Title: Block encoding with low gate count for second-quantized Hamiltonians
Authors: Diyi Liu, Shuchen Zhu, Guang Hao Low, Lin Lin, Chao Yang
Abstract: Efficient block encoding of many-body Hamiltonians is a central requirement for quantum algorithms in scientific computing, particularly in the early fault-tolerant era. In this work, we introduce new explicit constructions for block encoding second-quantized Hamiltonians that substantially reduce Clifford+T gate complexity and ancilla overhead. By utilizing a data lookup strategy based on the SWAP architecture for the sparsity oracle $O_C$, and a direct sampling method for the amplitude oracle $O_A$ with SELECT-SWAP architecture, we achieve a T count that scales as $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{L})$ with respect to the number of interaction terms $L$ in general second-quantized Hamiltonians. We also achieve an improved constant factor in the Clifford gate count of our oracle. Furthermore, we design a block encoding that directly targets the $\eta$-particle subspace, thereby reducing the subnormalization factor from $\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L})$, and improving fault-tolerant efficiency when simulating systems with fixed particle numbers. Building on the block encoding framework developed for general many-body Hamiltonians, we extend our approach to electronic Hamiltonians whose coefficient tensors exhibit translation invariance or possess decaying structures. Our results provide a practical path toward early fault-tolerant quantum simulation of many-body systems, substantially lowering resource overheads compared to previous methods.

Title: QuIRK: Quantum-Inspired Re-uploading KAN
Authors: Vinayak Sharma, Ashish Padhy, Vijay Jagdish Karanjkar, Sourav Behera, Lord Sen, Shyamapada Mukherjee, Aviral Shrivastava
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks or KANs have shown the ability to outperform classical Deep Neural Networks, while using far fewer trainable parameters for regression problems on scientific domains. Even more powerful has been their interpretability due to their structure being composed of univariate B-Spline functions. This enables us to derive closed-form equations from trained KANs for a wide range of problems. This paper introduces a quantum-inspired variant of the KAN based on Quantum Data Re-uploading~(DR) models. The Quantum-Inspired Re-uploading KAN or QuIRK model replaces B-Splines with single-qubit DR models as the univariate function approximator, allowing them to match or outperform traditional KANs while using even fewer parameters. This is especially apparent in the case of periodic functions. Additionally, since the model utilizes only single-qubit circuits, it remains classically tractable to simulate with straightforward GPU acceleration. Finally, we also demonstrate that QuIRK retains the interpretability advantages and the ability to produce closed-form solutions.

Title: A Formalization of the Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma in Lean
Authors: Alex Meiburg, Leonardo A. Lessa, Rodolfo R. Soldati
Abstract: The Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma is a theorem in quantum hypothesis testing that provides an operational meaning to the relative entropy within the context of quantum resource theories. Its original proof was found to have a gap, which led to a search for a corrected proof. We formalize the proof presented in [Hayashi and Yamasaki (2024)] in the Lean interactive theorem prover. This is the most technically demanding theorem in physics with a computer-verified proof to date, building with a variety of intermediate results from topology, analysis, and operator algebra. In the process, we rectified minor imprecisions in [HY24]'s proof that formalization forces us to confront, and refine a more precise definition of quantum resource theory. Formalizing this theorem has ensured that our Lean-QuantumInfo library, which otherwise has begun to encompass a variety of topics from quantum information, includes a robust foundation suitable for a larger collaborative program of formalizing quantum theory more broadly.

Title: Tensor-network representation of excitations in Josephson junction arrays
Authors: Emilio Rui, Joachim Cohen, Alexandru Petrescu
Abstract: We present a nonperturbative tensor-network approach to the excitation spectra of superconducting circuits based on Josephson junction arrays. These arrays provide the large lumped inductances required for qubit designs, yet their intrinsically many-body nature is typically reduced to effective single-mode descriptions. Perturbative treatments attempt to include the collective array modes neglected in these approximations, but a fully nonperturbative analysis is challenging due to the many-body structure and the collective character of these modes. We overcome this difficulty using the DMRG-X algorithm, which extends tensor-network methods to excited states. Our key advance is a construction of trial states from the linearized mode structure, enabling direct computation of excitations, even in degenerate manifolds, which was previously inaccessible. Our results reveal significant deviations from, and allow us to improve upon, previous perturbative treatments in the regime of low array junction impedance.

Title: The Exponential Deviation Induced by Quantum Readout Error Mitigation
Authors: Yibin Guo, Yi Fan, Pei Liu, Shoukuan Zhao, Yirong Jin, Xiaoxia Cai, Xiongzhi Zeng, Zhenyu Li, Wengang Zhang, Hai-Feng Yu
Abstract: The error mitigation techniques are indispensable for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices to obtain the experimental data with reasonable precision. The method based on taking the inverse of the measurement error matrix is widely used in quantum computing experiment to mitigate readout errors. In principle, the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error are fundamentally hard to distinguish. This implies that while readout calibration matrices mitigate readout errors, they simultaneously introduce extra initialization errors to the experimental data. In this work, we show that the conventional measurement error mitigation methods will introduce systematic errors that grow exponentially with the increase of qubit number. To illustrate their specific impact, we take large-scale entangled state preparation and measurement as examples, which are usually used for characterizing the performance of quantum processors. We demonstrated that the fidelity of large-scale entangled states will be significantly overestimated at presence of the state preparation error. Besides, we also showed that the outcome results of prevalent quantum algorithms such as variational quantum eigensolver and time evolution methods severe deviate from the ideal results as the system scale grows. These evidences indicate that state preparation error should be benchmarked and treated more carefully than it is recently. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the readout error mitigation technique at a given qubit scale, we have calculated an upper bound of the acceptable state preparation error rate.

Title: Single-shot conditional displacement gate between a trapped atom and traveling light
Authors: Seigo Kikura, Hayato Goto, Fumiya Hanamura, Takao Aoki
Abstract: We propose a single-shot conditional displacement gate between a trapped atom as the control qubit and a traveling light pulse as the target oscillator, mediated by an optical cavity. Classical driving of the atom synchronized with the light reflection off the cavity realizes the single-shot implementation of the crucial gate for the universal control of hybrid systems. We further derive a concise gate model incorporating cavity loss and atomic decay, facilitating the evaluation and optimization of the gate performance. This proposal establishes a key practical tool for coherently linking stationary atoms with itinerant light, a capability essential for realizing hybrid quantum information processing.

Title: Degeneracy Cutting: A Local and Efficient Post-Processing for Belief Propagation Decoding of Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes
Authors: Kento Tsubouchi, Hayata Yamasaki, Shiro Tamiya
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are promising for realizing scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their potential for low-overhead protocols. A common approach to decoding qLDPC codes is to use the belief propagation (BP) decoder, followed by a post-processing step to enhance decoding accuracy. For real-time decoding, the post-processing algorithm is desirable to have a small computational cost and rely only on local operations on the Tanner graph to facilitate parallel implementation. To address this requirement, we propose degeneracy cutting (DC), an efficient post-processing technique for the BP decoder that operates on information restricted to the support of each stabilizer generator. DC selectively removes one variable node with the lowest error probability for each stabilizer generator, significantly improving decoding performance while retaining the favorable computational scaling and structure amenable to parallelization inherent to BP. We further extend our method to realistic noise models, including phenomenological and circuit-level noise models, by introducing the detector degeneracy matrix, which generalizes the notion of stabilizer-induced degeneracy to these settings. Numerical simulations demonstrate that BP+DC achieves decoding performance approaching that of BP followed by ordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) in several settings, while requiring significantly less computational cost. Our results present BP+DC as a promising decoder for fault-tolerant quantum computing, offering a valuable balance of accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for parallel implementation.

Title: The charge-singlet measurement toolbox
Authors: Abhijit Chakraborty, Randy Lewis, Christine A. Muschik
Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to physical laws across different scales$\unicode{x2014}$from spacetime structure in general relativity to particle interactions in quantum field theory. Local symmetries, described by gauge theories, are central to phenomena such as superconductivity, topological phases, and the Standard Model of particle physics. Emerging simulation techniques using tensor network states or quantum computers offer exciting new possibilities of exploring the physics of these gauge theories, but require careful implementation of gauge symmetry and charge-neutrality constraints. This is especially challenging for non-Abelian gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which governs the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. In a recent article (arXiv:2501.00579), we introduced "charge-singlet measurements" for quantum simulations, consisting of a projection based technique from group representation theory that allowed us to probe for the first time the phase diagram of (1+1)-dimensional QCD on a quantum computer. In this article, we show more broadly how to apply charge-singlet measurements as a flexible tool for both classical and quantum simulations of discrete and continuous gauge theories. Our approach extends the use of charge-singlet measurements beyond state preparation in the charge neutral (charge-singlet) sector to include noise mitigation in symmetry-preserving time-evolution circuits. We further demonstrate how this method enables the computation of thermodynamic observables$\unicode{x2014}$such as entropy$\unicode{x2014}$within the charge-singlet subspace, providing a new tool for exploring the connection between quantum thermodynamics and gauge symmetry.

Title: Universal syndrome-based recovery for noise-adapted quantum error correction
Authors: Debjyoti Biswas, Prabha Mandayam
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential tool for quantum computing that enables reliable information processing in the presence of noise. Syndrome measurements play a central role in QEC, making it possible to unambiguously identify the location and type of errors. While syndrome extraction is natural for conventional QEC protocols, where the errors satisfy certain algebraic constraints \emph{perfectly}, this feature is largely missing in the framework of approximate or noise-adapted QEC. Rather, noise-adapted recovery maps like the Petz map are used in the latter scenario, but implementing such tailored recovery processes on the hardware can be quite challenging. Here, we address this issue by proposing an algorithmic approach to identifying error syndromes for arbitrary codes and noise processes. We then use our algorithm to develop a variant of the Petz recovery map -- a syndrome-based Petz recovery map -- which can then be implemented via syndrome measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in the context of amplitude-damping noise, by constructing the syndrome-based Petz map for the $4$-qubit code. We execute our recovery circuits on IBM quantum hardware to successfully demonstrate break-even performance of a noise-adapted QEC protocol with upto a threefold improvement of the qubit $T_{1}$ times.

Title: Statistical Benchmarking of Optimization Methods for Variational Quantum Eigensolver under Quantum Noise
Authors: Silvie Illésová, Tomáš Bezděk, Vojtěch Novák, Bruno Senjean, Martin Beseda
Abstract: This work investigates the performance of numerical optimization algorithms applied to the State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver for the H2 molecule under various quantum noise conditions. The goal is to assess the stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency of commonly used gradient-based, gradient-free, and global optimization strategies within the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum regime. We systematically compare six representative optimizers, BFGS, SLSQP, Nelder-Mead, Powell, COBYLA, and iSOMA,under ideal, stochastic, and decoherence noise models, including phase damping, depolarizing, and thermal relaxation channels. Each optimizer was tested over multiple noise intensities and measurement settings to characterize convergence behavior and sensitivity to noise-induced landscape distortions. The results show that BFGS consistently achieves the most accurate energies with minimal evaluations, maintaining robustness even under moderate decoherence. COBYLA performs well for low-cost approximations, while SLSQP exhibits instability in noisy regimes. Global approaches such as iSOMA show potential but are computationally expensive. These findings provide practical guidance for selecting suitable optimizers in variational quantum simulations, highlighting the importance of noise-aware optimization strategies for reliable and efficient quantum chemistry computations on current hardware.

Title: Spin-Locking Spectroscopy of Harmonic Motion
Authors: Florian Kranzl, Adria Rospars, Johannes Franke, Manoj K. Joshi, Rainer Blatt, Christian F. Roos
Abstract: Characterization of noise of a quantum harmonic oscillator is important for many experimental platforms. We experimentally demonstrate motional spin-locking spectroscopy, a method that allows us to directly measure the motional noise spectrum of a quantum harmonic oscillator. We measure motional noise of a single trapped ion in a frequency range from 200 Hz to 5 kHz with a power spectral density that resolves noise over two orders of magnitude. Coherent modulations in the oscillation frequency of the oscillator can be probed with a relative frequency sensitivity at the $10^{-6}$ level.

Title: A Pseudo-Hermitian Hybrid Model at Finite Temperature: The Role of the Exceptional Points
Authors: Ignacio Fushimi, Marta Reboiro (IFLP-UNLP, Argentina)
Abstract: We study a hybrid system formed by an ensemble of colour nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond interacting with a superconducting flux-qubit at finite temperature. The presence of impurities in the system is modelled through pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonian, by introducing an asymmetry parameter in the interaction between the superconducting flux qubit and the ensemble of colour nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. We construct the exact grand partition function of the system, and from it we derive the thermodynamic quantities, e.g. entropy, internal energy, and Helmholtz free energy. In the broken symmetry phase, we observe the existence of zeros in the partition function. This zeros are related to the existence of complex-pair-conjugate eigenvalues with real part lying among the low levels of energy. In line with the Yang Lee framework, these zeros in the complex plane signal phase transitions, and the proposed hybrid model exhibits transitions of first-order. To account for metastable regions in parameter space, we perform a Maxwell construction and a spinodal-decomposition analysis. We determine the critical temperature at which the first zero of the partition-function appears, as a function of the asymmetry parameter and the coupling constant of the interaction between the ensemble of colour nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond and the superconducting flux-qubit. We also design a Carnot cycle that traverses Exceptional Points in the broken symmetry phase for temperatures above the critical value, achieving the same efficiency as the classical Carnot cycle. Furthermore, we implement a Stirling cycle whose efficiency surpasses its classical counterpart, particularly when operating near Exceptional Points. Finally, we outline how the model can be scaled to larger Hilbert-space dimensions beyond the minimal setting used to capture the essential physics.

Title: Real-Time Instantons in Complex-Driven Qubits
Authors: Samuel Alperin
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of the quantum Rabi model driven parametrically by a periodic modulation of a complex coupling. We show both analytically and numerically that instead of Rabi oscillations, this nonunitary coherent driving leads to a unidirectional instanton solution which mediates the rapid and deterministic one-way tunneling of any initial coherent state to the ground state, making the ground state a strong attractor in the quantum dynamics of the qubit. The timescale of this tunneling is shown to be inversely proportional to the effective resonant coupling, allowing for exceptionally fast, deterministic, and high-fidelity qubit reset through a purely coherent, PT-symmetric drive--without coupling to external dissipative baths, lossy resonators, or employing measurement-based feedback. Finally, we show how the drive can be engineered to place the strong attractor at any arbitrary point on the Bloch sphere.

Title: LIV-Decoherence on Gravitational Cat States
Authors: Iarley P. Lobo, Kelvin Sampaio, Gislaine Varão, Moises Rojas, Valdir B. Bezerra
Abstract: Inspired by approaches based on the stochastic generalized uncertainty principle, we propose a Lindblad equation derived from the quantization of a stochastic modified dispersion relation in a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) scenario. This framework enables us to investigate decoherence effects in a system of particles exhibiting gravitationally induced entanglement. We analyze the impact of LIV on entanglement (quantified by concurrence) considering systematic and stochastic effects.

Title: Optimizing VQE Ansatz for Studying Tight-Binding Models with \textit{sd}-Interaction and On-Site Coulomb Repulsion
Authors: Oleg Udalov
Abstract: The VQE algorithm is applied to the problem of finding the ground state of a lattice model with on-site Coulomb repulsion, nearest-neighbor hopping, and on-site sd-interaction. We compare the performance of several ansatze, including cluster and generic forms. Several modifications of the standard cluster ansatz implementation are proposed, which significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates. Different classical optimizers are employed within the VQE algorithm. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated using both noiseless and noisy simulations.

Title: Gate Teleportation vs Circuit Cutting in Distributed Quantum Computing
Authors: Shobhit Gupta, Nikolay Sheshko, Daniel J. Dilley, Alvin Gonzales, Manish K. Singh, Zain H. Saleem
Abstract: Distributing circuits across quantum processor modules will enable the execution of circuits larger than the qubit count limitations of monolithic processors. While distributed quantum computation has primarily utilized circuit cutting, it incurs an exponential growth of sub-circuit sampling and classical post-processing overhead with an increasing number of cuts. The entanglement-based gate teleportation approach does not inherently incur exponential sampling overhead, provided that quantum interconnects of requisite performance are available for generating high-fidelity Bell pairs. Recent advances in photonic entanglement of qubits have motivated discussion on optical link metrics required to achieve remote gate performance approaching circuit-cutting techniques. We model noisy remote (teleported) gates between superconducting qubits entangled via noisy microwave-to-optical (M2O) transducers over optical links. We incorporate the effect of the transducer noise added ($N_{add}$) on the Bell pair fidelity and inject noisy Bell pairs into remote CNOT gates. We perform a comparative simulation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states generated between processor modules using remote gates and gate cuts by studying the dependence of the Hellinger fidelity on the primary source of error for the two approaches. We identify break-even points where noisy remote gates achieve parity with gate-cuts. Our work suggests that a 10-fold reduction in the present M2O transducer noise added figures would favor generating multipartite entangled states with remote gates over circuit cutting due to an exponential sampling overhead for the latter. Our work informs near-term quantum interconnect hardware metrics and motivates a network-aware hybrid quantum-classical distributed computation approach, where both quantum links and circuit cuts are employed to minimize quantum runtime.

Title: Beyond the Carnot limit: work extraction via an entropy battery
Authors: Liam Judd McClelland
Abstract: We explore the consequences of generalized thermodynamics, as interpreted from the perspective of information theory, on an ensemble's capacity to extract energetic work. We demonstrate that by utilizing unitary heat engines of different kinds, we can capitalize on the full entropy capacity of the ensemble across multiple conserved quantities. This leads to the extraction of energetic work with efficiencies surpassing the standard Carnot efficiency limit, all the while running at maximum power. This is achieved without requiring modified thermal sources, which is a method commonly used in the field of quantum heat engines. We pay particular attention to spin angular momentum, and show that when treated as a mutually independent conserved quantity, spin baths exhibit thermodynamic behaviour analogous to conventional heat baths, with corresponding quantities and models. This includes spin-analogous heat capacities, Einstein solid and Debye models, entropic responses, and Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Spin baths also follow the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Further, we examine the role of particle statistics in determining the maximum entropy capacity of the battery. In doing so, we argue that indistinguishability is necessary for interactions to occur, motivating a perspective in which information itself is treated as the indistinguishable property of particles, with information (in the form of coherence) transferable between both physical degrees of freedom such as energy and spin, and particles when the system acts unitarily. This work will find application in fields that require near energy degenerate spin statistics, such as in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates and spintronics. Further, our method will have implications for the fields of quantum heat engines, quantum batteries, quantum error correction, and in information and resource theories.

Title: A Davydov Ansatz approach to accurate system-bath dynamics in the presence of multiple baths with distinct temperatures
Authors: Chenlin Ma, Fulu Zheng, Kewei Sun, Lu Wang, Yang Zhao
Abstract: We perform benchmark simulations using the time-dependent variational approach with the multiple Davydov Ansatz (mDA) to study realtime nonequilibrium dynamics in a single qubit model coupled to two thermal baths with distinct temperatures. A broad region of the parameter space has been investigated, accompanied by a detailed analysis of the convergence behavior of the mDA method. In addition, we have compared our mD2 results to those from two widely adopted, numerically "exact" techniques: the methods of hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) and the quasi-adiabatic path integral (QUAPI). It is found that the mDA approach in combination with thermal field dynamics yields numerically accurate, convergent results in nearly all regions of the parameter space examined, including those that pose serious challenges for QUAPI and HEOM. Our results reveal that mDA offers a highly adaptable framework capable of capturing long-time dynamics, even in challenging regimes where other methods face limitations. These findings underscore the potential of mDA as a versatile tool for exploring quantum thermodynamics, energy transfer processes, and non-equilibrium quantum systems.

Title: Exploiting higher-order correlation functions for photon-statistics-based characterization and reconstruction of arbitrary Gaussian states
Authors: Philip Heinzel, René Sondenheimer
Abstract: Gaussian states are an essential building block for various applications in quantum optics and quantum information science, yet the precise relation between their second- and third-order correlation functions remains not fully explored. We discuss connections between these correlation functions by constructing an explicit decomposition formula for arbitrary sixth-order moments of ladder operators for general Gaussian states and demonstrate how the derived relations enable state classification from correlation data alone. Whereas violating these relations certifies non-Gaussianity, satisfying them provides evidence for a Gaussian-state description and allows a direct distinction among non-displaced, non-squeezed, and displaced-squeezed sectors of the Gaussian state space. Further, we show that it is not possible to uniquely extract state parameters solely from correlation-function measurements without prior assumptions about the Gaussian state. Resolving this ambiguity requires additional loss-sensitive information, e.g., measuring the mean intensity or the vacuum overlap of each mode. In particular, we show under which circumstances these measurements can be used to reconstruct a generic Gaussian state.

Title: Quantum Reference Frames in Arbitrary Charge Sectors: Accessibility of Global Properties from Internal Perspectives
Authors: Anne-Catherine de la Hamette, Viktoria Kabel, Časlav Brukner
Abstract: A fundamental question in the field of quantum reference frames concerns what global properties of a system can be determined by observers operating entirely from within that system. We investigate this question by extending both the perspectival and perspective-neutral approaches beyond the commonly studied zero total momentum case to arbitrary fixed charge sectors. When the entire system, including the reference frames, moves at a fixed total momentum $P$ relative to an external frame, this global charge becomes encoded in the quantum states and transformations between reference frames. Our extension leads to modified relative states and observables with QRF transformations that induce an additional $P$-dependent phase, treating all charge sectors as equally fundamental. By granting the internal observers successively more access and resources, we identify under which conditions they can infer the total momentum. These results clarify the relationship between major QRF approaches -- perspectival, perspective-neutral, operational, and extra-particle -- showing how their differing conclusions stem from different assumptions about which observables are deemed accessible from within. Our findings cast light on the relation between local and global perspectives and raise fundamental questions about scenarios where no global perspective exists, contributing to a deeper understanding of relationality and the role of perspectives in quantum theory.

Title: A one-world interpretation of quantum mechanics
Authors: Isaac Layton, Jonathan Oppenheim, Zachary Weller-Davies
Abstract: The measurement problem is the issue of explaining how the objective classical world emerges from a quantum one. Here we take a different approach. We assume that there is an objective classical system, and then ask that the standard rules of probability theory apply to it when it interacts with a quantum system. Under mild assumptions, we recover the unitary dynamics, collapse and Born rule postulates from quantum theory. Nonetheless, there is no decoherence, because the quantum state remains pure conditioned on the classical trajectory. This results in one world, rather than many-worlds. Our main technical tool is to exploit a change of measure on the space of classical paths, the functional form of which is shown to characterise the quantum dynamics and Born rules of a class of quantum-like theories.

Title: High-Fidelity Single-Shot Readout and Selective Nuclear Spin Control for a Spin-1/2 Quantum Register in Diamond
Authors: Prithvi Gundlapalli, Philipp J. Vetter, Genko Genov, Michael Olney-Fraser, Peng Wang, Matthias M. Müller, Katharina Senkalla, Fedor Jelezko
Abstract: Quantum networks offer a way to overcome the size and complexity limitations of single quantum devices by linking multiple nodes into a scalable architecture. Group-IV color centers in diamond, paired with long-lived nuclear spins, have emerged as promising building blocks demonstrating proof-of-concept experiments such as blind quantum computing and quantum-enhanced sensing. However, realizing a large-scale electro-nuclear register remains a major challenge. Here we establish the germanium-vacancy (GeV) center as a viable platform for such network nodes. Using correlation spectroscopy, we identify single nuclear spins within a convoluted spin environment, overcoming limitations imposed by the color center's spin-$1/2$ nature and thereby enabling indirect control of these nuclear spins. We further demonstrate high-fidelity single-shot readout of both the GeV center ($95.8\,\%$) and a neighboring ${}^{13}\text{C}$ nuclear spin ($93.7\,\%$), a key tool for feed-forward error correction. These critical advances position the GeV center as a compelling candidate for next-generation quantum network nodes.

Title: The foundational value of quantum computing for classical fluids
Authors: Sauro Succi, Claudio Sanavio, Peter Love
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for classical physics problems expose new patterns of quantum information flow as compared to the many-body Schrödinger equation. As a result, besides their potential practical applications, they also offer a valuable theoretical and computational framework to elucidate the foundations of quantum mechanics, particularly the validity of the many-body Schrödinger equation in the limit of large number of particles, on the order of the Avogadro number. This idea is illustrated by means of a concrete example, the Block-Encoded Carleman embedding of the Lattice Boltzmann formulation of fluid dynamics (CLB).

Title: Breakdown of Non-Bloch Bulk-Boundary Correspondence and Emergent Topology in Floquet Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Hong Wu, Xue-Min Yang, Hui Liu
Abstract: Topological edge states in gaps of non-Hermitian systems are robust due to topological protection. Using the non-Hermitian Floquet Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we show that this robustness can break down: edge states may be suppressed by infinitesimal perturbations that preserve sublattice symmetry. We identify this fragility to the instability of the quasienergy spectrum in finite-size systems, leading to a breakdown of the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence defined on the generalized Brillouin zone. To resolve this, we establish a correspondence between the number of stable zero-mode singular states and the topologically protected edge states in the thermodynamic limit. Our results formulate a bulk-boundary correspondence for Floquet non-Hermitian systems, where topology arises intrinsically from the driven non-Hermitian systems, even without symmetries. Our results provide a promising new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian topological phases.

Title: Nonlinear Heisenberg Limit via Uncertainty Principle in Quantum Metrology
Authors: Binke Xia, Jingzheng Huang, Yuxiang Yang, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: The Heisenberg limit is acknowledged as the ultimate precision limit in quantum metrology, traditionally implying that root mean square errors of parameter estimation decrease linearly with the time T of evolution and the number N of quantum gates or probes. However, this conventional perspective fails to interpret recent studies of "super-Heisenberg" scaling, where precision improves faster than linearly with T and N. In this work, we revisit the Heisenberg scaling by leveraging the position-momentum uncertainty relation in parameter space and characterizing precision in terms of the corresponding canonical momentum. This reformulation not only accounts for time and energy resources, but also incorporates underlying resources arising from noncommutativity and quantum superposition. By introducing a generating process with indefinite time direction, which involves noncommutative quantum operations and superposition of time directions, we obtain a quadratic increment in the canonical momentum, thereby achieving a nonlinear-scaling precision limit with respect to T and N. Then we experimentally demonstrate in quantum optical systems that this nonlinear-scaling enhancement can be achieved with a fixed probe energy. Our results provide a deeper insight into the Heisenberg limit in quantum metrology, and shed new light on enhancing precision in practical quantum metrological and sensing tasks.

Title: Partial Self-Correction in Layer Codes
Authors: Dominic J. Williamson
Abstract: The storage of large-scale quantum information at finite temperature requires an autonomous and reliable quantum hard drive, also known as a self-correcting quantum memory. It is a long-standing open problem to find a self-correcting quantum memory in three dimensions. The recently introduced Layer Codes achieve the best possible scaling of code parameters and logical energy barrier in three dimensions, these are tantalizing features for the purposes of self-correction. In this work we show that a family of Layer Codes, based on good Quantum Tanner Codes, exhibit partial self-correction. Their memory time grows exponentially with linear system size, up to a length scale that is exponential in the inverse temperature. At this length scale, the memory time scales as a double exponential of inverse temperature. To establish this result we introduce a concatenated matching decoder that combines three rounds of parallelized minimum-weight perfect-matching with a decoder for good Quantum Tanner Codes. We show that our decoder corrects errors up to a constant fraction of the energy barrier, and a constant fraction of the code distance, for a family of Layer Codes. Our results position Layer Codes as the leading candidate for a partially self-correcting memory in three dimensions. While they fall short of achieving strict self-correction in the thermodynamic limit, our work highlights the potential of these local codes in three dimensions, with fast distance and logical qubit growth, fast decoders, and a long memory time over a wide range of parameters.

Title: QBism and relational interpretation of quantum mechanics from the point of view of a contextual quantum realism (CQR)
Authors: Francois-Igor Pris
Abstract: A realist interpretation of quantum mechanics is proposed - Contextual Quantum Realism (CQR) - according to which there exists a categorical distinction between the ideal (theory, observation instrument) and the real (quantum physical systems, properties), and, consequently, quantum ontology is context-sensitive. CQR is compared with QBism and Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM), both of which also claim to offer realist interpretations. However, both approaches conflate the ideal and the real, thereby introducing an anti-realist dimension. RQM is an objectivist (physicalist) interpretation that naturalizes epistemic concepts, whereas QBism is subjectivist (phenomenological). RQM and QBism share a common presupposition of (post-)Modern philosophy - namely, the reduction of reality to objectivity - which CQR explicitly rejects.

Title: Entangled Photon Pair Generator via Biexciton-Exciton Cascade in Semiconductor Quantum Dots and its Simulation
Authors: Simon Sekavčnik, Paul Kohl, Janis Nötzel
Abstract: The generation of entangled photon pairs is highly useful for many types of quantum technologies. In this work an entangled photon pair generator that utilises the biexciton-exciton cascade in semiconductor quantum dots is described on a physical, mathematical, and software level. The system is implemented and simulated as a self-contained component in a framework for bigger quantum optical experiments. Thus, it is a description to further the holistic understanding of the system for interdisciplinary audiences in a hopefully simple yet sufficient manner. It is described from the condensed matter physics fundamentals, over the most important quantum optical properties, to a mathematical description of the used model, and finally a software description and simulation, making it an executable description of such a system.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a power limiter based on single-walled carbon nanotubes dispersed in a polymer matrix. This simple fiber-optic device permanently increases its attenuation when subjected to 50-mW or higher cw illumination at 1550 nm and initiates a fiber-fuse effect at 1 to 5 W. It may be used for protecting quantum key distribution equipment from light-injection attacks. We demonstrate its compatibility with phase- and polarisation-encoding quantum key distribution systems.

Title: A Framework for Distributed Resource Allocation in Quantum Networks
Authors: Nitish K. Panigrahy, Leonardo Bacciottini, C. V. Hollot, Emily A. Van Milligen, Matheus Guedes de Andrade, Nageswara S. V. Rao, Gayane Vardoyan, Don Towsley
Abstract: We introduce a distributed resource allocation framework for the Quantum Internet that relies on feedback-based, fully decentralized coordination to serve multiple co-existing applications. We develop quantum network control algorithms under the mathematical framework of Quantum Network Utility Maximization (QNUM), where utility functions quantify network performance by mapping entanglement rate and quality into a joint optimization objective. We then introduce QPrimal-Dual, a decentralized, scalable algorithm that solves QNUM by strategically placing network controllers that operate using local state information and limited classical message exchange. We prove global asymptotic stability for concave, separable utility functions, and provide sufficient conditions for local stability for broader non-concave cases. To reduce control overhead and account for quantum memory decoherence, we also propose schemes that locally approximate global quantities and prevent congestion in the network. We evaluate the performance of our approach via simulations in realistic quantum network architectures. Results show that QPrimalDual significantly outperforms baseline allocation strategies, scales with network size, and is robust to latency and decoherence. Our observations suggest that QPrimalDual could be a practical, high-performance foundation for fully distributed resource allocation in quantum networks.

Title: Structure of quantum measurements implementable with one round of classical communication
Authors: Arthur C. R. Dutra, Ties-A. Ohst, Hai-Chau Nguyen, Otfried Gühne
Abstract: Measurements that can be implemented via local operations and classical communication (LOCC) constitute a class of operations that is available in future quantum networks in which parties share entangled resource states. We characterise the different classes of measurements implementable with LOCC, where communication is restricted to a single round with a fixed direction. In particular, using the framework of constrained separability problems, we provide a complete characterisation of the class of LOCC measurements that require one round of classical communication with a limit on the transmitted information. Furthermore, we show how to distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive measurements strategies. Using our techniques we present examples where the success probability of state discrimination depends on the direction of communication as well as on the message size. We also discuss explicit instances of state ensembles where non-projective measurements provide an advantage and where adaptive measurement strategies lead to improved success rates when compared to all non-adaptive strategies.

Title: Two-Photon Induced Coherence without Induced Emission
Authors: Dong-Gil Im, Seung-Yeun Yoo, Chung-Hyun Lee, Jongheon Suh, Yoon-Ho Kim
Abstract: At the heart of recent advances in quantum imaging and spectroscopy with undetected photons is the quantum optical effect known as induced coherence without induced emission. This quantum interference effect has enabled access to challenging wavelength regimes for imaging and spectroscopic applications. However, the potential of undetected photon quantum metrology, particularly the enhanced phase sensitivity offered by Fock or N00N states, has not yet been realized, as prior work focused only on single-photon phenomena. Here, we report the observation of two-photon induced coherence without induced emission. Using a two-photon Fock state, we establish quantum coherence between pairs of two-photon spontaneous emission amplitudes, resulting in a doubling of interferometric phase modulation. Specifically, we show that a phase shift $\phi$ applied to undetected 1016 nm photons leads to a $2\phi$ modulation in the detection of 632 nm photons. This demonstrates genuine two-photon induced coherence without induced emission and opens possibilities for quantum-enhanced phase measurements using multi-photon coherence without detecting the modulated photons.

Title: Control of photoionization by resonant phase-locked pulse pairs
Authors: Edvin Olofsson, Evan Lovelle Fulton, Rezvan Tahouri, Mattias Bertolino, Jean Marcel Ngoko Djiokap, Jan Marcus Dahlström
Abstract: We study the nonlinear and resonant process of two-photon ionization of atoms (He and H) in a pump-probe scheme. The pump pulse prepares the quantum system in a superposition of the ground state and an excited bound state. By varying the phase difference between the pulses, we show how it is possible to coherently control the dressed-state population during the probe pulse. Our main result is that for certain laser parameters, the control over the dressed state population leads to strong control of the ionization probability during the probe pulse. The effect arises due to one of the dressed states becoming stabilized against ionization. Contrasting effects from circular and linear polarized pulses demonstrate how such ``bound states in the continuum'' are sensitive to the degeneracy of the coupled continuum.

Title: A Decoy-like Protocol for Quantum Key Distribution: Enhancing the Performance with Imperfect Single Photon Sources
Authors: Chanaprom Cholsuk, Furkan Ağlarcı, Daniel K. L. Oi, Serkan Ateş, Tobias Vogl
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on single photon sources (SPSs), e.g. from solid-state systems, as flying qubits, where security strongly requires sub-Poissonian photon statistics with low second-order correlation values (\$g^{(2)}(0)\$). However, achieving such low \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ remains experimentally challenging. We therefore propose a decoy-like QKD protocol that relaxes this constraint while maintaining security. This enables the use of many SPSs with \$g^{(2)}(0) > \$0.1, routinely achieved in experiments but rarely considered viable for QKD. Monte Carlo simulations and our experiment from defects in hexagonal boron nitride show that, under linear loss, \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ remains constant, whereas photon-number-splitting (PNS) attacks introduce nonlinear effects that modify the measured \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ statistics. Exploiting this \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ variation as a diagnostic tool, our protocol detects PNS attacks analogously to decoy-state methods. Both single- and two-photon pulses consequently securely contribute to the secret key rate. Our protocol outperforms the Gottesman--Lo--Lutkenhaus--Preskill (GLLP) framework under high channel loss across various solid-state SPSs and is applicable to the satellite-based communication. Since \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ can be extracted from standard QKD experiments, no additional hardware is required. The relaxed \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ requirement simplifies the laser system for SPS generation. This establishes a practical route toward high-performance QKD without the need for ultra-pure SPSs.

Title: Quantum Channel Masking
Authors: Anna Honeycutt, Hailey Murray, Eric Chitambar
Abstract: Quantum masking is a special type of secret sharing in which some information gets reversibly distributed into a multipartite system, leaving the original information inaccessible to each subsystem. This paper proposes a dynamical extension of quantum masking to the level of quantum channels. In channel masking, the identity of a channel becomes locally hidden but still globally accessible after its output is sent through a bipartite broadcasting channel. We first characterize all families of d-dimensional unitaries that can be isometrically masked, a condition that holds even in the presence of depolarizing noise. For the case of qubits, we identify which families of Pauli channels can be masked, and we prove that a qubit channel can be masked with the identity if and only if it is unital and has a pure-state fixed point. Masking with the identity describes a scenario in which channel noise becomes completely delocalized through a broadcast map and undetectable through subsystem dynamics alone.

Title: Nonlocal Games Through Communication Complexity and Quantum Cryptography
Authors: Pierre Botteron
Abstract: This thesis explores foundational aspects of quantum information theory and quantum cryptography. First, we investigate quantum correlations in interactive settings, including the CHSH and graph isomorphism games. We aim to distinguish quantum correlations from non-signaling correlations by leveraging the principle of communication complexity. To this end, we employ techniques such as distributed computation, majority-function-based distillation protocols, the algebraic and geometric properties of nonlocal box wirings, and variations of some graph properties such as isomorphism, transitivity, and equitable partitions. This inquiry advances our understanding of non-physical correlations. Second, we address a key open problem in cryptography: the feasibility of unclonable encryption. We aim to construct an encryption scheme that prevents two distant parties from simultaneously obtaining information about a shared encrypted message. We introduce a candidate for unclonable encryption in the plain model, i.e. without assumptions, in working towards an unconditional proof. Our protocol is based on Clifford algebra, utilizing complex Hermitian unitary matrices that anti-commute. For small key sizes, we rigorously prove security using sum-of-squares methods, while for larger key sizes, we provide strong numerical evidence via the NPA hierarchy.

Title: Fast CZ Gate via Energy-Level Engineering in Superconducting Qubits with a Tunable Coupler
Authors: Benzheng Yuan, Chaojie Zhang, Chuanbing Han, Shuya Wang, Peng Xu, Huihui Sun, Qing Mu, Lixin Wang, Bo Zhao, Weilong Wang, Zheng Shan
Abstract: In superconducting quantum circuits, decoherence errors in qubits constitute a critical factor limiting quantum gate performance. To mitigate decoherence-induced gate infidelity, rapid implementation of quantum gates is essential. Here we propose a scheme for rapid controlled-Z (CZ) gate implementation through energy-level engineering, which leverages Rabi oscillations between the |11> state and the superposition state in a tunable-coupler architecture. Numerical simulations achieved a 17 ns nonadiabatic CZ gate with fidelity over 99.99%. We further investigated the performance of the CZ gate in the presence of anharmonicity offsets. The results demonstrate that a high-fidelity CZ gate with an error rate below 10^-4 remains achievable even with finite anharmonicity variations. Furthermore, the detrimental impact of spectator qubits in different quantum states on the fidelity of CZ gate is effectively suppressed by incorporating a tunable coupler. This scheme exhibits potential for extending the circuit execution depth constrained by coherence time limitations.

Title: Subspace Leakage Error Randomized Benchmarking of Mølmer-Sørensen Gates
Authors: R. T. Sutherland, A. C. Hughes, J. P. Marceaux, H. M. Knaack, C. M. Löschnauer, R. Srinivas
Abstract: We demonstrate a new technique that adapts single-qubit randomized benchmarking to two-qubit Mølmer-Sørensen gates. We use the controllable gate phase to generate Cliffords that act on a two-state subspace, enabling benchmarking of two-qubit gates without single-qubit operations. In addition to quantifying the gate infidelity, the protocol provides valuable information about the type of error by distinguishing between those that conserve the two-state subspace and those that result in leakage out of it. We demonstrate the protocol for calibrating and validating all-electronic maximally entangling gates in a trapped-ion quantum computer, achieving a two-qubit gate error of $2.6 (2)\times10^{-4}$.

Title: Big cats: entanglement in 120 qubits and beyond
Authors: Ali Javadi-Abhari, Simon Martiel, Alireza Seif, Maika Takita, Ken X. Wei
Abstract: Entanglement is the quintessential quantum phenomenon and a key enabler of quantum algorithms. The ability to faithfully entangle many distinct particles is often used as a benchmark for the quality of hardware and control in a quantum computer. Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, also known as Schrödinger cat states, are useful for this task. They are easy to verify, but difficult to prepare due to their high sensitivity to noise. In this Letter we report on the largest GHZ state prepared to date consisting of 120 superconducting qubits. We do this via a combination of optimized compilation, low-overhead error detection and temporary uncomputation. We use an automated compiler to maximize error-detection in state preparation circuits subject to arbitrary qubit connectivity constraints and variations in error rates. We measure a GHZ fidelity of 0.56(3) with a post-selection rate of 28%. We certify the fidelity of our GHZ states using multiple methods and show that they are all equivalent, albeit with different practical considerations.

Title: Incoherent Imaging with Spatially Structured Quantum Probes
Authors: Anthony J. Brady, Zihao Gong, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Saikat Guha
Abstract: Incoherent imaging, including fluorescence and absorption microscopy, is often limited by weak signals and resolution constraints -- notoriously, Rayleigh's curse. We investigate how spatially structured quantum probes, combined with quantum detection strategies like spatial mode demultiplexing and photon counting, overcome these limitations. We propose a novel imaging protocol based on twin-beam echoes that maps the generalized incoherent-imaging model -- comprising both absorption and fluorescence -- onto distinct passive imaging channels that separately encode the absorption and fluorescence signatures. This enables (i) simultaneous absorption and fluorescence imaging and (ii) direct application of well-known results from passive imaging, all featuring quantum-enhanced measurement sensitivity. Remarkably, the same protocol supports displacement-field reconstruction of multiple quadratures (e.g., oscillators' positions) and works for both conventional and subdiffraction imaging, thereby functioning as a universal quantum imaging module. We also examine the utility of Fock states in a structured spatial mode basis, which offer comparable performance in principle. Though developed for optical imaging, our framework applies broadly to quantum-optical microscopy, phononic or acoustic imaging, and mapping stochastic forces, fields, or charge distributions using an array of mechanical oscillators.

Title: Certifying Quantum Gates via Automata Advantage
Authors: Anna Schroeder, Lucas B. Vieira, Jan Nöller, Nikolai Miklin, Mariami Gachechiladze
Abstract: There is growing interest in developing rigorous tests of quantumness that are feasible even before practical quantum advantages become a reality. Such tests not only aim to certify the quantum nature of a system but also serve as benchmarks for precise quantum control. In this work, we argue that promise problems, studied in the theory of finite automata, provide a natural framework for designing sound tests of quantum gate quality. Soundness, the property that only implementations of sufficiently high quality can pass the test, is a central requirement for meaningful certification. We study several promise problems relevant to quantum gate testing and establish separations between the memory resources required by quantum and classical finite automata to solve them. These separations form the theoretical basis for using promise problems as tests of quantumness. Finally, we show how results from automata theory, in particular the minimality of automata, can be used to derive soundness guarantees.

Title: Three Birds with One Stone: Improving Performance, Convergence, and System Throughput with Nest
Authors: Yuqian Huo, David Quiroga, Anastasios Kyrillidis, Tirthak Patel
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to demonstrate quantum utility on near-term quantum computers. However, these algorithms often get executed on the highest-fidelity qubits and computers to achieve the best performance, causing low system throughput. Recent efforts have shown that VQAs can be run on low-fidelity qubits initially and high-fidelity qubits later on to still achieve good performance. We take this effort forward and show that carefully varying the qubit fidelity map of the VQA over its execution using our technique, Nest, does not just (1) improve performance (i.e., help achieve close to optimal results), but also (2) lead to faster convergence. We also use Nest to co-locate multiple VQAs concurrently on the same computer, thus (3) increasing the system throughput, and therefore, balancing and optimizing three conflicting metrics simultaneously.

Title: Simplified Quantum Weight Reduction with Optimal Bounds
Authors: Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Xingjian Li, Ting-Chun Lin
Abstract: Quantum weight reduction is the task of transforming a quantum code with large check weight into one with small check weight. Low-weight codes are essential for implementing quantum error correction on physical hardware, since high-weight measurements cannot be executed reliably. Weight reduction also serves as a critical theoretical tool, which may be relevant to the quantum PCP conjecture. We introduce a new procedure for quantum weight reduction that combines geometric insights with coning techniques, which simplifies Hastings' previous approach while achieving better parameters. Given an arbitrary $[[n,k,d]]$ quantum code with weight $w$, our method produces a code with parameters $[[O(n w^2 \log w), k, \Omega(d w)]]$ with check weight $5$ and qubit weight $6$. When applied to random dense CSS codes, our procedure yields explicit quantum codes that surpass the square-root distance barrier, achieving parameters $[[n, \tilde O(n^{1/3}), \tilde \Omega(n^{2/3})]]$. Furthermore, these codes admit a three-dimensional embedding that saturates the Bravyi-Poulin-Terhal (BPT) bound. As a further application, our weight reduction technique improves fault-tolerant logical operator measurements by reducing the number of ancilla qubits.

Abstract: We report dielectric and magnetoelectric studies of single-crystalline \ce{CeMgAl11O19}, a Kramers triangular magnet embedded in a polarizable hexaaluminate lattice. In zero magnetic field, the permittivity $\varepsilon'(T)$ follows the Barrett law of a quantum paraelectric down to 25 K, below which a broad minimum develops near 3 K without evidence of static ferroelectric or magnetic order. Application of magnetic fields up to \SI{9}{\tesla} shifts this minimum to higher temperatures and broadens it, evidencing a tunable magnetoelectric this http URL magnetoelectric coupling was characterized using results from magnetization measurements. The anomaly temperature $T^*$, extracted from the local minimum of $\varepsilon'(T)$, exhibits a linear dependence on the squared magnetization $M^2$, consistent with the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling allowed in centrosymmetric systems. This magnetoelectric effect, mediated by spin-orbit-entangled Kramers doublets interacting with a frustrated antipolar liquid, establishes \ce{CeMgAl11O19} as a prototype for exploring quantum magnetoelectricity in frustrated systems.

Title: Hubbard-like Interactions and Emergent Dynamical Regimes Between Modulational Instability and Self-Trapping
Authors: L. J. R. Bezerra Jr., W. S. Dias
Abstract: We investigate the modulational instability of uniform wave packets governed by a discrete third-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation in finite square lattices, modeling light propagation in two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. We analyze how initially stable uniform distributions evolve into self-trapped (localized) regimes and the influence of a refractive index detuning selectively applied along the diagonal waveguides on this transition. This detuning effectively emulates the effect of on-site Hubbard-like interactions $U$ in photonic analogs of interacting particles in a one-dimensional lattice. While for $U = 0$ the system exhibits the known direct transition from stable uniform states to asymptotically localized profiles, we show that $U > 0$ induces an emergence of intermediate dynamical regimes. These regimes include coherent breathing modes that can be either confined along diagonal or off-diagonal waveguides, as well as chaotic-like propagation patterns. At higher nonlinearities, we identify distinct self-trapped regimes characterized by diagonal or off-diagonal localized modes, depending on the strength of $U$. The critical nonlinear strengths separating the existing regimes are shown in the phase diagram, underscoring the competing trends imposed by the Hubbard-like interaction on the optical field.

Title: Atomistic origin of low thermal conductivity in quaternary chalcogenides Cu(Cd, Zn)$_2$InTe$_4$
Authors: Nirmalya Jana, Amit Agarwal, Koushik Pal
Abstract: Crystalline semiconductors with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity ($\mathcal{K}$) are vital for device applications such as barrier coatings and thermoelectrics. Quaternary chalcogenide semiconductors such as CuCd$_2$InTe$_4$ and CuZn$_2$InTe$_4$ are experimentally shown to exhibit low $\mathcal{K}$, yet its microscopic origin remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse their thermal transport mechanisms using a unified first-principles framework that captures both the Peierls (particle-like propagation, $\mathcal{K}_P$) and coherence (wave-like tunneling, $\mathcal{K}_C$) mechanisms of phonon transport. We show that extended antibonding states below the Fermi level lead to enhanced phonon anharmonicity and strong scattering of heat-carrying phonon modes, suppressing $\mathcal{K}$ in these chalcogenides. We show that $\mathcal{K}_P$ dominates the total thermal conductivity, while $\mathcal{K}_C$ remains negligible even under strong anharmonicity of the phonon modes. The heavier Cd ions in CuCd$_2$InTe$_4$ induce greater acoustic-optical phonon overlap and scattering compared to CuZn$_2$InTe$_4$, further lowering thermal conductivity of the former. Additionally, grain boundary scattering in realistic samples contributes to further suppression of thermal transport. Our findings establish the atomistic origins of low $\mathcal{K}$ in quaternary chalcogenides and offer guiding principles for designing low-thermal-conductivity semiconductors.

Title: Imaging of Gate-Controlled Suppression of Superconductivity via the Meissner Effect
Authors: P. J. Scheidegger, K. J. Knapp, U. Ognjanovic, L. Ruf, S. Diesch, E. Scheer, A. Di Bernardo, C. L. Degen
Abstract: It was recently discovered that supercurrents flowing through thin superconducting nanowires can be quenched by a gate voltage. This gate control of supercurrents, known as the GCS effect, could enable superconducting transistor logic. Here, we report that the GCS also manifests in a suppression of Meissner screening, establishing the phenomenon as a genuine feature of superconductivity that is not restricted to transport. Using a scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer at sub-Kelvin temperatures, we image the nanoscale spatial region of GCS suppression in micron-size niobium islands. Our observations are compatible with a microscopic hot-spot model of quasiparticle generation and diffusion, and in conflict with other candidate mechanisms such as Joule heating or an electric field effect. Our work introduces an alternative means for studying quasiparticle dynamics in superconducting nanostructures, and showcases the power of local imaging techniques for understanding emergent condensed matter phenomena.

Title: Chern insulators and topological flat bands in cavity-embedded kagome systems
Authors: Hikaru Goto, Ryo Okugawa, Takami Tohyama
Abstract: We investigate topological band structures of a kagome system coupled to a circularly polarized cavity mode, using a model based on a muffin-tin potential and quantum light-matter interaction. We show that Chern insulating phases emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a low-energy effective tight-binding model.

Title: Acoustoelectric Amplification in a Piezoelectric-2DEG Heterostructure
Authors: Eric Chatterjee, Daniel Soh, Matt Eichenfield
Abstract: We provide a quantum mechanical description of phonon amplification in a heterostructure consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) stacked on top of a piezoelectric material. An applied drift voltage effectively creates a population inversion in the momentum states of the 2DEG electrons, giving rise to spontaneous emission of phonons. Once an acoustic wave is launched, the pumped electrons release phonons via stimulated emission, returning to depleted ground states before being pumped back to the excited states. We show that whereas efficient amplification using a 1D electron gas requires the acoustic wavelength to roughly equal the average electron-electron spacing, a 2DEG enables efficient amplification for any wavelength greater than the average electron-electron spacing. We derive the imaginary and real parts of the 2DEG first-order acoustic susceptibility as functions of electronic drift velocity in specific limits and derive the gain per unit length for the signal and the quantum noise, with the gain matching the classical result in the short-electronic-lifetime (low-mobility) regime. Moreover, we analyze the gain clamping due to pump depletion and calculate the maximum achievable intensity. Our results provide a framework for designing novel acoustic devices including a quantum phononic laser and phase-insensitive quantum phononic amplifiers.

Title: A quantum-coherent photon--emitter interface in the original telecom band
Authors: Marcus Albrechtsen, Severin Krüger, Juan Loredo, Lucio Stefan, Zhe Liu, Yu Meng, Lukas L. Niekamp, Bianca F. Seyschab, Nikolai Spitzer, Richard J. Warburton, Peter Lodahl, Arne Ludwig, Leonardo Midolo
Abstract: Quantum dots stand out as the most advanced and versatile light-matter interface available today. Their ability to deliver high-quality, high-rate, and pure photons has set benchmarks that far surpass other emitters. Yet, a critical frontier has remained elusive: achieving these exceptional capabilities at telecom wavelengths, bridging the gap to fiber-optic infrastructure and scalable silicon photonics. Overcoming this challenge demands high quality quantum materials and devices which, despite extensive efforts, have not been realized yet. Here, we demonstrate waveguide-integrated quantum dots and realize a fully quantum-coherent photon-emitter interface operating in the original telecommunication band. The quality is assessed by recording transform-limited linewidths only 8 % broader than the inverse lifetime and bright 41.7 MHz emission rate under 80 MHz $\pi$-pulse excitation, unlocking the full potential of quantum dots for scalable quantum networks.

Title: Strained Donor-Bound Excitons in $^{28}$Si
Authors: David A. Vogl, Noah L. Braitsch, Başak Ç. Özcan, Niklas S. Vart, M. L. W. Thewalt, Martin S. Brandt
Abstract: We present a comprehensive experimental study of the neutral donor to donor-bound exciton transition (D$^0$$\rightarrow\,$D$^0$X) in isotopically enriched $^{28}$Si, focusing on the group-V donors P, As, and Sb under finely tuned uniaxial stress along the [100] and [110] crystal axes and magnetic fields from 3.5 mT to 1.7 T. From these measurements, donor-specific deformation potentials are extracted. The uniaxial electron deformation potential $\Xi_\mathrm{u}$ is found to be significantly larger than values reported for other states or transitions in silicon and shows a clear dependence on the donor species, indicating an increased sensitivity of the D$^0$X state to strain and central-cell effects. We also observe a magnetic field dependence of the hole shear deformation potential $d$, suggesting a more complex strain coupling mechanism than captured by standard theory. Diamagnetic shift parameters determined from Zeeman spectra show good agreement with earlier measurements. Our results provide a refined parameter set critical for the design of silicon quantum devices based on D$^0$X transitions.

Title: Metaplectic time-frequency representations
Authors: Gianluca Giacchi
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.

Title: Magnetotactic bacterial populations studied with a Pound-Drever-Hall atomic magnetometer
Authors: María Hernández Ruiz, Christopher Kiehl, Vito Giovanni Lucivero, Morgan W. Mitchell
Abstract: We demonstrate an optically pumped magnetometer that monitors spin polarization using Pound Drever Hall (PDH) technique. The instrument exhibits a noise floor of 22.2 pT/sqrt(Hz) limited by optical photon shot noise, short-term instability of 30.8 pT/sqrt(Hz)/sqrt({\tau}) for averaging times {\tau} < 0.2 s , instability below 70 pT for 0.2 s < {\tau} < 20 s and a minimum instability of 47 pT at {\tau} = 6 s. We apply the OPM to investigate the ability of magnetotactic bacteria (Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, MSR-1) to orient in externally applied magnetic fields. Observing an opaque, concentrated suspension, we detect deviations from exponential relaxation dynamics on second time-scales, which give information about the dispersion of bacterial magnetic moment and rotational damping coefficient. These parameters are observed to evolve as the population further concentrates due to evaporation and settling. To our knowledge, this is the first time such magnetic inhomogeneities and long-term relaxation deviations have been directly observed. This study showcases both the sensitivity and stability of our OPM and its potential for probing biophysical processes.

Title: Entanglement and accidental symmetries in the nucleon-nucleon system
Authors: Alma L. Cavallin, Oliver Thim, Christian Forssén
Abstract: We study the connection between accidental symmetries in the nuclear interaction and spin entanglement in two-nucleon scattering. Specifically, we incorporate different levels of Wigner $SU(4)$ and Serber symmetries into leading-order potentials derived from chiral effective field theory. We conduct a quantitative analysis by computing the full $S$ matrix, demonstrating that the neutron-proton spin entanglement can be related to the symmetry properties of the interaction and the presence of certain operators and partial waves. Furthermore, we study the order-by-order evolution of the spin entanglement, up to next-to-next-to-leading order in Weinberg power counting, for both neutron-proton and neutron-neutron scattering. Entanglement suppression is not observed in neutron-neutron scattering, which can be attributed to the Pauli principle and the absence of accidental symmetries in this system. We conclude that entanglement is a useful guide for studying the power counting and symmetries in nuclear interactions derived from effective field theories.

Title: A microscopic approach to nonlinear theory of spin-charge separation
Authors: Oleksandr Tsyplyatyev, Yiqing Jin, María Moreno, Wooi Kiat Tan, Christopher J.B. Ford
Abstract: The fate of spin-charge separation beyond the low energy remains elusive up to now. Here we develop a microscopic theory of the correlation functions using the strong coupling expansion of the Hubbard model and demonstrate its validity down to the experimentally relevant $r_{\rm s}>1$. Evaluating the spectral function, we show the general stability of the nonlinear spin-charge modes in whole energy band and investigate all the nonlinear features systematically. We confirm the general prediction experimentally in semiconductor quantum wires. Furthermore, we observe a signal consistent with a continuum of the nonlinear excitations and with a final spectral density around the $3 k_{\rm F}$ point, indicating the robustness of the Hubbard model predictions for a finite range interaction.

Title: Anomalous Diffusion in a Percolating Disordered Dipolar Spin Ensemble
Authors: Andrew Stasiuk, Garrett Heller, Lance Berkey, Bo Xing, Paola Cappellaro
Abstract: Emergent hydrodynamics (EHD) bridges short-time unitarity with late-time thermodynamics, universal transport phenomena characterize the manner and speed of transport and thermalization. Typical non-integrable systems with few conserved local quantities are expected to be diffusive. In contrast, strongly disordered systems which admit phases such as many-body localization, are predicted to inhibit thermalization and thus slow dynamical transport. Disordered systems represent a uniquely poised platform to probe the quantum-to-classical transition and the emergence of irreversible thermodynamics from the underlying unitary structure. Here, we study a strongly disordered nuclear spin ensemble, using local measurements enabled by the disordered-state technique. We observe an apparent phase transition into a sub-diffusive regime, which we model as a random walk on the emergent fractal structure of a percolating network in the dipolar spin ensemble. Our novel theoretical model provides a framework for characterizing the emergence of thermalization in closed quantum systems, even in the presence of strong disorder.

Title: Unveiling dynamical quantum error correcting codes via non-invertible symmetries
Authors: Rajath Radhakrishnan, Adar Sharon, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn
Abstract: Dynamical stabilizer codes (DSCs) have recently emerged as a powerful generalization of static stabilizer codes for quantum error correction, replacing a fixed stabilizer group with a sequence of non-commuting measurements. This dynamical structure unlocks new possibilities for fault tolerance but also introduces new challenges, as errors must now be tracked across both space and time. In this work, we provide a physical and topological understanding of DSCs by establishing a correspondence between qudit Pauli measurements and non-invertible symmetries in 4+1-dimensional 2-form gauge theories. Sequences of measurements in a DSC are mapped to a fusion of the operators implementing these non-invertible symmetries. We show that the error detectors of a DSC correspond to endable surface operators in the gauge theory, whose endpoints define line operators, and that detectable errors are precisely those surface operators that braid non-trivially with these lines. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework naturally recovers the spacetime stabilizer code associated with a DSC.

Title: On Variational Perspectives To The Graph Isomorphism Problem
Authors: Turbasu Chatterjee, Shah Ishmam Mohtashim, Akash Kundu
Abstract: We consider a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation of the graph isomorphism problem from a variational quantum algorithmic perspective. By treating it using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), this study presents results for each and highlights variations therein for graphs of four and five nodes. For isomorphic graphs having an equal number of nodes and edges, we demonstrate clustering in the energy landscape for the QAOA. This trend found in the QAOA study was further reinforced by studying the ground state energy reduction using VQEs. Furthermore, we examine the trend under which isomorphic pairs of graphs vary in the ground state energies, with varying edges and nodes.

Title: Noise correlations behind superdiffusive quantum walks
Authors: Graça R. M. de Almeida, N. Amaral, A. R. C. Buarque, W. S. Dias
Abstract: We study how discrete-time quantum walks behave under short-range correlated noise. By considering noise as a source of inhomogeneity of quantum gates, we introduce a primitive relaxation in the assumption of uncorrelated stochastic noise: binary pair correlations manifesting in the random distribution. Using different quantum gates, we examined the transport properties for both spatial and temporal noise regimes. For spatial inhomogeneities, we unveil noise correlations driving quantum walks from the well-known exponentially localized regime to superdiffusive spreading. This scenario displays an intriguing performance in which the superdiffusive exponent is almost invariant to the degree of inhomogeneity. The time-asymptotic regime and the finite-size scaling also unveil an emergent superdiffusive behavior for quantum walks undergoing temporal noise correlation, replacing the diffusive regime exhibited when noise is random and uncorrelated. However, some quantum gates are insensitive to correlations, contrasting with the spatial noise scenario. Numerical and analytical results provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of superdiffusive quantum walks, including those arising from deterministic aperiodic inhomogeneities.

Title: Hartman effect, time-delays, and the non-spatial nature of quantum particles
Authors: Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi
Abstract: The phenomenon of quantum tunneling remains a fascinating and enigmatic one, defying classical notions of particle behavior. This paper presents a novel theoretical investigation of the tunneling phenomenon, from the viewpoint of Hartman effect, showing that the classical concept of spatiality is transcended during tunneling, since one cannot describe the process as a crossing of the potential barrier. This means that quantum tunneling strongly indicates that quantum non-locality should be understood as an aspect of quantum non-spatiality. It is also emphasized that according to the Conceptuality Interpretation of quantum mechanics, a non-spatial state should be understood as an abstract state of a conceptual-like entity, which only when it reaches its maximum degree of concreteness, during the wave-function collapse, can enter the spatiotemporal layer of our physical reality.

Title: Strong coupling between a single-photon and a two-photon Fock state
Authors: Shuai-Peng Wang, Alberto Mercurio, Alessandro Ridolfo, Yuqing Wang, Mo Chen, Wenyan Wang, Yulong Liu, Huanying Sun, Tiefu Li, Franco Nori, Salvatore Savasta, J. Q. You
Abstract: The realization of strong nonlinear coupling between single photons has been a long-standing goal in quantum optics and quantum information science, promising wide impact applications, such as all-optical deterministic quantum logic and single-photon frequency conversion. Here, we report an experimental observation of the strong coupling between a single-photon and a two-photon Fock state in an ultrastrongly-coupled circuit-QED system. This strong nonlinear interaction is realized by introducing a detuned flux qubit working as an effective coupler between two modes of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. The ultrastrong light--matter interaction breaks the excitation number conservation, and an external flux bias breaks the parity conservation. The combined effect of the two enables the strong one--two-photon coupling. Quantum Rabi-like avoided crossing is resolved when tuning the two-photon resonance frequency of the first mode across the single-photon resonance frequency of the second mode. Within this new photonic regime, we observe the thresholdless second harmonic generation for a mean photon number below one. Our results represent a key step towards a new regime of quantum nonlinear optics, where individual photons can deterministically and coherently interact with each other in the absence of any stimulating fields.

Title: Noisy Quantum Simulation: Performance and Resource Considerations for the Tavis-Cummings and Heisenberg Models
Authors: Alisa Haukisalmi, Daniel Paz Ramos, Matti Raasakka, Andrea Marchesin, Lauri Ylinen, Ilkka Tittonen
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers promise the simulation of complex quantum systems beyond the reach of classical computation. In contrast, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are constrained by hardware noise. Consequently, quantum simulation methods remain limited in their near-term applicability. Two prominent techniques addressing these challenges are zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and incremental structural learning (ISL). In this work, ZNE and ISL are benchmarked for simulating the Trotterized time evolution of two models: the Tavis-Cummings model (TCM) and the Heisenberg spin chain (HSC), using a classically simulated noisy hardware backend. The methods are evaluated on the basis of the accuracy of expectation values relative to noiseless simulations and their resource demands such as circuit depths and shot counts. The impact of noise on optimization routines in ISL, previously underexplored, is also investigated. Results indicate that ISL performs more favorably in HSC systems, consistently surpassing ZNE in expectation value accuracy. Conversely, for the TCM, ISL generally yields lower accuracies despite reduced Trotter circuit depths, with weak interactions often leading to pronounced phase lags or flat expectation curves. Notably, when performing ISL optimization under noiseless conditions, the protocol is generally able to reduce dephasing errors, but average accuracies still vary on the simulated Hamiltonian. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of quantum simulation protocols to the structure of the Hamiltonian encoding system dynamics. Trends across systems suggest that ISL optimization benefits from Trotter circuits with stronger interactions, and that ansatz construction favors isotropic couplings. Moreover, although ISL introduces approximation errors, it demonstrates greater robustness than ZNE in systems with deeper Trotter circuits.

Title: Conditional disclosure of secrets with quantum resources
Authors: Vahid R. Asadi, Kohdai Kuroiwa, Debbie Leung, Alex May, Sabrina Pasterski, Chris Waddell
Abstract: The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive is among the simplest cryptographic settings in which to study the relationship between communication, randomness, and security. CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret $z$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function $f$ has $f(x,y)=1$. Alice knows $x,z$, Bob knows $y$, and the referee knows $x,y$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to $f$-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. We begin by looking for quantum analogues of results already established in the classical CDS literature. Doing so we establish a number of basic properties of CDQS, including lower bounds on entanglement and communication stated in terms of measures of communication complexity. Because of the close relationship to the $f$-routing position-verification scheme, our results have relevance to the security of these schemes.

Title: Violation of Bell inequalities in an analogue black hole
Authors: Giorgio Ciliberto, Stephanie Emig, Nicolas Pavloff, Mathieu Isoard
Abstract: Signals of entanglement and nonlocality are quantitatively evaluated at zero and finite temperature in an analogue black hole realized in the flow of a quasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The violation of Lorentz invariance inherent to this analog system opens the prospect to observe 3-mode quantum correlations and we study the corresponding violation of bipartite and tripartite Bell inequalities. It is shown that the long wavelength modes of the system are maximally entangled, in the sense that they realize a superposition of continuous variable versions of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states whose entanglement resists partial tracing.

Title: Bosonic Quantum Computational Complexity
Authors: Ulysse Chabaud, Michael Joseph, Saeed Mehraban, Arsalan Motamedi
Abstract: Quantum computing involving physical systems with continuous degrees of freedom, such as the quantum states of light, has recently attracted significant interest. However, a well-defined quantum complexity theory for these bosonic computations over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces is missing. In this work, we lay foundations for such a research program. We introduce natural complexity classes and problems based on bosonic generalizations of BQP, the local Hamiltonian problem, and QMA. We uncover several relationships and subtle differences between standard Boolean classical and discrete variable quantum complexity classes and identify outstanding open problems. In particular: 1. We show that the power of quadratic (Gaussian) quantum dynamics is equivalent to the class BQL. More generally, we define classes of continuous-variable quantum polynomial time computations with a bounded probability of error based on higher-degree gates. Due to the infinite dimensional Hilbert space, it is not a priori clear whether a decidable upper bound can be obtained for these classes. We identify complete problems for these classes and demonstrate a BQP lower and EXPSPACE upper bound. We further show that the problem of computing expectation values of polynomial bosonic observables is in PSPACE. 2. We prove that the problem of deciding the boundedness of the spectrum of a bosonic Hamiltonian is co-NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that the problem of finding the minimum energy of a bosonic Hamiltonian critically depends on the non-Gaussian stellar rank of the family of energy-constrained states one optimizes over: for constant stellar rank, it is NP-complete; for polynomially-bounded rank, it is in QMA; for unbounded rank, it is undecidable.

Title: Observable-projected ensembles
Authors: Alexey Milekhin, Sara Murciano
Abstract: Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.

Title: Quantum state preparation with optimal T-count
Authors: David Gosset, Robin Kothari, Kewen Wu
Abstract: How many T gates are needed to approximate an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state to within error $\varepsilon$? Improving prior work of Low, Kliuchnikov, and Schaeffer, we show that the optimal asymptotic scaling is $\Theta\left(\sqrt{2^n\log(1/\varepsilon)}+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right)$ if we allow ancilla qubits. We also show that this is the optimal T-count for implementing an arbitrary diagonal $n$-qubit unitary to within error $\varepsilon$. We describe applications in which a tensor product of many single-qubit unitaries can be synthesized in parallel for the price of one.

Title: Security of Key-Alternating Ciphers: Quantum Lower Bounds and Quantum Walk Attacks
Authors: Chen Bai, Mehdi Esmaili, Atul Mantri
Abstract: We study the quantum security of key-alternating ciphers (KAC), a natural multi-round generalization of the Even--Mansour construction. KAC abstracts the round structure of practical block ciphers as public permutations interleaved with key XORs. The $1$-round KAC or EM setting already highlights the power of quantum superposition access: EM is secure against classical and Q1 adversaries (quantum access to the public permutation), but insecure in the Q2 model. The security of multi-round KACs remain largely unexplored; in particular, whether the quantum-classical separation extends beyond a single round had remained open. 1) Quantum Lower Bounds. We prove security of the $t$-round KAC against a non-adaptive adversary in both the Q1 and Q2 models. In the Q1 model, any distinguiser requires $\Omega(2^{\frac{tn}{2t+1}})$ oracle queries to distinguish the cipher from a random permutation, whereas classically any distinguisher needs $\Omega(2^{\frac{tn}{t+1}})$ queries. As a corollary, we obtain a Q2 lower bound of $\Omega (2^{\frac{(t-1)n}{2t}})$ quantum queries. Thus, for $t \geq 2$, the exponential Q1-Q2 gap collapses in the non-adaptive setting, partially resolving an open problem posed by Kuwakado and Morii (2012). Our proofs develop a controlled-reprogramming framework within a quantum hybrid argument, sidestepping the lack of quantum recording techniques for permutation-based ciphers; we expect this framework to be useful for analyzing other post-quantum symmetric primitives. 2) Quantum Key-Recovery Attack. We give the first non-trivial quantum key-recovery algorithm for $t$-round KAC in the Q1 model. It makes $O(2^{\alpha n})$ queries with $\alpha = \frac{t(t+1)}{(t+1)^2 + 1}$, improving on the best known classical bound of $O(2^{\alpha' n})$ with $\alpha' = \frac{t}{t+1}$. The algorithm adapts quantum walk techniques to the KAC structure.

Title: Vacuum Rabi Splitting and Quantum Fisher Information of a Non-Hermitian Qubit in a Single-Mode Cavity
Authors: Yi-Cheng Wang, Jiong Li, Li-Wei Duan, Qing-Hu Chen
Abstract: A natural extension of the non-Hermitian qubit is to place it in a single-mode cavity. This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigensolutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum are predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a {quantum-criticality-enhanced} effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.

Title: Digital quantum simulation of bosonic systems and quantum complementarity
Authors: Victor P. Brasil, Diego S. Starke, Jonas Maziero
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation (DQS) has emerged as a powerful approach to investigate complex quantum systems using digital quantum computers. Such systems, like many-particle bosonic systems and intricate optical experimental setups, pose significant challenges for classical simulation methods. In this paper, we utilize a general formalism for the DQS of bosonic systems, which consists of mapping bosonic operators to Pauli operators using the Gray code, in order to simulate interferometric variants of Afshar's experiment -- an intricate optical experiment -- on IBM's quantum computers. We investigated experiments analogous to Afshar's double-slit experiment performed by Unruh and Pessoa Júnior, exploring discussions on the apparent violation of Bohr's complementarity principle when considering the entire experimental setup. Based on the aforementioned experiments, we construct a variation of a delayed-choice setup. We also explore another experiment starting with a two-photon initial state. Finally, we analyze these experiments within the framework of an updated quantum complementarity principle, which applies to specific quantum state preparations and remains consistent with the foundational principles of Quantum Mechanics.

Title: Toward a Scalable Linear-Cavity Enhanced Warm-Vapor Photonic Quantum Memory
Authors: Bharath Srivathsan, Rafal Gartman, Robert J. A. Francis-Jones, Peter Mosley, Joshua Nunn
Abstract: The coherent storage, buffering and retrieval of photons in a quantum memory enables the scalable creation of photonic entangled states via linear optics and repeat-until-success, unlocking applications in quantum communications and photonic quantum computing. Quantum memories based on off-resonant cascaded absorption (ORCA) in atomic vapors allow this storage to be broadband, noise-free, and high efficiency. Here, we implement a cavity-enhanced ORCA memory with reduced footprint and reduced power requirements compared to conventional single-pass schemes. By combining a strong magnetic field with polarization control, we maintain a Doppler-free interaction and eliminate the need for optical pumping. Our design establishes the feasibility of large arrays of ultra-compact, low-power, near-unit-efficiency, noiseless quantum memories running at GHz bandwidth, without the need for atom trapping or cryogenics.

Title: Exact simulation of realistic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill cluster states
Authors: Milica Banic, Valerio Crescimanna, J. Eli Bourassa, Carlos Gonzalez-Arciniegas, Rafael N. Alexander, Khabat Heshami
Abstract: We describe a method for simulating and characterizing realistic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) cluster states, rooted in the representation of resource states in terms of sums of Gaussian distributions in phase space. We apply our method to study the generation of single-mode GKP states via cat state breeding, and the formation of multimode GKP cluster states via linear optical circuits and homodyne measurements. We characterize resource states by referring to expectation values of their stabilizers, and witness operators constructed from them. Our method reproduces the results of standard Fock-basis simulations, while being more efficient, and being applicable in a broader parameter space. We also comment on the validity of the heuristic Gaussian random noise (GRN) model, through comparisons with our exact simulations: We find discrepancies in the stabilizer expectation values when homodyne measurement is involved in cluster state preparation, yet we find a close agreement between the two approaches on average.

Title: Discrete time crystals in one-dimensional classical Floquet systems with nearest-neighbor interactions
Authors: Zhuo-Yi Li, Yu-Ran Zhang
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs), an emergent non-equilibrium phase of matter, have been studied in two- and higher-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions and one-dimensional (1D) lattices with long-range interactions. However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free discrete time crystals (DTCs) in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time first grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and is then saturated, which depends on the energy density of the initial state. Since thermalization of the effective Hamiltonian is slow, there is no typical prethermalization and PDTCs in the Floquet system before final thermalization. The robustness of DTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order

Title: Graph state extraction from two-dimensional cluster states
Authors: Julia Freund, Alexander Pirker, Lina Vandré, Wolfgang Dür
Abstract: We propose schemes to extract arbitrary graph states from two-dimensional cluster states by locally manipulating the qubits solely via single-qubit measurements. We introduce graph state manipulation tools that allow one to increase the local vertex degree and to merge subgraphs. We utilize these tools together with the previously introduced zipper scheme that generates multiple edges between distant vertices to extract the desired graph state from a two-dimensional cluster state. We show how to minimize overheads by avoiding multiple edges, and compare with a local manipulation strategy based on measurement-based quantum computation together with transport. These schemes have direct applications in entanglement-based quantum networks, sensor networks, and distributed quantum computing in general.

Title: Kibble-Zurek dynamical scaling hypothesis in the Google analog-digital quantum simulator of the $XX$ model
Authors: Yintai Zhang, Francis A. Bayocboc Jr., Jacek Dziarmaga
Abstract: State-of-the-art tensor networks are employed to simulate the Hamiltonian ramp in the analog-digital quantum simulation of the quantum phase transition to the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the two-dimensional square-lattice $XX$ model [T.I. Andersen \textit{et al.}, Nature (London) \textbf{638}, 79 (2025)]. We focus on the quantum Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism near the quantum critical point. Using the infinite projected entangled pair state, we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions. This finding contradicts the quantum simulation data where the correlation length seems to obey KZ-like power laws, although with modified exponents.

Title: Robustness Analysis for Quantum Systems Controlled by Continuous-Time Pulses
Authors: Sean Patrick O'Neil, Edmond Jonckheere, Sophie Schirmer
Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls. Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Upper bounds on the magnitude of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the control inputs.

Title: Obfuscation of Unitary Quantum Programs
Authors: Mi-Ying Huang, Er-Cheng Tang
Abstract: Program obfuscation aims to hide the inner workings of a program while preserving its functionality. In the quantum setting, recent works have obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security, and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.

Title: Topology-Enhanced Superconducting Qubit Networks for In-Sensor Quantum Information Processing
Authors: J. Settino, G. G. Luciano, A. Di Bartolomeo, P. Silvestrini, M. Lisitskiy, B. Ruggiero, F. Romeo
Abstract: We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.

Title: Quantum Dark Magic: Efficiency of Intermediate Non-Stabiliserness
Authors: Tom Krüger, Wolfgang Mauerer
Abstract: While there is strong evidence for advantages of quantum over classical computation, the repertoire of computational primitives with proven or conjectured quantum advantage remains limited. Despite considerable progress in delineating the quantum-classical divide, the systematic construction of algorithms with quantum advantage remains challenging, which can be attributed to a still incomplete understanding of the sources of quantum computational power. Non-classical behaviour of quantum systems can be characterised, for instance, by intermediate non-stabiliserness , and might be seen as required condition for quantum advantage. Yet, naively equating non-stabiliserness, non-classicality and quantum advantage would be misleading: Even random Haar sampled states that are of doubtful computational use at all exhibit near-maximal non-stabiliserness. Advancing towards systematic quantum advantage calls for a better understanding of the efficient use of non-classical resources like non-stabiliser states. We present an approach to track the behaviour of non-stabiliserness across various algorithms by pairing resource theory of non-stabiliser entropies with the geometry of quantum state evolution, and introduce permutation agnostic distance measures that reveal and quantify non-stabiliser effects previously hidden by a subset of Clifford operations. We find different efficiency in the use of non-stabiliserness for structured and unstructured variational approaches, and show that greater freedom for classical optimisation in quantum-classical methods increases unnecessary non-stabiliser consumption. Our results open new means of analysing the efficient utilisation of quantum resources, and contribute towards the targeted construction of algorithmic quantum advantage.

Title: Certifying non-classicality and non-Gaussianity through optical parametric amplification
Authors: Mahmoud Kalash, Marcello H.M. Passos, Éva Rácz, László Ruppert, Radim Filip, Maria V. Chekhova
Abstract: Non-Gaussian states of light are essential for numerous quantum information protocols; thus, certifying non-Gaussianity is crucial. Full quantum state tomography, commonly used for this purpose, is a complicated procedure and yields inconclusive results for strongly mixed states. Certifying non-Gaussianity through directly measurable parameters is a simpler alternative, typically achieved by measuring photon-number probabilities - either directly, using photon-number resolving detectors, or through Hanbury Brown--Twiss type measurements with single-photon detectors. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that optical parametric amplification combined with conventional intensity detectors can effectively replace this approach without the need for photon-number resolution. In our method, we measure the mean photon number and the second-order correlation function for the amplified state. Using it, we successfully certify the non-Gaussianity of a heralded quasi-single-photon state. Since optical parametric amplification is a broadband and multimode process, our method provides a foundation for developing high-dimensional quantum technologies utilizing broadband multimode non-Gaussian states.

Title: Multipartite correlation measures and framework for multipartite quantum resources theory
Authors: Taotao Yan, Jinchuan Hou, Xiaofei Qi, Kan He
Abstract: In recent years, it has been recognized that properties of multipartite physical systems, such as genuine multipartite entanglement, can be considered as important resources for quantum information and other areas of physics. However, the current framework of multipartite quantum resource theory is flawed. In this paper, we propose a more reasonable framework for multipartite quantum resource theory with a particular focus on axiomatic definition for true measures of multipartite quantum correlations (MQC) that regulates how to measure the correlation in part systems (the unification condition) and how to describe the requirement from many-body resource theory that the correlation hold by part system does not exceed that of the entire system (the hierarchy condition). We find that, due to the inherent characteristics of MQCs, the true measures of different MQCs exhibit distinct hierarchy conditions. Based on this framework, we verify that multipartite entanglement, $k$-entanglement, $k$-partite entanglement, multipartite non-PPT, multipartite coherence, multipartite imaginarity, multipartite multi-mode Gaussian non-product correlation, multipartite multi-mode Gaussian imaginarity, and multipartite single-mode Gaussian coherence are all symmetric multipartite quantum resources. We also show that, multipartite steering is an asymmetric multipartite quantum resource. Finally, the monogamy relations for true measures of symmetric MQCs are discussed.

Title: Universality in the Anticoncentration of Noisy Quantum Circuits at Finite Depths
Authors: Arman Sauliere, Guglielmo Lami, Corentin Boyer, Jacopo De Nardis, Andrea De Luca
Abstract: We present universal properties of the anticoncentration of noisy quantum circuits at finite depth. By employing an effective model of random matrix product operators, we show that in the weak-noise regime different types of noise act in a similar fashion, leading to a universal distribution of bit-string probabilities, largely independent of the specific noise channel or circuit architecture. We identify three distinct depth-dependent regimes, each signaled by a different scaling of cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) over rescaled depth. In the shallow-depth regime, noise effects are perturbatively small; in the intermediate regime, circuit-induced fluctuations and noise compete on equal footing; and in the deep-depth regime, the output distribution becomes effectively classical, up to corrections that are exponentially small in the noise strength. We provide quantitative predictions for the anticoncentration of generic circuits at finite depth, which we benchmark with numerical simulations displaying perfect agreement even for shallow circuits. Moreover, we show that, contrary to previous belief, the late-time XEB does give access to the global circuit fidelity, even for large noise strengths. Our findings are directly applicable to current quantum processors and demonstrate universal behavior beyond pure random-matrix-theory regimes which are only applicable at large depths.

Title: An exploration of the noise sensitivity of the Shor's algorithm
Authors: Fusheng Yang, Zhipeng Liang, Zhengzhong Yi, Xuan Wang
Abstract: Quantum algorithms face significant challenges due to qubit susceptibility to environmental noise, and quantum error correction typically requires prohibitive resource overhead. This paper proposes that quantum algorithms may possess inherent noise resilience characteristics that could reduce implementation barriers. We investigate Shor's algorithm by applying circuit-level noise models directly to the original algorithm circuit. Our findings reveal that Shor's algorithm demonstrates superior fault tolerance under Z noise compared to X and Y noise. Focusing on the modular exponentiation circuit which is the core component of the algorithm, we conduct fault-tolerant position statistics on circuits with bit lengths from 4 to 9. The results show that under Z noise, fault-tolerant positions grow with the same quartic polynomial order as potential error positions as the problem scale increases. In contrast, fault tolerance under X and Y noise exhibits a strong dependence on the composite number N and the parameter a. Based on these findings, we develop an extrapolation method predicting that the minimum probability of a correct output of the modular exponentiation circuit to factor 2048 bit integers under biased noise is approximately 1.417*{10}^{-17}.

Title: Continuous-Time Quantum State Transfer with a Generalized Laplacian
Authors: Yujia Shi
Abstract: Quantum walks generated by the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian are known to exhibit low transfer fidelity on general graphs. In this paper, we study continuous-time quantum walks governed by the generalized Laplacian operator L_k = A+kD, where A is the adjacency matrix, D is the degree matrix, and k is a real-valued parameter. Recent work of Duda, McLaughlin, and Wong showed that in the single-excitation Heisenberg (XYZ) spin model, one can realize walks generated by this family of operators on signed weighted graphs. Motivated by earlier studies on vertex-weighted graphs, we demonstrate that for certain graphs, tuning the parameter k can significantly enhance the fidelity of state transfer between endpoints.

Title: Provable avoidance of barren plateaus for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with Grover mixers
Authors: Boris Tsvelikhovskiy, Matthew Nuyten, Bojko N. Bakalov
Abstract: We analyze the dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) associated with the Grover-mixer variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (GM-QAOA). When the initial state is the uniform superposition of computational basis states, we show that the corresponding DLA is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{su}(d) \oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)\oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)$, where $d$ denotes the number of distinct values of the objective function. We also establish an analogous result for other choices of initial states and Grover-type mixers. Furthermore, we prove that the DLA of GM-QAOA has the largest possible commutant among all QAOA variants initialized with the same state, corresponding physically to the maximal set of conserved quantities. We derive an explicit formula for the variance of the GM-QAOA loss function in terms of the objective function values, and we show that for a broad class of optimization problems, GM-QAOA with sufficiently many layers avoids barren plateaus.

Abstract: The functionalization of quantum devices to increase their performance and extend their fields of application is an extremely active research area. One of the most promising approaches is to replace aluminum with more performant materials. Within this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials are ideal candidates since they would allow to embed their unique properties into qubits. However, the realization of qubits based on vdW materials other than graphene is yet to be achieved. In this work we present a weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit. Our device exhibits a relaxation time T1 = 6.5 +\- 0.4 us which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger of other vdW qubits in addition to robustness to photon noise up to 5-10 thermal photons. Our work serves as a demonstrator of the advantage of integration of vdW materials into quantum technologies as well as serving as the first step toward the application of quantum non demolition photon detection protocols in the challenging field of dark matter search.

Title: Classical and quantum chaotic synchronization in coupled dissipative time crystals
Authors: Eliška Postavová, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignano, Angelo Russomanno
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.

Title: Limits to black-box amplification in QMA
Authors: Scott Aaronson, Phillip Harris, Freek Witteveen
Abstract: We study the limitations of black-box amplification in the quantum complexity class QMA. Amplification is known to boost any inverse-polynomial gap between completeness and soundness to exponentially small error, and a recent result (Jeffery and Witteveen, 2025) shows that completeness can in fact be amplified to be doubly exponentially close to 1. We prove that this is optimal for black-box procedures: we provide a quantum oracle relative to which no QMA verification procedure using polynomial resources can achieve completeness closer to 1 than doubly exponential, or a soundness which is super-exponentially small. This is proven by using techniques from complex approximation theory, to make the oracle separation from (Aaronson, 2008), between QMA and QMA with perfect completeness, quantitative.

Title: Entanglement dynamics of light's orbital angular momentum under a Lorentz boost
Authors: Moslem Mahdavifar
Abstract: The idea behind entanglement is counterintuitive to any classical viewpoint of physical realism. An entangled state is a nonlocal superposition of realities that belong to a physical system. The common test of such a state has been done through Bell measurements. In this work, we attempt to look at this notion from a different perspective. We study the evolution of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertia reference frames under a Lorentz boost. We consider two specific motions for the observers of the entanglement. First, we consider co-moving observers, i.e., with zero relative motion (Zero-RM). Second, we introduce a non-zero relative motion (Non-Zero RM) between them. In the second case, we distinguish between observer's perspective of the amplitude probability, i.e., from the perspective of rest (Non-Zero RM1) and moving (Non-Zero RM2) observers. As a result, the transition probability amplitudes are altered in all cases. We observe that entanglement undergoes significant changes and is not preserved maximally from the viewpoint of the stationary observers at the rest (source) frame and asymptotically approaches a minimum at very large velocities close to the light cone (LC). However, from the viewpoint of moving observer in the Non-Zero RM2, entanglement will not survive, and the final state is separable. This is an extremely important observation since the concept of entanglement is supposed to be nonlocal, and therefore free from any spacetime transformation. Our results demonstrated through the entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity show that OAM entanglement is observer dependent, hence, local. Ironically, even entanglement is influenced by motion. Finally, based on this study, one can predict that within photon's frame of reference, there is no OAM relevance, and this property is only emergent at the light-matter interaction limit.

Title: Scrambling-Enhanced Quantum Battery Charging in Black Hole Analogues
Authors: Zhilong Liu, Ying Li, Zehua Tian, Jieci Wang
Abstract: Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, we explore how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches of preset scrambling parameters. Our analysis reveals that the intentionally engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters could significantly enhance both maximum stored energy $E_{\max}$ and peak charging power $P_{\max}$ in the quench charging protocol. The optimal charging time $\tau_*$ exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon parameter $x_{h0}$, while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench horizon parameter $x_{ht}$. This temporal compression confines high-power operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling $x_{ht} > x_{h0}$, demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling dynamics.

Title: Information Loss and Cost in Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Javier Molina-Vilaplana, Germán Sierra, H.C. Zhang
Abstract: We develop an algebraic and information-theoretic framework to characterize symmetry breaking of generalized, non-invertible symmetries in two spatial dimensions. The reduction of symmetry is modeled within subfactor theory, where condensable Frobenius algebras play the role of subgroups in the categorical setting. This perspective naturally connects to the description of anyon condensation in topological phases of matter. Central to our approach are coarse-graining maps, or conditional expectations, which act as quantum channels projecting observables from a phase with higher symmetry onto one where the symmetry is partially or completely broken by condensation. By employing relative entropy as an entropic order parameter, we quantify the information loss induced by condensation and establish a universal bound governed by the Jones index, which is equal to the quantum dimension of the condensate. We illustrate the framework through explicit examples, including the toric code, abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the representation category Rep($S_3$), and show how dualities give rise to equivalence classes of condensation patterns. Our results forge new connections between operator algebras, tensor category theory, and quantum information in the study of generalized symmetries.

Title: Progress in the study of the (non)existence of genuinely unextendible product bases
Authors: Maciej Demianowicz
Abstract: We investigate the open problem of the existence of genuinely unextendible product bases (GUPBs), that is, multipartite unextendible product bases (UPBs) which remain unextendible even with respect to biproduct vectors across all bipartitions of the parties. To this end, we exploit the well-known connection between UPBs and graph theory through orthogonality graphs and orthogonal representations, together with recent progress in this framework, and employ forbidden induced subgraph characterizations to single out the admissible local orthogonality graphs for GUPBs. Using this approach, we establish that GUPBs of size thirteen in three-qutrit systems-the smallest candidate GUPBs-do not exist. We further provide a partial characterization of graphs relevant to larger bases and systems with ququart subsystems.

Title: Turning Down the Noise: Power-Law Decay and Temporal Phase Transitions
Authors: Lieuwe Bakker, Suvendu Barik, Vladimir Gritsev, Emil A. Yuzbashyan
Abstract: We determine the late-time dynamics of a generic spin ensemble with inhomogeneous broadening - equivalently, qubits with arbitrary Zeeman splittings - coupled to a dissipative environment with strength decreasing as $1/t$. The approach to the steady state follows a power law, reflecting the interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and vanishing dissipation. The decay exponents vary non-analytically with the ramp rate, exhibiting a cusp singularity, and $n$-point correlation functions factorize into one- and two-point contributions. Our exact solution anchors a universality class of open quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent dissipation.

Title: Quantum Strategies to Overcome Classical Multiplexing Limits
Authors: Tzula B. Propp, Jeroen Grimbergen, Emil R. Hellebek, Junior R. Gonzales-Ureta, Janice van Dam, Joshua A. Slater, Anders S. Sørensen, Stephanie D. C. Wehner
Abstract: Near-term quantum networks face a bottleneck due to low quantum communication rates. This degrades performance both by lowering operating speeds and increasing qubit storage time in noisy memories, making some quantum internet applications infeasible. One way to circumvent this bottleneck is multiplexing: combining multiple signals into a single signal to improve the overall rate. Standard multiplexing techniques are classical in that they do not make use of coherence between quantum channels nor account for decoherence rates that vary during a protocol's execution. In this paper, we first derive semiclassical limits to multiplexing for many-qubit protocols, and then introduce new techniques: quantum multiplexing and multi-server multiplexing. These can enable beyond-classical multiplexing advantages. We illustrate these techniques through three example applications: 1) entanglement generation between two asymetric quantum network nodes (i.e., repeaters or quantum servers with inequal memories), 2) remote state preparation between many end user devices and a single quantum node, and 3) remote state preparation between one end user device and many internetworked quantum nodes. By utilizing many noisy internetworked quantum devices instead of fewer low-noise devices, our multiplexing strategies enable new paths towards achieving high-speed many-qubit quantum network applications.

Title: Extended validations on photon number resolving detector based Gaussian boson sampling with low noises
Authors: Yang Ji, Yongzheng Wu, Shi Wang, Jie Hou, Zijian Wang, Bo Jiang
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a variety of boson sampling overcoming the stable single-photon preparation difficulty of the later. However, like those in the original version, noises in GBS will also result in the deviation of output patterns and the reduction of classical simulation complexity. We extend the pattern recognition validation, together with the correlation approach as a comparison, on GBS using photon number resolving detectors with noises of both photon loss and distinguishability, to quantificationally evaluate noise levels. As for the classical simulation with noises to be used during validations, it is actually a simulation of mixed states where we employ an existing photon-pair strategy to realize polynomial speedup locally. Furthermore, we use an output-binning strategy to realize validation speedup. Our simulation indicates that the pattern recognition protocol is robust on noise evaluations of GBS even when noises are sufficiently low.

Title: Angular Geometry of Atomic Multipole Transitions
Authors: Wesley C. Campbell
Abstract: A simple way to calculate Rabi frequencies is outlined for interactions of atomic or nuclear multipole moments with laser fields that focuses on their relative geometry. The resulting expression takes the form of a dot product between the laser polarization and a vector spherical harmonic, thereby naturally connecting to the multipole's far-field spontaneous-emission pattern and providing a way to visualize the interaction. Since the vector spherical harmonics are not yet a standard tool in quantum science, their relevant properties are reviewed. This approach is illustrated in the calculation of a variety of beam effects, yielding both perturbative corrections and some nontrivial cases with non-vanishing coupling.

Title: On Quantum Computation Using Bias-Preserving Gates
Authors: Debadrito Roy, Aryaman Manish Kolhe, V. Lalitha, Navin Kashyap
Abstract: Certain types of quantum computing platforms, such as those realized using Rydberg atoms or Kerr-cat qubits, are natively more susceptible to Pauli-Z noise than Pauli-X noise, or vice versa. On such hardware, it is useful to ensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in the noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for biased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms. In this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj Quantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving gates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a linear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving gate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set {X,R_z(\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \theta is any irrational multiple of 2\pi. (3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any Z-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving gates on the physical qubits. Along the way, we also demonstrate that Z-bias-preserving gates are far from being universal for quantum computation.

Title: Computational Bell Inequalities
Authors: Ilya Merkulov, Rotem Arnon
Abstract: We introduce a systematic approach for analyzing device-independent single-prover interactive protocols under computational assumptions. This is done by establishing an explicit correspondence with Bell inequalities and nonlocal games and constructing a computational space of correlations. We show how computational assumptions are converted to computational Bell inequalities, in their rigorous mathematical sense, a hyperplane that separates the sets of classical and quantum verifier-prover interactions. We reveal precisely how the nonsignaling assumption in standard device-independent setups interchanges with the computational challenge of learning a hidden input (that we define). We further utilize our fundamental results to study explicit protocols using the new perspective. We take advantage of modular tools for studying nonlocality, deriving tighter Tsirelson bounds for single-prover protocols and bounding the entropy generated in the interaction, improving on previous results. Our work thus establishes a modular approach to analyzing single-prover quantum certification protocols based on computational assumptions through the fundamental lens of Bell inequalities, removing many layers of technical overhead. The link that we draw between single-prover protocols and Bell inequalities goes far beyond the spread intuitive understanding or known results about "compiled nonlocal games"; Notably, it captures the exact way in which the correspondence between computational assumptions and locality should be understood also in protocols based on, e.g., trapdoor claw-free functions (in which there is no clear underlying nonlocal game).

Title: Disorder operators in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquids through multidimensional bosonization
Authors: Kang-Le Cai, Meng Cheng
Abstract: Disorder operators are a type of non-local observables for quantum many-body systems, measuring the fluctuations of symmetry charges inside a region. It has been shown that disorder operators can reveal global aspects of many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access through local measurements. We study the disorder operator for U(1) (charge or spin) symmetry in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquid states, using the multidimensional bosonization formalism. For a region $A$, the logarithm of the charge disorder parameter in a Fermi liquid with isotropic interactions scales asymptotically as $l_A\ln l_A$, with $l_A$ being the linear size of the region $A$. We calculate the proportionality coefficient in terms of Landau parameters of the Fermi liquid theory. We then study models of the Fermi surface coupled to gapless bosonic fields realizing non-Fermi liquid states. In a simple spinless model, where the fermion density is coupled to a critical scalar, we find that at the quantum critical point the scaling behavior of the charge disorder operators is drastically modified to $l_A \ln^2 l_A$. We also consider the composite Fermi liquid state and argue that the charge disorder operator scales as $l_A$.

Title: Filtering out mislabeled training instances using black-box optimization and quantum annealing
Authors: Makoto Otsuka, Kento Kodama, Keisuke Morita, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.

Title: Quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with trivial band topology
Authors: Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager, Gunnar F. Lange
Abstract: We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$ index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain broader bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where the quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental bismuth realizing a nontrivial even spin-Chern number. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses and show their robustness in the presence of disorder within a real space marker formulation, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry is observable in realistic experimental settings of impure materials. Finally, we connect spin bounds to quantum Cramér-Rao bounds that are central to quantum metrology, showing that elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.

Title: Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors
Authors: S. I. Mukhin
Abstract: A theory is presented of a mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, based on the fact that 'nested' fermionic states near the Fermi surface of electrons/holes cause instability with respect to formation of the Q-balls (nontopological solitons) of coherently condensed spin/charge density wave fluctuations (SDW/CDW) with the wave-vector that matches the 'nesting' one. Simultaneously, the 'nested' fermions form superconducting condensate of Cooper/local pairs inside the Q-balls, with Q-ball SDW/CDW field being a 'pairing glue'. Thus, Q-balls possess lower total energy with respect to not condensed thermal SDW/CDW fluctuations and form a Q-balls 'gas' via first order phase transition below a temperature T$^*$. Besides, superconducting condensates inside the Q-balls induce a spectral gap on the nested parts of the Fermi surface, thus creating pseudogap phase. The Q-ball semiclassical field breaks chiral symmetry along the Matsubara time axis in Euclidean space-time possessing conserved Noether "charge" Q that makes the Q-ball volume finite. Prediction of the Q-ball scenario in cuprates is supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ in the pseudogap phase. The Q-balls of baryonic fields were originally predicted in Minkowski space-time by Sidney Coleman. In this paper it is demonstrated analytically that scattering of itinerant fermions on the Q-balls causes linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, that may explain famous 'Plankian' behavior in the 'strange metal' phase of high-Tc cuprates. Calculated diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas in the 'strange metal' phase and the phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates, with superconducting dome touching the 'strange metal' area at the optimal (holes)doping, are also in qualitative accord with experimental data.

Title: The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain
Authors: Akash Sinha, Tinu Justin, Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.

Title: Generalized Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm
Authors: Abdelrahman S. Abdelrahman, Shuvro Chowdhury, Flaviano Morone, Kerem Y. Camsari
Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.

Title: Agentic Exploration of Physics Models
Authors: Maximilian Nägele, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

Title: Slow dynamics from a nested hierarchy of frozen states
Authors: Vanja Marić, Luka Paljk, Lenart Zadnik
Abstract: We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions.

Title: Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes
Authors: Zhilong Liu, Wentao Liu, Xiaofang Liu, Jieci Wang
Abstract: Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.
