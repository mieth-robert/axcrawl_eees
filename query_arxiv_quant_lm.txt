Title: Quantal analysis of the effects of coordinate noncommutativity on bi-dimensional harmonic motion under parametric variations
Authors: Salim Medjber, Hacene Bekkar, Salah Menouar, Jeong Ryeol Choi
Abstract: Influence of coordinate noncommutativity on 2D quantum oscillatory motion, which undergoes parameter variations, are investigated. We first derive quantum solutions of the system described with time-independent parameters considering the noncommutativity of coordinates as a preliminary step. And then, we extend our study, framed with noncommutative phase-space formalism, to obtain relevant solutions of the system with time-dependent parameters. This system, which we focus on, is nonstationary due to variation of parameters in time. While the left and right circular annihilation and creation operators are utilized in the quantal management of the basic stationary system, the Schrödinger equation of the nonstationary system is solved using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the invariant-related unitary transformation procedure. The outcome of our analysis is useful in understanding the effects of noncommutativity from quantum perspectives, especially in conjunction with the impact of parameter variations.

Title: Optimizing compilation of error correction codes for 2xN quantum dot arrays and its NP-hardness
Authors: Anthony Micciche, Anasua Chatterjee, Andrew McGregor, Stefan Krastanov
Abstract: The ability to physically move qubits within a register allows the design of hardware-specific error correction codes which can achieve fault-tolerance while respecting other constraints. In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity. Exploiting this, we design an error correction architecture, consisting merely of two parallel quantum dot arrays, an experimentally validated architecture compatible with classical wiring and control constraints. We develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any stabilizer error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a minimal number of shuttling operations. In simulation, these heuristics show that fault tolerance can be achieved on several contemporary quantum error-correcting codes requiring only modestly-optimistic noise parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate how constant column-weight qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that scales constantly with code size using Shor-style syndrome extraction. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for codes not in that class.

Title: Entanglement-assisted variational algorithm for discrete optimization problems
Authors: Lorenzo Fioroni, Vincenzo Savona
Abstract: From fundamental sciences to economics and industry, discrete optimization problems are ubiquitous. Yet, their complexity often renders exact solutions intractable, necessitating the use of approximate methods. Heuristics inspired by classical physics have long played a central role in this domain. More recently, quantum annealing has emerged as a promising alternative, with hardware implementations realized on both analog and digital quantum devices. Here, we develop a heuristic inspired by quantum annealing, using Generalized Coherent States as a parameterized variational Ansatz to represent the quantum state. This framework allows for the analytical computation of energy and gradients with low-degree polynomial complexity, enabling the study of large problems with thousands of spins. Concurrently, these states capture non-trivial entanglement, crucial for the effectiveness of quantum annealing. We benchmark the heuristic on the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model and compare the solution quality and runtime of our method to other popular heuristics. Our findings suggest that it offers a scalable way to leverage quantum effects for complex optimization problems, potentially surpassing conventional alternatives in large-scale applications.

Title: Demonstrating quantum error mitigation on logical qubits
Authors: Aosai Zhang, Haipeng Xie, Yu Gao, Jia-Nan Yang, Zehang Bao, Zitian Zhu, Jiachen Chen, Ning Wang, Chuanyu Zhang, Jiarun Zhong, Shibo Xu, Ke Wang, Yaozu Wu, Feitong Jin, Xuhao Zhu, Yiren Zou, Ziqi Tan, Zhengyi Cui, Fanhao Shen, Tingting Li, Yihang Han, Yiyang He, Gongyu Liu, Jiayuan Shen, Han Wang, Yanzhe Wang, Hang Dong, Jinfeng Deng, Hekang Li, Zhen Wang, Chao Song, Qiujiang Guo, Pengfei Zhang, Ying Li, H. Wang
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in quantum computing is developing technologies to overcome the inevitable noise in qubits. To enable meaningful applications in the early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing, devising methods to suppress post-correction logical failures is becoming increasingly crucial. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the application of zero-noise extrapolation, a practical quantum error mitigation technique, to error correction circuits on state-of-the-art superconducting processors. By amplifying the noise on physical qubits, the circuits yield outcomes that exhibit a predictable dependence on noise strength, following a polynomial function determined by the code distance. This property enables the effective application of polynomial extrapolation to mitigate logical errors. Our experiments demonstrate a universal reduction in logical errors across various quantum circuits, including fault-tolerant circuits of repetition and surface codes. We observe a favorable performance in multi-round error correction circuits, indicating that this method remains effective when the circuit depth increases. These results advance the frontier of quantum error suppression technologies, opening a practical way to achieve reliable quantum computing in the early fault-tolerant era.

Title: Thermodynamics of the Page curve in Markovian open quantum systems
Authors: Jonas Glatthard
Abstract: Typically, the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem increases until it plateaus at the thermal value. Under some circumstances, however, the intermediate value can dwarf the final value, even if the subsystem starts in a pure state. A famous example in the context of the black hole information paradox is the entropy of the Hawking radiation, where this behaviour is dubbed the Page curve. More generally, this is the case for excited systems weakly coupled to cold reservoirs. Here we study the entropy dynamics for Lindbladian evolution, i.e. open quantum systems in weak contact with Markovian reservoirs. This allows us to study the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the subsystem entropy decrease and link it to Landauer's principle: the entropy decrease must be accompanied by a heat flow out of the system. We give an analytic expression of the entanglement dynamics for a decaying excitation in a two-level system and study it under equilibration of a localised oscillator. In both cases the Page time occurs when half the initial energy has left the system.

Title: SeQUeNCe GUI: An Extensible User Interface for Discrete Event Quantum Network Simulations
Authors: Alexander Kiefer
Abstract: With recent advances in the fields of quantum information theory [J. Pablo. Nature 12, 2172 (2021)] and the approach of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) [J. Preskill. Quantum 2, 79 (2018)] computing era, it is necessary to provide tools for experimentation and prototyping that are able to keep pace with the rapidly progressing field of quantum computing. SeQUeNCe, an open source simulator of quantum network communication, aims to provide scalability and extensibility for the simulation of quantum networks, from the hardware level to the application and protocol level. In order to improve upon the usability of this software, we implement a graphical user interface which maintains the core principles of SeQUeNCe, scalability and extensibility, while enhancing the software's portability and ease of use. We demonstrate the capabilities of the graphical user interface through the construction of the existing Chicago metropolitan quantum network topology.

Title: High-frequency readout free from transmon multi-excitation resonances
Authors: Pavel D. Kurilovich, Thomas Connolly, Charlotte G. L. Bøttcher, Daniel K. Weiss, Sumeru Hazra, Vidul R. Joshi, Andy Z. Ding, Heekun Nho, Spencer Diamond, Vladislav D. Kurilovich, Wei Dai, Valla Fatemi, Luigi Frunzio, Leonid I. Glazman, Michel H. Devoret
Abstract: Quantum computation will rely on quantum error correction to counteract decoherence. Successfully implementing an error correction protocol requires the fidelity of qubit operations to be well-above error correction thresholds. In superconducting quantum computers, measurement of the qubit state remains the lowest-fidelity operation. For the transmon, a prototypical superconducting qubit, measurement is carried out by scattering a microwave tone off the qubit. Conventionally, the frequency of this tone is of the same order as the transmon frequency. The measurement fidelity in this approach is limited by multi-excitation resonances in the transmon spectrum which are activated at high readout power. These resonances excite the qubit outside of the computational basis, violating the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement. Here, we find that strongly detuning the readout frequency from that of the transmon exponentially suppresses the strength of spurious multi-excitation resonances. By increasing the readout frequency up to twelve times the transmon frequency, we achieve a quantum non-demolition measurement fidelity of 99.93% with a residual probability of leakage to non-computational states of only 0.02%.

Title: More resourceful states improve quantum channel discrimination
Authors: Kenji Nakahira
Abstract: One of the key issues in quantum discrimination problems is understanding the extent of the advantages in discrimination performance when using resource states compared to resourceless states. We show that in any resource theory of states, which may not be convex, the extent to which the maximum average success probability can be improved in quantum channel discrimination problems without using auxiliary systems can be precisely quantified by the robustness measure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robustness measure can also quantify the improvement in channel discrimination problems that use auxiliary systems. Using these findings, resources can be fully characterized to achieve higher success probabilities than any state without the given resource in channel discrimination problems.

Title: Observation of non-Markovian Radiative Phenomena in Structured Photonic Lattices
Authors: Rodrigo A. Vicencio, Fabiola G.L. Carcamo-Macaya, Pablo Solano
Abstract: The spectral structure of a photonic reservoir shapes radiation phenomena for embedded quantum emitters. We implement an all-optical analogue to study such an effect, particularly to observe the non-Markovian radiation dynamics of an emitter coupled to two-dimensional structured reservoirs. Its dynamics is simulated by light propagating through a photonic lattice, acting as a reservoir for an adjacent waveguide that mimics a coupled quantum emitter. We study radiation dynamics in square and Lieb lattices under different coupling regimes and observe how the flat band properties of the Lieb lattice significantly enhances light-matter coupling and non-Markovianity. Our platform opens a path for the experimental exploration of single photon quantum optical phenomena in structured reservoirs to enhance light-matter interactions.

Title: Diatomic and Polyatomic Heteronuclear Ultralong-Range Rydberg Molecules
Authors: Qing Li, Shi-Yao Shao, Li-Hua Zhang, Bang Liu, Zheng-Yuan Zhang, Jun Zhang, Qi-Feng Wang, Han-Chao Chen, Yu Ma, Tian-Yu Han, Dong-Sheng Ding, Bao-Sen Shi
Abstract: Ultra-long-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) have attracted significant interest due to their unique electronic properties and potential applications in quantum technologies. We theoretically investigate the formation and characteristics of heteronuclear ULRMs, focusing on Rb-Cs systems. We explore the vibrational energy levels of heteronuclear nD ULRMs and compare them with homonuclear counterparts. We also predict the formation of polyatomic heteronuclear ULRMs, discussing how the binding energy and spectral features evolve as the number of ground-state atoms increases. Our theoretical predictions are presented in terms of molecular spectra and provide insight into the formation dynamics of these systems. The study further explores the potential applications of heteronuclear ULRMs in quantum information processing, quantum simulation, and precision measurements, offering new avenues for future research in many-body physics and quantum technologies.

Title: Variational method for $\mathbb{Z}_K$ wavefunctions in spin-$J$ PXP model
Authors: Zhigang Hu, Biao Wu
Abstract: We investigate the approach of time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) for the one-dimensional spin-$J$ PXP model with detuning, which is relevant for programmable Rydberg atom arrays. The variational manifold is chosen as the minimally entangled $\mathbb{Z}_K$ matrix-product-states (MPS). We demonstrate that variational dynamics and variational error can be expressed as rapidly convergent series in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, for $J=1/2$ and the limiting case $J\rightarrow \infty$, the TDVP results become exact and significantly simplified.

Title: General detectability measure
Authors: Masahito Hayashi
Abstract: Distinguishing resource states from resource-free states is a fundamental task in quantum information. We have approached the state detection problem through a hypothesis testing framework, with the alternative hypothesis set comprising resource-free states in a general context. Consequently, we derived the optimal exponential decay rate of the failure probability for detecting a given $n$-tensor product state when the resource-free states are separable states, positive partial transpose (PPT) states, or the convex hull of the set of stabilizer states. This optimal exponential decay rate is determined by the minimum of the reverse relative entropy, indicating that this minimum value serves as the general detectability measure. The key technique of this paper is a quantum version of empirical distribution.

Title: Indefinite causal order strategy nor adaptive strategy does not improve the estimation of group action
Authors: Masahito Hayashi
Abstract: We consider estimation of unknown unitary operation when the set of possible unitary operations is given by a projective unitary representation of a compact group. We show that indefinite causal order strategy nor adaptive strategy does not improve the performance of this estimation when error function satisfies group covariance. That is, the optimal parallel strategy gives the optimal performance even under indefinite causal order strategy and adaptive strategy.

Title: Creation and manipulation of Schr\"odinger cat states based on semiclassical predictions
Authors: N. G. Veselkova, Roman Goncharov, Alexei D. Kiselev
Abstract: We consider the generation of Schrödinger cat states using a quantum measurement-induced logical gate where entanglement between the input state of the target oscillator and the Fock state of the ancillary system produced by the quantum non-demolition entangling $C_Z$ operation is combined with the homodyne measurement. We utilize the semiclassical approach to construct both the input-output mapping of the field variables in the phase space and the wave function of the output state. This approach is found to predict that the state at the gate output is represented by a minimum disturbed cat-like state which is a superposition of two initial state copies symmetrically displaced by momentum variable. For the target oscillator prepared in the coherent state, we show that the fidelity between the exact solution for the gate output state and the "perfect" Schrödinger cat reconstructed from the semiclassical theory can reach high values exceeding 0.99.

Title: Pretty-good simulation of all quantum measurements by projective measurements
Authors: Michał Kotowski, Michał Oszmaniec
Abstract: In quantum theory general measurements are described by so-called Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs). We show that in $d$-dimensional quantum systems an application of depolarizing noise with constant (independent of $d$) visibility parameter makes any POVM simulable by a randomized implementation of projective measurements that do not require any auxiliary systems to be realized. This result significantly limits the asymptotic advantage that POVMs can offer over projective measurements in various information-processing tasks, including state discrimination, shadow tomography or quantum metrology. We also apply our findings to questions originating from quantum foundations by asymptotically improving the range of visibilities for which noisy pure states of two qudits admit a local model for generalized measurements. As a byproduct, we give asymptotically tight (in terms of dimension) bounds on critical visibility for which all POVMs are jointly measurable. On the technical side we use recent advances in POVM simulation, the solution to the celebrated Kadison-Singer problem, and a method of approximate implementation of nearly projective POVMs by a convex combination of projective measurements, which we call dimension-deficient Naimark theorem. Finally, some of our intermediate results show (on information-theoretic grounds) the existence of circuit-knitting strategies allowing to simulate general $2N$ qubit circuits by randomization of subcircuits operating on $N+1$ qubit systems, with a constant (independent of $N$) probabilistic overhead.

Title: Efficient measure of information backflow with quasi-stochastic process
Authors: Kelvin Onggadinata, Teck Seng Koh
Abstract: Characterization and quantification of non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum systems is a topical issue in the rapidly developing field of quantum computation and quantum communication. A standard approach based on the notion of information backflow detects the flow of information from the environment back to the system. Numerous measures of information backflow have been proposed using different definitions of distinguishability between pairs of quantum states. These measures, however, necessitate optimization over the state space which can be analytically challenging or numerically demanding. Here, we propose an alternative witness and measure of information backflow that is explicitly state-independent by utilizing the concept of quasiprobability representation and recent advances in the theory of majorization for quasiprobabilities. We illustrate its use over several paradigmatic examples, demonstrating consistent Markovian conditions with known results and also reported necessary and sufficient condition for qutrit system in random unitary channel. The paper concludes with discussions on the foundational implications of quantum dynamical evolution.

Title: Quantum algorithm for the gradient of a logarithm-determinant
Authors: Thomas E. Baker, Jaimie Greasley
Abstract: The logarithm-determinant is a common quantity in many areas of physics and computer science. Derivatives of the logarithm-determinant compute physically relevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as well as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum gradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the logarithm-determinant. From this, the inverse of a sparse-rank input operator may be determined efficiently. Measuring an expectation value of the quantum state--instead of all $N^2$ elements of the input operator--can be accomplished in $O(k\sigma)$ time in the idealized case for $k$ relevant eigenvectors of the input matrix. A factor $\sigma=\frac1{\varepsilon^3}$ or $-\frac1{\varepsilon^2}\log_2\varepsilon$ depends on the version of the quantum Fourier transform used for a precision $\varepsilon$. Practical implementation of the required operator will likely need $\log_2N$ overhead, giving an overall complexity of $O(k\sigma\log_2 N)$. The method applies widely and converges super-linearly in $k$ when the condition number is high. For non-sparse-rank inputs, the algorithm can be evaluated provided that an equal superposition of eigenstates is provided. The output is given in $O(1)$ queries of oracle, which is given explicitly here and only relies on time-evolution operators that can be implemented with arbitrarily small error. The algorithm is envisioned for fully error-corrected quantum computers but may be implementable on near-term machines. We discuss how this algorithm can be used for kernel-based quantum machine-learning.

Title: Chiral Dissociation of Bound Photon Pairs for a Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Jiaming Shi, Alexander N. Poddubny
Abstract: We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.

Title: From tomography of conditional states to tomography of states that never existed
Authors: Julian Göttsch, Stephan Grebien, Felix Pein, Malte Lautzas, Daniela Abdelkhalek, Lorena Rebón, Boris Hage, Jaromír Fiurašek, Roman Schnabel
Abstract: Microscopic Schr{ö}dinger cat states with photon numbers of the order of one are produced from stationary quantum-correlated fields exploiting a probabilistic heralding photon-subtraction event. The subsequent quantum state tomography provides the complete information about the state. Another approach targets measurement results on states with a significantly larger number of quantum-correlated photons by conditioning the analysis on measurement results with exactly this number of photons. Here, we present a new approach to derive measurement data of quantum correlated states with average quantum-correlated photon numbers significantly larger than one. We produce an ensemble of a heralded, photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state of light. We split the states at a balanced beam splitter and simultaneously measure a pair of orthogonal field quadratures at the outputs using tomographic `Q-function homodyne detection' (QHD). The final act is probabilistic two-copy data post-processing aiming for data from a new state with larger photon number. Evaluating the final tomographic data as that of a grown microscopic Schr{ö}dinger cat state shows that the probabilistic post-processing increased the photon number of $|\alpha_0|^2 \approx 1.2$ to $|\alpha_2|^2 \approx 6.8$. Our concept for obtaining tomographic measurement data of mesoscopic non-classical states that never existed might be a turning point in measurement-based quantum technology.

Abstract: It is shown how state-of-the-art attosecond photoionization experiments can test Born's rule -- a postulate of quantum mechanics -- via the so-called Sorkin test. A simulation of the Sorkin test under consideration of typical experimental noise and data acquisition efficiencies infers an achievable measurement precision in the range of the best Sorkin tests to date.

Title: Non-reciprocical Scattering in a Microwave Frequency Comb
Authors: Christoph L. Bock, J. C. Rivera Hernández, Fabio Lingua, David B. Haviland
Abstract: We investigate non-reciprocal scattering within the modes of a microwave frequency comb. Adjusting the pump frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of a Josephson parametric oscillator, we control constructive interference for the $m \longrightarrow \ell$ scattering processes, while concurrently achieving destructive interference for the inverse process $\ell \longrightarrow m$. We outline the methodology for realizing non-reciprocity in the context of two-mode isolation and a three-mode circulation, which we extend to multiple modes. We find good agreement between the experiments and a linearized theoretical model. Nonreciprocal scattering expands the toolset for parametric control, with the potential to engineer novel quantum correlations.

Authors: Sahil Tomar, Rajeshwar Tripathi, Sandeep Kumar
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning represents a paradigm shift at the intersection of Quantum Computing and Machine Learning, leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum parallelism to address the limitations of classical approaches in processing high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of Quantum Machine Learning, detailing foundational concepts, algorithmic advancements, and their applications across domains such as healthcare, finance, and quantum chemistry. Key techniques, including Quantum Support Vector Machine, Quantum Neural Network, Quantum Decision Trees, and hybrid quantum-classical models, are explored with a focus on their theoretical foundations, computational benefits, and comparative performance against classical counterparts. While the potential for exponential speedups and enhanced efficiency is evident, the field faces significant challenges, including hardware constraints, noise, and limited qubit coherence in the current era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. Emerging solutions, such as error mitigation techniques, hybrid frameworks, and advancements in quantum hardware, are discussed as critical enablers for scalable and fault-tolerant Quantum Machine Learning systems. By synthesizing state-of-the-art developments and identifying research gaps, this survey aims to provide a foundational resource for advancing Quantum Machine Learning toward practical, real-world applications in tackling computationally intensive problems.

Title: Strong and Noise-Tolerant Entanglement in Dissipative Optomechanics
Authors: Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong, Dong Wang, Liu Ye
Abstract: Macroscopic entanglement, as critical quantum resources in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in optomechanical systems with purely dispersive coupling over the past decades. However, quantum entanglement, induced by purely dissipative coupling, remains unexplored. In this work, we study quantum entanglement in a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer, where the dispersive and the dissipative coupling can be arbitrarily switched on and off. With current experimental parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power with the purely dispersive (dissipative) coupling. Further, we find that quantum entanglement generated by purely dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more noise-tolerant than that generated by purely dispersive coupling. When both couplings coexist, entanglement is weakened due to interference. Our findings provide a promising path to engineer strong and noise-tolerant quantum entanglement in purely dissipative quantum systems.

Title: Unifying quantum stochastic methods using Wick's theorem on the Keldysh contour
Authors: Vasco Cavina, Antonio D'Abbruzzo, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: We present a new method based on the Keldysh formalism to derive stochastic master equations for the non-Markovian evolution of a quantum system coupled to a Gaussian environment. Using this approach, we develop a compact expression for the propagator of the system's dynamics, naturally formulated on the Keldysh contour. This expression is shown to be equivalent to other formulations, such as the stochastic von Neumann equation (SVNE). A key advantage of our method is its flexibility, as it can be easily adapted to account for initial system-bath correlations, and its simplicity, as it does not rely on path integration techniques or superoperator representations, unlike previous approaches. The insight offered by our technique allows us to make some considerations on the nature of the noises appearing in the SVNE. We prove that the solution of the SVNE can be written in terms of a single physical noise without loss of information. We then envision a semiclassical scenario in which such noise can be interpreted in terms of an initial measurement process on the environment.

Title: Performance Analysis for Crosstalk Errors between Parallel Entangling Gates in Trapped Ion Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Fangxuan Liu, Gaoxiang Tang, Luming Duan, Yukai Wu
Abstract: The ability to execute a large number of quantum gates in parallel is a fundamental requirement for quantum error correction, allowing an error threshold to exist under the finite coherence time of physical qubits. Recently, two-dimensional ion crystals have been demonstrated as a plausible approach to scale up the qubit number in a trapped ion quantum computer. However, although the long-range Coulomb interaction between the ions enables their strong connectivity, it also complicates the design of parallel gates and leads to intrinsic crosstalk errors. Here we examine the effects of crosstalk errors on a rotated surface code. We show that, instead of the distance-3 code considered in previous works, a distance-5 code is necessary to correct the two-qubit crosstalk error. We numerically calculate the logical error rates and coherence times under various crosstalk errors, gate infidelities and coherence times of the physical qubits, and we optimize the parallelism level according to the competition between different error sources. We show that a break-even point can be reached under realistic parameters. We further analyze the spatial dependence of the crosstalk, and discuss the scaling of the logical error rate versus the code distance for the long-term goal of a logical error rate below $10^{-10}$.

Title: Threshold Quantum Secret Sharing
Authors: Kartick Sutradhar
Abstract: One crucial and basic method for disclosing a secret to every participant in quantum cryptography is quantum secret sharing. Numerous intricate protocols, including secure multiparty summation, multiplication, sorting, voting, and more, can be designed with it. A quantum secret sharing protocol with a $(t,n)$ threshold approach and modulo d, where t and n represent the threshold number of participants and the total number of participants, respectively was recently discussed by Song et al. Kao et al. notes that without the information of other participants, the secret in Song {\em et al.'s}protocol cannot be reconstructed. We address a protocol that solves this issue in this paper.

Title: Quantum Diffie-Hellman key exchange
Authors: Georgios M. Nikolopoulos
Abstract: The Diffie-Hellman key exchange plays a crucial role in conventional cryptography, as it allows two legitimate users to establish a common, usually ephemeral, secret key. Its security relies on the discrete-logarithm problem, which is considered to be a mathematical one-way function, while the final key is formed by random independent actions of the two users. In the present work we investigate the extension of Diffie-Hellman key exchange to the quantum setting, where the two legitimate users exchange independent random quantum states. The proposed protocol relies on the bijective mapping of integers onto a set of symmetric coherent states, and we investigate the regime of parameters for which the map behaves as a quantum one-way function. Its security is analyzed in the framework of minimum-error-discrimination and photon-number-splitting attacks, while its performance and the challenges in a possible realization are also discussed.

Title: Adaptive-depth randomized measurement for fermionic observables
Authors: Kaiming Bian, Bujiao Wu
Abstract: Accurate estimation of fermionic observables is essential for advancing quantum physics and chemistry. The fermionic classical shadow (FCS) method offers an efficient framework for estimating these observables without requiring a transformation into a Pauli basis. However, the random matchgate circuits in FCS require polynomial-depth circuits with a brickwork structure, which presents significant challenges for near-term quantum devices with limited computational resources. To address this limitation, we introduce an adaptive-depth fermionic classical shadow (ADFCS) protocol designed to reduce the circuit depth while maintaining the estimation accuracy and the order of sample complexity. Through theoretical analysis and numerical fitting, we establish that the required depth for approximating a fermionic observable $H$ scales as $\max\{d^2_{\text{int}}(H)/\log n, d_{\text{int}}(H)\}$ where $d_{\text{int}}$ is the interaction distance of $H$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the ADFCS protocol through numerical experiments, which show similar accuracy to the traditional FCS method while requiring significantly fewer resources. Additionally, we apply ADFCS to compute the expectation value of the Kitaev chain Hamiltonian, further validating its performance in practical scenarios. Our findings suggest that ADFCS can enable more efficient quantum simulations, reducing circuit depth while preserving the fidelity of quantum state estimations, offering a viable solution for near-term quantum devices.

Title: Elucidating the Physical and Mathematical Properties of the Prouhet-Thue-Morse Sequence in Quantum Computing
Authors: Denis Janković, Rémi Pasquier, Jean-Gabriel Hartmann, Paul-Antoine Hervieux
Abstract: This study explores the applications of the Prouhet-Thue-Morse (PTM) sequence in quantum computing, highlighting its mathematical elegance and practical relevance. We demonstrate the critical role of the PTM sequence in quantum error correction, in noise-resistant quantum memories, and in providing insights into quantum chaos. Notably, we demonstrate how the PTM sequence naturally appears in Ising X-X interacting systems, leading to a proposed robust encoding of quantum memories in such systems. Furthermore, connections to number theory, including the Riemann zeta function, bridge quantum computing with pure mathematics. Our findings emphasize the PTM sequence's importance in understanding the mathematical structure of quantum computing systems and the development of the full potential of quantum technologies and invite further interdisciplinary research.

Title: Optimizing hypergraph product codes with random walks, simulated annealing and reinforcement learning
Authors: Bruno C. A. Freire, Nicolas Delfosse, Anthony Leverrier
Abstract: Hypergraph products are quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed from two classical LDPC codes. Although their dimension and distance depend only on the parameters of the underlying classical codes, optimizing their performance against various noise channels remains challenging. This difficulty partly stems from the complexity of decoding in the quantum setting. The standard, ad hoc approach typically involves selecting classical LDPC codes with large girth. In this work, we focus on optimizing performance against the quantum erasure channel. A key advantage of this channel is the existence of an efficient maximum-likelihood decoder, which enables us to employ optimization techniques based on sampling random codes, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Our results indicate that these techniques improve performance relative to the state-of-the-art.

Title: Thermodynamics of coherent energy exchanges between lasers and two-level systems
Authors: Ariane Soret, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: We study the quantum thermodynamics of a coherent macroscopic electromagnetic field (laser) coupled to a two-level system (qubit) near resonance, from weak to strong driving regimes. This combined system is, in turn, weakly coupled to a thermal radiation field, and can be described by an autonomous quantum master equation. We show that the laser acts as an autonomous work source and that, in the macroscopic limit, the work produced is independent of the phase of the laser. Using the dressed qubit approach, we show that the variation of energy in the laser is not the work transferred to the dressed qubit, which is instead obtained from the ''dressed laser'' -- a coherent superposition of the laser and the qubit. Using a two-point measurement technique with counting fields, we obtain the full counting statistics for the work of the laser and dressed laser, and show that they satisfy Crooks fluctuation theorems. We then use these theorems as criteria to investigate the thermodynamic consistency of quantum master equations, first in the autonomous setup for the combined system, then in the non-autonomous setup where the coherent field is eliminated and effectively described by a time dependent external field. Treating the laser as an external field in known to yield expressions for the work which are in contradiction with quantum thermodynamics predictions in the strong drive regime. We show that these inconsistencies stem from a confusion between the laser and dressed laser, and show how to correct them. We also derive a new master equation, thermodynamically consistent at all driving regimes, from which the Bloch and Floquet master equations can be obtained using additional approximations (of which we also examine the consistency).

Abstract: Quantum contextuality plays a significant role in supporting quantum computation and quantum information theory. The key tools for this are the Kochen--Specker and non-Kochen--Specker contextual sets. Traditionally, their representation has been predominantly operator-based, mainly focusing on specific constructs in dimensions ranging from three to eight. However, nearly all of these constructs can be represented as low-dimensional hypergraphs. This study demonstrates how to generate contextual hypergraphs in any dimension using various methods, particularly those that do not scale in complexity with increasing dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce innovative examples of hypergraphs extending to dimension 32. Our methodology reveals the intricate structural properties of hypergraphs, enabling precise quantifications of contextuality of implemented sets. Additionally, we investigate several promising applications of hypergraphs in quantum communication and quantum computation, paving the way for future breakthroughs in the field.

Title: A symmetry-protected topological optical lattice clock
Authors: Tianrui Xu, Anjun Chu, Kyungtae Kim, James K. Thompson, Jun Ye, Tilman Esslinger, Ana Maria Rey
Abstract: We theoretically propose a tunable implementation of symmetry-protected topological phases in a synthetic superlattice, taking advantage of the long coherence time and exquisite spectral resolutions offered by gravity-tilted optical lattice clocks. We describe a protocol similar to Rabi spectroscopy that can be used to probe the distinct topological properties of our system. We then demonstrate how the sensitivity of clocks and interferometers can be improved by the topological robustness to unwanted experimental imperfections. The proposed implementation opens a path to exploit the unique opportunities offered by symmetry-protected topological phases in state-of-the-art quantum sensors.

Title: Incorporating Quantum Advantage in Quantum Circuit Generation through Genetic Programming
Authors: Christoph Stein, Michael Färber
Abstract: Designing efficient quantum circuits that leverage quantum advantage compared to classical computing has become increasingly critical. Genetic algorithms have shown potential in generating such circuits through artificial evolution. However, integrating quantum advantage into the fitness function of these algorithms remains unexplored. In this paper, we aim to enhance the efficiency of quantum circuit design by proposing two novel approaches for incorporating quantum advantage metrics into the fitness function of genetic algorithms.1 We evaluate our approaches based on the Bernstein-Vazirani Problem and the Unstructured Database Search Problem as test cases. The results demonstrate that our approaches not only improve the convergence speed of the genetic algorithm but also produce circuits comparable to expert-designed solutions. Our findings suggest that automated quantum circuit design using genetic algorithms that incorporate a measure of quantum advantage is a promising approach to accelerating the development of quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. It has long been viewed as a promising application for quantum computers. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Quantum diagonalization algorithms based on subspaces represent alternatives to phase estimation, which are feasible for pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then show numerical investigations of lattice Hamiltonians, which indicate that our method can outperform existing Krylov quantum diagonalization in the presence of shot noise, making our approach well-suited for near-term quantum devices. Finally, we carry out the largest ground-state quantum simulation of the single-impurity Anderson model on a system with $41$ bath sites, using $85$ qubits and up to $6 \cdot 10^3$ two-qubit gates on a Heron quantum processor, showing excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group calculations.

Title: Belavkin-Staszewski Quantum Markov Chains
Authors: Andreas Bluhm, Ángela Capel, Pablo Costa Rico, Anna Jenčová
Abstract: It is well-known that the conditional mutual information of a quantum state is zero if, and only if, the quantum state is a quantum Markov chain. Replacing the Umegaki relative entropy in the definition of the conditional mutual information by the Belavkin-Staszewski (BS) relative entropy, we obtain the BS-conditional mutual information, and we call the states with zero BS-conditional mutual information Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains. In this article, we establish a correspondence which relates quantum Markov chains and BS-quantum Markov chains. This correspondence allows us to find a recovery map for the BS-relative entropy in the spirit of the Petz recovery map. Moreover, we prove a structural decomposition of the Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains and also study states for which the BS-conditional mutual information is only approximately zero. As an application, we show that the conditional mutual information of the state associated to the Gibbs state of a quantum spin chain with local, finite-range, translation-invariant interactions at any positive temperature via this new correspondence decays superexponentially fast with the size of the middle system.

Title: Converse bounds for quantum hypothesis exclusion: A divergence-radius approach
Authors: Kaiyuan Ji, Hemant K. Mishra, Milán Mosonyi, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Hypothesis exclusion is an information-theoretic task in which an experimenter aims at ruling out a false hypothesis from a finite set of known candidates, and an error occurs if and only if the hypothesis being ruled out is the ground truth. For the tasks of quantum state exclusion and quantum channel exclusion -- where hypotheses are represented by quantum states and quantum channels, respectively -- efficiently computable upper bounds on the asymptotic error exponents were established in a recent work of the current authors [Ji et al., arXiv:2407.13728 (2024)], where the derivation was based on nonasymptotic analysis. In this companion paper of our previous work, we provide alternative proofs for the same upper bounds on the asymptotic error exponents of quantum state and channel exclusion, but using a conceptually different approach from the one adopted in the previous work. Specifically, we apply strong converse results for asymmetric binary hypothesis testing to distinguishing an arbitrary ``dummy'' hypothesis from each of the concerned candidates. This leads to the desired upper bounds in terms of divergence radii via a geometrically inspired argument.

Title: Coming full circle - A unified framework for Kochen-Specker contextuality
Authors: Markus Frembs
Abstract: Contextuality is a key distinguishing feature between classical and quantum physics. It expresses a fundamental obstruction to describing quantum theory using classical concepts. In turn, when understood as a resource for quantum computation, it is expected to hold the key to quantum advantage. Yet, despite its long recognised importance in quantum foundations and, more recently, in quantum computation, the mathematics of contextuality has remained somewhat elusive - different frameworks address different aspects of the phenomenon, yet their precise relationship often is unclear. In fact, there is a glaring discrepancy already between the original notion of contextuality introduced by Kochen and Specker on the one side [J. Math. Mech., 17, 59, (1967)], and the modern approach of studying contextual correlations on the other [Rev. Mod. Phys., 94, 045007 (2022)]. In a companion paper [arXiv:2408.16764], we introduce the conceptually new tool called ``context connections'', which allows to cast and analyse Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality in new form. Here, we generalise this notion, and based on it prove a complete characterisation of KS contextuality for finite-dimensional systems. To this end, we develop the framework of ``observable algebras". We show in detail how this framework subsumes the marginal and graph-theoretic approaches to contextuality, and thus that it offers a unified perspective on KS contextuality. In particular, we establish the precise relationships between the various notions of ``contextuality" used in the respective settings, and in doing so, generalise a number of results on the characterisation of the respective notions in the literature.

Title: Pseudo-real quantum fields
Authors: Maxim N. Chernodub, Peter Millington, Esra Sablevice
Abstract: We introduce the concept of pseudo-reality for complex numbers. We show that this concept, applied to quantum fields, provides a unifying framework for two distinct approaches to pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories. The first approach stems from analytically continuing Hermitian theories into the complex plane, while the second is based on constructing them from first principles. The pseudo-reality condition for bosonic fields resolves a long-standing problem with the formulation of gauge theories involving pseudo-Hermitian currents, sheds new light on the resolution of the so-called Hermiticity Puzzle, and leads to a consistent minimal coupling of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories to gravity. These results contribute significantly to the ongoing development of the first-principles construction of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, including their formulation in curved spacetimes.

Title: Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal
Authors: Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.

Title: From Complexification to Self-Similarity: New Aspects of Quantum Criticality
Authors: Yang Liu, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are a fascinating area of condensed matter physics. The extension through complexification not only broadens the scope of this field but also offers a new framework for understanding criticality and its statistical implications. This mini review provides a concise overview of recent developments in complexification, primarily covering finite temperature and equilibrium quantum phase transitions, as well as their connection with dynamical quantum phase transitions and non-Hermitian physics, with a particular focus on the significance of Fisher zeros. Starting from the newly discovered self-similarity phenomenon associated with complex partition functions, we further discuss research on self-similar systems briefly. Finally, we offer a perspective on these aspects.

Title: Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros
Authors: Yuchen Meng, Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e. the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the survival amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate another scenario of ergodicity breaking, where lines of Fisher zeros repeatedly intersect the imaginary $\beta$ axis. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of easily spotting the emergence of scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.

Title: The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi ``Gravity from entropy" (2024) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.

Title: Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids
Authors: Tong Liu, Ying-Hai Wu, Hong-Hao Tu, Tao Xiang
Abstract: We employ the SU(n)_k Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. It is unveiled that these wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the SU(3)_k series are derived. The SU(3)_k chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the k = 2 member hosts Fibonacci anyons.

Title: Surface Plasmon-Enhanced X-ray Ultraviolet Nonlinear Interactions
Authors: H. Aknin, O. Sefi, D. Borodin, J.-P. Rueff, J. M. Ablett, S. Shwartz
Abstract: X ray matter interactions are intrinsically weak, and the high energy and momentum of X rays pose significant challenges to applying strong light matter coupling techniques that are highly effective at longer wavelengths for controlling and manipulating radiation. Techniques such as enhanced coupling between light and electrons at a metal dielectric interface or within nanostructures, as well as the Purcell effect where spontaneous emission is amplified near a metallic surface are not applicable to X rays due to their fundamentally different energy and momentum scales. Here we present a novel approach for coupling X rays to surface plasmon polaritons by entangling X ray photons with SPPs in the ultraviolet range through X ray to UV spontaneous parametric down conversion in aluminum. The distinct characteristics of the SPPs are imprinted onto the angular and energy dependence of the detected X ray photons, as demonstrated in this work. Our results highlight the potential to control X rays using SPPs, unlocking exciting opportunities to enhance X ray matter interactions and explore plasmonic phenomena with atomic scale resolution a capability uniquely enabled by X rays.

Title: Fabrication of Mode-Matched, Low-Loss Optical Resonators by Combination of FIB-Milling and CO$_2$ Laser Ablation
Authors: Patrick Maier, Simon Rupp, Niklas Lettner, Johannes Hecker Denschlag, Alexander Kubanek
Abstract: Fabry-Perot cavities are essential tools for applications like precision metrology, optomechanics and quantum technologies. A major challenge is the creation of microscopic spherical mirror structures which allow the precise matching with the wavefront of a Gaussian beam, while providing high surface quality. We present a novel fabrication technique, enabling the creation of customized microscopic Gaussian mode matched cavity mirror structures over a wide range of geometrical parameters, by combining focused ion beam milling (FIB) and CO$_2$ laser ablation. While FIB milling allows us to imprint features on the mirror substrate with a resolution on the nanometer scale, the application of defocused CO$_2$ laser pulses consistently reduces remaining surface deformations down to a roughness of $\sigma_\text{RMS}=0.2\,$nm. The average deviation of the profile from an ideal spherical shape is kept below a few nanometres. This technique enables the customized and repeatable fabrication of low loss optics on a wide range of optical substrates, including optical fibres. Thus, mode-matched Fabry-Perot cavities can be fabricated with pre-defined modal volume, high finesse and tailored ellipticity. Since the structural shape of the mirror is created by FIB milling, its pixel-by-pixel nature of the writing process can be used to create arbitrary structures with a resolution given by the FIB milling. At the same time, the surface quality is given by the CO$_2$ laser ablation processes, without degrading the FIB milled shape.

Title: A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation
Authors: Paul-Louis Etienney, Rémi Robin, Pierre Rouchon
Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution. In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.

Title: High-accuracy multi-ion spectroscopy with mixed-species Coulomb crystals

Abstract: Multi-ion optical clocks offer the possibility of overcoming the low signal-to-noise ratio of single-ion clocks, while still providing low systematic uncertainties. We present simultaneous spectroscopy of up to four ${}^{115}$In${}^+$ clock ions in a linear Coulomb crystal, sympathetically cooled with ${}^{172}$Yb${}^+$ ions. In first clock comparisons, we see agreement below $1\times10^{-17}$ with results obtained using a single In${}^+$ ion, for which we have evaluated the systematic uncertainty to be $2.5\times10^{-18}$. Operation with four clock ions reduces the instability from $1.6\times10^{-15}/\sqrt{t/(1\;\mathrm{s})}$ to $9.2\times10^{-16}/\sqrt{t/(1\;\mathrm{s})}$. We derive a model for decay-related dead time during state preparation, which matches the observed scaling of instability with clock ion number $N$, and indicates that $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling can be achieved with the addition of a repump laser.

Title: Approaching optimal microwave-acoustic transduction on lithium niobate using SQUID arrays
Authors: A. Hugot, Q. Greffe, G. Julie, E. Eyraud, F. Balestro, J. J. Viennot
Abstract: Electronic devices exploiting acoustic vibrations are ubiquitous in classical and quantum technologies. Central to these devices is the transducer, which enables the exchange of signals between electrical and acoustic networks. Among the various transduction mechanisms, piezoelectricity remains the most widely used. However, conventional piezoelectric transducers are limited to either small efficiencies or narrow bandwidths and they typically operate at fixed frequency. These limitations restrict their utility in many applications. Here we propose and demonstrate a robust strategy to realize piezoelectric microwave-acoustic transduction close to the maximal efficiency-bandwidth product of lithium niobate. We use SQUID arrays to transform the large complex impedance of wide-band interdigital transducers into 50 $\Omega$ and demonstrate unprecedented efficiency$\times$bandwidth $\approx$ 440 MHz, with a maximum efficiency of 62% at 5.7 GHz. Moreover, leveraging the flux dependence of SQUIDs, we realize transducers with in-situ tunability across nearly an octave around 5.5 GHz. Our transducer can be readily connected to other superconducting quantum devices, with applications in microwave-to-optics conversion schemes, quantum-limited phonon detection, or acoustic spectroscopy in the 4-8 GHz band.

Title: Unitary Expressions: A Necessary Abstraction for Extensible Quantum Programming Languages and Systems
Authors: Ed Younis
Abstract: Quantum gates are the fundamental instructions of digital quantum computers. Current programming languages, systems, and software development toolkits identify these operational gates by their titles, which requires a shared understanding of their meanings. However, in the continuously developing software ecosystem surrounding quantum computing -- spanning high-level programming systems to low-level control stacks -- this identification process is often error-prone, challenging to debug, maintenance-heavy, and resistant to change. In this paper, we propose replacing this nominal gate representation with a functional one. We introduce the OpenQudit system for describing, parsing, optimizing, analyzing, and utilizing programs comprising gates described as symbolic unitary expressions. As part of this effort, we design the Qudit Gate Language (QGL), a unitary-specific expression language, and implement a differentiating just-in-time compiler in OpenQudit towards embedding this language in quantum programming languages and systems. Additionally, we have precisely designed and implemented the Qudit Virtual Machine (QVM) to evaluate quantum programs and their gradients efficiently. This evaluation is performed millions of times during the compilation of quantum programs. Our QVM can compute gradients approximately ten times faster than current leading numerical quantum compilation frameworks in the most common use cases. Altogether, the OpenQudit system is envisioned to (1) support many-level or qudit-based quantum systems, (2) enable the safe composition of program transformation tools, (3) accelerate circuit optimizers and transpilers, (4) enable compiler extensibility, and (5) provide a productive, simple-to-use interface to quantum practitioners.

Title: A Simplification Method for Inequality Constraints in Integer Binary Encoding HOBO Formulations
Authors: Yuichiro Minato
Abstract: This study proposes a novel method for simplifying inequality constraints in Higher-Order Bi- nary Optimization (HOBO) formulations. The proposed method addresses challenges associated with Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, specifically the increased computational complexity and reduced solution accuracy caused by the introduction of slack vari- ables and the resulting growth in auxiliary qubits. By efficiently integrating constraints, the method enhances the computational efficiency and accuracy of both quantum and classical solvers. The ef- fectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments applied to combinatorial optimization problems. The results indicate that this method expands the applicabil- ity of quantum algorithms to high-dimensional problems and improves the practicality of classical optimization solvers for optimization problems involving inequality constraints.

Title: Finite-time Unruh effect: Waiting for the transient effects to fade off
Authors: D. Jaffino Stargen
Abstract: We investigate the transition probability rate of a Unruh-DeWitt (UD) detector interacting with massless scalar field for a finite duration of proper time, $T$, of the detector. For a UD detector moving at a uniform acceleration, $a$, we explicitly show that the finite-time transition probability rate can be written as a sum of purely thermal terms, and non-thermal transient terms. While the thermal terms are independent of time, $T$, the non-thermal transient terms depend on $(\Delta ET)$, $(aT)$, and $(\Delta E/a)$, where $\Delta E$ is the energy gap of the detector. Particularly, the non-thermal terms are oscillatory with respect to the variable $(\Delta ET)$, so that they may be averaged out to be insignificant in the limit $\Delta ET \gg 1$, irrespective of the values of $(aT)$ and $(\Delta E/a)$. To quantify the contribution of non-thermal transient terms to the transition probability rate of a uniformly accelerating detector, we introduce a parameter, $\varepsilon_{\rm nt}$, called non-thermal parameter. Demanding the contribution of non-thermal terms in the finite-time transition probability rate to be negligibly small, \ie, $\varepsilon_{\rm nt}=\delta\ll1$, we calculate the thermalization time -- the time required for the detector to interact with the field to arrive at the required non-thermality, $\varepsilon_{\rm nt}=\delta$, and the detector to be (almost) thermalized with the Unruh bath in its comoving frame. Specifically, for small accelerations, $a\ll\Delta E$, we find the thermalization time, $\tau_{\rm th}$, to be $\tau_{\rm th} \sim (\Delta E)^{-1} \times {\rm e}^{2\pi|\Delta E|/a}/\delta$; and for large accelerations, $a\gg \Delta E$, we find the thermalization time to be $\tau_{\rm th} \sim (\Delta E)^{-1}/\delta$. We comment on the possibilities of bringing down the exponentially large thermalization time at small accelerations, $a\ll\Delta E$.

Title: Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion using an integrated barium-titanate transducer
Authors: Charles Möhl, Annina Riedhauser, Max Glantschnig, Daniele Caimi, Ute Drechsler, Antonis Olziersky, Deividas Sabonis, David Indolese, Thomas Karg, Paul Seidler
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical tranduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. Due to the quadratic scaling of transduction efficiency with the electro-optic coefficient, material classes with stronger Pockels effects, such as the perovskite titanates BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, may unlock new performance regimes for future transducers. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response, as well as limited process compatibility. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. Exploiting the bias-induced Pockels effect of BaTiO$_3$, we demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction at millikelvin temperatures and total off-chip efficiencies reaching $1\times10^{-6}$ in pulsed operation. We establish a device concept permitting in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss and tuning of the optical system without sacrificing microwave-optical overlap. Using a fully subtractive process, we fabricate Nb air bridges for crossings of conductors and both air- and oxide-clad optical waveguides. We investigate optically-induced heating through pulsed optical pumping, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept is applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and paves the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.

Title: Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network methods
Authors: Zhong-Bo Kang, Noah Moran, Peter Nguyen, Wenyang Qian
Abstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we propose a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.

Title: Exact Parent Hamiltonians for All Landau Level States in a Half-flux Lattice
Authors: Xin Shen, Guangyue Ji, Jinjie Zhang, David E. Palomino, Bruno Mera, Tomoki Ozawa, Jie Wang
Abstract: Realizing topological flat bands with tailored single-particle Hilbert spaces is a critical step toward exploring many-body phases, such as those featuring anyonic excitations. One prominent example is the Kapit-Mueller model, a variant of the Harper-Hofstadter model that stabilizes lattice analogs of the lowest Landau level states. The Kapit-Mueller model is constructed based on the Poisson summation rule, an exact lattice sum rule for coherent states. In this work, we consider higher Landau-level generalizations of the Poisson summation rule, from which we derive families of parent Hamiltonians on a half-flux lattice which have exact flat bands whose flatband wavefunctions are lattice version of higher Landau level states. Focusing on generic Bravais lattices with only translation and inversion symmetries, we discuss how these symmetries enforced gaplessness and singular points for odd Landau level series, and how to achieve fully gapped parent Hamiltonians by mixing even and odd series. Our model points to a large class of tight-binding models with suitable energetic and quantum geometries that are potentially useful for realizing non-Abelian fractionalized states when interactions are included. The model exhibits fast decay hopping amplitudes, making it potentially realizable with neutral atoms in optical lattices.

Title: Quantum Risk Analysis: Beyond (Conditional) Value-at-Risk
Authors: Christian Laudagé, Ivica Turkalj
Abstract: Risk measures are important key figures to measure the adequacy of the reserves of a company. The most common risk measures in practice are Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). Recently, quantum-based algorithms are introduced to calculate them. These procedures are based on the so-called quantum amplitude estimation algorithm which lead to a quadratic speed up compared to classical Monte-Carlo based methods. Based on these ideas, we construct quantum-based algorithms to calculate alternatives for VaR and CVaR, namely the Expectile Value-at-Risk (EVaR) and the Range Value-at-Risk (RVaR). We construct quantum algorithms to calculate them. These algorithms are based on quantum amplitude estimation. In a case study, we compare their performance with the quantum-based algorithms for VaR and CVaR. We find that all of the algorithms perform sufficiently well on a quantum simulator. Further, the calculations of EVaR and VaR are robust against noise on a real quantum device. This is not the case for CVaR and RVaR.

Title: Quantum dynamics of coupled excitons and phonons in chain-like systems: tensor train approaches and higher-order propagators
Authors: Patrick Gelß, Sebastian Matera, Rupert Klein, Burkhard Schmidt
Abstract: We investigate tensor-train approaches to the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for chain-like quantum systems with on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions only. Using efficient low-rank tensor train representations, we aim at reducing memory consumption and computational costs. As an example, coupled excitons and phonons modeled in terms of Fröhlich-Holstein type Hamiltonians are studied here. By comparing our tensor-train based results with semi-analytical results, we demonstrate the key role of the ranks of the quantum state vectors. Typically, an excellent quality of the solutions is found only when the maximum number of ranks exceeds a certain value. One class of propagation schemes builds on splitting the Hamiltonian into two groups of interleaved nearest-neighbor interactions commutating within each of the groups. In particular, the 4-th order Yoshida-Neri and the 8-th order Kahan-Li symplectic composition yield results close to machine precision. Similar results are found for 4-th and 8-th order global Krylov scheme. However, the computational effort currently restricts the use of these four propagators to rather short chains which also applies to propagators based on the time-dependent variational principle, typically used for matrix product states. Yet another class of propagators involves explicit, time-symmetrized Euler integrators. Especially the 4-th order variant is recommended for quantum simulations of longer chains, even though the high precision of the splitting schemes cannot be reached. Moreover, the scaling of the computational effort with the dimensions of the local Hilbert spaces is much more favorable for the differencing than for splitting or variational schemes.

Title: Intermodal quantum key distribution field trial with active switching between fiber and free-space channels
Authors: Francesco Picciariello, Ilektra Karakosta-Amarantidou, Edoardo Rossi, Marco Avesani, Giulio Foletto, Luca Calderaro, Giuseppe Vallone, Paolo Villoresi, Francesco Vedovato
Abstract: Intermodal quantum key distribution enables the full interoperability of fiber networks and free-space channels, which are both necessary elements for the development of a global quantum network. We present a field trial of an intermodal quantum key distribution system in a simple 3-node heterogeneous quantum network - comprised of two polarization-based transmitters and a single receiver - in which the active channel is alternately switched between a free-space link of 620 m and a 17km-long deployed fiber in the metropolitan area of Padova. The performance of the free-space channel is evaluated against the atmospheric turbulence strength of the link. The field trial lasted for several hours in daylight conditions, attesting the interoperability between fiber and free-space channels, with a secret key rate of the order of kbps for both the channels. The QKD hardware and software require no different strategies to work over the two channels, even if the intrinsic characteristics of the links are clearly different. The switching system represents a cost-effective solution for a trusted quantum key distribution network, reducing the number of necessary devices in different network topologies.

Title: Fermionic wave packet scattering: a quantum computing approach
Authors: Yahui Chai, Arianna Crippa, Karl Jansen, Stefan Kühn, Vincent R. Pascuzzi, Francesco Tacchino, Ivano Tavernelli
Abstract: Quantum computing provides a novel avenue towards simulating dynamical phenomena, and, in particular, scattering processes relevant for exploring the structure of matter. However, preparing and evolving particle wave packets on a quantum device is a nontrivial task. In this work, we propose a method to prepare Gaussian wave packets with momentum on top of the interacting ground state of a fermionic Hamiltonian. Using Givens rotation, we show how to efficiently obtain expectation values of observables throughout the evolution of the wave packets on digital quantum computers. We demonstrate our technique by applying it to the staggered lattice formulation of the Thirring model and studying the scattering of two wave packets. Monitoring the particle density and the entropy produced during the scattering process, we characterize the phenomenon and provide a first step towards studying more complicated collision processes on digital quantum computers. In addition, we perform a small-scale demonstration on IBM's quantum hardware, showing that our method is suitable for current and near-term quantum devices.

Title: An operational approach to classifying measurement incompatibility
Authors: Arun Kumar Das, Saheli Mukherjee, Debashis Saha, Debarshi Das, A. S. Majumdar
Abstract: Measurement incompatibility has proved to be an important resource for information-processing tasks. In this work, we analyze various levels of incompatibility of measurement sets. We provide operational classification of measurement incompatibility with respect to two elementary classical operations, viz., coarse-graining of measurement outcomes and convex mixing of different measurements. We derive analytical criteria for determining when a set of projective measurements is fully incompatible with respect to coarse-graining or convex mixing. Robustness against white noise is investigated for mutually unbiased bases that can sustain full incompatibility. Furthermore, we propose operational witnesses for different levels of incompatibility subject to classical operations, using the input-output statistics of Bell-type experiments as well as experiments in the prepare-and-measure scenario.

Title: Universal Behavior of Tunneling Time and Barrier Time-Delay Decoupling in Attoclock Measurements
Authors: Ossama Kullie
Abstract: The measurement of the tunneling time-delay is hotly debated and remains controversial. In previous works, we showed that a model that accurately describes the time-delay measured by the attoclock experiment in adiabatic and nonadiabatic field calibrations. In the present work, we show that the tunneling time reveals a universal behavior with disentangled contributions. Even more remarkable is that the barrier tunneling time-delay can be convincingly defined and determined from the difference between the time-delay of adiabatic and nonadiabatic tunnel-ionization, which also show good agreement with experimental results. Furthermore, we illustrate that in the weak measurement limit, the barrier time-delay corresponds to the Larmor-clock time and the interaction time within the barrier.

Title: Quantum One-Wayness of the Single-Round Sponge with Invertible Permutations
Authors: Joseph Carolan, Alexander Poremba
Abstract: Sponge hashing is a widely used class of cryptographic hash algorithms which underlies the current international hash function standard SHA-3. In a nutshell, a sponge function takes as input a bit-stream of any length and processes it via a simple iterative procedure: it repeatedly feeds each block of the input into a so-called block function, and then produces a digest by once again iterating the block function on the final output bits. While much is known about the post-quantum security of the sponge construction when the block function is modeled as a random function or one-way permutation, the case of invertible permutations, which more accurately models the construction underlying SHA-3, has so far remained a fundamental open problem. In this work, we make new progress towards overcoming this barrier and show several results. First, we prove the "double-sided zero-search" conjecture proposed by Unruh (eprint' 2021) and show that finding zero-pairs in a random $2n$-bit permutation requires at least $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries -- and this is tight due to Grover's algorithm. At the core of our proof lies a novel "symmetrization argument" which uses insights from the theory of Young subgroups. Second, we consider more general variants of the double-sided search problem and show similar query lower bounds for them. As an application, we prove the quantum one-wayness of the single-round sponge with invertible permutations in the quantum random oracle model.

Title: Imperfect quantum networks with tailored resource states
Authors: Maria Flors Mor-Ruiz, Julius Wallnöfer, Wolfgang Dür
Abstract: Entanglement-based quantum networks exhibit a unique flexibility in the choice of entangled resource states that are then locally manipulated by the nodes to fulfill any request in the network. Furthermore, this manipulation is not uniquely defined and thus can be optimized. We tailor the adaptation of the resource state or pre-established entanglement to achieve bipartite communication in an imperfect setting that includes time-dependent memory errors. In this same setting, we study how the flexibility of this approach can be used for the distribution of entanglement in a fully asymmetric network scenario. The considered entanglement topology is a custom one based on the minimization of the required measurements to retrieve a Bell pair. The optimization of the manipulation and the study of such a custom entanglement topology are performed using the noisy stabilizer formalism, a recently introduced method to fully track noise on graph states. We find that exploiting the flexibility of the entanglement topology, given a certain set of bipartite requests, is highly favorable in terms of the fidelity of the final state.

Title: Transformer Models for Quantum Gate Set Tomography
Authors: King Yiu Yu, Aritra Sarkar, Ryoichi Ishihara, Sebastian Feld
Abstract: Quantum computation represents a promising frontier in the domain of high-performance computing, blending quantum information theory with practical applications to overcome the limitations of classical computation. This study investigates the challenges of manufacturing high-fidelity and scalable quantum processors. Quantum gate set tomography (QGST) is a critical method for characterizing quantum processors and understanding their operational capabilities and limitations. This paper introduces ML4QGST as a novel approach to QGST by integrating machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing a transformer neural network model. Adapting the transformer model for QGST addresses the computational complexity of modeling quantum systems. Advanced training strategies, including data grouping and curriculum learning, are employed to enhance model performance, demonstrating significant congruence with ground-truth values. We benchmark this training pipeline on the constructed learning model, to successfully perform QGST for $3$ gates on a $1$ qubit system with over-rotation error and depolarizing noise estimation with comparable accuracy to pyGSTi. This research marks a pioneering step in applying deep neural networks to the complex problem of quantum gate set tomography, showcasing the potential of machine learning to tackle nonlinear tomography challenges in quantum computing.

Title: Energy-filtered quantum states and the emergence of non-local correlations
Authors: Gianluca Morettini, Luca Capizzi, Maurizio Fagotti, Leonardo Mazza
Abstract: Energy-filtered quantum states are promising candidates for efficiently simulating thermal states. We explore a protocol designed to transition a product state into an eigenstate located in the middle of the spectrum; this is achieved by gradually reducing its energy variance, which allows us to comprehensively understand the crossover phenomenon and the subsequent convergence towards thermal behavior. We introduce and discuss three energy-filtering regimes (short, medium and long), and we interpret them as stages of thermalization. We show that the properties of the filtered states are locally indistinguishable from those of time-averaged density matrices, routinely employed in the theory of thermalization. On the other hand, unexpected non-local quantum correlations are generated in the medium regimes and are witnessed by the Rényi entanglement entropies of subsystems, which we compute via replica methods. Specifically, two-point correlation functions break cluster decomposition and the entanglement entropy of large regions scales as the logarithm of the volume during the medium filter time.

Title: Multiplexed Quantum Communication with Surface and Hypergraph Product Codes
Authors: Shin Nishio, Nicholas Connolly, Nicolò Lo Piparo, William John Munro, Thomas Rowan Scruby, Kae Nemoto
Abstract: Connecting multiple processors via quantum interconnect technologies could help overcome scalability issues in single-processor quantum computers. Transmission via these interconnects can be performed more efficiently using quantum multiplexing, where information is encoded in high-dimensional photonic degrees of freedom. We explore the effects of multiplexing on logical error rates in surface codes and hypergraph product codes. We show that, although multiplexing makes loss errors more damaging, assigning qubits to photons in an intelligent manner can minimize these effects, and the ability to encode higher-distance codes in a smaller number of photons can result in overall lower logical error rates. This multiplexing technique can also be adapted to quantum communication and multimode quantum memory with high-dimensional qudit systems.

Title: Optimizing Circuit Reusing and its Application in Randomized Benchmarking
Authors: Zhuo Chen, Guoding Liu, Xiongfeng Ma
Abstract: Quantum learning tasks often leverage randomly sampled quantum circuits to characterize unknown systems. An efficient approach known as "circuit reusing," where each circuit is executed multiple times, reduces the cost compared to implementing new circuits. This work investigates the optimal reusing parameter that minimizes the variance of measurement outcomes for a given experimental cost. We establish a theoretical framework connecting the variance of experimental estimators with the reusing parameter R. An optimal R is derived when the implemented circuits and their noise characteristics are known. Additionally, we introduce a near-optimal reusing strategy that is applicable even without prior knowledge of circuits or noise, achieving variances close to the theoretical minimum. To validate our framework, we apply it to randomized benchmarking and analyze the optimal R for various typical noise channels. We further conduct experiments on a superconducting platform, revealing a non-linear relationship between R and the cost, contradicting previous assumptions in the literature. Our theoretical framework successfully incorporates this non-linearity and accurately predicts the experimentally observed optimal R. These findings underscore the broad applicability of our approach to experimental realizations of quantum learning protocols.

Title: Information flow-enhanced precision in collisional quantum thermometry
Authors: Taysa M. Mendonça, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto, Mauro Paternostro
Abstract: We describe and analyze a quantum thermometer based on a multi-layered collisional model. The proposed architecture provides significant sensitivity even for short interaction times between the ancillae comprised in the thermometer and the system to be probed, and a small number of information-acquiring collisions. The assessment of the flow of information taking place within the layered thermometer and between system and thermometer reveals that the tuning of the mutual backflow of information has a positive influence on the precision of thermometry, and helps unveiling the information-theoretic mechanisms behind the working principles of the proposed architecture.

Title: Optimal limits of continuously monitored thermometers and their Hamiltonian structure
Authors: Mohammad Mehboudi, Florian Meier, Marcus Huber, Harry J. D. Miller
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental and practical precision limits of thermometry in bosonic and fermionic environments by coupling an $N$-level probe to them and continuously monitoring it. Our findings show that the ultimate precision limit, quantified by the Fisher information, scales linearly with $N$, offering an exponential improvement over equilibrium thermometry, where the scaling is only $\log^2 N$. For a fixed Hamiltonian structure, we develop a maximum likelihood estimation strategy that maps the observed continuously monitored trajectories of the probe into temperature estimates with minimal error. By optimizing over all possible Hamiltonian structures, we discover that the optimal configuration is an effective two-level system, with both levels exhibiting degeneracy that increases with $N$-a stark contrast to equilibrium thermometry, where the ground state remains non-degenerate. Our results have practical implications. First, continuous monitoring is experimentally feasible on several platforms and accounts for the preparation time of the probe, which is often overlooked in other approaches such as prepare-and-reset. Second, the linear scaling is robust against deviations from the effective two-level structure of the optimal Hamiltonian. Additionally, this robustness extends to cases of initial ignorance about the temperature. Thus, in global estimation problems, the linear scaling remains intact even without adaptive strategies.

Title: Benchmarking quantum machine learning kernel training for classification tasks
Authors: Diego Alvarez-Estevez
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that aims to leverage the unique properties of quantum mechanics to enhance classical machine learning. However, the practical applicability of these methods remains an open question, particularly beyond the context of specifically-crafted toy problems, and given the current limitations of quantum hardware. This study focuses on quantum kernel methods in the context of classification tasks. In particular, it examines the performance of Quantum Kernel Estimation (QKE) and Quantum Kernel Training (QKT) in connection with two quantum feature mappings, namely ZZFeatureMap and CovariantFeatureMap. Remarkably, these feature maps have been proposed in the literature under the conjecture of possible near-term quantum advantage and have shown promising performance in ad-hoc datasets. In this study, we aim to evaluate their versatility and generalization capabilities in a more general benchmark, encompassing both artificial and established reference datasets. Classical machine learning methods, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and logistic regression, are also incorporated as baseline comparisons. Experimental results indicate that quantum methods exhibit varying performance across different datasets. Despite outperforming classical methods in ad-hoc datasets, mixed results are obtained for the general case among standard classical benchmarks. Our experiments call into question a general added value of applying QKT optimization, for which the additional computational cost does not necessarily translate into improved classification performance. Instead, it is suggested that a careful choice of the quantum feature map in connection with proper hyperparameterization may prove more effective.

Title: High-Q cavity coupled to a high permittivity dielectric resonator for sensing applications
Authors: Shahnam Gorgi Zadeh, Alberto Ghirri, Sergio Pagano, Simone Tocci, Claudio Gatti, Antonio Cassinese
Abstract: The use of high quality factor resonators is of undoubted interest for high precision measurements and for applications in quantum technologies. Novel types of microwave sensors can be realized by coupling a first resonator acting as a stable frequency reference with a second resonator that is sensitive to a particular physical quantity. Here we report on a coupled cavity configuration in which a high $Q$-factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$) SrTiO$_3$ puck, whose resonant frequency varies as a function of temperature due to the temperature dependence of the permittivity that reaches values higher than 30000 below 1 K. Extensive electromagnetic simulations are used to test different coupling configurations, showing great versatility to tune the coupling in the weak or strong regime, depending on the puck's position within the cavity. Moreover, for the coupled system, they allow one to investigate the dependence of the zero transmission frequency value on changes of the permittivity $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, obtaining a maximum value of 2.8 MHz per unit change of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, for $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \approx 230$. Finally, we discuss a specific application of the coupled system as a bolometer in different temperature ranges.

Title: Geometric Floquet theory
Authors: Paul M. Schindler, Marin Bukov
Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a unique Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy gap in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.

Title: Event-based quantum contextuality theory
Authors: Songyi Liu, Yongjun Wang, Baoshan Wang, Yunyi Jia
Abstract: Fully revealing the mathmatical structure of quantum contextuality is a significant task, while some known contextuality theories are only applicable for rank-1 projectors. That is because they adopt the observable-based definitions. This paper overcomes the challenges faced by some known contextuality theories by establishing an event-based contextuality theory with exclusive partial Boolean algebra, which is used to describe the contextual systems with local consistency and exclusivity principle. Our theory provides a precise mathematical framework for quantum contextuality, which can handle the scenarios composed of general projectors, and introduces a more complete contextuality hierarchy. We conclude that the Kochen-Specker contextuality is equivalent to the state-independent strong contextuality for finite dimensional quantum systems. Therefore, when considering both the strength and proportion of contextual quantum states, Kochen-Specker contextuality is the strongest.

Title: The Learning Stabilizers with Noise problem
Authors: Alexander Poremba, Yihui Quek, Peter Shor
Abstract: Random classical codes have good error correcting properties, and yet they are notoriously hard to decode in practice. Despite many decades of extensive study, the fastest known algorithms still run in exponential time. The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, which can be seen as the task of decoding a random linear code in the presence of noise, has thus emerged as a prominent hardness assumption with numerous applications in both cryptography and learning theory. Is there a natural quantum analog of the LPN problem? In this work, we introduce the Learning Stabilizers with Noise (LSN) problem, the task of decoding a random stabilizer code in the presence of local depolarizing noise. We give both polynomial-time and exponential-time quantum algorithms for solving LSN in various depolarizing noise regimes, ranging from extremely low noise, to low constant noise rates, and even higher noise rates up to a threshold. Next, we provide concrete evidence that LSN is hard. First, we show that LSN includes LPN as a special case, which suggests that it is at least as hard as its classical counterpart. Second, we prove a worst-case to average-case reduction for variants of LSN. We then ask: what is the computational complexity of solving LSN? Because the task features quantum inputs, its complexity cannot be characterized by traditional complexity classes. Instead, we show that the LSN problem lies in a recently introduced (distributional and oracle) unitary synthesis class. Finally, we identify several applications of our LSN assumption, ranging from the construction of quantum bit commitment schemes to the computational limitations of learning from quantum data.

Title: Threetangle in the XY-model class with a non-integrable field background
Authors: Jörg Neveling, Andreas Osterloh
Abstract: The square root of the threetangle is calculated for the transverse XY-model with an integrability-breaking in-plane field component. To be in a regime of quasi-solvability of the convex roof, here we concentrate here on a 4-site model Hamiltonian. In general, the field and hence a mixing of the odd/even sectors, has a detrimental effect on the threetangle, as expected. Only in a particular spot of models with no or weak inhomogeneity $\gamma$ does a finite value of the tangle prevail in a broad maximum region of the field strength $h\approx 0.3\pm 0.1$. There, the threetangle is basically independent of the non-zero angle $\alpha$. This system could be experimentally used as a quasi-pure source of threetangled states or as an entanglement triggered switch depending on the experimental error in the field orientation.

Title: Control of a Josephson Digital Phase Detector via an SFQ-based Flux Bias Driver
Authors: Laura Di Marino, Luigi Di Palma, Michele Riccio, Francesco Fienga, Marco Arzeo, Oleg Mukhanov
Abstract: Quantum computation requires high-fidelity qubit readout, preserving the quantum state. In the case of superconducting (SC) qubits, readout is typically performed using a complex analog experimental setup operated at room temperature, which poses significant technological and economic barriers to large system scalability. An alternative approach is to perform a cryogenic on-chip qubit readout based on a Josephson Digital Phase Detector (JDPD): a flux switchable device capable of digitizing the phase sign of a coherent input. The readout operation includes the flux excitation of the JDPD to evolve from a single to a double-minima potential. In this work, the effect of the flux bias characteristics on the JDPD performances is studied numerically. To meet the identified requirements that maximize detection fidelity and tackle the engineering challenges, a cryogenic on-chip Single Flux Quantum based flux bias driver is proposed and discussed.

Title: Universal quantum computation via scalable measurement-free error correction
Authors: Stefano Veroni, Alexandru Paler, Giacomo Giudice
Abstract: We show that universal quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant in a scenario where the error-correction is implemented without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate, enabling a universal set of fault-tolerant operations. Independently, we demonstrate that certain stabilizer codes can be concatenated in a measurement-free way without having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is achieved by means of the disposable Toffoli gadget, which realizes the feedback operation in a resource-efficient way. For the purpose of benchmarking the proposed protocols with circuit-level noise, we implement an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits consisting of few Hadamard gates. In particular, our findings support that below-breakeven logical performance is achievable with a circuit-level error rate below $10^{-3}$. Altogether, the deformation protocol and the Toffoli gadget provide a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, which is particularly suited for state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.

Title: Quantum particle in the wrong box (or: the perils of finite-dimensional approximations)
Authors: Felix Fischer, Daniel Burgarth, Davide Lonigro
Abstract: When numerically simulating the unitary time evolution of an infinite-dimensional quantum system, one is usually led to treat the Hamiltonian $H$ as an "infinite-dimensional matrix" by expressing it in some orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space, and then truncate it to some finite dimensions. However, the solutions of the Schrödinger equations generated by the truncated Hamiltonians need not converge, in general, to the solution of the Schrödinger equation corresponding to the actual Hamiltonian. In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, they converge to the solution of the Schrödinger equation generated by a specific Hamiltonian which crucially depends on the particular choice of basis: the Friedrichs extension of the restriction of $H$ to the space of finite linear combinations of elements of the basis. Importantly, this is generally different from $H$ itself; in all such cases, numerical simulations will unavoidably reproduce the wrong dynamics in the limit, and yet there is no numerical test that can reveal this failure, unless one has the analytical solution to compare with. As a practical demonstration of such results, we consider the quantum particle in the box, and we show that, for a wide class of bases (which include associated Legendre polynomials as a concrete example) the dynamics generated by the truncated Hamiltonians will always converge to the one corresponding to the particle with Dirichlet boundary conditions, regardless the initial choice of boundary conditions. Other such examples are discussed.

Title: Topological quantum compilation of metaplectic anyons based on the genetic optimized algorithms
Authors: Jiangwei Long, Jianxin Zhong, Lijun Meng
Abstract: Topological quantum computing holding global anti-interference ability is realized by braiding some anyons, such as well-known Fibonacci anyons. Here, based on SO(3)2 theory we obtain a total of 28 anyon models utilizing F-matrices, R-symbols, and fusion rules of metaplectic anyon. Three of them {V113_3,V131_3,V133_1} are studied in detail because only one non-computational state is involved in the two-qubit case. We study systematically the compilation of these three models through elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) obtained analytically. For one-qubit case, the classical H- and T-gate can be well constructed using the genetic algorithm enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA) by {V113_3,V131_3,V133_1}. The obtained accuracy of the H/T-gate by {V113_3,V133_1} is slightly inferior to the corresponding gates of the Fibonacci anyon model, but it also can meet the requirements of fault-tolerant quantum computing, V131_3 giving the best performance of these four models. For the two-qubit case, we use the exhaustive method for short lengths and the GA for long lengths to obtain braidword for {V113_3,V131_3,V133_1} models. The resulting matrices can well approximate the local equivalence class of the CNOT-gate, while demonstrating a much smaller error than the Fibonacci model, especially for the V113_3.

Title: Lindblad estimation with fast and precise quantum control
Authors: James W. Gardner, Simon A. Haine, Joseph J. Hope, Yanbei Chen, Tuvia Gefen
Abstract: Enhancing precision sensors for stochastic signals using quantum techniques is a promising emerging field of physics. Estimating a weak stochastic waveform is the core task of many fundamental physics experiments including searches for stochastic gravitational waves, quantum gravity, and axionic dark matter. Simultaneously, noise spectroscopy and characterisation, e.g. estimation of various decay mechanisms in quantum devices, is relevant to a broad range of fundamental and technological applications. We consider the ultimate limit on the sensitivity of these devices for Lindblad estimation given any quantum state, fast and precise control sequence, and measurement scheme. We show that it is optimal to rapidly projectively measure and re-initialise the quantum state. We develop optimal protocols for a wide range of applications including stochastic waveform estimation, spectroscopy with qubits, and Lindblad estimation.

Abstract: This document contains a guide on how to use the Qudit Cirq library, an extension of Google's Cirq library for qudits. While Cirq provides necessary building blocks for quantum computation on qudits, the gates, curcuits and simulation of qudit systems need to be developed from scratch. Our extension to the Cirq library has built-in methods for creating qudits, applying common qudit gates, building circuits and simulating quantum computation on these circuits. This is ideal for researchers who want to use an off-the-shelf library to simulate qudit systems.

Title: On the uncertainty principle of neural networks
Authors: Jun-Jie Zhang, Dong-Xiao Zhang, Jian-Nan Chen, Long-Gang Pang, Deyu Meng
Abstract: In this study, we explore the inherent trade-off between accuracy and robustness in neural networks, drawing an analogy to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. We propose that neural networks are subject to an uncertainty relation, which manifests as a fundamental limitation in their ability to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. Through mathematical proofs and empirical evidence, we demonstrate that this trade-off is a natural consequence of the sharp boundaries formed between different class concepts during training. Our findings reveal that the complementarity principle, a cornerstone of quantum physics, applies to neural networks, imposing fundamental limits on their capabilities in simultaneous learning of conjugate features. Meanwhile, our work suggests that achieving human-level intelligence through a single network architecture or massive datasets alone may be inherently limited. Our work provides new insights into the theoretical foundations of neural network vulnerability and opens up avenues for designing more robust neural network architectures.

Title: Semantic Security with Infinite Dimensional Quantum Eavesdropping Channel
Authors: Matthias Frey, Igor Bjelaković, Janis Nötzel, Sławomir Stańczak
Abstract: We propose a new proof method for direct coding theorems for wiretap channels where the eavesdropper has access to a quantum version of the transmitted signal on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the legitimate parties communicate through a classical channel or a classical input, quantum output (cq) channel. The transmitter input can be subject to an additive cost constraint, which specializes to the case of an average energy constraint. This method yields errors that decay exponentially with increasing block lengths. Moreover, it provides a guarantee of a quantum version of semantic security, which is an established concept in classical cryptography and physical layer security. Therefore, it complements existing works which either do not prove the exponential error decay or use weaker notions of security. The main part of this proof method is a direct coding result on channel resolvability which states that there is only a doubly exponentially small probability that a standard random codebook does not solve the channel resolvability problem for the cq channel. Semantic security has strong operational implications meaning essentially that the eavesdropper cannot use its quantum observation to gather any meaningful information about the transmitted signal. We also discuss the connections between semantic security and various other established notions of secrecy.

Title: Topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in higher dimensions and uniform spectra
Authors: Haiping Hu
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is an iconic phenomenon characterized by the aggregation of eigenstates near the system boundaries in non-Hermitian systems. While extensively studied in one dimension, understanding the skin effect and extending the non-Bloch band theory to higher dimensions encounters a formidable challenge, primarily due to infinite lattice geometries or open boundary conditions. This work adopts a point-gap perspective and unveils that non-Hermitian skin effect in all spatial dimensions originates from point gaps. We introduce the concept of uniform spectra and reveal that regardless of lattice geometry, their energy spectra are universally given by the uniform spectra, even though their manifestations of skin modes may differ. Building on the uniform spectra, we demonstrate how to account for the skin effect with generic lattice cuts and establish the connections of skin modes across different geometric shapes via momentum-basis transformations. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles point gaps play, offering a unified understanding of the topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in all dimensions.

Title: $^{115}$In$^+$-$^{172}$Yb$^+$ Coulomb crystal clock with $2.5\times10^{-18}$ systematic uncertainty

Abstract: We present a scalable mixed-species Coulomb crystal clock based on the $^1S_0$ $\leftrightarrow$ $^3P_0$ transition in $^{115}$In$^+$. $^{172}$Yb$^+$ ions are co-trapped and used for sympathetic cooling. Reproducible interrogation conditions for mixed-species Coulomb crystals are ensured by a conditional preparation sequence with permutation control. We demonstrate clock operation with a 1In$^+$-3Yb$^+$ crystal, achieving a relative systematic uncertainty of $2.5\times10^{-18}$ and a relative frequency instability of $1.6\times10^{-15}/\sqrt{\tau/1\;\mathrm{s}}$. We report on absolute frequency measurements with an uncertainty of $1.3\times10^{-16}$ and optical frequency comparisons with clocks based on $^{171}$Yb$^+$ (E3) and $^{87}$Sr. With a fractional uncertainty of $4.4\times10^{-18}$, the former is - to our knowledge - the most accurate frequency ratio value reported to date. For the $^{115}$In$^+$/$^{87}$Sr ratio, we improve upon the best previous measurement by more than an order of magnitude. We also demonstrate operation with four $^{115}$In$^+$ clock ions, which reduces the instability to $9.2\times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/1\;\mathrm{s}}$.

Title: Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point
Authors: Yang Liu, Songtai Lv, Yuchen Meng, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.

Title: Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies
Authors: Daine L. Danielson, Gautam Satishchandran, Robert M. Wald
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.

Title: Supersolidity in Rydberg tweezer arrays
Authors: Lukas Homeier, Simon Hollerith, Sebastian Geier, Neng-Chun Chiu, Antoine Browaeys, Lode Pollet
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between two Rydberg states, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. On the triangular lattice with repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$ accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We further demonstrate the experimental feasibility by identifying pairs of Rydberg states in ${}^{87}$Rb realizing the required interactions. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles allowing one to directly probe the defect-induced picture of supersolids. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.

Title: Engineering a Josephson junction chain for the simulation of the clock model
Authors: Matteo M. Wauters, Lorenzo Maffi, Michele Burrello
Abstract: The continuous improvement of fabrication techniques and high-quality semiconductor-superconductor interfaces allowed for unprecedented tunability of Josephson junction arrays (JJA), making them a promising candidate for analog quantum simulations of many-body phenomena. While most experimental proposals so far focused on quantum simulations of ensembles of two-level systems, the possibility of tuning the current-phase relation beyond the sinusoidal regime paves the way for studying statistical physics models with larger local Hilbert spaces. Here, we investigate a particular JJA architecture that can be mapped into a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model. Through matrix-product-states simulations and bosonization analysis, we show that few experimentally accessible control parameters allow for the exploration of the rich phase diagrams of the associated low-energy field theories. Our results expand the horizon for analog quantum simulations with JJAs towards models that can not be efficiently captured with qubit architectures.

Title: Internal structure of gauge-invariant Projected Entangled Pair States
Authors: David Blanik, José Garre-Rubio, András Molnár, Erez Zohar
Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) are very useful in the description of strongly correlated systems, partly because they allow encoding symmetries, either global or local (gauge), naturally. In recent years, PEPS with local symmetries have increasingly been used in the study of non-perturbative regimes of lattice gauge theories, most prominently as a way to construct variational ansatz states depending only on a small number of parameters and yet capturing the relevant physical properties. For the case of one-dimensional PEPS (Matrix Product States - MPS) a bidirectional connection was established between the internal structure of the tensor network, i.e. the mathematical properties of the constituent tensors, and the symmetry. In higher dimensions this has only been done for global symmetries, where in the local (gauge) case it is known only how to construct gauge-invariant states, but not what the symmetry implies on the internal structure of the PEPS. In the present work we complete this missing piece and study the internal structure of projected entangled pair states with a gauge symmetry. The PEPS we consider consist of matter and gauge field tensors placed on the vertices and edges, respectively, of arbitrary graphs.

Title: Fr\"ohlich versus Bose-Einstein Condensation in Pumped Bosonic Systems
Authors: Wenhao Xu, Andrey A. Bagrov, Farhan T. Chowdhury, Luke D. Smith, Daniel R. Kattnig, Hilbert J. Kappen, Mikhail I. Katsnelson
Abstract: Magnon-condensation, which emerges in pumped bosonic systems at room temperature, continues to garner great interest for its long-lived coherence. While traditionally formulated in terms of Bose-Einstein condensation, which typically occurs at ultra-low temperatures, it could potentially also be explained by Fröhlich-condensation, a hypothesis of Bose-Einstein-like condensation in living systems at ambient temperatures. This prompts general questions relating to fundamental differences between coherence phenomena in open and isolated quantum systems. To that end, we introduce a simple model of bosonic condensation in an open quantum system (OQS) formulation, wherein bosons dissipatively interact with an oscillator (phonon) bath. Our derived equations of motion for expected boson occupations turns out to be similar in form to the rate equations governing Fröhlich-condensation. Provided that specific system parameters result in correlations that amplify or diminish the condensation effects, we thereby posit that our treatment offers a better description of high-temperature condensation compared to traditional formulations obtained using equilibrium thermodynamics. By comparing our OQS derivation with the original uncorrelated and previous semi-classical rate equations, we furthermore highlight how both classical anti-correlations and quantum correlations alter the bosonic occupation distribution.

Title: Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect
Authors: Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Ashley M. Cook
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.

Title: Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath
Authors: Xiang-Ping Jiang, Mingdi Xu, Xuanpu Yang, Hongsheng Hou, Yucheng Wang, Lei Pan
Abstract: A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.

Title: Observation of Jones-Roberts solitons in a paraxial quantum fluid of light
Authors: Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Tangui Aladjidi, Nils A.Krause, Ashton S. Bradley, Quentin Glorieux
Abstract: We investigate the formation and dynamics of Jones-Roberts solitons in a smoothly inhomogeneous quantum fluid. To do so, we create a superfluid of light using paraxial, near-resonant laser beam propagating through a hot rubidium vapor. We excite a bounded vortex-antivortex dipole in the superfluid and observe its transition to a rarefaction pulse and back, in agreement with the seminal predictions of Jones and Roberts. Employing an analogy with ray optics, we calculate the trajectory of the interacting vortices, deriving an effective refractive index from the inhomogeneous fluid density. Finally, we examine analytically and experimentally the superfluid velocity correlations, observing a transfer of coherence from incompressible to compressible velocity of the quantum fluid, a direct signature of the dynamical conversion between vortices and rarefaction pulse.
