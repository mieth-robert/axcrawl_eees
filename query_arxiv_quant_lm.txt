Title: Graphical Stabilizer Decompositions for Multi-Control Toffoli Gate Dense Quantum Circuits
Authors: Yves Vollmeier
Abstract: In this thesis, we study concepts in quantum computing using graphical languages, specifically using the ZX-calculus. The core of the research revolves around (graphical) stabilizer decompositions. The first major focus is on the decomposition of non-stabilizer states created from star edges. We discuss previous results and then present novel decompositions that yield a theoretical improvement. The second major focus is on weighting algorithms, applied to the special class of multi-control Toffoli gate dense quantum circuits. The representation of the corresponding gates is based on star edges. The applicability of known methods, such as CNOT-grouping, traditionally used for other classes, is examined in the context of this specific class. We then present a novel weighting algorithm that attempts to determine the best vertex to decompose. A refined version is implemented to simulate a known class of quantum querying algorithms, which is used to search for causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams. For this case, as well as for a generalized benchmark consisting of randomly generated quantum circuits, we demonstrate occasional improvements in the final number of terms against traditional methods. These results are discussed by considering different simplification strategies. This thesis also provides a brief but broad outline of the important preliminaries.

Title: Restoring thermalization in long-range quantum magnets with staggered magnetic fields
Authors: Lucas Winter, Pietro Brighi, Andreas Nunnenkamp
Abstract: Quantum systems with strong long-range interactions are thought to resist thermalization because of their discrete energy spectra. We show that applying a staggered magnetic field to a strong long-range Heisenberg antiferromagnet restores thermalization for a large class of initial states by breaking permutational symmetry. Using self-consistent mean-field theory and exact diagonalization, we reveal that the energy spectrum, while composed of discrete subspaces, collectively forms a dense spectrum. The equilibration time is independent of system size and depends only on the fluctuations in the initial state. For initial states at low to intermediate energies, the long-time average aligns with the microcanonical ensemble. However, for states in the middle of the spectrum the long-time average depends on the initial state due to quantum scar-like eigenstates localized at unstable points in classical phase space. Our results can be readily tested on a range of experimental platforms, including Rydberg atoms or optical cavities.

Title: Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction
Authors: Zijian Liang, Ke Liu, Hao Song, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr√∂bner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360,12,24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

Title: Fidelity Aware Multipath Routing for Multipartite State Distribution in Quantum Networks
Authors: Evan Sutcliffe, Alejandra Beghelli
Abstract: We consider the problem of distributing entangled multipartite states across a quantum network with improved distribution rate and fidelity. For this, we propose fidelity-aware multi-path routing protocols, assess their performance in terms of the rate and fidelity of the distributed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and compare such performance against that of single-path routing. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-path routing protocols select routes that require more Bell states compared to single-path routing, but also require fewer rounds of Bell state generation. We also optimised the trade-off between distribution rate and fidelity by selecting an appropriate cutoff to the quantum memory storage time. Using such a cutoff technique, the proposed multi-path protocols can achieve up to a 8.3 times higher distribution rate and up to a 28\% improvement in GHZ state fidelity compared to single-path routing. These results show that multi-path routing, both improves the distribution rates and enhances fidelity for multipartite state distribution.

Title: Continuous Variable Structured Collision Models
Authors: Anton Corr, Stefano Cusumano, Gabriele De Chiara
Abstract: Quantum collision models allow for the dynamics of open quantum systems to be described by breaking the environment into small segments, typically consisting of non-interacting harmonic oscillators or two-level systems. This work introduces structure within these environmental units via spring-like interactions between N coupled oscillators in a ring structure, initially prepared in a thermal state. Two models of interest are examined. The first highlights a case in which a continuous time evolution can be obtained, wherein the system interacts with the environment via a beam-splitter-like, energy-preserving, interaction. The resulting dynamics are analogous to those due to interactions with unstructured units prepared as squeezed thermal states. The second model highlights a case in which the continuous time limit for the evolution cannot be taken generally, requiring instead discrete-time propagation. Special cases in which the continuous time limit can be taken are also investigated, alongside the addition of a secondary environment to induce a steady state. The first and second laws of thermodynamics are verified for both examples.

Title: The Large-Scale Structure of Entanglement in Quantum Many-body Systems
Authors: Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming
Abstract: We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the \emph{large-scale structure of entanglement} of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.

Title: Quantum metasurfaces as probes of vacuum particle content
Authors: Germain Tobar, Joshua Foo, Sofia Qvarfort, Fabio Costa, Rivka Bekenstein, Magdalena Zych
Abstract: The quantum vacuum of the electromagnetic field is inherently entangled across distinct spatial sub-regions, resulting in non-trivial particle content across these sub-regions. However, accessing this particle content in a controlled laboratory experiment has remained far out of experimental reach. Here we propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a two-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity. The array's response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective states by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that photon content from entangled sub-regions of the vacuum causes frequency shifts that are accessible in existing experimental setups. This feasibility stems from the system's unique ability to create coherent superpositions of transmissive and reflective states, providing the first practical platform for directly observing particle content from entangled spatial sub-regions of the electromagnetic field vacuum.

Title: Spatial correlations and entanglement in a hybrid system of N fermion pairs with harmonic interaction
Authors: M.D. Jim√©nez, W.J. D√≠az, E. Cuestas, A. Vald√©s-Hern√°ndez, A.P. Majtey
Abstract: Using the Moshinsky model, we analyze the spatial correlation and the entanglement of the ground state across different bipartitions of a system composed by $N$ pairs of harmonically confined fermions of two different interacting species. We find that in the strongly attractive regime fermions tend to localize within a confined region, while Pauli exclusion induces a spatial repulsion among identical particles. Conversely, in the strongly repulsive regime, the system exhibits phase separation into two spatially distinct domains. We propose a suitably designed entanglement measure that takes into account the (in)distinguishable nature of the particles, so as to guarantee that only quantum correlations beyond exchange or Slater correlations contribute to the entanglement. Our findings reveal how entanglement varies across different bipartitions, influenced by both the number of pairs and the interaction strength. The obtained entanglement between distinguishable species increases with both $N$ and the interaction strength, whereas the entanglement between subsystems of which at least one contains particles of both species decreases with $N$, suggesting a screening effect that weakens effective interactions among parties of the same kind. Our results sheds light on the intricate interplay between particle statistics and entanglement dynamics in composite quantum systems, and provides insights into the fundamental quantum correlations in fermionic systems.

Title: Multilayered Aspects of Casimir Energy
Authors: Kyohei Mukaida, Hideo Iizuka, Kazunori Nakayama
Abstract: We give a robust formulation to calculate the Casimir energy and Casimir force for plane-parallel multilayer setups with general dielectric constants. We derive recursion relations for multilayer reflection and transmission coefficients in the most general setups, which are essential ingredients for evaluating the Casimir energy. With the use of complex analysis techniques involving the argument principle, we carefully treat and subtract UV divergences and make clear the relation between the subtraction procedure and an actual physical setup. We also clarify the physical operational meaning of pole subtraction, which is required to utilize the argument principle in the calculation of the Casimir energy. Our formula is applicable to more general situations including chiral medium or Weyl semimetals.

Title: Universal logical operations with a dynamical qubit in Floquet code

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) protects quantum systems against inevitable noises and control inaccuracies, providing a pathway towards fault-tolerant (FT) quantum computation. However, the significant overhead of physical qubits required to encode a single logical qubit poses a major challenge for scalability and practical implementation. Floquet QEC codes, a recent innovation, mitigate this challenge by utilizing time-periodic measurements to introduce additional dynamical logical qubits, thereby enhancing resource efficiency in QEC. Here, we experimentally implement the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code on a superconducting quantum processor. We encode a dynamical logical qubit within a $3\times 3$ lattice of data qubits, alongside a conventional static logical qubit. We demonstrate FT encoding and measurement of the two-qubit logical states and stabilize the states using repeated error detection cycles. Additionally, we showcase universal single-qubit logical gates on the dynamical qubit. By implementing a logical CNOT gate, we entangle the dynamical and static logical qubits, generating an error-detected logical Bell state with a fidelity of 75.9\%. Our results highlight the potential of Floquet codes for scalable and resource-efficient FT quantum computation.

Title: Non-equilibrium thermodynamics of precision through a quantum-centric computation
Authors: Mario Motta, Antonio Mezzacapo, Giacomo Guarnieri
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) are a set of inequalities expressing a fundamental trade-off between precision and dissipation in non-equilibrium classical and quantum thermodynamic processes. TURs show that achieving low fluctuations in a thermodynamic quantity (e.g., heat or work) requires a minimum entropy production, with profound implications for the efficiency of biological and artificial thermodynamic processes. The accurate evaluation of TURs is a necessary requirement to quantify the fluctuation and dissipation entailed by a thermodynamic process, and ultimately to optimize the performance of quantum devices, whose operation is fundamentally a quantum thermodynamic process. Here, we simulate TURs in a transverse-field Ising model subjected to a time-dependent driving protocol, using quantum and classical computers in concert. Varying the duration and strength of the drive as well as the system size, we verify the validity of TURs, identify quantum signatures in the work statistics within the linear response regime, and observe TUR saturation in the high-temperature limit.

Title: Tight and self-testing multipartite quantum Bell inequalities from the renormalization group
Authors: Paolo Abiuso, Julian Fischer, Miguel Navascu√©s
Abstract: In past work, the concept of connectors was introduced: directed tensors with the property that any contraction thereof defines a multipartite quantum Bell inequality, i.e., a linear restriction on measurement probabilities that holds in any multipartite quantum experiment. In this paper we propose the notion of ''tight connectors'', which, if contracted according to some simple rules, result in tight quantum Bell inequalities. By construction, the new inequalities are saturated by tensor network states, whose structure mimics the corresponding network of connectors. Some tight connectors are furthermore ''fully self-testing'', which implies that the quantum Bell inequalities they generate can only be maximized with such a tensor network state and specific measurement operators (modulo local isometries). We provide large analytic families of tight, fully self-testing connectors that generate $N$-partite quantum Bell inequalities of correlator form for which the ratio between the maximum quantum and classical values increases exponentially with $N$.

Title: Conserved operators and exact conditions for pair condensation
Authors: Federico Petrovich, R. Rossignoli
Abstract: We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions which ensure that an $N=2m$-particle fermionic or bosonic state $|\Psi\rangle$ has the form $|\Psi\rangle\propto(A^{\dagger})^{m}|0\rangle$, where $A^{\dagger}=\tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}c_{i}^{\dagger}c_{j}^{\dagger}$ is a general pair creation operator. These conditions can be cast as an eigenvalue equation for a modified two-body density matrix, and enable an exact reconstruction of the operator $A^‚Ä†$, providing as well a measure of the proximity of a given state to an exact pair condensate. Through a covariance-based formalism, it is also shown that such states are fully characterized by a set of $L$ "conserved" one-body operators which have $|\Psi\rangle$ as exact eigenstate, with $L$ determined just by the single particle space dimension involved. The whole set of two-body Hamiltonians having $|\Psi\rangle$ as exact eigenstate is in this way determined, while a general subset having $|\Psi\rangle$ as nondegenerate ground state is also identified. Extension to states $\propto f(A^‚Ä†)|0\rangle$ with $f$ an arbitrary function is also discussed.

Title: Acoustic phonon phase gates with number-resolving phonon detection
Authors: Hong Qiao, Zhaoyou Wang, Gustav Andersson, Alexander Anferov, Christopher R. Conner, Yash J. Joshi, Shiheng Li, Jacob M. Miller, Xuntao Wu, Haoxiong Yan, Liang Jiang, Andrew N. Cleland
Abstract: Linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) provides a compelling approach to quantum information processing, with a short list of physical requirements; however, experimental implementations have faced significant challenges. Itinerant phonons in quantum acoustics, combined with superconducting qubits, offer a compelling alternative to the quantum optics approach. Here we demonstrate key advances in the ability to manipulate and measure acoustic phonon quantum states: First, we demonstrate deterministic phase control of itinerant one- and two-phonon qubit states, measured using an acoustic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We implement phonon phase control using the frequency-dependent scattering of phonon states from a superconducting transmon qubit. The acoustic interferometer used to measure the resulting phonon phase achieves a noise-floor-limited Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference visibility of 98.1%, representing a significant improvement over our previous demonstration. Additionally, we propose and implement a multi-phonon detection scheme that enables coherent conversion between itinerant one- and two-phonon Fock states and transmon qutrit states, transforming for example the Hong-Ou-Mandel two-phonon entangled output state $|02\rangle - |20\rangle$ into the entangled state of two transmons. The tight integration of quantum acoustics with superconducting circuits native to our implementation promises further advances, including deterministic phonon quantum gates with direct applications to quantum computing.

Title: Construction and Decoding of Quantum Margulis Codes
Authors: Michele Pacenti, Dimitris Chytas, Bane Vasic
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check codes are a promising approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation, offering potential advantages in rate and decoding efficiency. In this work, we introduce quantum Margulis codes, a new class of QLDPC codes derived from Margulis' classical LDPC construction via the two-block group algebra framework. We show that quantum Margulis codes, unlike bivariate bicycle codes which require ordered statistics decoding for effective error correction, can be efficiently decoded using a standard min-sum decoder with linear complexity, when decoded under depolarizing noise. This is attributed to their Tanner graph structure, which does not exhibit group symmetry, thereby mitigating the well-known problem of error degeneracy in QLDPC decoding. To further enhance performance, we propose an algorithm for constructing 2BGA codes with controlled girth, ensuring a minimum girth of 6 or 8, and use it to generate several quantum Margulis codes of length 240 and 642. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating that quantum Margulis codes behave significantly better than BB codes in the error floor region, under min-sum decoding.

Title: Protocols for inter-module two-qubit gates mediated by time-bin encoded photons
Authors: Z. M. McIntyre, W. A. Coish
Abstract: As quantum devices scale to larger numbers of qubits, entangling gates between distant stationary qubits will help provide flexible, long-range connectivity in modular architectures. In this work, we present protocols for implementing long-range two-qubit gates mediated by either Fock-state or time-bin qubits -- photonic encodings that are both compatible with the coplanar waveguide resonators commonly used in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). These protocols become deterministic in the limit of vanishing photon loss. Additionally, photon loss can be heralded, signaling a failed two-qubit gate attempt. We model the loss of a time-bin qubit to a dielectric environment consisting of an ensemble of two-level systems (TLSs), which are believed to be the dominant mechanism for dielectric loss in circuit QED architectures. The backaction (on the stationary qubits) associated with the loss of the time-bin qubit is strongly suppressed in a non-Markovian regime where the temporal separation of the time bins is short compared to the dielectric environment's correlation time. This result suggests strategies based on a combination of materials-fabrication and time-bin-qubit optimization for ensuring that the loss of a time-bin qubit is not only heralded, but also approximately backaction-free.

Title: Quantum walk search on a two-dimensional grid with extra edges
Authors: Pulak Ranjan Giri
Abstract: Quantum walk has been successfully used to search for targets on graphs with vertices identified as the elements of a database. This spacial search on a two-dimensional periodic grid takes $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{N\log N}\right)$ oracle consultations to find a target vertex from $N$ number of vertices with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ success probability, while reaching optimal speed of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ on $d \geq 3$ dimensional square lattice. Our numerical analysis based on lackadaisical quantum walks searches $M$ vertices on a 2-dimensional grid with optimal speed of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N/M})$, provided the grid is attached with additional long range edges. Based on the numerical analysis performed with multiple sets of randomly generated targets for a wide range of $N$ and $M$ we suggest that the optimal time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N/M})$ with constant success probability can be achieved for quantum search on a two-dimensional periodic grid with long-range edges.

Title: Quantum walk search by Grover search on coin space
Authors: Pulak Ranjan Giri
Abstract: Quantum walk followed by some amplitude amplification technique has been successfully used to search for marked vertices on various graphs. Lackadaisical quantum walk can search for target vertices on graphs without the help of any additional amplitude amplification technique. These studies either exploit AKR or SKW coin to distinguish the marked vertices from the unmarked vertices. The success of AKR coin based quantum walk search algorithms highly depend on the arrangements of the set of marked vertices on the graph. For example, it fails to find adjacent vertices, diagonal vertices and other exceptional configurations of vertices on a two-dimensional periodic square lattice and on other graphs. These coins also suffer from low success probability while searching for marked vertices on a one-dimensional periodic lattice and on other graphs for certain arrangements for marked vertices. In this article, we propose a modified coin for the lackadaisical quantum walk search. It allows us to perform quantum walk search for the marked vertices by doing Grover search on the coin space. Our model finds the marked vertices by searching the self-loops associated with the marked vertices. It can search for marked vertices irrespective of their arrangement on the graph with high success probability. For all analyzed arrangements of the marked vertices the time complexity for 1d-lattice and 2d-lattice are $\mathcal{O}(\frac{N}{M})$ and $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{ \frac{N}{M}\log \frac{N}{M}}\right)$ respectively with constant and high success probability.

Title: Entangled states from simple quantum graphs
Authors: Alison A. Silva, D. Bazeia, Fabiano M. Andrade
Abstract: This work deals with quantum transport in open quantum graphs with two scattering channels. They are used as a two-level system whose weights are defined by its reflection and transmission amplitudes. We propose a controlled operation between two quantum graphs, where the scattering in a quantum graph modifies the second one, changing its outcome. Our findings show that the scattering measurements in this system are linked to recent results on randomized quantum graphs. The main results reveal the presence of entangled states according to the wave-number values in each quantum graph and the applied controlled operation. It was possible to determine the criteria for maximal entanglement or separability. In particular, we uncovered the presence of entanglement in a simple system consisting of two simple quantum graphs, with only one edge and a controlled phase.

Title: Stabilizer Ranks, Barnes Wall Lattices and Magic Monotones
Authors: Amolak Ratan Kalra, Pulkit Sinha
Abstract: In 2024, Kliuchnikov and Sch√∂nnenbeck showed a connection between the Barnes Wall lattices, stabilizer states and Clifford operations. In this work, we study their results and relate them to the problem of lower bounding stabilizer ranks. We show the first quantitative lower bound on stabilizer fidelity as a function of stabilizer ranks, which reproduces the linear-by-log lower bound for $\chi_{\delta}({|{H}\rangle^{ \otimes n}})$, i.e, on the approximate stabilizer rank of $|H\rangle^{\otimes n}$. In fact, we show that the lower bound holds even when the fidelity between the approximation and ${|H\rangle}^{\otimes n}$ is exponentially small, which is currently the best lower bound in this regime. Next, we define a new magic monotone for pure states, the Barnes Wall norm, and its corresponding approximate variant. We upper bound these monotones by the $CS$-count of state preparation, and also by the stabilizer ranks. In particular, the upper bound given by the $CS$-count is tight, in the sense that we exhibit states that achieve the bound. Apart from these results, we give a Fidelity Amplification algorithm, which provides a trade-off between approximation error and the stabilizer rank. As a corollary, it gives us a way to compose approximate stabilizer decompositions into approximate decompositions of their tensor products. Finally, we provide an alternate, elementary proof of the existence and density of product states with maximal stabilizer ranks, which was first proven by Lovitz and Steffan (2022), where they used results from algebraic geometry.

Title: Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system
Authors: Xue-Yi Guo
Abstract: The irreversibility and thermalization of many-body systems can be attributed to the erasure of spreaded nonequilibrium state information by local operations. This thermalization mechanism can be demonstrated by the sequence $[\hat{O}^\dagger \hat{O}(t)]^N$, where $\hat{O}$ is a local operator, $\hat{O}(t) = e^{i\hat{H}t} \hat{O} e^{-i\hat{H}t}$, $\hat{H}$ is the system Hamiltonian, and $N$ denotes the number of repetitions. We begin by preparing a nonequilibrium initial state with an inhomogeneous particle number distribution in a one-dimensional Hubbard model. As particles propagate and interact within the lattice, the system evolves into a highly entangled quantum state, where the entanglement entropy satisfies a volume law, yet the information of the initial state remains well preserved. The local operator $\hat{O}$ erases part of the information in the entangled state, altering the interference of the system wavefunction and the disentangling process during time-reversed evolution. Repeatedly applying $\hat{O}^\dagger \hat{O}(t)$ leads to a monotonic increase in the entanglement entropy until it saturates at a steady value. By incorporating this information erasure mechanism into the one-dimensional Hubbard model, our numerical simulations demonstrate that in a completely isolated system, a thermalization process emerges. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of implementing related quantum simulation experiments on superconducting quantum processors.

Title: A mirrored pair of optimal non-decomposable entanglement witnesses for two qudits does exist
Authors: Dariusz Chru≈õci≈Ñski, Anindita Bera, Joonwoo Bae, Beatrix C. Hiesmayr
Abstract: Two approaches can be utilized to handle the separability problem, finding out whether a given bipartite qudit state is separable or not: a direct procedure on the state space or the effective tool of entanglement witnesses (EWs). This contribution studies the structure of EWs. Exploiting the very concept of mirrored EWs, increasing the detection power, we show, in contrast to the conjecture in a recent paper (Sci. Rep. {\bf 13}, 10733 (2023)), there exist pairs of optimal EWs, which are both non-decomposible, i.e. can detect bound/PPT-entangled states in an optimal way. Since we show that the structure also extends to higher dimensions, our results reveal a further structure of entanglement witnesses.

Title: White Gaussian Noise Generation with a Vacuum State Quantum Entropy Source Chip
Authors: Guan-Ru Qiao, Bing Bai, Zi-Xuan Weng, Jia-Ying Wu, You-Qi Nie, Jun Zhang
Abstract: White Gaussian noise (WGN) is widely used in communication system testing, physical modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and electronic countermeasures. WGN generation relies heavily on random numbers. In this work, we present an implementation of WGN generation utilizing a quantum entropy source chip for the first time. A photonic integrated chip based on the vacuum state scheme generates quantum random numbers at a real-time output rate of up to 6.4 Gbps. A hardware-based inversion method converts uniform quantum random numbers into Gaussian random numbers using the inverse cumulative distribution function. Subsequently, the WGN signal is generated through a digital-to-analog converter and amplifiers. The WGN generator is characterized by a bandwidth of 230 MHz, a crest factor as high as 6.2, and an adjustable peak-to-peak range of 2.5 V. This work introduces a novel approach to WGN generation with information-theory provable quantum random numbers to enhance system security.

Title: Thermodynamic approach to quantum cooling limit of continuous Gaussian feedback
Authors: Kousuke Kumasaki, Toshihiro Yada, Ken Funo, Takahiro Sagawa
Abstract: Feedback cooling plays a critical role in stabilizing quantum systems and achieving low temperatures, where a key question is to determine the fundamental thermodynamic limits on cooling performance. We establish a fundamental bound on quantum feedback cooling in Gaussian systems, by deriving a generalized second law of thermodynamics involving the kinetic temperatures of the system and a measure of quantum information flow obtained by continuous measurement. In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum. Our theoretical result is numerically demonstrated using parameters from an experiment of levitated nanoparticles. Our theory provides a general framework for understanding the thermodynamic constraints on quantum feedback cooling.

Title: Implementation of a quantum addressable router using superconducting qubits
Authors: Connie Miao, S√©bastien L√©ger, Ziqian Li, Gideon Lee, Liang Jiang, David I. Schuster
Abstract: The implementation of a quantum router capable of performing both quantum signal routing and quantum addressing (a Q2-router) represents a key step toward building quantum networks and quantum random access memories. We realize a Q2-router that uses fixed-frequency transmon qubits to implement a routing protocol based on two native controlled-iSWAP gates. These gates leverage a large ZZ interaction to selectively route information according to a quantum address. We find an estimated average routing fidelity of 94.8%, with errors arising primarily from decoherence or state preparation and measurement. We present a comprehensive calibration and characterization of both the c-iSWAP gates and the overall routing protocol through randomized benchmarking techniques and state tomography.

Title: AppQSim: Application-oriented benchmarks for Hamiltonian simulation on a quantum computer
Authors: Etienne Granet, Henrik Dreyer
Abstract: We introduce AppQSim, a benchmarking suite for quantum computers focused on applications of Hamiltonian simulation. We consider five different settings for which we define a precise task and score: condensed matter and material simulation (dynamic and static properties), nuclear magnetic resonance simulation, chemistry ground state preparation, and classical optimization. These five different benchmark tasks display different resource requirements and scalability properties. We introduce a metric to evaluate the quality of the output of a tested quantum hardware, called distinguishability cost, defined as the minimal number of gates that a perfect quantum computer would have to run to certify that the output of the benchmarked hardware is incorrect.

Title: Overcoming user-rate limit of quantum network
Authors: Yuehan Xu, Qijun Zhang, Junpeng Zhang, Xiaojuan Liao, Ziyi Shen, Xu Liu, Beibei Zhang, Zicong Tan, Zehao Zhou, Jisheng Dai, Xueqin Jiang, Peng Huang, Tao Wang, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: Quantum networks revolutionize the way of information transmission and are an essential step in building a quantum internet. Generally, the information capacity per user-channel in a quantum network drastically decreases with the increase of network capacity, making it difficultly scale to large-user scenarios. To break this limit, we develop a quantum network architecture in which the information capacity per user-channel is independent of the network capacity (NCI-QN), and all previous quantum networks can be regarded as special examples. Three aspects are investigated. Firstly, a quantum network scheme formulated in a comprehensive multi-mode time-frequency representation is presented. Then, information characteristics of the proposed quantum network are delineated by expanding the well-known Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi (PLOB) bound and the Holevo bound from the linear combination of point-to-point links to a complex network architecture, demonstrating clear proofs of the network capacity independence. Finally, a practical NCI-QN with a network capacity of 19 is experimentally demonstrated using optical frequency comb in quantum key distribution network scenarios, in which the security under the asymptotic case, finite-size effect, composable security, and composable finite-size security are verified, with a secret key rate up to 8.75 Gbps. This achievement overcomes the user-rate limit of quantum network, which is the keystone for the development of the quantum internet.

Authors: Mario Collura, Guglielmo Lami, Nishan Ranabhat, Alessandro Santini
Abstract: This book serves as an introductory yet thorough guide to tensor networks and their applications in quantum computation and quantum information, designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate-level readers. In Part I, foundational topics are covered, including tensor structures and network representations like Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN). These preliminaries provide readers with the core mathematical tools and concepts necessary for quantum physics and quantum computing applications, bridging the gap between multi-linear algebra and complex quantum systems. Part II explores practical applications of tensor networks in simulating quantum dynamics, with a particular focus on the efficiency they offer for systems of high computational complexity. Key topics include Hamiltonian dynamics, quantum annealing, open system dynamics, and optimization strategies using TN frameworks. A final chapter addresses the emerging role of "quantum magic" in tensor networks. It delves into non-stabilizer states and their contribution to quantum computational power beyond classical simulability, featuring methods such as stabilizer-enhanced MPS and the Clifford-dressed TDVP.

Abstract: In the recent breakthrough result of Slofstra and Mastel (STOC'24), they show that there is a two-player one-round perfect zero-knowledge MIP* protocol for RE. We build on their result to show that there exists a succinct two-player one-round perfect zero-knowledge MIP* protocol for RE with polylog question size and O(1) answer size, or with O(1) question size and polylog answer size. To prove our result, we analyze the four central compression techniques underlying the MIP*= RE proof (Ji et al. '20) -- question reduction, oracularization, answer reduction, and parallel repetition -- and show that they all preserve the perfect (as well as statistical and computational) zero-knowledge properties of the original protocol. Furthermore, we complete the study of the conversion between constraint-constraint and constraint-variable binary constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games, which provide a quantum information characterization of MIP* protocols. While Paddock (QIP'23) established that any near-perfect strategy for a constraint-variable game can be mapped to a constraint-constraint version, we prove the converse, fully establishing their equivalence.

Title: Gradient-descent methods for fast quantum state tomography
Authors: Akshay Gaikwad, Manuel Sebastian Torres, Shahnawaz Ahmed, Anton Frisk Kockum
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a widely employed technique for characterizing the state of a quantum system. However, it is plagued by two fundamental challenges: computational and experimental complexity grows exponentially with the number of qubits, rendering experimental implementation and data post-processing arduous even for moderately sized systems. Here, we introduce gradient-descent (GD) algorithms for the post-processing step of QST in discrete- and continuous-variable systems. To ensure physically valid state reconstruction at each iteration step of the algorithm, we use various density-matrix parameterizations: Cholesky decomposition, Stiefel manifold, and projective normalization. These parameterizations have the added benefit of enabling a rank-controlled ansatz, which simplifies reconstruction when there is prior information about the system. We benchmark the performance of our GD-QST techniques against state-of-the-art methods, including constrained convex optimization, conditional generative adversarial networks, and iterative maximum likelihood estimation. Our comparison focuses on time complexity, iteration counts, data requirements, state rank, and robustness against noise. We find that rank-controlled ansatzes in our stochastic mini-batch GD-QST algorithms effectively handle noisy and incomplete data sets, yielding significantly higher reconstruction fidelity than other methods. Simulations achieving full-rank seven-qubit QST in under three minutes on a standard laptop, with 18 GB of RAM and no dedicated GPU, highlight that GD-QST is computationally more efficient and outperforms other techniques in most scenarios, offering a promising avenue for characterizing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Our Python code for GD-QST algorithms is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Scalable quantum simulator with an extended gate set in giant atoms
Authors: Guangze Chen, Anton Frisk Kockum
Abstract: Quantum computation and quantum simulation require a versatile gate set to optimize circuit compilation for practical applications. However, existing platforms are often limited to specific gate types or rely on parametric couplers to extend their gate set, which compromises scalability. Here, we propose a scalable quantum simulator with an extended gate set based on giant-atom three-level systems, which can be implemented with superconducting circuits. Unlike conventional small atoms, giant atoms couple to the environment at multiple points, introducing interference effects that allow exceptional tunability of their interactions. By leveraging this tunability, our setup supports both CZ and iSWAP gates through simple frequency adjustments, eliminating the need for parametric couplers. This dual-gate capability enhances circuit efficiency, reducing the overhead for quantum simulation. As a demonstration, we showcase the simulation of spin dynamics in dissipative Heisenberg XXZ spin chains, highlighting the setup's ability to tackle complex open quantum many-body dynamics. Finally, we discuss how a two-dimensional extension of our system could enable fault-tolerant quantum computation, paving the way for a universal quantum processor.

Title: Long-range nonstabilizerness from topology and correlation
Authors: Fuchuan Wei, Zi-Wen Liu
Abstract: Understanding nonstabilizerness (aka quantum magic) in many-body quantum systems, particularly its interplay with entanglement, represents an important quest in quantum computation and many-body physics. Drawing natural motivations from the study of quantum phases of matter and entanglement, we systematically investigate the notion of long-range magic (LRM), defined as nonstabilizerness that cannot be erased by constant-depth local circuits. By establishing connections to the Bravyi--K√∂nig theorem concerning the limitation of fault-tolerant logical gates, we show that certain families of topological stabilizer code states exhibit LRM. Then, we show that all ground states of topological orders that cannot be realized by topological stabilizer codes, such as Fibonacci topological order, exhibit LRM, which can be viewed as a ``no lowest-energy trivial magic'' result. Building on our considerations of LRM, we discuss the classicality of short-range magic from e.g.~preparation and learning perspectives, and put forward a ``no low-energy trivial magic'' (NLTM) conjecture that has key motivation in the quantum PCP context. We also connect two-point correlations with LRM, demonstrating certain LRM state families by correlation properties. Most of our proof techniques do not depend on geometric locality and can potentially be extended to systems with general connectivity. Our study leverages and sheds new light on the interactions between quantum resources, coding and fault tolerance theory, complexity theory, and many-body physics.

Title: Conclusive exclusion of quantum states with group action
Authors: Hongshun Yao, Xin Wang
Abstract: Retrieving classical information from quantum systems is central to quantum information processing. As a more general task than quantum state discrimination which focuses on identifying the exact state, quantum state exclusion only requires ruling out options, revealing fundamental limits of information extraction from quantum systems. In this work, we study conclusive state exclusion of quantum states under group actions. First, we establish explicit criteria for achieving conclusive exclusion for states under group actions. For complex symmetries, including finite groups and compact Lie groups, we derive a sufficient condition for exclusive exclusion based solely on amplitudes of the seed state and group structure parameters. Second, as applications to special groups such as Abelian groups, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for conclusive state exclusion and generalize the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph result to a wider range of scenarios. Third, we explore zero-error communication via conclusive exclusion of quantum states and derive a lower bound on the feedback-assisted and non-signalling-assisted zero-error capacity of classical-quantum channels generated by group actions.

Title: Calibrating Magnetic Flux Control in Superconducting Circuits by Compensating Distortions on Time Scales from Nanoseconds up to Tens of Microseconds
Authors: Christoph Hellings, Nathan Lacroix, Ants Remm, Richard Boell, Johannes Herrmann, Stefania LazƒÉr, Sebastian Krinner, Fran√ßois Swiadek, Christian Kraglund Andersen, Christopher Eichler, Andreas Wallraff
Abstract: Fast tuning of the transition frequency of superconducting qubits using magnetic flux is essential, for example, for realizing high-fidelity two-qubit gates with low leakage or for reducing errors in dispersive qubit readout. To apply accurately shaped flux pulses, signal distortions induced by the flux control lines need to be carefully compensated for. This requires their in situ characterization at the reference plane of the qubit. However, many existing approaches are limited in time resolution or in pulse duration. Here, we overcome these limitations and demonstrate accurate flux control with sub-permille residual frequency errors on time scales ranging from nanoseconds to tens of microseconds. We achieve this by combining two complementary methods to characterize and compensate for pulse distortions. We have deployed this approach successfully in a quantum error correction experiment calibrating 24 flux-activated two-qubit gates. Reliable calibration methods, as the ones presented here, are essential in experiments scaling up superconducting quantum processors.

Title: On the Random Schr√∂dinger Equation and Geometric Quantum Control
Authors: Rufus Lawrence, Ale≈° Wodecki, Johannes Aspman, Jakub Mareƒçek
Abstract: We introduce the random Schr√∂dinger equation, with a noise term given by a random Hermitian matrix as a means to model noisy quantum systems. We derive bounds on the error of the synthesised unitary in terms of bounds on the norm of the noise, and show that for certain noise processes these bounds are tight. We then show that in certain situations, minimising the error is equivalent to finding a geodesic on SU (n) with respect to a Riemannian metric encoding the coupling between the control pulse and the noise process. Our work thus extends the series of seminal papers by Nielsen et al. on the geometry of quantum gate complexity.

Title: Optimal interpolation-based coordinate descent method for parameterized quantum circuits
Authors: Zhijian Lai, Jiang Hu, Taehee Ko, Jiayuan Wu, Dong An
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits appear ubiquitously in the design of many quantum algorithms, such as variational quantum algorithms, where the optimization of parameters is crucial for algorithmic efficiency. In this work, we propose an Optimal Interpolation-based Coordinate Descent (OICD) method to solve the parameter optimization problem that arises in parameterized quantum circuits. Our OICD method employs an interpolation technique to approximate the cost function of a parameterized quantum circuit, effectively recovering its trigonometric characteristics, then performs an argmin update on a single parameter per iteration on a classical computer. We determine the optimal interpolation nodes in our OICD method to mitigate the impact of statistical errors from quantum measurements. Additionally, for the case of equidistant frequencies -- commonly encountered when the Hermitian generators are Pauli operators -- we show that the optimal interpolation nodes are equidistant nodes, and our OICD method can simultaneously minimize the mean squared error, the condition number of the interpolation matrix, and the average variance of derivatives of the cost function. We perform numerical simulations of our OICD method using Qiskit Aer and test its performance on the maxcut problem, the transverse field Ising model, and the XXZ model. Numerical results imply that our OICD method is more efficient than the commonly used stochastic gradient descent method and the existing random coordinate descent method.

Title: Characterization and Mitigation of Crosstalk in Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Zeyuan Zhou, Andrew Ji, Yongshan Ding
Abstract: The design and performance analysis of quantum error correction (QEC) codes are often based on incoherent and independent noise models since it is easy to simulate. However, these models fail to capture realistic hardware noise sources, such as correlated errors (crosstalk), which can significantly impact QEC code performance, especially when they occur between data and ancillary qubits. In this paper, we systematically study various types of crosstalk noise and quantify their effects on surface codes through memory and stability experiments. Based on our findings, we introduce crosstalk-robust implementations of QEC via redundant stabilizer checks and flag qubit designs. In addition, we analyze logical crosstalk in an $[[n,k>1,d]]$ code block and establish analytical conditions under which physical crosstalk does not lead to logical crosstalk. Together, our analytical and numerical results shed light on designing QEC codes that are robust against hardware-realistic noise, paving the way for reliable experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: Anyon Theory and Topological Frustration of High-Efficiency Quantum LDPC Codes
Authors: Keyang Chen, Yuanting Liu, Yiming Zhang, Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen, Ke Liu, Hao Song
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes present a promising route to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet systematic strategies for their exploration remain underdeveloped. In this work, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. Besides providing efficient characterizations for demonstrations using Gr√∂bner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein--Khovanskii--Kushnirenko theorem, allowing us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choice of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasi-fractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their inherent link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and offer an efficient method for searching for finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced mathematical structures.

Title: Scalable and Site-Specific Frequency Tuning of Two-Level System Defects in Superconducting Qubit Arrays
Authors: Larry Chen, Kan-Heng Lee, Chuan-Hong Liu, Brian Marinelli, Ravi K. Naik, Ziqi Kang, Noah Goss, Hyunseong Kim, David I. Santiago, Irfan Siddiqi
Abstract: State-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors containing tens to hundreds of qubits have demonstrated the building blocks for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Nonetheless, a fundamental barrier to scaling further is the prevalence of fluctuating quantum two-level system (TLS) defects that can couple resonantly to qubits, causing excess decoherence and enhanced gate errors. Here we introduce a scalable architecture for site-specific and in-situ manipulation of TLS frequencies out of the spectral vicinity of our qubits. Our method is resource efficient, combining TLS frequency tuning and universal single qubit control into a single on-chip control line per qubit. We independently control each qubit's dissipative environment to dynamically improve both qubit coherence times and single qubit gate fidelities -- with a constant time overhead that does not scale with the device size. Over a period of 40 hours across 6 qubits, we demonstrate a $36\%$ improvement in average single qubit error rates and a $17\%$ improvement in average energy relaxation times. Critically, we realize a 4-fold suppression in the occurrence of TLS-induced performance outliers, and a complete reduction of simultaneous outlier events. These results mark a significant step toward overcoming the challenges that TLS defects pose to scaling superconducting quantum processors.

Title: Routing Dynamics in Distributed Quantum Networks
Authors: Mst Shapna Akter, Md. Shazzad Hossain Shaon, Tasmin Karim, Md. Fahim Sultan, Emran Kanaan
Abstract: Distributed quantum networks are not merely information conduits but intricate systems that embody the principles of quantum mechanics. In our study, we examine the underlying mechanisms of quantum connectivity within a distributed framework by exploring phenomena such as superposition and entanglement and their influence on information propagation. We investigate how these fundamental quantum effects interact with routing strategies that, while inspired by classical methods, must contend with quantum decoherence and measurement uncertainties. By simulating distributed networks of 10, 20, 50 and 100 nodes, we assess the performance of routing mechanisms through metrics that reflect both quantum fidelity and operational efficiency. Our findings reveal that the quantum coherence inherent in entangled states can enhance routing fidelity under specific conditions, yet also introduce challenges such as increased computational overhead and sensitivity to network scale. This work bridges the gap between the underlying principles of quantum systems and practical routing implementations, offering new insights into the design of robust distributed quantum networks.

Title: Constrained many-body phases in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Higgs lattice gauge theory
Authors: Alexander Schuckert, Stefan K√ºhn, Kevin C. Smith, Eleanor Crane, Steven M. Girvin
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to soft-core bosonic matter at unit filling, inspired by the Higgs sector of the standard model. Through a combination of analytical perturbative approaches, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram driven by gauge-field-mediated resonant pair hopping and the confinement of single particles. The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions. The bunching state crosses over into a pair superfluid phase as the on-site interaction increases, characterized by a finite superfluid density and powerlaw-decaying pair correlations. At large on-site interaction strengths and driven by effective interactions induced by the gauge constraint, the superfluid transitions into an incompressible pair Mott insulator phase. At weak field strengths and on-site interactions, we find a plasma-like region, where single bosons exhibit large short-range correlations and the ground state is composed almost equally of states with even and odd local boson occupation. The presence of a bunching state with large number fluctuations, which is difficult to study using classical numerics, motivates experimental realizations in hybrid boson-qubit quantum simulation platforms such as circuit QED, neutral atoms, and trapped ions. Our findings highlight the rich interplay between gauge fields and soft-core bosonic matter.

Title: A Quantum Good Authentication Protocol
Authors: Shuangbao Wang
Abstract: This article presents a novel network protocol that incorporates a quantum photonic channel for symmetric key distribution, a Dilithium signature to replace factor-based public key cryptography for enhanced authentication, security, and privacy. The protocol uses strong hash functions to hash original messages and verify heightened data integrity at the destination. This Quantum Good Authentication Protocol (QGP) provides high-level security provided by the theory of quantum mechanics. QGP also has the advantage of quantum-resistant data protection that prevents current digital computer and future quantum computer attacks. QGP transforms the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) by adding a quantum layer at the bottom of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model (layer 0) and modifying the top layer (layer 7) with Dilithium signatures, thus improving the security of the original OSI model. In addition, QGP incorporates strong encryption, hardware-based quantum channels, post-quantum signatures, and secure hash algorithms over a platform of decryptors, switches, routers, and network controllers to form a testbed of the next-generation, secure quantum internet. The experiments presented here show that QGP provides secure authentication and improved security and privacy and can be adopted as a new protocol for the next-generation quantum Internet.

Title: The Dirac equation in General Relativity and the 3+1 formalism
Authors: Miguel Alcubierre
Abstract: I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity. Although the generalization of the Dirac equation to a curved spacetime is well known, it is not usually part of the standard toolkit of techniques known to people working on classical general relativity. Recently, there has been some renewed interest in studying solutions of the Einstein--Dirac system of equations, particularly in the context of the so-called ``Dirac stars''. Motivated by this, here I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity, starting from Minkowski spacetime, and then considering the Lorentz group and the tetrad formalism in order to generalize this equation to the case of a curved spacetime. I also derive the form of the Dirac equation and its associated stress--energy tensor for the case of the 3+1 formalism of general relativity, which can be useful for the study of the evolution of the Dirac field in a dynamical spacetime.

Title: Image Computation for Quantum Transition Systems
Authors: Xin Hong, Dingchao Gao, Sanjiang Li, Shenggang Ying, Mingsheng Ying
Abstract: With the rapid progress in quantum hardware and software, the need for verification of quantum systems becomes increasingly crucial. While model checking is a dominant and very successful technique for verifying classical systems, its application to quantum systems is still an underdeveloped research area. This paper advances the development of model checking quantum systems by providing efficient image computation algorithms for quantum transition systems, which play a fundamental role in model checking. In our approach, we represent quantum circuits as tensor networks and design algorithms by leveraging the properties of tensor networks and tensor decision diagrams. Our experiments demonstrate that our contraction partition-based algorithm can greatly improve the efficiency of image computation for quantum transition systems.

Title: Compact and fully functional high-frequency sine wave gating InGaAs/InP single-photon detector module
Authors: Qi Xu, Chao Yu, Dajian Cui, Xuan-Yi Zhang, Wei Chen, Yu-Qiang Fang, Lianjun Jiang, Qixia Tong, Jianglin Zhao, Jun Zhang
Abstract: High-frequency sine wave gating (SWG) InGaAs/InP single-photon detectors (SPDs) are widely used for synchronous near-infrared single-photon detection. For practical use, the size of SPD is one of the most concerning features for system integration. Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the most compact and fully functional high-frequency SWG InGaAs/InP SPD. We develop a sine wave gating integrated circuit (SWGIC) using system-in-package technology that supports functions including large amplitude sine wave gate generation, coincidence gate generation, phase regulation, amplitude monitoring, and amplitude modulation. Moreover, we design and fabricate a high-performance multi-mode fiber coupled InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) with a compact butterfly package. Furthermore, we implement a monolithically integrated readout circuit (MIRC) to extract the weak avalanche signal from large capacitance response of SWG. Finally, the SWGIC, SPAD, MIRC, and the affiliated circuits are integrated into a single module with a size of 6 cm x 5.7 cm x 1.7 cm. After characterization, the SPD module exhibits a photon detection efficiency of 40%, a dark count rate of 9 kcps, and an afterpulse probability of 4.6% at an operation temperature of 238 K and a hold-off time of 160 ns. Our work provides a practical solution for applications necessitating highly integrated near-infrared single-photon detection.

Title: Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning in the Presence of Epistemic Ambivalence
Authors: Alireza Habibi, Saeed Ghoorchian, Setareh Maghsudi
Abstract: The complexity of online decision-making under uncertainty stems from the requirement of finding a balance between exploiting known strategies and exploring new possibilities. Naturally, the uncertainty type plays a crucial role in developing decision-making strategies that manage complexity effectively. In this paper, we focus on a specific form of uncertainty known as epistemic ambivalence (EA), which emerges from conflicting pieces of evidence or contradictory experiences. It creates a delicate interplay between uncertainty and confidence, distinguishing it from epistemic uncertainty that typically diminishes with new information. Indeed, ambivalence can persist even after additional knowledge is acquired. To address this phenomenon, we propose a novel framework, called the epistemically ambivalent Markov decision process (EA-MDP), aiming to understand and control EA in decision-making processes. This framework incorporates the concept of a quantum state from the quantum mechanics formalism, and its core is to assess the probability and reward of every possible outcome. We calculate the reward function using quantum measurement techniques and prove the existence of an optimal policy and an optimal value function in the EA-MDP framework. We also propose the EA-epsilon-greedy Q-learning algorithm. To evaluate the impact of EA on decision-making and the expedience of our framework, we study two distinct experimental setups, namely the two-state problem and the lattice problem. Our results show that using our methods, the agent converges to the optimal policy in the presence of EA.

Title: Quantumness and entropic uncertainty for a pair of static Unruh-DeWitt detectors
Authors: Yu-Kun Zhang, Tariq Aziz, Li-Juan Li, Xue-Ke Song, Liu Ye, Dong Wang
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a pair of detectors operating in Minkowski space-time and analyze the characteristics of various quantum resources within this framework. Specifically, we focus on examining the properties of Bell nonlocality, quantum coherence, the nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence (NAQC), and measured uncertainty in relation to the energy ratio and the distance between the detectors. Additionally, we examine how the initial states influence these quantum properties. Notably, our findings reveal that both a larger energy ratio and a greater separation between the detectors degrade the system's quantumness. Moreover, we explore the evolution of entropic uncertainty and demonstrate its inverse correlation with both Bell nonlocality and coherence, highlighting the intricate interplay between these quantum resources. These insights provide a deeper understanding of quantumness in a relativistic framework and may contribute to the ongoing discussion on the black hole information paradox.

Title: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms for Molecular Docking
Authors: Christos Papalitsas, Yanfei Guan, Shreyas Waghe, Athanasios Liakos, Ioannis Balatsos, Vassilios Pantazopoulos
Abstract: Molecular docking is a critical process for drug discovery and challenging due to the complexity and size of biomolecular systems, where the optimal binding configuration of a drug to a target protein is determined. Hybrid classical-quantum computing techniques offer a novel approach to address these challenges. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its variations are hybrid classical-quantum techniques, and a promising tool for combinatorial optimization challenges. This paper presents a Digitized Counterdiabatic QAOA (DC-QAOA) approach to molecular docking. Simulated quantum runs were conducted on a GPU cluster. We examined 14 and 17 nodes instances - to the best of our knowledge the biggest published instance is 12-node at Ding et al. and we present the results. Based on computational results, we conclude that binding interactions represent the anticipated exact solution. Additionally, as the size of the examined instance increases, the computational times exhibit a significant escalation.

Title: Minimizing sensor-sample distances in scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry
Authors: Zhewen Xu, Marius L. Palm, William S. Huxter, Konstantin Herb, John M. Abendroth, Karim Bouzehouane, Olivier Boulle, Mihai S. Gabor, Joseba Urrestarazu Larranaga, Andrea Morales, Jan Rhensius, Gabriel F. Puebla-Hellmann, Christian L. Degen
Abstract: Scanning magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has led to significant advances in the sensitive imaging of magnetic systems. The spatial resolution of the technique, however, remains limited to tens to hundreds of nanometers, even for probes where NV centers are engineered within 10 nm from the tip apex. Here, we present a correlated investigation of the crucial parameters that determine the spatial resolution: the mechanical and magnetic stand-off distances, as well as the sub-surface NV center depth in diamond. We study their contributions using mechanical approach curves, photoluminescence measurements, magnetometry scans, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of surface adsorbates. We first show that the stand-off distance is mainly limited by features on the surface of the diamond tip, hindering mechanical access. Next, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) feedback partially overcomes this issue, leading to closer and more consistent magnetic stand-off distances (26-87 nm) compared to the more common amplitude-modulated (AM-AFM) feedback (43-128 nm). FM operation thus permits improved magnetic imaging of sub-100-nm spin textures, shown for the spin cycloid in BFO and domain walls in a CoFeB synthetic antiferromagnet. Finally, by examining 1H and 19F NMR signals in soft contact with a polytetrafluoroethylene surface, we demonstrate a minimum NV-to-sample distance of 7.9+/-0.4 nm.

Title: Bi-Lipschitz Ansatz for Anti-Symmetric Functions
Authors: Nadav Dym, Jianfeng Lu, Matan Mizrachi
Abstract: Motivated by applications for simulating quantum many body functions, we propose a new universal ansatz for approximating anti-symmetric functions. The main advantage of this ansatz over previous alternatives is that it is bi-Lipschitz with respect to a naturally defined metric. As a result, we are able to obtain quantitative approximation results for approximation of Lipschitz continuous antisymmetric functions. Moreover, we provide preliminary experimental evidence to the improved performance of this ansatz for learning antisymmetric functions.

Title: Identifying high-energy electronic states of NV$^-$ centers in diamond
Authors: Minh Tuan Luu, Christopher Linder√§lv, Zsolt Benedek, √Åd√°m Ganyecz, Gergely Barcza, Viktor Iv√°dy, Ronald Ulbricht
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond is a prototype photoluminescent point defect spin qubit with promising quantum technology applications, enabled by its efficient optical spin polarization and readout. Its low-lying electronic states and optical spin polarization cycle have been well characterized over decades, establishing it as a benchmark system for state-of-the-art computational methods in point defect research. While the optical cycle is well understood, a comprehensive energetic analysis of higher-lying states has received less attention until recently. In this joint experimental theoretical study, we identify and characterize five high-energy states beyond those involved in the optical cycle. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we determine their transition energies and relative oscillator strengths. Additionally, we perform two independent numerical studies employing two state-of-the-art post-DFT methods to support the experimental findings and assign energy levels. These results enhance our understanding of the NV center's energy spectrum and providing a broader reference for benchmarking high-level first-principles methods.

Title: Limitations of the paraxial beam model in the study of quantum vacuum signals
Authors: Felix Karbstein, Fabian Sch√ºtze
Abstract: Studies of nonlinear quantum vacuum signals often model the driving laser fields as paraxial beams. This in particular holds for analytic approaches. While this allows for reliable predictions in most situations, there are also notable exceptions. A prominent example is the overestimation of the polarization-flipped signal photon yield in the collision of two equally focused, parallel polarized laser beams by a factor of about six. In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on the example of two linearly polarized laser pulses colliding at a generic collision angle.

Title: Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir√© matter beyond one billion sites
Authors: Yitao Sun, Marcel Niedermeier, Tiago V. C. Ant√£o, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Moir√© and super-moir√© materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir√© systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir√© materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir√© systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir√© quantum matter.

Title: Observation of non-adiabatic Landau-Zener tunneling among Floquet states
Authors: Yun Yen, Marcel Reutzel, Andi Li, Zehua Wang, Hrvoje Petek, Michael Sch√ºler
Abstract: Electromagnetic fields not only induce electronic transitions but also fundamentally modify the quantum states of matter through strong light-matter interactions. As one established route, Floquet engineering provides a powerful framework to dress electronic states with time-periodic fields, giving rise to quasi-stationary Floquet states. With increasing field strength, non-perturbative responses of the dressed states emerge, yet their nonlinear dynamics remain challenging to interpret. In this work we explore the emergence of non-adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions among Floquet states in Cu(111) under intense optical fields. At increasing field strength, we observe a transition from perturbative dressing to a regime where Floquet states undergo non-adiabatic tunneling, revealing a breakdown of adiabatic Floquet evolution. These insights are obtained through interferometrically time-resolved multi-photon photoemission spectroscopy, which serves as a sensitive probe of transient Floquet state dynamics. Numerical simulations and the theory of instantaneous Floquet states allow us to directly examine real-time excitation pathways in this non-perturbative photoemission regime. Our results establish a direct connection the onset of light-dressing of matter, non-perturbative ultrafast lightwave electronics, and high-optical-harmonic generation in the solids.

Title: Nonlinear Nanophotonics for High-Dimensional Quantum States
Authors: Liat Nemirovsky-Levy, Amit Kam, Meir Lederman, Meir Orenstein, Uzi Pereg, Guy Bartal, Mordechai Segev
Abstract: Quantum nanophotonics merges the precision of nanoscale light manipulation with the capabilities of quantum technologies, offering a pathway for enhanced light-matter interaction and compact realization of quantum devices. Here, we show how a recently-demonstrated nonlinear nanophotonic process can be employed to selectively create photonic high-dimensional quantum states (qudits). We utilize the nonlinearity on the surface of the nanophotonic device to dress, through the polarization of the pump field, the near-field modes carrying angular momentum and their superpositions. We then use this approach for the realization of a multilevel quantum key distribution protocol, which doubles the key rate compared to standard schemes. This idea is an important step towards experimental realizations of quantum state generation and manipulation through nonlinearity within nanophotonic platforms, and enables new capabilities for on-chip quantum devices.

Title: Detection of 2D SPT Order with Partial Symmetries
Authors: Alex Turzillo, Naren Manjunath, Jose Garre-Rubio
Abstract: A method of using partial symmetries to distinguish two dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of on-site, unitary symmetries is proposed. This novel order parameter takes a wavefunction, such as a ground state of a lattice model, and detects its SPT invariants as expectation values of finitely supported operators, without the need for flux insertion. The construction exploits the rotational symmetry of the lattice to extract on-site SPT invariants, building upon prior work on probing crystalline SPT phases with partial rotations. The method is demonstrated by computing the order parameter analytically on group cohomology models and numerically on a family of states interpolating between the CZX state and a trivial state. Its robustness is suggested by interpreting partial symmetries as generating the topological partition functions of lens spaces.

Title: Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats
Authors: Daniel Boyanovsky
Abstract: In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.

Title: A New Proof of the QNEC
Authors: Stefan Hollands, Roberto Longo
Abstract: We give a simplified proof of the quantum null energy condition (QNEC). Our proof is based on an explicit formula for the shape derivative of the relative entropy, with respect to an entangling cut. It allows bypassing the analytic continuation arguments of a previous proof by Ceyhan and Faulkner and can be used e.g., for defining entropy current fluctuations.

Title: Electrically-Small Rydberg Sensor for Three-Dimensional Determination of rf k-Vectors
Authors: Peter K. Elgee, Kevin C. Cox, Joshua C. Hill, Paul D. Kunz, David H. Meyer
Abstract: We present an electrically-small Rydberg atom electric field sensor with the ability to extract the three-dimensional $k$-vector of an elliptically polarized radio frequency (rf) field. In most mediums, the $k$-vector (or wave vector) provides the direction of propagation of an electromagnetic wave. Our method uses a field vector measurement at a single point in space and is thus compatible with a sensor volume that is arbitrarily small compared to the carrier wavelength. We measure the $k$-vector of a circularly polarized signal field with average absolute errors in the polar and azimuthal angles of $33~\text{mrad}$ and $43~\text{mrad}$ respectively, and statistical noise of $1.3~\text{mrad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and $1.5~\text{mrad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Additionally, we characterize the performance of the sensor as a function of the ellipticity of the input field and the size of the sensing region. We find that the sensor works over a broad range of ellipticities and validate that an electrically-small sensing region is optimal.

Title: Ultrahigh free-electron Kerr nonlinearity in all-semiconductor waveguides for all-optical nonlinear modulation of mid-infrared light
Authors: Gonzalo √Ålvarez-P√©rez, Huatian Hu, Fangcheng Huang, Tadele Orbula Otomalo, Michele Ortolani, Cristian Cirac√¨
Abstract: Nonlinear optical waveguides, particularly those harnessing the optical Kerr effect, are promising for advancing next-generation photonic technologies. Despite the Kerr effect`s ultrafast response, its inherently weak nonlinearity has hindered practical applications. Here, we explore free-electron-induced Kerr nonlinearities in all-semiconductor waveguides, revealing that longitudinal bulk plasmons (inherently nonlocal excitations) can generate exceptionally strong Kerr nonlinearities. We specifically develop a nonlinear eigenmode analysis integrated with semiclassical hydrodynamic theory to compute the linear and nonlinear optical responses originating from the quantum behavior of free electrons in heavily doped semiconductors. These waveguides achieve ultrahigh nonlinear coefficients exceeding 10$^7$ W$^{-1}$km$^{-1}$ and support long-propagating modes with propagation distances over 100 $\mu$m. Additionally, we confirm the robustness of the nonlinear response under realistic conditions by considering viscoelastic and nonlinear damping mechanisms. Finally, we implement our all-semiconductor waveguides in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, demonstrating efficient nonlinear modulation of the transmittance spectrum via the free-electron Kerr effect. This work evidences the transformative potential of free-electron nonlinearities in heavily doped semiconductors for photonic integrated circuits, paving the way for scalable on-chip nonlinear nanophotonic systems.

Title: Quantum computation with indefinite causal structures
Authors: Mateus Ara√∫jo, Philippe Allard Gu√©rin, √Ñmin Baumeler
Abstract: One way to study the physical plausibility of closed timelike curves (CTCs) is to examine their computational power. This has been done for Deutschian CTCs (D-CTCs) and post-selection CTCs (P-CTCs), with the result that they allow for the efficient solution of problems in PSPACE and PP, respectively. Since these are extremely powerful complexity classes, which are not expected to be solvable in reality, this can be taken as evidence that these models for CTCs are pathological. This problem is closely related to the nonlinearity of this models, which also allows for example cloning quantum states, in the case of D-CTCs, or distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states, in the case of P-CTCs. In contrast, the process matrix formalism allows one to model indefinite causal structures in a linear way, getting rid of these effects, and raising the possibility that its computational power is rather tame. In this paper we show that process matrices correspond to a linear particular case of P-CTCs, and therefore that its computational power is upperbounded by that of PP. We show, furthermore, a family of processes that can violate causal inequalities but nevertheless can be simulated by a causally ordered quantum circuit with only a constant overhead, showing that indefinite causality is not necessarily hard to simulate.

Title: Quantum reinforcement learning in continuous action space
Authors: Shaojun Wu, Shan Jin, Dingding Wen, Donghong Han, Xiaoting Wang
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) is a promising paradigm for near-term quantum devices. While existing QRL methods have shown success in discrete action spaces, extending these techniques to continuous domains is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality introduced by discretization. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a quantum Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm that efficiently addresses both classical and quantum sequential decision problems in continuous action spaces. Moreover, our approach facilitates single-shot quantum state generation: a one-time optimization produces a model that outputs the control sequence required to drive a fixed initial state to any desired target state. In contrast, conventional quantum control methods demand separate optimization for each target state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and discuss its potential applications in quantum control.

Title: Incompatible observables in classical physics: A closer look at measurement in Hamiltonian mechanics
Authors: David Theurel
Abstract: Quantum theory famously entails the existence of incompatible measurements; pairs of observables which cannot be simultaneously measured to arbitrary precision. Incompatibility is widely regarded to be a uniquely quantum phenomenon, linked to failure to commute of quantum operators. Even in the face of deep parallels between quantum commutators and classical Poisson brackets, no connection has been established between the Poisson algebra and any intrinsic limitations to classical measurement. Here I examine measurement in classical Hamiltonian physics as a process involving the joint evolution of an object-system and a finite-temperature measuring apparatus. Instead of the ideal measurement capable of extracting information without disturbing the system, I find a Heisenberg-like precision-disturbance relation: Measuring an observable leaves all Poisson-commuting observables undisturbed but inevitably disturbs all non-Poisson-commuting observables. In this relation the role of h-bar is played by an apparatus-specific quantity, q-bar. While not a universal constant, q-bar takes a finite positive value for any apparatus that can be built. I show that a classical version of Ozawa's model of quantum measurement, originally proposed as a means to violate the Heisenberg relation, does not violate the classical relation. Hence, incompatibility may prove to be a feature not only of quantum, but of classical physics too. This approach points the way to studying the Bayesian epistemology of classical physics, which was until now assumed to be trivial. It now seems possible that it is non-trivial and bears a resemblance to the quantum formalism. These findings may be of interest to researchers working on foundations of quantum mechanics, particularly for psi-epistemic interpretations. And there may be applications in the fields of precision measurement, nanoengineering and molecular machines.

Title: Prog-QAOA: Framework for resource-efficient quantum optimization through classical programs
Authors: Bence Bak√≥, Adam Glos, √ñzlem Salehi, Zolt√°n Zimbor√°s
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms require representing the original problem as a binary optimization problem, which is then converted into an equivalent cost Hamiltonian suitable for the quantum device. Implementing each term of the cost Hamiltonian separately often results in high redundancy, significantly increasing the resources required. Instead, we propose to design classical programs for computing the objective function and certifying the constraints, and later compile them to quantum circuits, eliminating the reliance on the binary optimization problem representation. This results in a new variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which we name the Program-based QAOA (Prog-QAOA). We exploit this idea for optimization tasks like the Travelling Salesman Problem and Max-$K$-Cut and obtain circuits that are near-optimal with respect to all relevant cost measures, e.g., number of qubits, gates, and circuit depth. While we demonstrate the power of Prog-QAOA only for a particular set of paradigmatic problems, our approach is conveniently applicable to generic optimization problems.

Title: Autonomous Recognition of Erroneous Raw Key Bit Bias in Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Matt Young, Marco Lucamarini, Stefano Pirandola
Abstract: As Quantum Key Distribution technologies mature, it is pertinent to consider these systems in contexts beyond lab settings, and how these systems may have to operate autonomously. To begin, an abstract definition of a type of error that can occur with regard to the ratio of bit values in the raw key is presented, and how this has an impact on the security and key rate of QKD protocols. A mechanism by which errors of this type can be autonomously recognised is given, along with simulated results. A two part countermeasure that can be put in place to mitigate against errors of this type is also given. Finally some motivating examples where this type of error could appear in practice are presented to add context, and to illustrate the importance of this work to the development of Quantum Key Distribution technologies.

Title: Variational method for learning Quantum Channels via Stinespring Dilation on neutral atom systems
Authors: L.Y. Visser, R.J.P.T. de Keijzer, O. Tse, S.J.J.M.F. Kokkelmans
Abstract: Real-world quantum systems interact with their environments, leading to the irreversible dynamics described by the Lindblad equation. Solutions to the Lindblad equation give rise to quantum channels $\Phi_t$ that characterize the evolution of density matrices as $\rho(t) = \Phi_t(\rho_0)$. In many quantum experiments, the observation windows are limited by experimental instability or technological constraints. Nevertheless, extending the evolution of the state beyond this window may be valuable for identifying sources of decoherence and dephasing or determining the steady state of the evolution. In this work, we propose a method to approximate an arbitrary target quantum channel by variationally constructing equivalent unitary operations on an extended system, leveraging the Stinespring dilation theorem. We also present an experimentally feasible approach to extrapolate the quantum channel in discrete time steps beyond the period covered by the training data. Our approach takes advantage of the unique capability of neutral-atom quantum computers to spatially transport entangled qubits, an essential feature for implementing our method. The approach demonstrates significant predictive power for approximating non-trivial quantum channels.

Title: Nonlinear response theory for lossy superconducting quantum circuits
Authors: V. Vadimov, M. Xu, J. T. Stockburger, J. Ankerhold, M. M√∂tt√∂nen
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact and computationally feasible nonlinear-response theory developed for lossy superconducting quantum circuits based on a framework of quantum dissipation in a minimally extended state space. Starting from the Feynman--Vernon path integral formalism for open quantum systems with the system degrees of freedom being the nonlinear elements of the circuit, we eliminate the temporally non-local influence functional of all linear elements by introducing auxiliary harmonic modes with complex-valued frequencies coupled to the nonlinear elements. In our work, we propose a concept of time-averaged observables, inspired by experiment, and provide an explicit formula for producing their quasiprobability distribution. We illustrate the consistency of our formalism with the well-established Markovian input-output theory by applying them the dispersive readout of a superconducting transmon qubit. For an important demonstration of our approach beyond weak coupling, we analyze the low-frequency linear response of a capacitively and resistively shunted Josephson junction and observe signatures of a much-debated quantum phase transition at a finite temperature. The developed framework enables a comprehensive fully quantum-mechanical treatment of nonlinear quantum circuits coupled to their environment, without the limitations of typical approaches to weak dissipation, high temperature, and weak drive. This versatile tool paves the way for accurate models of quantum devices and increased fundamental understanding of quanutm mechanics such as that of the quantum measurement.

Title: Learning finitely correlated states: stability of the spectral reconstruction
Authors: Marco Fanizza, Niklas Galke, Josep Lumbreras, Cambyse Rouz√©, Andreas Winter
Abstract: Matrix product operators allow efficient descriptions (or realizations) of states on a 1D lattice. We consider the task of learning a realization of minimal dimension from copies of an unknown state, such that the resulting operator is close to the density matrix in trace norm. For finitely correlated translation-invariant states on an infinite chain, a realization of minimal dimension can be exactly reconstructed via linear algebra operations from the marginals of a size depending on the representation dimension. We establish a bound on the trace norm error for an algorithm that estimates a candidate realization from estimates of these marginals and outputs a matrix product operator, estimating the state of a chain of arbitrary length $t$. This bound allows us to establish an $O(t^2)$ upper bound on the sample complexity of the learning task, with an explicit dependence on the site dimension, realization dimension and spectral properties of a certain map constructed from the state. A refined error bound can be proven for $C^*$-finitely correlated states, which have an operational interpretation in terms of sequential quantum channels applied to the memory system. We can also obtain an analogous error bound for a class of matrix product density operators on a finite chain reconstructible by local marginals. In this case, a linear number of marginals must be estimated, obtaining a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(t^3)$. The learning algorithm also works for states that are sufficiently close to a finitely correlated state, with the potential of providing competitive algorithms for other interesting families of states.

Title: Dicke superradiant enhancement of the heat current in circuit QED
Authors: Gian Marcello Andolina, Paolo Andrea Erdman, Frank No√©, Jukka Pekola, Marco Schir√≤
Abstract: Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.

Title: Computational complexity of isometric tensor network states
Authors: Daniel Malz, Rahul Trivedi
Abstract: We determine the computational power of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS), a variational ansatz originally developed to numerically find and compute properties of gapped ground states and topological states in two dimensions. By mapping 2D isoTNS to 1+1D unitary quantum circuits, we find that computing local expectation values in isoTNS is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete. We then introduce injective isoTNS, which are those isoTNS that are the unique ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians, and which are characterized by an injectivity parameter $\delta\in(0,1/D]$, where $D$ is the bond dimension of the isoTNS. We show that injectivity necessarily adds depolarizing noise to the circuit at a rate $\eta=\delta^2D^2$. We show that weakly injective isoTNS (small $\delta$) are still $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, but that there exists an efficient classical algorithm to compute local expectation values in strongly injective isoTNS ($\eta\geq0.41$). Sampling from isoTNS corresponds to monitored quantum dynamics and we exhibit a family of isoTNS that undergo a phase transition from a hard regime to an easy phase where the monitored circuit can be sampled efficiently. Our results can be used to design provable algorithms to contract isoTNS. Our mapping between ground states of certain frustration-free Hamiltonians to open circuit dynamics in one dimension fewer may be of independent interest.

Title: Efficient classical algorithm for simulating boson sampling with heterogeneous partial distinguishability
Authors: S.N. van den Hoven, E. Kanis, J. J. Renema
Abstract: Boson sampling is one of the leading protocols for demonstrating a quantum advantage, but the theory of how this protocol responds to noise is still incomplete. We extend the theory of classical simulation of boson sampling with partial distinguishability to the case where the degree of indistinguishability between photon pairs is different between different pairs.

Title: Impact of chaos on the excited-state quantum phase transition of the Kerr parametric oscillator
Authors: Ignacio Garc√≠a-Mata, Miguel A. Prado Reynoso, Rodrigo G. Corti√±as, Jorge Ch√°vez-Carlos, Victor S. Batista, Lea F. Santos, Diego A. Wisniacki
Abstract: The driven Kerr parametric oscillator, of interest to fundamental physics and quantum technologies, exhibits an excited state quantum phase transition (ESQPT) originating in an unstable classical periodic orbit. The main signature of this type of ESQPT is a singularity in the level density in the vicinity of the energy of the classical separatrix that divides the phase space into two distinct regions. The quantum states with energies below the separatrix are useful for quantum technologies, because they show a cat-like structure that protects them against local decoherence processes. In this work, we show how chaos arising from the interplay between the external drive and the nonlinearities of the system destroys the ESQPT and eventually eliminates the cat states. Our results demonstrate the importance of the analysis of theoretical models for the design of new parametric oscillators with ever larger nonlinearities.

Title: On fully entangled fraction and quantum conditional entropies for states with maximally mixed marginals
Authors: Komal Kumar, Indranil Chakrabarty, Nirman Ganguly
Abstract: The fully entangled fraction (FEF) measures the proximity of a quantum state to maximally entangled states. FEF $>\frac{1}{d}$, in $d \otimes d$ systems is a significant benchmark for various quantum information processing protocols including teleportation. Quantum conditional entropy (QCE) on the other hand is a measure of correlation in quantum systems. Conditional entropies for quantum systems can be negative, marking a departure from conventional classical systems. The negativity of quantum conditional entropies plays a decisive role in tasks like state merging and dense coding. In the present work, we investigate the relation of these two important yardsticks. Our probe is mainly done in the ambit of states with maximally mixed marginals, with a few illustrations from other classes of quantum states. We start our study in two qubit systems, where for the Werner states, we obtain lower bounds to its FEF when the conditional R√©nyi $\alpha-$entropy is negative. We then obtain relations between FEF and QCE for two qubit Weyl states. Moving on to two qudit states we find a necessary and sufficient condition based on FEF, for the isotropic state to have negative conditional entropy. In two qudit systems the relation between FEF and QCE is probed for the rank deficient and generalized Bell diagonal states. FEF is intricately linked with $k$- copy nonlocality and $k$- copy steerability. The relations between FEF and QCE facilitates to find conditions for $k$- copy nonlocality and $k$- copy steerability based on QCE. We obtain such conditions for certain classes of states in two qubits and two qudits. Applications of the relations obtained are provided in the context of work extraction, faithful entanglement and entropic uncertainty relations.

Title: Fault-Tolerant Logical Clifford Gates from Code Automorphisms
Authors: Hasan Sayginel, Stergios Koutsioumpas, Mark Webster, Abhishek Rajput, Dan E Browne
Abstract: We study the implementation of fault-tolerant logical Clifford gates on stabilizer quantum error correcting codes based on their symmetries. Our approach is to map the stabilizer code to a binary linear code, compute its automorphism group, and impose constraints based on the Clifford operators permitted. We provide a rigorous formulation of the method for finding automorphisms of stabilizer codes and generalize ZX-dualities to non-CSS codes. We provide a Python package implementing our algorithms which uses the computational algebra system MAGMA. Our algorithms map automorphism group generators to physical circuits, calculate Pauli corrections based on the destabilizers of the code, and determine their logical action. We discuss the fault tolerance of the circuits and include examples of gates through automorphisms for the [[4,2,2]] and perfect [[5,1,3]] codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and the best known distance codes.

Title: Information scrambling and entanglement dynamics in Floquet Time Crystals
Authors: Himanshu Sahu, Fernando Iemini
Abstract: We study the dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and entanglement of entropy as quantitative measures of information propagation in disordered many-body systems exhibiting Floquet time-crystal (FTC) phases. We find that OTOC spreads in the FTC with different characteristic timescales due to the existence of a preferred ``quasi-protected'' direction - denoted as $\ell$-bit direction - along which the spins stabilize their period-doubling magnetization for exponentially long times. While orthogonal to this direction the OTOC thermalizes as an usual MBL time-independent system (at stroboscopic times), along the $\ell$-bit direction the system features a more complex structure. The scrambling appears as a combination of an initially frozen dynamics (while in the stable period doubling magnetization time window) and a later logarithmic slow growth (over its decoherence regime) till full thermalization. Interestingly, in the late time regime, since the wavefront propagation of correlations has already settled through the whole chain, scrambling occurs at the same rate regardless of the distance between the spins, thus resulting in an overall envelope-like structure of all OTOCs, independent of their distance, merging into a single growth. Alongside, the entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic growth over all time, reflecting the slow dynamics up to a thermal volume-law saturation.

Title: States Violating Both Locality and Noncontextuality Inequalities in Quantum Theory
Authors: Yuichiro Kitajima
Abstract: The CHSH inequality is an inequality used to test locality in quantum theory and is recognized as one of Bell's inequalities. In contrast, the KCBS inequality is employed to test noncontextuality in quantum theory. While certain quantum states are known to violate these inequalities individually, it was previously assumed that no state could violate both inequalities simultaneously. This assumption is encapsulated in the concept of the `monogamy relation.' It describes a trade-off between nonlocality and contextuality: the violation of one inequality typically excludes the possibility of violating the other. However, Xue et al. demonstrated that simultaneous violations of both the CHSH and KCBS inequalities are possible with specific choices of observables. This discovery challenges the universal validity of the monogamy relation. It also suggests that the relationship between contextuality and nonlocality is more complex than previously understood. They further showed that numerous scenarios exist where both the CHSH inequality and a contextuality inequality involving more than five observables are violated. However, the number of such scenarios is finite. Building on this, we present two main results. The first is that there are infinitely many scenarios in which both the CHSH inequality and a contextuality inequality involving an odd number of observables are violated. This finding reveals the existence of infinitely many scenarios where the monogamy relation between the CHSH inequality and the noncontextuality inequality no longer holds. The second is that certain quantum states violate both the KCBS inequality and a nonlocality inequality distinct from the CHSH inequality. These insights deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between nonlocality and contextuality, and open avenues for exploring state-dependent inequalities and their physical implications.

Title: Revisiting Gaussian genuine entanglement witnesses with modern software
Authors: E. Shchukin, P. van Loock
Abstract: Continuous-variable Gaussian entanglement is an attractive notion, both as a fundamental concept in quantum information theory, based on the well-established Gaussian formalism for phase-space variables, and as a practical resource in quantum technology, exploiting in particular, unconditional room-temperature squeezed-light quantum optics. The readily available high level of scalability, however, is accompanied by an increased theoretical complexity when the multipartite entanglement of a growing number of optical modes is considered. For such systems, we present several approaches to reconstruct the most probable physical covariance matrix from a measured non-physical one and then test the reconstructed matrix for different kinds of separability (factorizability, concrete partite separability or biseparability) even in the presence of measurement errors. All these approaches are based on formulating the desired properties (physicality or separability) as convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved with modern optimization solvers, even when the system grows. To every optimization problem we construct the corresponding dual problem used to verify the optimality of the solution. Besides this numerical part of work, we derive an explicit analytical expression for the symplectic trace of a positive definite matrix, which can serve as a simple witness of an entanglement witness, and extend it for positive semidefinite matrices. In addition, we show that in some cases our optimization problems can be solved analytically. As an application of our analytical approach, we consider small instances of bound entangled or genuine multipartite entangled Gaussian states, including some examples from the literature that were treated only numerically, and a family of non-Gaussian states.

Title: Geometrical frustration, power law tunneling and non-local gauge fields from scattered light
Authors: Pavel P. Popov, Joana Fraxanet, Luca Barbiero, Maciej Lewenstein
Abstract: Designing the amplitude and range of couplings in quantum systems is a fundamental tool for exploring a large variety of quantum mechanical effects. Here, we consider off-resonant photon scattering processes on a geometrically shaped molecular cloud. Our analysis shows that such a setup is properly modeled by a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian where the range, amplitude and sign of the tunneling processes of the scattered photonic modes can be accurately tuned. Specifically, by varying the molecular distribution, we demonstrate that different configurations characterized by geometrical frustration, long-range power law hopping processes, and non-local gauge fields can be achieved. Our results thus represent a powerful and alternative approach to perform an accurate Hamiltonian engineering of quantum systems with non trivial coupling structures.

Title: A Permutation-equivariant Deep Learning Model for Quantum State Characterization
Authors: Diego Maragnano, Claudio Cusano, Marco Liscidini
Abstract: The characterization of quantum states is a fundamental step of any application of quantum technologies. Nowadays there exist several approaches addressing this problem, also based on machine and deep learning techniques. However, all these approaches usually require a number of measurement that scales exponentially with the number of parties composing the system. Threshold quantum state tomography (tQST) addresses this problem and, in some cases of interest, can significantly reduce the number of measurements. In this paper, we study how to combine a permutation-equivariant deep learning model with the tQST protocol. We test the model on quantum state tomography and purity estimation. Finally, we validate the robustness of the model to noise. We show results up to 4 qubits.

Title: Efficient detection of entanglement by stimulated disentanglement
Authors: Nir Nechushtan, Hanzhong Zhang, Yosef London, Mallachi Meller, Haia Amichai, Eliahu Cohen, Avi Pe'er
Abstract: Standard detection of entanglement relies on local measurements of the individual particles, evaluating their correlations in post-processing. For time-energy entangled photons, either times $(t_{1},t_{2})$ or energies $(E_{1},E_{2})$ are measured, but not both due to the mutual quantum uncertainty, providing only partial information of the entanglement. In principle, a global detector could recover the complete information of entanglement in a single shot if it could measure the combined correlated variables $(t_{1}-t_{2})$ and $(E_{1}+E_{2})$ without measuring the individual energies or times. Such a global measurement is possible using the reverse disentangling interaction, like sum-frequency generation (SFG), but nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level are exceedingly inefficient. We overcome this barrier by stimulating the nonlinear SFG interaction with a strong pump, thereby measuring both the energy-sum (SFG spectrum) and the time-difference (response to group delay/dispersion) simultaneously and efficiently. We generate bi-photons with extreme time-energy entanglement (octave-spanning spectrum of 113THz) and measure a relative uncertainty between time-difference and energy-sum of $\Delta(t_1-t_2)\Delta(E_1+E_2)\approx\!2\!\cdot\!10^{-13}h$, violating the classical bound by more than 12 orders of magnitude. The presented coherent SFG dramatically enhances the detection SNR compared to standard methods since it ideally rejects erroneous coincidences in both time and energy, paving the way for sensing applications, such as quantum illumination (radar) and more.

Title: Simultaneous nonreciprocal and ultra-strong coupling in cavity magnonics
Authors: Chi Zhang, Zhenhui Hao, Yongzhang Shi, Changjun Jiang, Xiling Li, C. K. Ong, Daqiang Gao, Guozhi Chai
Abstract: We demonstrate the simultaneous realization of nonreciprocal coupling and ultra-strong coupling in cavity magnonics. By replacing a copper cylinder with a yttrium iron garnet cylinder within the photonic crystal, we achieve an ultra-strong coupling strength of 1.18 GHz and a coupling efficiency of 10.9%. Nonreciprocal microwave transmission emerges within the photonic bandgap, due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry through the gyromagnetic and Faraday effects. This work establishes a foundation for advanced nonreciprocal devices in hybrid cavity magnonic systems, with promising applications in quantum information processing and microwave isolation.

Title: Differential absorption ozone Lidar with 4H-SiC single-photon detectors
Authors: Xian-Song Zhao, Chao Yu, Chong Wang, Tianyi Li, Bo Liu, Hai Lu, Rong Zhang, Xiankang Dou, Jun Zhang, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: Differential absorption Lidar (DIAL) in the ultraviolet (UV) region is an effective approach for monitoring tropospheric ozone. 4H-SiC single-photon detectors (SPDs) are emergent devices for UV single-photon detection. Here, we demonstrate a 4H-SiC SPD-based ozone DIAL. We design and fabricate the 4H-SiC single-photon avalanche diode with a beveled mesa structure and optimized layer thickness. An active quenching circuit with a quenching time of 1.03 ns is developed to significantly mitigate the afterpulsing effect while enhancing the maximum count rate. After characterization, the SPD exhibits excellent performance with a photon detection efficiency of 16.6% at 266 nm, a dark count rate of 138 kcps, a maximum count rate of 13 Mcps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.7% at room temperature. Then, we apply two 4H-SiC SPDs in an ozone DIAL. The measured ozone concentrations at altitudes of 1-3.5 km agree well with the results of a commercial ozone DIAL. Our work provides an alternative solution for general UV Lidar applications.

Title: Linearization (in)stabilities and crossed products
Authors: Julian De Vuyst, Stefan Eccles, Philipp A. Hoehn, Josh Kirklin
Abstract: Modular crossed product algebras have recently assumed an important role in perturbative quantum gravity as they lead to an intrinsic regularization of entanglement entropies by introducing quantum reference frames (QRFs) in place of explicit regulators. This is achieved by imposing certain boost constraints on gravitons, QRFs and other fields. Here, we revisit the question of how these constraints should be understood through the lens of perturbation theory and particularly the study of linearization (in)stabilities, exploring when linearized solutions can be integrated to exact ones. Our aim is to provide some clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for imposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\to0$ limit as they turn out to be of second-order. While for spatially closed spacetimes there is an essentially unambiguous justification, in the presence of boundaries or the absence of isometries this depends on whether one is also interested in second-order observables. Linearization (in)stabilities occur in any gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this in a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical formulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes theory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind (in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant theories. We comment on the relation to modular flow and illustrate our findings in several gravity and gauge theory examples.

Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.

Title: The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter
Authors: Romuald A. Janik
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.
