Title: Adaptive Entanglement Routing with Deep Q-Networks in Quantum Networks
Authors: Lamarana Jallow, Majid Iqbal Khan
Abstract: The quantum internet holds transformative potential for global communication by harnessing the principles of quantum information processing. Despite significant advancements in quantum communication technologies, the efficient distribution of critical resources, such as qubits, remains a persistent and unresolved challenge. Conventional approaches often fall short of achieving optimal resource allocation, underscoring the necessity for more effective solutions. This study proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based adaptive entanglement routing framework designed to enable resource allocation tailored to the specific demands of quantum applications. The introduced QuDQN model utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the management of quantum networks, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance entanglement routing. The model integrates key considerations, including fidelity requirements, network topology, qubit capacity, and request demands.

Title: Train on classical, deploy on quantum: scaling generative quantum machine learning to a thousand qubits
Authors: Erik Recio-Armengol, Shahnawaz Ahmed, Joseph Bowles
Abstract: We propose an approach to generative quantum machine learning that overcomes the fundamental scaling issues of variational quantum circuits. The core idea is to use a class of generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits, which we show can be trained efficiently on classical hardware. Although training is classically efficient, sampling from these circuits is widely believed to be classically hard, and so computational advantages are possible when sampling from the trained model on quantum hardware. By combining our approach with a data-dependent parameter initialisation strategy, we do not encounter issues of barren plateaus and successfully circumvent the poor scaling of gradient estimation that plagues traditional approaches to quantum circuit optimisation. We investigate and evaluate our approach on a number of real and synthetic datasets, training models with up to one thousand qubits and hundreds of thousands of parameters. We find that the quantum models can successfully learn from high dimensional data, and perform surprisingly well compared to simple energy-based classical generative models trained with a similar amount of hyperparameter optimisation. Overall, our work demonstrates that a path to scalable quantum generative machine learning exists and can be investigated today at large scales.

Title: Reply to Pavičić's 'Comment on "Optimal conversion of Kochen-Specker sets into bipartite perfect quantum strategies"' (arXiv:2502.13787)
Authors: Stefan Trandafir, Adán Cabello
Abstract: According to Paviči{ć}, Kochen and Specker's 117-observable set is not a ``Kochen-Specker set''. By the same reason, in arXiv:2502.13787, Paviči{ć} claims that 10 statements in our paper ``Optimal conversion of Kochen-Specker sets into bipartite perfect quantum strategies'' [Phys. Rev. A 111, 022408 (2025)] are ``wrong''. In all cases, Paviči{ć}'s claims are based on the fact that he is assuming a different definition of Kochen-Specker (KS) set. Adopting a terminology used by, e.g., Larsson, the sets that Paviči{ć} call KS sets can be called ``extended'' KS sets, since they are constructed by adding observables to the ``original'' KS sets. For example, Paviči{ć} adds 75 observables to the original 117-observable KS set. Beyond terminology, there are fundamental physical reasons for focusing on the original KS sets. One reason is that, for experimentally observing quantum state-independent contextuality, there is no need to measure the observables added in the extended sets. Another reason is that, to produce bipartite perfect quantum strategies, or correlations in a face of the nonsignaling polytope with no local points, or correlations with nonlocal content 1, the two parties do not need to measure any of the observables added in the extended sets. We also respond to other claims made by Paviči{ć} about our work.

Title: Quantum resource estimates for computing binary elliptic curve discrete logarithms
Authors: Michael Garn, Angus Kan
Abstract: We perform logical and physical resource estimation for computing binary elliptic curve discrete logarithms using Shor's algorithm on fault-tolerant quantum computers. We adopt a windowed approach to design our circuit implementation of the algorithm, which comprises repeated applications of elliptic curve point addition operations and table look-ups. Unlike previous work, the point addition operation is implemented exactly, including all exceptional cases. We provide exact logical gate and qubit counts of our algorithm for cryptographically relevant binary field sizes. Furthermore, we estimate the hardware footprint and runtime of our algorithm executed on surface-code matter-based quantum computers with a baseline architecture, where logical qubits have nearest-neighbor connectivity, and on a surface-code photonic fusion-based quantum computer with an active-volume architecture, which enjoys a logarithmic number of non-local connections between logical qubits. At 10$\%$ threshold and compared to a baseline device with a $1\mu s$ code cycle, our algorithm runs $\gtrsim$ 2-20 times faster, depending on the operating regime of the hardware and over all considered field sizes, on a photonic active-volume device.

Title: Analysis of electron spectra dynamics in a moving periodical ponderomotive potential
Authors: Marek Kuchař, Kamila Moriová, Martin Kozák
Abstract: The interaction between freely propagating electrons and light waves is typically described using an approximation in which we assume that the electron velocity remains approximately the same during the interaction. In this article we analytically describe the dynamics of electrons in an interaction potential generated by an optical beat wave beyond this regime and find a structure of sharp electron distribution peaks that periodically alternate in the energy/momentum spectrum. In the classical description we analytically solve the nonlinear equation of motion, which is an analogy to the mathematical pendulum. While addressing the problem using quantum mechanics, we first use a parabolic approximation of the interaction potential and then we also study the evolution of the electron wavepacket in an infinite periodical potential. Using numerical simulations we show the classical and quantum evolution of the electron spectra during the interaction for different conditions and experimental settings.

Designed with an emphasis on numerical stability, efficiency, and performance, QCLAB provides a reliable platform for prototyping and testing quantum algorithms. For advanced performance needs, QCLAB++ serves as a complementary C++ package optimized for GPU-accelerated quantum circuit simulations.

Title: Generalized Quantum Signal Processing and Non-Linear Fourier Transform are equivalent
Authors: Lorenzo Laneve
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) are powerful techniques for the development of quantum procedures. They allow to derive circuits preparing desired polynomial transformations. Recent research [Alexis et al. 2024] showed that Non-Linear Fourier Analysis (NLFA) can be employed to numerically compute a QSP protocol, with provable stability. In this work we extend their result, showing that GQSP and the Non-Linear Fourier Transform over $SU(2)$ are the same object. This statement - proven by a simple argument - has a bunch of consequences: first, the Riemann-Hilbert-Weiss algorithm can be turned, with little modifications and no penalty in complexity, into a unified, provably stable algorithm for the computation of phase factors in any QSP variant, including GQSP. Secondly, we derive a uniqueness result for the existence of GQSP phase factors based on the bijectivity of the Non-Linear Fourier Transform. Furthermore, NLFA provides a complete theory of infinite generalized quantum signal processing, which characterizes the class of functions approximable by GQSP protocols.

Title: Capacitively Shunted Double-Transmon Coupler Realizing Bias-Free Idling and High-Fidelity CZ Gate
Authors: Rui Li, Kentaro Kubo, Yinghao Ho, Zhiguang Yan, Shinichi Inoue, Yasunobu Nakamura, Hayato Goto
Abstract: A high-fidelity CZ gate utilizing a double-transmon coupler (DTC) has recently been demonstrated as a building block for superconducting quantum processors. Like many other kinds of tunable couplers, however, the DTC requires a finite DC current for flux-biasing the coupler at the idling point to turn off the coupling, necessitating extra care for wiring and heat-load management. To address this issue, we theoretically propose and experimentally realize a novel coupling scheme by introducing a shunt capacitance between the two transmons of the DTC at zero-flux bias, which demonstrates high-fidelity CZ-gate performance comparable to the previous DTC. Through a comprehensive error budget analysis using multiple randomized benchmarking methods, we also identify that the current fidelity is limited by the decoherence through the coupler. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate the wide operational flux range of the capacitively shunted DTC, which solves the challenging issue of remnant flux existing even with careful magnetic shielding.

Title: Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat
Authors: T. Koide, F. Nicacio
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.

Title: Quantum-enhanced radio-frequency photonic distributed imaging
Authors: Haowei Shi, Christopher M. Jones, Mengjie Yu, Zheshen Zhang, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: Quantum physics has brought enhanced capability in various sensing applications. Despite challenges from noise and loss in the radio-frequency (RF) domain, [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 150502 (2020)] demonstrates a route for enhanced RF-receiver empowered by quantum squeezing and entanglement. In this work, we further explore the quantum advantage of imaging in the weak coupling scenario of the RF-photonic receiver. The proposed imaging receiver applies transducer to upconvert the RF signal to optical to enable high-efficiency connection via low-loss fiber networks. The efficient connection therefore increases the synthetic aperture and improves the resolution of the distributed imaging system. To overcome the challenge from low transduction efficiency in existing devices limited by weak photon interaction, we propose the use of squeezed-state optical sources to suppress the noise. We numerically evaluate the quantum advantage in synthetic aperture radar imaging, where the images are generated from the standard resolution test chart via a Gaussian point spread function with added Gaussian noise. We apply the Wiener filter on the images to restore the objects and find that stronger squeezing significantly improves the quality of the restored image. Our findings push quantum squeezing advantage to real-world applications.

Title: Quantum Weak Measurement Amplifies Dispersion Signal of Rydberg Atomic System
Authors: Yinghang Jiang, Jiguo Wu, Meng Shi, Hanqing Zheng, Fei Guo, Zhiguang Xiao, Zhiyou Zhang
Abstract: Rydberg atoms, with their long coherence time and large electric dipole moment, are pivotal in quantum precision measurement. In the process of approaching the standard quantum limit, higher demands are placed on detection schemes. This paper presents a scheme to amplify dispersion signal of Rydberg atomic microwave detection system, using a quantum weak measurement technique together with improved dimensionless pointer. The scheme effectively mitigates the impact of technical noise and can be used to achieve a measurement precision close to the limit set by atomic shot noise in theory. Compared with the superheterodyne method based on transmission detection, our scheme has been experimentally proved to have a sensitivity increase of 5$\sim$6 dB. In this work, the Rydberg dispersion signal amplification mechanism offers a approach to enhance microwave detection sensitivity, which also facilitates deeper investigations into its dynamic processes and further applications of this mechanism in quantum communication and quantum control.

Title: Quantum Magic in Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin
Abstract: In quantum computing, non-stabilizerness -- the magic -- refers to the computational advantage of certain quantum states over classical computers and is an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. Employing the second order stabilizer Rényi entropy to quantify magic, we study the production of magic states in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) via 2-to-2 scattering processes involving electrons and muons. Considering all 60 stabilizer initial states, which have zero magic, the angular dependence of magic produced in the final states is governed by only a few patterns, both in the non-relativistic and the ultra-relativistic limits. Some processes, such as the low-energy $e^-\mu^-\to e^-\mu^-$ and Bhabha scattering $e^-e^+\to e^-e^+$, do not generate magic at all. In most cases the largest magic generated is significantly less than the maximal possible value of $\log (16/7) \approx 0.827$. The only instance where QED is able to generate maximal magic is the low-energy $\mu^-\mu^+\to e^-e^+$, in the limit $m_e/m_\mu \to 0$, which is well approximated in nature. Our results suggest QED, although capable of producing maximally entangled states easily, may not be an efficient mechanism for generating quantum advantages.

Title: Machine Learning for Estimation and Control of Quantum Systems
Authors: Hailan Ma, Bo Qi, Ian R. Petersen, Re-Bing Wu, Herschel Rabitz, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: The development of quantum technologies relies on creating and manipulating quantum systems of increasing complexity, with key applications in computation, simulation, and sensing. This poses severe challenges in efficient control, calibration, and validation of quantum states and their dynamics. Machine learning methods have emerged as powerful tools owing to their remarkable capability to learn from data, and thus have been extensively utilized for different quantum tasks. This paper reviews several significant topics related to machine learning-aided quantum estimation and control. In particular, we discuss neural networks-based learning for quantum state estimation, gradient-based learning for optimal control of quantum systems, evolutionary computation for learning control of quantum systems, machine learning for quantum robust control, and reinforcement learning for quantum control. This review provides a brief background of key concepts recurring across many of these approaches with special emphasis on neural networks, evolutionary computation, and reinforcement learning.

Title: SSR: A Swapping-Sweeping-and-Rewriting Optimizer for Quantum Circuit Transformation
Authors: Yunqi Huang, Xiangzhen Zhou, Fanxu Meng, Pengcheng Zhu, Yu Luo, Zhenlong Du
Abstract: Quantum circuit transformation (QCT), necessary for adapting any quantum circuit to the qubit connectivity constraints of the NISQ device, often introduces numerous additional SWAP gates into the original circuit, increasing the circuit depth and thus reducing the success rate of computation. To minimize the depth of QCT circuits, we propose a Swapping-Sweeping-and-Rewriting optimizer. This optimizer rearranges the circuit based on generalized gate commutation rules via a genetic algorithm, extracts subcircuits consisting of CNOT gates using a circuit sweeping technique, and rewrites each subcircuit with a functionally equivalent and depth-optimal circuit generated by an SAT solver. The devised optimizer effectively captures the intrinsic patterns of the QCT circuits, and the experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly reduce the depth of QCT circuits, 26.68\% at most and 12.18\% on average, across all benchmark circuits.

Title: Temporal CW polarization-tomography of photon pairs from the biexciton radiative cascade: theory and experiment
Authors: Noam Tur, Ismail Nassar, Ido Schwartz, Joseph Avron, Dan Dalacau, Philip J. Poole, David Gershoni
Abstract: We study, experimentally and theoretically, temporal correlations between the polarization of photon pairs emitted during the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade from a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically excited by a continuous-wave light source. The system is modeled by a Lindbladian coupled to two Markovian baths: One bath represents the continuous light source, and a second represents the emitted radiation. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model that we constructed and a set of 36 different time resolved, polarization correlation measurements between cascading photon pairs.

Title: Development_of_a_novel_high-performance_balanced_homodyne_detector
Authors: Hong Lin, Mengmeng Liu, Xiaomin Guo, Yue Luo, Qiqi Wang, Zhijie Song, Yanqiang Guo, Liantuan Xiao
Abstract: True random numbers are extracted through measurements of vacuum fluctuations in quantum state components. We propose an improved scheme utilizing an optimization-based simulation methodology to enhance the temporal resolution of quantum state detection and processing efficiency of vacuum fluctuation signals in continuous-variable quantum random number generators (CV-QRNGs), while simultaneously maximizing the entropy content of quantum noise sources. This work presents the first application of optimization simulation methodology to balanced homodyne detector (BHD) circuit design, with particular emphasis on improving high-frequency transmission characteristics. The design framework prioritizes system stability and S-parameter sensitivity to optimize both circuit architecture and critical component parameters. The AC amplifier circuit was implemented through ADS high-frequency simulations using two ABA-52563 RF amplifiers in a cascaded configuration, with circuit modeling performed on Rogers 4350 substrate optimized for high-frequency applications. This approach enabled the development of a switched-configuration BHD featuring: 1) 1.9 GHz bandwidth, 2) 41.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio at 1.75 GHz, 3) 30 dB common-mode rejection ratio at 100 MHz, and 4) frequency response flatness within 1.5 dB across 1.3-1.7 GHz. Additionally, the Husimi function is employed for entropy analysis to reconstruct vacuum state phase-space distributions, validating the detector's quantum measurement fidelity. The implemented system demonstrates a collective generation rate of 20.0504 Gbps across four parallel channels, with all output streams successfully passing NIST SP 800-22 statistical testing requirements.

Title: Nuclear Spin Induced Transparency
Authors: He-bin Zhang, Yuanjiang Tang, Yong-Chun Liu
Abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is an important quantum optical phenomenon which provides a crucial tool for light manipulation. However, typically the transparency window is broad, limited by the coherence time of the metastable state. Here we show that extremely narrow transparency window can be realized using nuclear spin induced transparency (NSIT), which is achieved by combining optical field, magnetic field and the spin-exchange interaction between noble-gas nuclear spins and alkali-metal electronic spins. The width of the NSIT window can be several orders of magnitude smaller than that of conventional EIT, and even reaches sub-mHz range due to the long coherence time of nuclear spins. The scheme holds great potential for applications in slow light and magnetic field sensing.

Title: nuHOPS: A quantum trajectory method for highly excited environments in non-Markovian open quantum dynamics
Authors: Kai Müller, Walter T. Strunz
Abstract: Systems in contact with an environment provide a ubiquitous challenge in quantum dynamics. Many fascinating phenomena can arise if the coupling is strong, leading to non-Markovian dynamics of the system, or collective, where the environment can become highly excited. We introduce a significant improvement of the Hierarchy of Pure States (HOPS) approach, which is able to efficiently deal with such highly excited, non-Markovian environments in a nearly unitary way. As our method relies on quantum trajectories, we can obtain dynamics efficiently, also for large system sizes by i) avoiding the quadratic scaling of a density matrix and ii) exploiting the localization properties of the trajectories with an adaptive basis. We provide the derivation of the nuHOPS (nearly unitary Hierarchy of Pure States) method, compare it to the original HOPS and discuss numerical subtleties based on an illustrative dephasing model. Finally, we show its true power using the Dicke model as the paradigmatic example of many emitters decaying superradiantly inside a cavity. We reach numerically exact solutions for up to 1000 emitters. We apply our method to study emerging higher order correlations in the emitter system or the cavity mode environment and their scaling with the number of emitters.

Title: Genuine Quantum effects in Dicke-type Models at large atom numbers
Authors: Kai Müller, Walter T. Strunz
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of genuine quantum effects and beyond mean-field physics in the balanced and unbalanced open Dicke model with a large, yet finite number of atoms $N$. Such driven and dissipative quantum many-body systems have recently been realized in experiments involving ultracold gases inside optical cavities and are known to obey mean-field predictions in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$. Here we show quantum effects that survive for large but finite $N$, by employing a novel open-system dynamics method that allows us to obtain numerically exact quantum dynamical results for atom numbers up to a mesoscopic $N\approx 1000$. While we find that beyond-mean-field effects vanish quickly with increasing $N$ in the balanced Dicke model, we are able to identify parameter regimes in the unbalanced Dicke model that allow genuine quantum effects to persist even for mesoscopic $N$. They manifest themselves in a strong squeezing of the steady state and a modification of the steady-state phase diagram that cannot be seen in a mean-field description. This is due to the fact that the steady-state limit $t\rightarrow \infty$ and thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ do not commute.

Title: Dependence of Krylov complexity on the initial operator and state
Authors: Sreeram PG, J. Bharathi Kannan, Ranjan Modak, S. Aravinda
Abstract: Krylov complexity, a quantum complexity measure which uniquely characterizes the spread of a quantum state or an operator, has recently been studied in the context of quantum chaos. However, the definitiveness of this measure as a chaos quantifier is in question in light of its strong dependence on the initial condition. This article clarifies the connection between the Krylov complexity dynamics and the initial operator or state. We find that the Krylov complexity depends monotonically on the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the initial condition in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian. We explain the reversal of the complexity saturation levels observed in \href{this https URL}{ Phys.Rev.E.107,024217, 2023} using the initial spread of the operator in the Hamiltonian eigenbasis. IPR dependence is present even in the fully chaotic regime, where popular quantifiers of chaos, such as out-of-time-ordered correlators and entanglement generation, show similar behavior regardless of the initial condition. Krylov complexity averaged over many initial conditions still does not characterize chaos.

Title: Deterministic generation of multi-qubit entangled states among distant parties using indefinite causal order
Authors: Wen-Qiang Liu, Hai-Rui Wei
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays an irreplaceable role in various remote quantum information processing tasks. Here we present protocols for generating deterministic and heralded $N$-qubit entangled states across multiple network nodes. By utilizing a pre-shared maximally entangled state and single-qubit operations within an indefinite causal order framework, the multi-qubit entangled state between distant parties can be generated deterministically. The complex entangled state measurements and multiple pre-shared entangled states, are essential in conventional entanglement swapping technique, but are not required in our approach. This greatly reduces the complexity of the quantum circuit and makes it more experimentally feasible. Furthermore, we develop optical architectures to implement these protocols by encoding qubits in polarization degree of freedom. The results indicate that our protocols significantly improve the efficiency of long-distance entanglement generation and provide a practical framework for establishing large-scale quantum networks.

Title: Light drag in an Optomechanical system
Authors: Hazrat Ali, Nadia Boutabba, Amjad Sohail
Abstract: Light dragging refers to the change in the path of light passing through a moving medium. This effect enables accurate detection of very slow speeds of light, which have prominent applications in state transfer, quantum gate operations, and quantum memory implementations. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate the existence of the light-dragging effect in an optomechanical system (OMS) for the first time. The origin of this key factor arises from the nonlinear effects linked to optomechanical-induced transparency (OMIT). Hence, we observe prominent effects in the group and refractive indices profile spectra related to optomechanical parameters such as the decay rate of the cavity field, the mirror's damping momentum rate, and mechanical frequency. We find out that lateral light drag depends on the detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This allowed us to change the light's propagation through the optomechanical cavity from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by modifying the probe's detuning. The ability to manipulate and control the light drag through an optomechanical system might be useful in designing novel optical devices and systems with enhanced performance.

Title: Critical dynamics and its interferometry in the one-dimensional p-wave-paired Aubry-André-Harper model
Authors: Zhi-Han Zhang, Han-Chuan Kou, Peng Li
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the critical dynamics of the one-dimensional quasiperiodic p-wave-paired Aubry-André-Harper model, which exhibits a transition point between the gapped critical and the gapless localized phases. First, we disclose that the dynamical exponent features two distinct plateaus in the gapless localized phase. Besides the plateau with dynamical exponent $z=1.388$ near the transition point, there is a second one with $z=1$ away from the transition point. Then we demonstrate that these two plateaus intrinsically affect the critical dynamics with moderate quench rate by employing both one-way and round-trip quench protocols. In the one-way quench protocol, we clarify that the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) regime consists of two sub-regimes with different KZ exponents, which is a direct consequence of the two-plateau structure of the dynamical exponent. We also diagnose the KZ, pre-saturated, and saturated regimes by varying the quench rate from slow to fast limits. While, in the round-trip quench protocol, we confirm the interference effect of two critical dynamics and show a narrow neck in the oscillatory density of defects. It turns out that the position of the neck depends on the ratio of to-and-fro quench rates and the p-wave superconductivity pairing amplitude. We show how the position of the neck can be used to quantitatively determine the turning point of the two KZ sub-regimes.

Title: Enhancing the Performance of Quantum Neutral-Atom-Assisted Benders Decomposition
Authors: Anna Joliot, M. Yassine Naghmouchi, Wesley Coelho
Abstract: This paper presents key enhancements to our previous work~\cite{naghmouchi2024mixed} on a hybrid Benders decomposition (HBD) framework for solving mixed integer linear programs (MILPs). In our approach, the master problem is reformulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and solved on a neutral-atom quantum processor using automated conversion techniques. Our enhancements address three critical challenges. First, to adapt to hardware constraints, we refine the QUBO formulation by tightening the bounds of continuous variables and employing an exponential encoding method that eliminates slack variables, thereby reducing the required qubit count. Second, to improve solution quality, we propose a robust feasibility cut generation method inspired by the L-shaped approach and implement a constructive penalty tuning mechanism that replaces manual settings. Third, to accelerate convergence, we introduce a multi-cut strategy that integrates multiple high-density Benders cuts per iteration. Extensive numerical results demonstrate significant improvements compared to our previous approach: the feasibility rate increases from 68 percent to 100 percent, and the optimality rate rises from 52 percent to 86 percent . These advancements provide a solid foundation for future hybrid quantum-classical optimization solvers.

Title: Heisenberg and Heisenberg-Like Representations via Hilbert Space Bundle Geometry in the Non-Hermitian Regime
Authors: Chia-Yi Ju, Adam Miranowicz, Jacob Barnett, Guang-Yin Chen, Franco Nori
Abstract: The equivalence between the Schrödinger and Heisenberg representations is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. However, this relationship remains unclear in the non-Hermitian regime, particularly when the Hamiltonian is time-dependent. In this study, we address this gap by establishing the connection between the two representations, incorporating the metric of the Hilbert space bundle. We not only demonstrate the consistency between the Schrödinger and Heisenberg representations but also present a Heisenberg-like representation grounded in the generalized vielbein formalism, which provides a clear and intuitive geometric interpretation. Unlike the standard Heisenberg representation, where the metric of the Hilbert space is encoded solely in the dual states, the Heisenberg-like representation distributes the metric information between both the states and the dual states. Despite this distinction, it retains the same Heisenberg equation of motion for operators. Within this formalism, the Hamiltonian is replaced by a Hermitian counterpart, while the "non-Hermiticity" is transferred to the operators. Moreover, this approach extends to regimes with a dynamical metric (beyond the pseudo-Hermitian framework) and to systems governed by time-dependent Hamiltonians.

Title: KLiNQ: Knowledge Distillation-Assisted Lightweight Neural Network for Qubit Readout on FPGA
Authors: Xiaorang Guo, Tigran Bunarjyan, Dai Liu, Benjamin Lienhard, Martin Schulz
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are among the most promising candidates for building quantum information processors. Yet, they are often limited by slow and error-prone qubit readout -- a critical factor in achieving high-fidelity operations. While current methods, including deep neural networks, enhance readout accuracy, they typically lack support for mid-circuit measurements essential for quantum error correction, and they usually rely on large, resource-intensive network models. This paper presents KLiNQ, a novel qubit readout architecture leveraging lightweight neural networks optimized via knowledge distillation. Our approach achieves around a 99% reduction in model size compared to the baseline while maintaining a qubit-state discrimination accuracy of 91%. KLiNQ facilitates rapid, independent qubit-state readouts that enable mid-circuit measurements by assigning a dedicated, compact neural network for each qubit. Implemented on the Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA, our design can perform the discrimination within 32ns. The results demonstrate that compressed neural networks can maintain high-fidelity independent readout while enabling efficient hardware implementation, advancing practical quantum computing.

Title: Fault-Tolerant Qudit Gate Optimization in Solid-State Quantum Memory
Authors: William Boone Samuels
Abstract: Achieving scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation requires quantum memory architectures that minimize error correction overhead while preserving coherence. This work presents a framework for high-dimensional qudit memory in 153Eu:Y2SiO5, integrating three core mechanisms: (i) non-destructive syndrome extraction, using spin-echo sequences to encode error syndromes without direct measurement; (ii) adaptive quantum Fourier transform (QFT) for error identification, leveraging frequency-space transformations to reduce gate complexity; and (iii) coset-based fault-tolerant correction, factorizing large stabilizer-like unitaries into modular operations to confine error propagation. By combining generalized stabilizer formalism, Weyl-Heisenberg operators, and finite-group coset decompositions, we develop a qudit error correction scheme optimized for solid-state quantum memory. This approach circumvents resource-intensive multi-qubit concatenation, enabling scalable, long-lived quantum storage with efficient state retrieval and computational redundancy. These results provide a pathway toward practical fault-tolerant architectures for rare-earth-ion-doped quantum memories.

Title: Efficient detection of entanglement by stimulated disentanglement
Authors: Nir Nechushtan, Hanzhong Zhang, Yosef London, Mallachi Meller, Haia Amichai, Eliahu Cohen, Avi Pe'er
Abstract: Standard detection of entanglement relies on local measurements of the individual particles, evaluating their correlations in post-processing. For time-energy entangled photons, either times $(t_{1},t_{2})$ or energies $(E_{1},E_{2})$ are measured, but not both due to the mutual quantum uncertainty, providing only partial information of the entanglement. In principle, a global detector could recover the complete information of entanglement in a single shot if it could measure the combined correlated variables $(t_{1}-t_{2})$ and $(E_{1}+E_{2})$ without measuring the individual energies or times. Such a global measurement is possible using the reverse disentangling interaction, like sum-frequency generation (SFG), but nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level are ridiculously inefficient. We overcome this barrier by stimulating the nonlinear SFG interaction with a strong pump, thereby measuring both the energy-sum (SFG spectrum) and the time-difference (response to group delay/dispersion) simultaneously and efficiently. We generate bi-photons with extreme time-energy entanglement (octave-spanning spectrum of 113THz) and measure a relative uncertainty between time-difference and energy-sum of $\Delta(t_1-t_2)\Delta(E_1+E_2)\approx\!2\!\cdot\!10^{-13}h$, violating the classical bound by >12 orders of magnitude. The presented coherent SFG dramatically enhances the detection SNR compared to standard methods since it ideally rejects erroneous coincidences in both time and energy, paving the way for sensing applications, such as quantum illumination (radar) and more.

Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.

Title: Benchmarks for quantum communication via gravity
Authors: Kristian Toccacelo, Ulrik Lund Andersen, Jonatan Bohr Brask
Abstract: We establish limitations and bounds on the transmission of quantum states between gravitationally interacting mechanical oscillators under different models of gravity. This provides benchmarks that can enable tests for quantum features of gravity. Our proposal does not require the measurement of gravitationally induced entanglement and only requires final measurements of a single subsystem. We discuss bounds for classical models based on local operations and classical communication when considering coherent-state alphabets, and we discuss the transfer of quantum squeezing for falsifying the Schrödinger-Newton model.

Title: Bounding the computational power of bosonic systems
Authors: Varun Upreti, Ulysse Chabaud
Abstract: Bosonic quantum systems operate in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, unlike discrete-variable quantum systems. This distinct mathematical structure leads to fundamental differences in quantum information processing, such as an exponentially greater complexity of state tomography [MMB+24] or a factoring algorithm in constant space [BCCRK24]. Yet, it remains unclear whether this structural difference of bosonic systems may also translate to a practical computational advantage over finite-dimensional quantum computers. Here we take a step towards answering this question by showing that universal bosonic quantum computations can be simulated in exponential time on a classical computer, significantly improving the best previous upper bound requiring exponential memory [CJMM24]. In complexity-theoretic terms, we improve the best upper bound on $\textsf{CVBQP}$ from $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$ to $\textsf{EXP}$. This result is achieved using a simulation strategy based on finite energy cutoffs and approximate coherent state decompositions. While we propose ways to potentially refine this bound, we also present arguments supporting the plausibility of an exponential computational advantage of bosonic quantum computers over their discrete-variable counterparts. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of circuit energy as a resource and discuss why it may act as the fundamental bottleneck in realizing this advantage in practical implementations.

Title: Compact Superconducting Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with On-chip rf Components
Authors: Logan Howe, Andrea Giachero, Michael Vissers, Jordan Wheeler, Jason Austermann, Johannes Hubmayr, Joel Ullom
Abstract: Quantum computing systems and fundamental physics experiments using superconducting technologies frequently require signal amplification chains operating near the quantum limit of added noise. Both Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) and traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have been used as first-stage amplifiers to enable readout chains operating within a few quanta or less of the quantum limit. These devices are also presently entering the commercial industry. However, nearly all demonstrations and existing products require bulky external microwave components for interconnection and application of requisite biases. These components -- cabling interconnects, bias tees, directional couplers, and diplexers -- increase the overall amplifier footprint, installation complexity, and reduce already limited available cryogenic volumes. Additionally, these components introduce loss and reflections which impact the measurement efficiency and readout system noise performance; thus making it more difficult to operate near the quantum limit. Here we present the design and validation of microfabricated bias tees and directional couplers for operating three-wave mixing kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs). We report the performance of KITs integrated with the microfabricated rf components. Using these devices we demonstrate reduction in the amplifier installation footprint by a factor of nearly five and elimination of all external, lossy microwave components previously required to operate a KIT. Our device displays a 2.8 GHz 3 dB bandwidth with a median true gain of 17.5 dB and median system noise of 3.4 quanta. These efforts represent the first full integration of all rf components mandatory for TWPA operation on-chip. Our results mark significant progress towards the miniaturization and simplification of parametric amplifier setups and will aid in their more widespread applicability.

Title: Spectral truncation of out-of-time-ordered correlators in dissipative system
Authors: Pablo D. Bergamasco, Gabriel G. Carlo, Alejandro M. F. Rivas
Abstract: Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have emerged as powerful tools for diagnosing quantum chaos and information scrambling. While extensively studied in closed quantum systems, their behavior in dissipative environments remains less understood. In this work, we investigate the spectral decomposition of OTOCs in open quantum systems, using the dissipative modified kicked rotator (DMKR) as a paradigmatic model. By analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum Liouvillian, we identify a crucial spectral truncation criterion that enables efficient modeling of OTOC dynamics. Our results reveal two distinct temporal regimes: a long-time decay phase governed by the spectral gap and an intermediate-time regime where a small subset of subdominant eigenvalues plays a crucial role. This spectral truncation criterion allows for efficient modeling of OTOC decay and reveals a direct connection between eigenvalue structure and information scrambling. Our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding OTOCs in dissipative quantum systems and suggest new avenues for experimental exploration in open quantum platforms.

Abstract: Diverse organisms exploit the geomagnetic field (GMF) for migration. Migrating birds employ an intrinsically quantum mechanical mechanism for detecting the geomagnetic field: absorption of a blue photon generates a radical pair whose two electrons precess at different rates in the magnetic field, thereby sensitizing cells to the direction of the GMF. In this work, using an in vitro injury model, we discovered a quantum-based mechanism of cellular migration. Specifically, we show that migrating cells detect the GMF via an optically activated, electron spin-based mechanism. Cell injury provokes acute emission of blue photons, and these photons sensitize muscle progenitor cells to the magnetic field. We show that the magnetosensitivity of muscle progenitor cells is (a) activated by blue light, but not by green or red light, and (b) disrupted by the application of an oscillatory field at the frequency corresponding to the energy of the electron-spin/magnetic field interaction. A comprehensive analysis of protein expression reveals that the ability of blue photons to promote cell motility is mediated by activation of calmodulin calcium sensors. Collectively, these data suggest that cells possess a light-dependent magnetic compass driven by electron spin dynamics.

Title: Gauging non-invertible symmetries on the lattice
Authors: Sahand Seifnashri, Shu-Heng Shao, Xinping Yang
Abstract: We provide a general prescription for gauging finite non-invertible symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian systems. Our primary example is the Rep(D$_8$) fusion category generated by the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation, which is the simplest anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry on a spin chain of qubits. We explicitly compute its lattice F-symbols and illustrate our prescription for a particular (non-maximal) gauging of this symmetry. In our gauging procedure, we introduce two qubits around each link, playing the role of "gauge fields" for the non-invertible symmetry, and impose novel Gauss's laws. Similar to the Kramers-Wannier transformation for gauging an ordinary $\mathbb{Z}_2$, our gauging can be summarized by a gauging map, which is part of a larger, continuous non-invertible cosine symmetry.

Title: Finite-temperature quantum topological order in three dimensions
Authors: Shu-Tong Zhou, Meng Cheng, Tibor Rakovszky, Curt von Keyserlingk, Tyler D. Ellison
Abstract: We identify a three-dimensional system that exhibits long-range entanglement at sufficiently small but nonzero temperature--it therefore constitutes a quantum topological order at finite temperature. The model of interest is known as the fermionic toric code, a variant of the usual 3D toric code, which admits emergent fermionic point-like excitations. The fermionic toric code, importantly, possesses an anomalous 2-form symmetry, associated with the space-like Wilson loops of the fermionic excitations. We argue that it is this symmetry that imbues low-temperature thermal states with a novel topological order and long-range entanglement. Based on the current classification of three-dimensional topological orders, we expect that the low-temperature thermal states of the fermionic toric code belong to an equilibrium phase of matter that only exists at nonzero temperatures. We conjecture that further examples of topological orders at nonzero temperatures are given by discrete gauge theories with anomalous 2-form symmetries. Our work therefore opens the door to studying quantum topological order at nonzero temperature in physically realistic dimensions.

Title: Vestigial Order from an Excitonic Mother State in Kagome Superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Julian Ingham, Ronny Thomale, Harley D. Scammell
Abstract: Alongside high-temperature charge order and superconductivity, kagome metals exhibit signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking and nematicity which appear to depend strongly on external perturbations such as strain and magnetic fields, posing a fundamental challenge for conceptual reconciliation. We develop a theory of vestigial order descending from an excitonic mother state in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K,Rb,Cs), which develops around $T_* \approx 40$ K. The application of external fields stabilises a subset of the phase-melted order parameter manifold, referred to as a vestigial state, producing a symmetry-breaking response which depends on the applied probe. Our theory reproduces the observations of piezomagnetism, electric magnetic chiral anisotropy, absence of Kerr rotation, unusual elastoresistance response, and superconducting diode effect. Our proposed excitonic mother state accounts for probe-dependent symmetry breaking patterns without fine-tuning, and predicts additional signatures accessible through optical spectroscopy.

Title: Probing new forces with nuclear-clock quintessometers
Authors: Cédric Delaunay, Seung J. Lee, Roee Ozeri, Gilad Perez, Wolfram Ratzinger, Bingrong Yu
Abstract: Clocks based on nuclear isomer transitions promise exceptional stability and precision. The low transition energy of the Thorium-229 isomer makes it an ideal candidate, as it may be excited by a vacuum-ultraviolet laser and is highly sensitive to subtle interactions. This enables the development of powerful tools for probing new forces, which we call quintessometers. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of nuclear clocks, particularly solid-state variants, to surpass existing limits on scalar field couplings, exceeding the sensitivity of current fifth-force searches at submicron distances and significantly improving equivalence-principle tests at kilometer scales and beyond. Additionally, we highlight the capability of transportable nuclear clocks to detect scalar interactions at distances beyond $10\,$km, complementing space-based missions.

Title: Towards a complexity-theoretic dichotomy for TQFT invariants
Authors: Nicolas Bridges (Purdue), Eric Samperton (Purdue)
Abstract: We show that for any fixed $(2+1)$-dimensional TQFT over $\mathbb{C}$ of either Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury or Reshetikhin-Turaev type, the problem of (exactly) computing its invariants on closed 3-manifolds is either solvable in polynomial time, or else it is $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard to (exactly) contract certain tensors that are built from the TQFT's fusion category. Our proof is an application of a dichotomy result of Cai and Chen [J. ACM, 2017] concerning weighted constraint satisfaction problems over $\mathbb{C}$. We leave for future work the issue of reinterpreting the conditions of Cai and Chen that distinguish between the two cases (i.e. $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard tensor contractions vs. polynomial time invariants) in terms of fusion categories. We expect that with more effort, our reduction can be improved so that one gets a dichotomy directly for TQFTs' invariants of 3-manifolds rather than more general tensors built from the TQFT's fusion category.

Title: Quantum Non-Linear Bandit Optimization
Authors: Zakaria Shams Siam, Chaowen Guan, Chong Liu
Abstract: We study non-linear bandit optimization where the learner maximizes a black-box function with zeroth order function oracle, which has been successfully applied in many critical applications such as drug discovery and hyperparameter tuning. Existing works have showed that with the aid of quantum computing, it is possible to break the $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ regret lower bound in classical settings and achieve the new $O(\mathrm{poly}\log T)$ upper bound. However, they usually assume that the objective function sits within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and their algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose the new Q-NLB-UCB algorithm which uses the novel parametric function approximation technique and enjoys performance improvement due to quantum fast-forward and quantum Monte Carlo mean estimation. We prove that the regret bound of Q-NLB-UCB is not only $O(\mathrm{poly}\log T)$ but also input dimension-free, making it applicable for high-dimensional tasks. At the heart of our analyses are a new quantum regression oracle and a careful construction of parameter uncertainty region. Our algorithm is also validated for its efficiency on both synthetic and real-world tasks.

Title: Vortex Motion Induced Losses in Tantalum Resonators

Cava, Andrew A. Houck, Nathalie P. de Leon
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) based superconducting circuits have been demonstrated to enable record qubit coherence times and quality factors, motivating a careful study of the microscopic origin of the remaining losses that limit their performance. We have recently shown that the losses in Ta-based resonators are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) at low microwave powers and millikelvin temperatures. We also observe that some devices exhibit loss that is exponentially activated at a lower temperature inconsistent with the superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of the constituent film. Specifically, dc resistivity measurements show a Tc of over 4 K, while microwave measurements of resonators fabricated from these films show losses that increase exponentially with temperature with an activation energy as low as 0.3 K. Here, we present a comparative study of the structural and thermodynamic properties of Ta-based resonators and identify vortex motion-induced loss as the source of thermally activated microwave loss. Through careful magnetoresistance and x-ray diffraction measurements, we observe that the increased loss occurs for films that are in the clean limit, where the superconducting coherence length is shorter than the mean free path. Vortex motion-induced losses are suppressed for films in the dirty limit, which show evidence of structural defects that can pin vortices. We verify this hypothesis by explicitly pinning vortices via patterning and find that we can suppress the loss by microfabrication.

Authors: Michael K.-H. Kiessling, A. Shadi Tahvildar-Zadeh
Abstract: We formulate a Lorentz-covariant bispinorial wave function and wave equation for a single photon on a curved background with no symmetries. We show the existence of a 10-dimensional set of conservation laws for this equation, and prove that on an asymptotically flat background 8 of these conservation laws yield global, gauge-invariant, ADM-like quantities that together define a covariantly constant self-dual bispinor.

Title: Dynamics in Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theory: Approaching the Continuum Limit with Partitionings of SU$(2)$
Authors: Timo Jakobs, Marco Garofalo, Tobias Hartung, Karl Jansen, Johann Ostmeyer, Simone Romiti, Carsten Urbach
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a digitised SU$(2)$ lattice gauge theory in the Hamiltonian formalism. We use partitionings to digitise the gauge degrees of freedom and show how to define a penalty term based on finite element methods to project onto physical states of the system. Moreover, we show for a single plaquette system that in this framework the limit $g\to0$ can be approached at constant cost.

Title: Anti Kibble-Zurek behavior in the quantum XY spin-1/2 chain driven by correlated noisy magnetic field and anisotropy
Authors: S. Sadeghizade, R. Jafari, A. Langari
Abstract: In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.

Title: Many-Body Localization and Particle Statistics in Disordered Bose-Hubbard Model
Authors: Jie Chen, Chun Chen, Xiaoqun Wang
Abstract: We study the potential influence of the particle statistics on the stability of the many-body localization in the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. Within the higher-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, we find that there is no apparent finite-size boundary drift between the thermal phase and the many-body localized regime. We substantiate this observation by introducing the Van Vleck perturbation theory into the field of many-body localization. The appropriateness of this method rests largely on the peculiar Hilbert-space structure enabled by the particles' Bose statistics. The situation is reversed in the lower-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, where the significant finite-size boundary drift pushes the putative many-body localized regime up to the greater disorder strengths. We utilize the algebraic projection method to make a connection linking the disordered Bose-Hubbard model in the lower-energy section to an intricate disordered spin chain model. This issue of the finite-size drift could hence be analogous to what happens in the disordered Heisenberg chain. Both trends might be traced back to the particles' intrinsic or emergent Fermi statistics.

Title: Dynamic Hologram Generation with Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Xing-Yu Zhang, Yu-Qing Wang, Angrui Du, Han Wang, Lei Wang, Jinguo Liu
Abstract: We designed an automatic differentiation-based strategy to generate optical trap arrays that change smoothly in time. Instead of repeatedly regenerating the holograms for each time step, we derive the differential form of the phase dynamics that enables the continuous evolution of the trap coordinates. This differential form is derived from the implicit differentiation of the fixed point of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, which is computationally efficient. We carried out numerical and laboratory experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the phase continuity and reducing the computational burden compared to the traditional pure interpolation techniques. By combining the method with the spatial light modulator, the method is promising for the dynamic manipulation of particles in real experiments.

Title: Quantum-limited amplification without instability
Authors: A. Metelmann, O. Lanes, T-Z. Chien, A. McDonald, I. Tsiamis, M. Hatridge, A. A. Clerk
Abstract: Quantum parametric amplifiers typically generate by operating in proximity to a point of dynamical instability. We consider an alternate general strategy where quantum-limited, large-gain amplification is achieved without any proximity to a dynamical instability. Our basic mechanism (involving dynamics that conserves the number of squeezed photons) enables the design of a variety of one and two mode amplifiers that are not limited by any fundamental gain-bandwidth constraint. We focus on a particular realization that allows us to realize an ideal single-mode squeezing operation in transmission, and which has zero reflection. We present both a thorough theoretical analysis of this system (including pump-depletion effects), and also discuss results of an experimental superconducting quantum circuit implementation.

Title: Impact of decoherence on the fidelity of quantum gates leaving the computational subspace
Authors: Tahereh Abad, Yoni Schattner, Anton Frisk Kockum, Göran Johansson
Abstract: The fidelity of quantum operations is often limited by incoherent errors, which typically can be modeled by fundamental Markovian noise processes such as amplitude damping and dephasing. In Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 150504 (2022; this https URL), we presented an analytical result for the average gate fidelity of a general multiqubit operation in terms of the dissipative rates and the corresponding Lindblad jump operators, provided that the operation remains in the computational subspace throughout the time evolution. Here we generalize this expression for the average gate fidelity to include the cases where the system state temporarily leaves the computational subspace during the gate. Such gate mechanisms are integral to several quantum-computing platforms, and our formula is applicable to all of them; as examples, we employ it for the two-qubit controlled-Z gate in both superconducting qubits and neutral atoms. We also obtain the average gate fidelity for simultaneous operations applied in multiqubit systems. These results are useful for understanding the error budgets of quantum gates while scaling up quantum computers.

Title: Approximation and Generalization Capacities of Parametrized Quantum Circuits for Functions in Sobolev Spaces
Authors: Alberto Manzano, David Dechant, Jordi Tura, Vedran Dunjko
Abstract: Parametrized quantum circuits (PQC) are quantum circuits which consist of both fixed and parametrized gates. In recent approaches to quantum machine learning (QML), PQCs are essentially ubiquitous and play the role analogous to classical neural networks. They are used to learn various types of data, with an underlying expectation that if the PQC is made sufficiently deep, and the data plentiful, the generalization error will vanish, and the model will capture the essential features of the distribution. While there exist results proving the approximability of square-integrable functions by PQCs under the $L^2$ distance, the approximation for other function spaces and under other distances has been less explored. In this work we show that PQCs can approximate the space of continuous functions, $p$-integrable functions and the $H^k$ Sobolev spaces under specific distances. Moreover, we develop generalization bounds that connect different function spaces and distances. These results provide a theoretical basis for different applications of PQCs, for example for solving differential equations. Furthermore, they provide us with new insight on the role of the data normalization in PQCs and of loss functions which better suit the specific needs of the users.

Title: Learning to learn with an evolutionary strategy applied to variational quantum algorithms
Authors: Lucas Friedrich, Jonas Maziero
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) employ parameterized quantum circuits optimized using classical methods to minimize a cost function. While VQAs have found broad applications, certain challenges persist. Notably, a significant computational burden arises during parameter optimization. The prevailing ``parameter shift rule'' mandates a double evaluation of the cost function for each parameter. In this article, we introduce a novel optimization approach named ``Learning to Learn with an Evolutionary Strategy'' (LLES). LLES unifies ``Learning to Learn'' and ``Evolutionary Strategy'' methods. ``Learning to Learn'' treats optimization as a learning problem, utilizing recurrent neural networks to iteratively propose VQA parameters. Conversely, ``Evolutionary Strategy'' employs gradient searches to estimate function gradients. Our optimization method is applied to two distinct tasks: determining the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian and training a quantum neural network. The obtained results underscore the efficacy of this novel approach. Additionally, we identify a key hyperparameter that significantly influences gradient estimation using the ``Evolutionary Strategy'' method.

Title: Incoherent Approximation of Leakage in Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Jeffrey Marshall, Dvir Kafri
Abstract: Quantum error correcting codes typically do not account for quantum state transitions - leakage - out of the computational subspace. Since these errors can last for multiple detection rounds they can significantly contribute to logical errors. It is therefore important to understand how to numerically model them efficiently. Fully quantum simulations of leakage require more levels per leaked qubit, which substantially limits the system sizes that may be simulated. To address this, we introduce a Subspace Twirling Approximation (STA) on quantum channels that preserves the incoherence between the computational and leakage subspaces. The assumption of incoherence enables the quantum simulation of leakage at little computational overhead. We motivate the approximation's validity by showing that incoherence is achieved naturally during repeated stabilizer measurements. Additionally, we provide various simulation results which show that the STA yields accurate error correction statistics in the repetition and surface codes with physical error parameters.

Title: Neural quantum kernels: training quantum kernels with quantum neural networks
Authors: Pablo Rodriguez-Grasa, Yue Ban, Mikel Sanz
Abstract: Quantum and classical machine learning have been naturally connected through kernel methods, which have also served as proof-of-concept for quantum advantage. Quantum embeddings encode classical data into quantum feature states, enabling the construction of embedding quantum kernels (EQKs) by measuring vector similarities and projected quantum kernels (PQKs) through projections of these states. However, in both approaches, the model is influenced by the choice of the embedding. In this work, we propose using the training of a quantum neural network (QNN) to construct neural quantum kernels: both neural EQKs and neural PQKs, which are problem-inspired kernels. Unlike previous methods in the literature, our approach requires the kernel matrix to be constructed only once. We present several strategies for constructing neural quantum kernels and propose a scalable method to train an $n$-qubit data re-uploading quantum neural network (QNN). We provide numerical evidence of the performance of these models under noisy conditions. Additionally, we demonstrate how neural quantum kernels can alleviate exponential concentration and enhance generalization capabilities compared to problem-agnostic kernels, positioning them as a scalable and robust solution for quantum machine learning applications.

Title: Dicke superradiant enhancement of the heat current in circuit QED
Authors: Gian Marcello Andolina, Paolo Andrea Erdman, Frank Noé, Jukka Pekola, Marco Schirò
Abstract: Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.

Title: Emergent Continuous Time Crystal in Dissipative Quantum Spin System without Driving
Authors: Shu Yang, Zeqing Wang, Libin Fu, Jianwen Jie
Abstract: Time crystals are a nonequilibrium phase of matter that extend fundamental spontaneous symmetry breaking into the temporal dimension, typically requiring external driving for their realization. Here, we explore the nonequilibrium phase diagram of a two-dimensional dissipative Heisenberg spin system without external coherent or incoherent driving. Through numerical analysis of spin dynamics, we identify nonstationary steady states, some of which are limit cycles with persistent periodic oscillations, while others exhibit chaotic, aperiodic behavior. The emergence of limit cycle steady states breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry of this time-independent many-body system, classifying them as continuous time crystals. We further validate these oscillatory behaviors by testing their stability against local perturbations and assess the robustness of the emergent continuous time crystals by introducing isotropic Gaussian white noise. This work provides insights into the intricate interplay between the dissipation and spin interaction, and opens possibilities for realizing dissipation-induced, heating-immune time crystals.

Title: Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems with a Block Encoding Quantum Optimizer
Authors: Adelina Bärligea, Benedikt Poggel, Jeanette Miriam Lorenz
Abstract: In the pursuit of achieving near-term quantum advantage for combinatorial optimization problems, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) are the primary methods of interest, but their practical effectiveness remains uncertain. Therefore, there is a persistent need to develop and evaluate alternative variational quantum algorithms. This study presents an investigation of the Block ENcoding Quantum Optimizer (BENQO), a hybrid quantum solver that uses block encoding to represent the cost function. BENQO is designed to be universally applicable across discrete optimization problems. Beyond Maximum Cut, we evaluate BENQO's performance in the context of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, which is of greater practical relevance. Our findings confirm that BENQO performs significantly better than QAOA and competes with VQE across a variety of performance metrics. We conclude that BENQO is a promising novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that should be further investigated and optimized to realize its full potential.

Title: Realization of a crosstalk-free two-ion node for long-distance quantum networking

Abstract: Trapped atomic ions constitute one of the leading physical platforms for building the quantum repeater nodes to realize large-scale quantum networks. In a long-distance trapped-ion quantum network, it is essential to have crosstalk-free dual-type qubits: one type, called the communication qubit, to establish an entangling interface with telecom photons; and the other type, called the memory qubit, to store quantum information immune from photon scattering under entangling attempts. Here, we report the first experimental implementation of a telecom-compatible and crosstalk-free quantum network node based on two trapped $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ ions. The memory qubit is encoded on a long-lived metastable level to avoid crosstalk with the communication qubit encoded in another subspace of the same ion species, and a quantum wavelength conversion module is employed to generate ion-photon entanglement over a $12\,$km fiber in a heralded style. Our work therefore constitutes an important step towards the realization of quantum repeaters and long-distance quantum networks.

Title: Quantum encoder for fixed Hamming-weight subspaces
Authors: Renato M. S. Farias, Thiago O. Maciel, Giancarlo Camilo, Ruge Lin, Sergi Ramos-Calderer, Leandro Aolita
Abstract: We present an exact $n$-qubit computational-basis amplitude encoder of real- or complex-valued data vectors of $d=\binom{n}{k}$ components into a subspace of fixed Hamming weight $k$. This represents a polynomial space compression of degree $k$. The circuit is optimal in that it expresses an arbitrary data vector using only $d-1$ (controlled) Reconfigurable Beam Splitter (RBS) gates and is constructed by an efficient classical algorithm that sequentially generates all bitstrings of weight $k$ and identifies the gates that superpose the corresponding states with the correct amplitudes. An explicit compilation into CNOTs and single-qubit gates is presented, with the total CNOT-gate count of $\mathcal{O}(k\, d)$ provided in analytical form. In addition, we show how to load data in the binary basis by sequentially stacking encoders of different Hamming weights using $\mathcal{O}(d\,\log(d))$ CNOT gates. Moreover, using generalized RBS gates that mix states of different Hamming weights, we extend the construction to efficiently encode arbitrary sparse vectors. Experimentally, we perform a proof-of-principle demonstration of our scheme on a commercial trapped-ion quantum computer. We successfully upload a $q$-Gaussian probability distribution in the non-log-concave regime with $n = 6$ and $k = 2$. We also showcase how the effect of hardware noise can be alleviated by quantum error mitigation. Numerically, we show how our encoder can improve the performance of variational quantum algorithms for problems that include particle-preserving symmetries. Our results constitute a versatile framework for quantum data compression with various potential applications in fields such as quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, and constrained combinatorial optimizations.

Title: Optimizing Gate Decomposition for High-Level Quantum Programming
Authors: Evandro C. R. Rosa, Eduardo I. Duzzioni, Rafael de Santiago
Abstract: This paper presents novel methods for optimizing multi-controlled quantum gates, which naturally arise in high-level quantum programming. Our primary approach involves rewriting $U(2)$ gates as $SU(2)$ gates, utilizing one auxiliary qubit for phase correction. This reduces the number of CNOT gates required to decompose any multi-controlled quantum gate from $O(n^2)$ to at most $32n$. Additionally, we can reduce the number of CNOTs for multi-controlled Pauli gates from $16n$ to $12n$ and propose an optimization to reduce the number of controlled gates in high-level quantum programming. We have implemented these optimizations in the Ket quantum programming platform and demonstrated significant reductions in the number of gates. For instance, for a Grover's algorithm layer with 114 qubits, we achieved a reduction in the number of CNOTs from 101,252 to 2,684. This reduction in the number of gates significantly impacts the execution time of quantum algorithms, thereby enhancing the feasibility of executing them on NISQ computers.

Title: Bridging magic and non-Gaussian resources via Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill encoding
Authors: Oliver Hahn, Giulia Ferrini, Ryuji Takagi
Abstract: Although the similarity between non-stabilizer states -- also known as magic states -- in discrete-variable systems and non-Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems has widely been recognized, the precise connections between these two notions have still been unclear. We establish a fundamental link between these two quantum resources via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. We show that the negativity of the continuous-variable Wigner function for an encoded GKP state coincides with a magic measure we introduce, which matches the negativity of the discrete Wigner function for odd dimensions. We also provide a continuous-variable representation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy -- a recent proposal for a magic measure for multi-qubit states. With this in hand, we give a classical simulation algorithm with runtime scaling with the resource contents, quantified by our magic measures. We also employ our results to prove that implementing a multi-qubit logical non-Clifford operation in the GKP code subspace requires a non-Gaussian operation even at the limit of perfect encoding, despite the fact that the ideal GKP states already come with a large amount of non-Gaussianity.

Title: Quantum key distribution rates from non-symmetric conic optimization
Authors: Andrés González Lorente, Pablo V. Parellada, Miguel Castillo-Celeita, Mateus Araújo
Abstract: Computing key rates in quantum key distribution (QKD) numerically is essential to unlock more powerful protocols, that use more sophisticated measurement bases or quantum systems of higher dimension. It is a difficult optimization problem, that depends on minimizing a convex non-linear function: the (quantum) relative entropy. Standard conic optimization techniques have for a long time been unable to handle the relative entropy cone, as it is a non-symmetric cone, and the standard algorithms can only handle symmetric ones. Recently, however, a practical algorithm has been discovered for optimizing over non-symmetric cones, including the relative entropy. Here we adapt this algorithm to the problem of computation of key rates, obtaining an efficient technique for lower bounding them. In comparison to previous techniques it has the advantages of flexibility, ease of use, and above all performance.

Title: Atom Cavity Encoding for NP-Complete Problems
Authors: Meng Ye, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: We consider an atom-cavity system having long-range atomic interactions mediated by cavity modes. It has been shown that quantum simulations of spin models with this system can naturally be used to solve number partition problems. Here, we present encoding schemes for numerous NP-complete problems, encompassing the majority of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. We find a number of such computation problems can be encoded by the atom-cavity system at a linear cost of atom number. There are still certain problems that cannot be encoded by the atom-cavity as efficiently, such as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and the Hamiltonian cycle. For these problems, we provide encoding schemes with a quadratic or quartic cost in the atom number. We expect this work to provide important guidance to search for the practical quantum advantage of the atom-cavity system in solving NP-complete problems. Moreover, the encoding schemes we develop here may also be adopted in other optical systems for solving NP-complete problems, where a similar form of Mattis-type spin glass Hamiltonian as in the atom-cavity system can be implemented.

Title: Efficient detection of nonclassicality using moments of the Wigner function
Authors: Bivas Mallick, Sudip Chakrabarty, Saheli Mukherjee, Ananda G. Maity, A. S. Majumdar
Abstract: States with a negative Wigner function, a significant subclass of nonclassical states, serve as a valuable resource for various quantum information processing tasks. Here, we provide a criterion for detecting such quantum states characterized by a negative Wigner function. Our method relies on evaluating moments of the Wigner function, which involves computing simple functionals and can be implemented in a real experiment without the need for full state tomography or Wigner function reconstruction. We provide explicit examples to support our detection scheme. Further, we propose an experimental method utilizing the mode SWAP operator to realize these moments in a real experiment.

Title: To reset, or not to reset -- that is the question
Authors: György P. Gehér, Marcin Jastrzebski, Earl T. Campbell, Ophelia Crawford
Abstract: Whether to reset qubits, or not, during quantum error correction experiments is a question of both foundational and practical importance for quantum computing. Text-book quantum error correction demands that qubits are reset after measurement. However, fast qubit reset has proven challenging to execute at high fidelity. Consequently, many cutting-edge quantum error correction experiments are opting for the no-reset approach, where physical reset is not performed. It has recently been postulated that no-reset is functionally equivalent to reset procedures, as well as being faster and easier. For memory experiments, we confirm numerically that resetting provides no benefit. On the other hand, we identify a remarkable difference during logical operations. We find that unconditionally resetting qubits can reduce the duration of fault-tolerant logical operation by up to a factor of two as the number of measurement errors that can be tolerated is doubled. We support this with numerical simulations. However, our simulations also reveal that the no-reset performance is superior if the reset duration and infidelity exceed given thresholds. For example, with the noise model we considered, we find the no-reset performance to be superior when the reset duration is greater than approximately $100$ ns and the physical error probability is greater than approximately $10^{-2.5} \approx 0.003$. Lastly, we introduce two novel syndrome extraction circuits that can reduce the time overhead of no-reset approaches. Our findings provide guidance on how experimentalists should design future experiments.

Title: Chaos destroys the excited state quantum phase transition of the Kerr parametric oscillator
Authors: Ignacio García-Mata, Miguel A. Prado Reynoso, Rodrigo G. Cortiñas, Jorge Chávez-Carlos, Victor S. Batista, Lea F. Santos, Diego A. Wisniacki
Abstract: The driven Kerr parametric oscillator, of interest to fundamental physics and quantum technologies, exhibits an excited state quantum phase transition (ESQPT) originating in an unstable classical periodic orbit. The main signature of this type of ESQPT is a singularity in the level density in the vicinity of the energy of the classical separatrix that divides the phase space into two distinct regions. The quantum states with energies below the separatrix are useful for quantum technologies, because they show a cat-like structure that protects them against local decoherence processes. In this work, we show how chaos arising from the interplay between the external drive and the nonlinearities of the system destroys the ESQPT and eventually eliminates the cat states. Our results demonstrate the importance of the analysis of theoretical models for the design of new parametric oscillators with ever larger nonlinearities.

Title: Quantum convolutional neural networks for jet images classification
Authors: Hala Elhag, Tobias Hartung, Karl Jansen, Lento Nagano, Giorgio Menicagli Pirina, Alice Di Tucci
Abstract: Recently, interest in quantum computing has significantly increased, driven by its potential advantages over classical techniques. Quantum machine learning (QML) exemplifies one of the important quantum computing applications that are expected to surpass classical machine learning in a wide range of instances. This paper addresses the performance of QML in the context of high-energy physics (HEP). As an example, we focus on the top-quark tagging, for which classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been effective but fall short in accuracy when dealing with highly energetic jet images. In this paper, we use a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for this task and compare its performance with CNN using a classical noiseless simulator. We compare various setups for the QCNN, varying the convolutional circuit, type of encoding, loss function, and batch sizes. For every quantum setup, we design a similar setup to the corresponding classical model for a fair comparison. Our results indicate that QCNN with proper setups tend to perform better than their CNN counterparts, particularly when the convolution block has a lower number of parameters. For the higher parameter regime, the QCNN circuit was adjusted according to the dimensional expressivity analysis (DEA) to lower the parameter count while preserving its optimal structure. The DEA circuit demonstrated improved results over the comparable classical CNN model.

Title: $χ$-Colorable Graph States: Closed-Form Expressions and Quantum Orthogonal Arrays
Authors: Konstantinos-Rafail Revis, Hrachya Zakaryan, Zahra Raissi
Abstract: Graph states are a fundamental class of multipartite entangled quantum states with wide-ranging applications in quantum information and computation. In this work, we develop a systematic framework for constructing and analyzing $\chi$-colorable graph states, deriving explicit closed-form expressions for arbitrary $\chi$. For two- and a broad family of three-colorable graph states, the representations obtained using only local operations, require a minimal number of terms in the Z-eigenbasis. We prove that every two-colorable graph state is local Clifford (LC) equivalent to a state expressible as a summation of rows of an orthogonal array (OA), providing a structured approach to writing highly entangled states. For graph states with $\chi > 2$, we show that they are LC-equivalent to quantum orthogonal arrays (QOAs), establishing a direct combinatorial connection between multipartite entanglement and structured quantum states. Additionally, the derived closed-form expression has the minimal Schmidt measure for every two-colorable and a broad family of three-colorable graph states. Furthermore, the upper and lower bounds of the Schmidt measure are also discussed. Our results offer an efficient and practical method for systematically constructing graph states, optimizing their representation in quantum circuits, and identifying structured forms of multipartite entanglement. This framework also connects graph states to $k$-uniform and absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states, motivating further exploration of the structure of entangled states and their applications in quantum networks, quantum error correction, and measurement based quantum computing.

Title: Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning
Authors: Li-Li Ye, Ying-Cheng Lai
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.

Title: BEADS: A Canonical Visualization of Quantum States for Applications in Quantum Information Processing
Authors: Dennis Huber, Steffen J. Glaser
Abstract: We introduce a generalized phase-space representation of qubit systems called the BEADS representation which makes it possible to visualize arbitrary quantum states in an intuitive and an easy to grasp way. Our representation is exact, bijective, and general. It bridges the gap between the highly abstract mathematical description of quantum mechanical phenomena and the mission to convey them to non-specialists in terms of meaningful pictures and tangible models. Several levels of simplifications can be chosen, e.g., when using the BEADS representation in the communication of quantum mechanics to the general public. In particular, this visualization has predictive power in contrast to simple metaphors such as Schrödinger's cat.

Title: Nonclassicality and sub-Planck structures of photon subtracted compass states
Authors: Amit Das, Sobhan Sounda
Abstract: We discuss the nonclassical properties of photon-subtracted compass states (PSCS). Nonclassical behavior is studied using various parameters like the Wigner function, squeezing, and photon statistical parameters like Mandels Q-function, second-order correlation function, Agarwal Tara $A_3$ criterion, and photon number distribution. Further analysis is being done to investigate the subPlanck structures in the Wigner functions of these PSCS. We also show that the photon subtraction does not cause the loss of sensitivity due to the displacement of the states in phase space.

Title: An Improved Quantum Algorithm of the Multislice Method
Authors: Y.C. Wang, Y. Sun, Z.J. Ding
Abstract: The multisilce method is an important algorithm for electron diffraction and image simulations in transmission electron microscopy. We have proposed a quantum algorithm of the multislice method based on quantum circuit model previously. In this work we have developed an improved quantum algorithm. We reconstruct the phase-shifting quantum circuit without using the multi-controlled quantum gates, thereby significantly improve the computation efficiency. The new quantum circuit also allows further gate count reduction at the cost of a controllable error. We have simulated the quantum circuit on a classical supercomputer and analyzed the result to prove the feasibility and correctness of the improved quantum algorithm. We also provide proper parameter settings through testing, allowing the minimization of the necessary number of quantum gates while limiting the relative error within 1%. This work demonstrates the potential of applying quantum computing to electron diffraction simulations and achieving quantum advantages.

Title: Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations
Authors: Husein Natur, Uzi Pereg
Abstract: We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.

Title: Modular Compilation for Quantum Chiplet Architectures
Authors: Mingyoung Jessica Jeng, Nikola Vuk Maruszewski, Connor Selna, Michael Gavrincea, Kaitlin N. Smith, Nikos Hardavellas
Abstract: As quantum computing technology continues to mature, industry is adopting modular quantum architectures to keep quantum scaling on the projected path and meet performance targets. However, the complexity of chiplet-based quantum devices, coupled with their growing size, presents an imminent scalability challenge for quantum compilation. Contemporary compilation methods are not well-suited to chiplet architectures. In particular, existing qubit allocation methods are often unable to contend with inter-chiplet links, which don't necessary support a universal basis gate set. Furthermore, existing methods of logical-to-physical qubit placement, swap insertion (routing), unitary synthesis, and/or optimization are typically not designed for qubit links of significantly varying levels of duration or fidelity. In this work, we propose SEQC, a complete and parallelized compilation pipeline optimized for chiplet-based quantum computers, including several novel methods for qubit placement, qubit routing, and circuit optimization. SEQC attains up to a 36% increase in circuit fidelity, accompanied by execution time improvements of up to 1.92x. Additionally, owing to its ability to parallelize compilation, SEQC achieves consistent solve time improvements of 2-4x over a chiplet-aware Qiskit baseline.

Title: Optimal Performance of an Asymmetric Quantum Harmonic Otto Engine and Refrigerator
Authors: Monika, Shishram Rebari
Abstract: We study a quantum Otto cycle operating with a time-dependent harmonic oscillator as the working material. We examine the asymmetry present between the two adiabatic processes of the Otto cycle, focusing on cases of sudden expansion and sudden compression. We analytically derive the efficiency and coefficient of performance for an asymmetric Otto cycle, employing the Omega function, which represents the balance between the maximum useful energy and minimum lost energy. Notably, our findings reveal that the efficiency (coefficient of performance) of an asymmetric engine (refrigerator) is higher during the sudden compression case compared to the sudden expansion case. Furthermore, we derive the results for the maximum work efficiency and observe that efficiency at the maximum Omega function consistently exceeds the maximum work efficiency. Finally, we compute the fractional loss of work in both cases to thoroughly examine the performance of asymmetric Otto engine.

Title: Achievable rates in non-asymptotic bosonic quantum communication
Authors: Francesco Anna Mele, Giovanni Barbarino, Vittorio Giovannetti, Marco Fanizza
Abstract: Bosonic quantum communication has extensively been analysed in the asymptotic setting, assuming infinite channel uses and vanishing communication errors. Comparatively fewer detailed analyses are available in the non-asymptotic setting, which addresses a more precise, quantitative evaluation of the optimal communication rate: how many uses of a bosonic Gaussian channel are required to transmit $k$ qubits, distil $k$ Bell pairs, or generate $k$ secret-key bits, within a given error tolerance $\varepsilon$? In this work, we address this question by finding easily computable lower bounds on the non-asymptotic capacities of Gaussian channels. To derive our results, we develop new tools of independent interest. In particular, we find a stringent bound on the probability $P_{>N}$ that a Gaussian state has more than $N$ photons, demonstrating that $P_{>N}$ decreases exponentially with $N$. Furthermore, we design the first algorithm capable of computing the trace distance between two Gaussian states up to a fixed precision.

Title: Assessing Quantum Layout Synthesis Tools via Known Optimal-SWAP Cost Benchmarks
Authors: Shuohao Ping, Wan-Hsuan Lin, Daniel Bochen Tan, Jason Cong
Abstract: Quantum layout synthesis (QLS) is a critical step in quantum program compilation for superconducting quantum computers, involving the insertion of SWAP gates to satisfy hardware connectivity constraints. While previous works have introduced SWAP-free benchmarks with known-optimal depths for evaluating QLS tools, these benchmarks overlook SWAP count - a key performance metric. Real-world applications often require SWAP gates, making SWAP-free benchmarks insufficient for fully assessing QLS tool performance. To address this limitation, we introduce QUBIKOS, a benchmark set with provable-optimal SWAP counts and non-trivial circuit structures. For the first time, we are able to quantify the optimality gaps of SWAP gate usages of the leading QLS algorithms, which are surprisingly large: LightSabre from IBM delivers the best performance with an optimality gap of 63x, followed by ML-QLS with an optimality gap of 117x. Similarly, QMAP and t|ket> exhibit significantly larger gaps of 250x and 330x, respectively. This highlights the need for further advancements in QLS methodologies. Beyond evaluation, QUBIKOS offers valuable insights for guiding the development of future QLS tools, as demonstrated through an analysis of a suboptimal case in LightSABRE. This underscores QUBIKOS's utility as both an evaluation framework and a tool for advancing QLS research.

Title: One-shot manipulation of coherence in dynamic quantum resource theory
Authors: Yu Luo
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum information is to understand the operational significance of quantum resources. Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a powerful theoretical framework that aids in analyzing and comprehending the operational meaning of these resources. Early resource theories primarily focused on analyzing static quantum resources. Recently, there has been growing interest in the study of dynamic quantum resources. In this paper, we utilize superchannel theory to describe the dynamic resource theory of quantum coherence. In this dynamic resource theory, we treat classical channels as free channels and consider two classes of free superchannels that preserve channel incoherence (maximally incoherent superchannels (MISC) and dephasing-covariant incoherent superchannels (DISC)) as free resources. We regard the quantum Fourier transform as the golden unit of dynamic coherence resources. We first establish the one-shot theory of dynamic coherence cost and dynamic coherence distillation, which involves converting the quantum Fourier transform into an arbitrary quantum channel using MISC and DISC. Next, we introduce a class of free superchannels known as $\delta$-MISC, which asymptotically generate negligible dynamic coherence. Finally, we provide upper and lower bounds for the one-shot catalytic dynamic coherence cost of quantum channels under the action of these $\delta$-MISC superchannels.

Title: Weak continuous measurements require more work than strong ones
Authors: Lorena Ballesteros Ferraz, Cyril Elouard
Abstract: We analyze a dynamical model for a quantum measurement process, able to capture nonideal (weak or inefficient) measurements. In this model, the irreversibility of the measurement dynamics is due to action of a reservoir at equilibrium, which cause decoherence between the states associated with different measurement results. We analyze the performance of measurement process generated by the model, by introducing figures of merits to quantify the strength of the measurement and its efficiency. We also derive and analyze a lower bound on the measurement work cost that we can relate to the measurement quality. We take as an illustration a qubit measurement owing to its coupling to a harmonic oscillator. We investigate the long sequences of extremely short and weak measurements (a.k.a continuous measurements), to find under which conditions they converge to an ndeal measurement and analyze their work cost. Surprisingly, we find that a sequence converging towards a projective measurement has a much larger work cost than a equivalent strong measurement obtained from a single intense interaction with the apparatus. We extend this result to a large class of models owing to scaling arguments. Our analysis offer new insights into the trade-offs between measurement strength, energy consumption, and information extraction in quantum measurement protocols.

Title: Analytical results for laser models producing a beam with sub-Poissonian photon statistics and coherence scaling as the Heisenberg limit
Authors: Lucas A. Ostrowski, Travis J. Baker, Dominic W. Berry, Howard M. Wiseman
Abstract: Recent advances in laser theory have demonstrated that a quantum enhancement is possible for the production of coherence $\mathfrak{C}$ by a continuous-wave laser device. Curiously, natural families of laser models that achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling for coherence produce the most coherence when the beam exhibits sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In this work, we provide an analytical treatment of those novel families of laser models by specializing to a parameter regime that permits a linearization. We characterize the dynamics of each laser system, and find that some of the intuitions from standard laser theory may be applied here. Specifically, the intracavity number dynamics are well-described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the intracavity phase dynamics are well-described in terms of a physically realizable ensemble of pure states, which evolve according to pure phase diffusion. Unlike a standard laser, however, we find that the pure states comprising the ensemble in the Heisenberg-limited lasers are substantially phase squeezed. From our dynamical analysis, we deduce various quantities of the beam for each laser family, including the first- and second-order Glauber coherence functions, intensity noise spectrum, Mandel-Q parameter and coherence $\mathfrak{C}$. In addition, inspired from these phase diffusion dynamics, we derive an upper bound on laser coherence $\mathfrak{C} \lesssim 1.1156 \mu^4$ -- which is tighter by a factor of $3/8$ when compared to that derived in [Baker et al., Nat. Phys. 17 179 (2021)] -- by making one of the assumptions of that paper slightly stronger.

Title: Generalized Uncertainty Principle For Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Tarek Yehia
Abstract: We introduce an extension of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that broadens the traditional limits by incorporating the dynamical evolution of the observables. We establish a bound on the simultaneous precision of observables and their rate of change. The relation is derived from established and fundamental uncertainty principles and Heisenberg's equation of motion, we will show that it recovers standard uncertainty limits when applied to well-known cases. We will show its implications through analytical and numerical studies in many quantum systems. These include 1D harmonic oscillator and free particle, relativistic Dirac particle, spin-1/2 particle, Jaynes-Cummings model, QFT, and QED. This relation offers new insights into quantum dynamics and speed limits.

Title: Characterizing dynamical behaviors in topological open systems with boundary dissipations
Authors: Zhen-Yu Zheng, Xueliang Wang, Shu Chen
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with boundary dissipations described by Lindblad master equations and unravel distinct dynamical features in the topologically different phases of the underlying Hamiltonian. By examining the long-time damping dynamics, we uncover a dynamical duality phenomenon between the weak and strong dissipation region, which exists only in the topologically non-trivial phase, linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectra,particularly the stripe closest to the steady state. When dissipation is confined to a single boundary, the dynamical duality phenomenon still exists. Under this condition, the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential size scaling relation in the topologically non-trivial phase and a power-law size scaling relation in the topologically trivial phase. Within the topologically non-trivial region, we identify the existence of boundary-localized dark states in the thermodynamical limit, which is responsible for the exponential size decay of Liouvillian gap.

Title: Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees
Authors: Jernej Rudi Finžgar, Simone Notarnicola, Madelyn Cain, Mikhail D. Lukin, Dries Sels
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.

Title: Quantum of action in entangled relativity
Authors: Olivier Minazzoli
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate that the novel general theory of relativity named `Entangled Relativity' is more economical than General Relativity in terms of universal dimensionful constants and units when both theories are considered through a path integral formulation. The sole parameter of Entangled Relativity is a quantum of energy squared. However, in order to recover standard Quantum Field Theory when gravity is neglected in the path integral, we show that this quantum of energy corresponds to the reduced Planck energy. But this result also implies that Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ and Newton's constant $G$ are not fixed constants in this framework but vary proportionally to a gravitational scalar degree-of-freedom, akin to typical scalar-tensor and $f(R)$ theories. In particular, it is derived that $\hbar$ is proportional to $G$ in this framework. This establishes an explicit connection between the quantum and gravitational realms. Given the absence of any free theoretical parameter in the theory, we evaluate the level of variation of $\hbar$ and $G$ in the solar system and for neutron stars. We argue that this type of quantitative predictions might be probed observationally in the future, although their amplitudes are extremely small.

Title: Blue repulsive potential for dysprosium Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Niccolò Preti, Nicolò Antolini, Giulio Biagioni, Andrea Fioretti, Giovanni Modugno, Luca Tanzi, Carlo Gabbanini
Abstract: Short-wavelength repulsive potentials for quantum gases allow to realize new systems and to study new phenomena. Here we report the realization of repulsive optical potentials for dysprosium atoms in the blue region of the spectrum, at wavelengths close to 400 nm. We employ a spectrallyfiltered diode laser system to measure both scalar and tensorial components of the polarizability of dysprosium, which we find in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the implementation of potential strengths appropriate to manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates, with scattering-limited lifetimes exceeding one second. This type of optical potentials opens interesting directions for the study of dipolar superfluids and supersolids.

Title: Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons
Authors: Zeno Bacciconi, Hernan Xavier, Iacopo Carusotto, Titas Chanda, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.

Title: Local analysis of a single impurity on a graphene Josephson Junction
Authors: Ignazio Vacante, Francesco M.D. Pellegrino, G.G.N. Angilella, Giuseppe A. Falci, Elisabetta Paladino
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the local effects of a single short-range impurity on the electron system of a short ballistic graphene Josephson Junction. Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De Gennes approach, we systematically analyze the local density states, whose subgap energy dependence enables us to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes and identify the magnetic nature of the impurity. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial dependence of the local density of states is a sensitive probe of the microscopic processes resulting in subgap impurity-induced bound states. The Fourier analysis evidences the wavevectors related to the momenta of the high transmissive channels in ballistic graphene.

Title: Dirac Equation Solution with Generalized tanh-Shaped Hyperbolic Potential: Application to Charmonium and Bottomonium Mass Spectra
Authors: V. H. Badalov, A. I. Ahmadov, E. A. Dadashov, S. V. Badalov
Abstract: In the study, we present an analytical solution of the Dirac equation in a generalized tanh-shape hyperbolic potential, which allows us to unify various well-known quantum potentials under a single theoretical framework. This versatile potential model is used to compute the mass spectra for charmonium and bottomonium, with excellent agreement with experimental measurements and does better than some potential models in predicting the several orbital states. Our results not only validate the GTHP as a powerful tool for describing heavy quarkonium systems but also suggest its broader applicability in exploring quantum systems where similar potentials are effective. This work is a stepping stone for new research into fermionic systems with complex interactions, by jointly providing insights into foundational aspects of quantum mechanics as well as applications in particle physics.

Title: Autoionization-enhanced Rydberg dressing by fast contaminant removal
Authors: Alec Cao, Theodor Lukin Yelin, William J. Eckner, Nelson Darkwah Oppong, Adam M. Kaufman
Abstract: Rydberg dressing is a powerful tool for entanglement generation in long-lived atomic states. While already employed effectively in several demonstrations, a key challenge for this technique is the collective loss triggered by blackbody-radiation-driven transitions to contaminant Rydberg states of opposite parity. We demonstrate the rapid removal of such contaminants using autoionization (AI) transitions found in alkaline-earth-like atoms. The AI is shown to be compatible with coherent operation of an array of optical clock qubits. By incorporating AI pulses into a stroboscopic Rydberg dressing (SRD) sequence, we enhance lifetimes by an order of magnitude for system sizes of up to 144 atoms, while maintaining an order of magnitude larger duty cycle than previously achieved. To highlight the utility of our approach, we use the AI-enhanced SRD protocol to improve the degree of spin-squeezing achieved during early-time dressing dynamics. These results bring Rydberg dressing lifetimes closer to fundamental limits, opening the door to previously infeasible dressing proposals.

Title: Strong Structural Bounds for MaxSAT: The Fine Details of Using Neuromorphic and Quantum Hardware Accelerators
Authors: Max Bannach, Jai Grover, Markus Hecher
Abstract: Hardware accelerators like quantum annealers or neuromorphic chips are capable of finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian. A promising route in utilizing these devices is via methods from automated reasoning: The problem at hand is first encoded into MaxSAT; then MaxSAT is reduced to Max2SAT; and finally, Max2SAT is translated into a Hamiltonian. It was observed that different encodings can dramatically affect the efficiency of the hardware accelerators. Yet, previous studies were only concerned with the size of the encodings rather than with syntactic or structural properties. We establish structure-aware reductions between MaxSAT, Max2SAT, and the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO) that underlies such hardware accelerators. All these problems turn out to be equivalent under linear-time, treewidth-preserving reductions. As a consequence, we obtain tight lower bounds under ETH and SETH for Max2SAT and QUBO, as well as a new time-optimal fixed-parameter algorithm for QUBO. While our results are tight up to a constant additive factor for the primal treewidth, we require a constant multiplicative factor for the incidence treewidth. To close the emerging gap, we supplement our results with novel time-optimal algorithms for fragments of MaxSAT based on model counting.

Title: Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas
Authors: Alexander G. Abanov, Dimitri M. Gangardt
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.

Title: Z-basis measurements using mixed parity and direct readout
Authors: Pieter Thijs Eendebak, Önder Gül
Abstract: Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.
