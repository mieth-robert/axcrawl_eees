Title: A simple mechanism for unstable degeneracies in local Hamiltonians
Authors: Jose Garre Rubio
Abstract: If a local Hamiltonian eigenstate is mapped to another state by local operators commuting with the Hamiltonian terms, the latter is also an eigenstate. This basic observation implies a no-go result for being a unique ground state, short-range entangled and protected against local perturbations.

Title: Cavity-mediated cross-cross-resonance gate
Authors: Alexey V. Gorshkov, Daniel Cohen, Arbel Haim, Amit Rotem, Or Golan, Gihwan Kim, Andreas Butler, Connor T. Hann, Oskar Painter, Fernando G.S.L. Brandão, Alex Retzker
Abstract: We propose a cavity-mediated gate between two transmon qubits or other nonlinear superconducting elements. The gate is realized by driving both qubits at a frequency that is near-resonant with the frequency of the cavity. Since both qubits are subject to a cross-resonant drive, we call this gate a cross-cross-resonance gate. In close analogy with gates between trapped-ion qubits, in phase space, the state of the cavity makes a circle whose area depends on the state of the two qubits, realizing a controlled-phase gate. We propose two schemes for canceling the dominant error, which is the dispersive coupling. We also show that this cross-cross-resonance gate allows one to realize simultaneous gates between multiple pairs of qubits coupled via the same metamaterial composed of an array of coupled cavities or other linear mediators.

Title: Universal Resources for QAOA and Quantum Annealing
Authors: Pablo Díez-Valle, Fernando J. Gómez-Ruiz, Diego Porras, Juan José García-Ripoll
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational ansatz that resembles the Trotterized dynamics of a Quantum Annealing (QA) protocol. This work formalizes this connection formally and empirically, showing the angles of a multilayer QAOA circuit converge to universal QA trajectories. Furthermore, the errors in both QAOA circuits and QA paths act as thermal excitations in pseudo-Boltzmann probability distributions whose temperature decreases with the invested resource -- i.e. integrated angles or total time -- and which in QAOA also contain a higher temperature arising from the Trotterization. This also means QAOA and QA are cooling protocols and simulators of partition functions whose target temperature can be tuned by rescaling the universal trajectory. The average cooling power of both methods exhibits favorable algebraic scalings with respect to the target temperature and problem size, whereby in QAOA the coldest temperature is inversely proportional to the number of layers, $T\sim 1/p$, and to the integrated angles -- or integrated interactions in QA.

Title: Orbital angular momentum can take non-integer values in a closed universe
Authors: Daniel Burgarth, Paolo Facchi
Abstract: We show that the spectrum of orbital angular momentum in quantum mechanics consists of two parts when the underlying space has periodic boundaries. While the first part consists of the usual textbook integer quantized values, the second is a continuous band arising from regions at the `edge' of space with respect to the center of rotation. The spectrum thus contains not only half-integer values, previously thought impossible for orbital angular momentum, but even irrational ones. Remarkably, this effect is independent of the size of space. While these spectral components remain undetectable in laboratory experiments, they could still produce observable effects on cosmological scales, for instance in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.

Title: Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.

Title: Investigating Quantum Feature Maps in Quantum Support Vector Machines for Lung Cancer Classification
Authors: My Youssef El Hafidi, Achraf Toufah, Mohamed Achraf Kadim
Abstract: In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising intersection between quantum physics and artificial intelligence, particularly in domains requiring advanced pattern recognition such as healthcare. This study investigates the effectiveness of Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM), which leverage quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to construct high-dimensional Hilbert spaces for data classification. Focusing on lung cancer diagnosis, a concrete and critical healthcare application, we analyze how different quantum feature maps influence classification performance. Using a real-world dataset of 309 patient records with significant class imbalance (39 non-cancer vs. 270 cancer cases), we constructed six balanced subsets for robust evaluation. QSVM models were implemented using Qiskit and executed on the qasm simulator, employing three distinct quantum feature maps: ZFeatureMap, ZZFeatureMap, and PauliFeatureMap. Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. Results show that the PauliFeatureMap consistently outperformed the others, achieving perfect classification in three subsets and strong performance overall. These findings demonstrate how quantum computational principles can be harnessed to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reinforcing the importance of physics-based modeling in emerging AI applications within healthcare.

Title: Coherence and Entanglement in a Quantum Spacetime
Authors: Iarley P. Lobo, Gislaine Varão, Giulia Gubitosi, Moises Rojas, Valdir B. Bezerra
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in a two-particle system with deformed symmetries arising from the quantum nature of spacetime. We demonstrate that the deformation of energy-momentum composition induces a momentum-dependent interaction that counteracts the decoherence effects described by the Lindblad equation in quantum spacetime. This interplay leads to the formation of coherence, entanglement and other correlations, which we quantify using concurrence, the $l_1$-norm of coherence, quantum discord and Local Quantum Fisher Information. Our analysis reveals that while the openness of quantum spacetime ultimately degrades entanglement, it also facilitates the creation and preservation of both classical and quantum correlations.

Title: Ultracoherent superconducting cavity-based multiqudit platform with error-resilient control

Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times and large accessible Hilbert spaces, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with coherence-limited fidelities reaching up to 99.9% after post-selection. These results establish our platform as a robust foundation for quantum information processing, allowing for future extensions to high-dimensional qudit encodings.

Title: Selective Addressing of Coupled Qubits via Complex Frequency Zero Targeting
Authors: Deepanshu Trivedi, Laraib Niaz, Alex Krasnok
Abstract: Achieving precise, individual control over qubits within scalable quantum processors is critically hampered by parasitic couplings and spectral crowding, leading to detrimental crosstalk. While optimal absorption strategies based on time-reversal symmetry have shown promise for single emitters, their applicability is limited in realistic multi-qubit systems where realistic losses break time-reversal symmetry. This work introduces a robust approach using complex frequency (CF) pulses specifically tailored to the complex reflection zeros of the complete, coupled, and explicitly lossy qubit-waveguide system. This method circumvents the limitations of idealized time-reversal arguments by directly engaging with the dissipative system's true response characteristics. We first develop a theoretical framework for a system of three coupled two-level emitters, employing Heisenberg equations to derive the system's response and design appropriate CF pulses that inherently account for the system's dissipative nature. The efficacy and practicality of this approach are then validated through comprehensive transient simulations for a realistic model of three Josephson junction-based transmon qubits, explicitly including intrinsic qubit losses. Our results demonstrate that CF pulses can selectively excite a target qubit with significantly suppressed crosstalk to neighboring qubits, markedly outperforming conventional Gaussian pulses of comparable energy.

Title: Validation of Quantum Elliptic Curve Point Addition Circuits
Authors: Francis P. Papa
Abstract: Specific quantum algorithms exist to-in theory-break elliptic curve cryptographic protocols. Implementing these algorithms requires designing quantum circuits that perform elliptic curve arithmetic. To accurately judge a cryptographic protocol's resistance against future quantum computers, researchers figure out minimal resource-count circuits for performing these operations while still being correct. To assure the correctness of a circuit, it is integral to restore all ancilla qubits used to their original states. Failure to do so could result in decoherence of the computation's final result. Through rigorous classical simulation and unit testing, I surfaced four inconsistencies in the state-of-the-art quantum circuit for elliptic curve point addition where the circuit diagram states the qubits are returned in the original ($|0\rangle$) state, but the intermediate values are not uncomputed. I provide fixes to the circuit without increasing the leading-order gate cost.

Title: Fast Machine Learning for Quantum Control of Microwave Qudits on Edge Hardware
Authors: Flor Sanders, Gaurav Agarwal, Luca Carloni, Giuseppe Di Guglielmo, Andy C. Y. Li, Gabriel N. Perdue
Abstract: Quantum optimal control is a promising approach to improve the accuracy of quantum gates, but it relies on complex algorithms to determine the best control settings. CPU or GPU-based approaches often have delays that are too long to be applied in practice. It is paramount to have systems with extremely low delays to quickly and with high fidelity adjust quantum hardware settings, where fidelity is defined as overlap with a target quantum state. Here, we utilize machine learning (ML) models to determine control-pulse parameters for preparing Selective Number-dependent Arbitrary Phase (SNAP) gates in microwave cavity qudits, which are multi-level quantum systems that serve as elementary computation units for quantum computing. The methodology involves data generation using classical optimization techniques, ML model development, design space exploration, and quantization for hardware implementation. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, with optimized models achieving low gate trace infidelity near $10^{-3}$ and efficient utilization of programmable logic resources.

Title: Clique detection using symmetry-restricted quantum circuits
Authors: Maximilian Balthasar Mansky, Tobias Rohe, Dmytro Bondarenko, Linus Menzel, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien
Abstract: We show the application of permutation-invariant quantum circuits to the clique problem. The experiment asks to label a clique through identification of the nodes in a larger subgraph. The permutation-invariant quantum circuit outperforms a cyclic-invariant alternative as well as a standard quantum machine learning ansatz. We explain the behavior through the intrinsic symmetry of the problem, in the sense that the problem is symmetric under permutation of both the feature and the label.

Title: Globalized Nonlinear Critical Quantum Metrology by Two-photon Rabi-Stark model
Authors: Zu-Jian Ying
Abstract: Squeezing as a quantum resource for quantum metrology is robust against decoherence and dissipation, while the conventional nonlinear two-photon quantum Rabi model (QRM) provides a squeezing resource immune to the divergence problem of preparation time of probe state (PTPS). However the critical point of the two-photon QRM is locally restricted to one single point, which hinders a wider application. In the present work we propose to combine the Stark coupling with the two-photon QRM to realize a tunable critical point so that the nonlinear critical quantum metrology can be globalized. As demonstrated by the diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) the protocol enables us to acquire a high measurement precision in a wide range of coupling parameter rather than locally at a single critical point. Moreover, We find that the QFI not only manifests criticality but also exhibits universality. As a particular merit of our protocol, a strong squeezing can be globally retained as the leading quantum resource, while at the same time the PTPS remains in a finite order.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Greedy Decoding for Quantum Stabilizer Codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$
Authors: Vahid Nourozi
Abstract: We construct new classical Goppa codes and corresponding quantum stabilizer codes from plane curves defined by separated polynomials. In particular, over $\mathbb{F}_3$ with the Hermitian curve $y^3 + y = x^4$, we obtain a ternary code of length 27, dimension 13, distance 4, which yields a [[27, 13, 4]]$_3$ quantum code. To decode, we introduce an RL-on-Greedy algorithm: first apply a standard greedy syndrome decoder, then use a trained Deep Q-Network to correct any residual syndrome. Simulation under a depolarizing noise model shows that RL-on-Greedy dramatically reduces logical failure compared to greedy alone. Our work thus broadens the class of Goppa- and quantum-stabilizer codes from separated-polynomial curves and delivers a learned decoder with near-optimal performance.

Title: Multipassage Landau-Zener tunneling oscillations in transverse/longitudinal dual dressing of atomic qubits
Authors: Alessandro Fregosi, Carmela Marinelli, Carlo Gabbanini, Valerio Biancalana, Maria Allegrini, Ennio Arimondo, Francesco Petiziol, Sandro Wimberger, Andrea Fioretti, Giuseppe Bevilacqua
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of a non-resonant dressed-atom qubit in an XZ original configuration. It is composed of two electromagnetic fields, one oscillating parallel and the other orthogonal to the quantisation magnetic static field. The experiments are performed in rubidium and caesium atomic magnetometers, confined in a magneto-optical trap and in a vapour cell, respectively. Static fields in the $\mu$T range and kHz oscillating fields with large Rabi frequencies are applied. This dual-dressing configuration is an extension of the Landau-Zener multipassage interferometry in the presence of an additional dressing field controlling the tunneling process by its amplitude and phase. Our measurement of the qubit coherence introduces additional features to the transition probability readout of standard interferometry. The coherence time evolution is characterized by oscillations at several frequencies, each of them produced by a different quantum contribution. Such frequency description introduces a new picture of the qubit multipassage evolution. Because the present low-frequency dressing operation does not fall within the standard Floquet engineering paradigm based on the high-frequency expansion, we develop an ad-hoc dressing perturbation treatment. Numerical simulations support the adiabatic and non-adiabatic qubit evolution.

Title: Interference-enhanced light-matter interaction of an optically levitated dielectric particle
Authors: Seyed K. Alavi, Youssef Ezzo, Ashik Pulikkathara, Sungkun Hong
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interaction is a central subject in quantum science. In this work, we investigate an interference-based approach to amplify the effect of a weak optical field on a nanoscale particle levitated in an optical tweezer. By interfering the weak signal field with the strong trapping field, we achieve a significant enhancement of the optical force caused by the weak field, compared to the force in the absence of interference. This enhanced interaction enables us to detect the weak field through monitoring the motion of the particle, with sensitivity down to 79 pW/Hz. We discuss the potential of this approach for realizing an ultrasensitive, nondestructive light field detector and for exploring optomechanical interactions at the single-photon level.

Title: Flagged Extensions and Numerical Simulations for Quantum Channel Capacity: Bridging Theory and Computation
Authors: Vahid Nourozi
Abstract: I will investigate the capacities of noisy quantum channels through a combined analytical and numerical approach. First, I introduce novel flagged extension techniques that embed a channel into a higher-dimensional space, enabling single-letter upper bounds on quantum and private capacities. My results refine previous bounds and clarify noise thresholds beyond which quantum transmission vanishes. Second, I present a simulation framework that uses coherent information to estimate channel capacities in practice, focusing on two canonical examples: the amplitude damping channel (which we confirm is degradable and thus single-letter) and the depolarizing channel (whose capacity requires multi-letter superadditivity). By parameterizing input qubit states on the Bloch sphere, I numerically pinpoint the maximum coherent information for each channel and validate the flagged extension bounds. Notably, I capture the abrupt transition to zero capacity at high noise and observe superadditivity for moderate noise levels.

Title: Computational Complexity of Non-Hermitian Quantum Systems
Authors: Brian Barch, Daniel Lidar
Abstract: We analyze the computational power of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics, i.e., conditional time evolutions that arise when a quantum system is monitored and one postselects on a particular measurement record. We establish an approximate equivalence between post-selection and arbitrary non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Namely, first we establish hardness in the following sense: Let $U=e^{-iHt}$ be an NH gate on $n$ qubits whose smallest and largest singular values differ by at least $2^{-\text{poly}(n)}$. Together with any universal set of unitary gates, the ability to apply such a gate lets one efficiently emulate postselection. The resulting model decides every language in PostBQP; hence, under standard complexity conjectures, fully scalable NH quantum computers are unlikely to be engineered. Second, we establish upper bounds which show that conversely, any non-Hermitian evolution can be written as a unitary on a system-meter pair followed by postselecting the meter. This ``purification'' is compact -- it introduces only $O(\delta^{2})$ Trotter error per time step $\delta$ -- so any NH model whose purification lies in a strongly simulable unitary family (e.g., Clifford, matchgate, or low-bond-dimension tensor-network circuits) remains efficiently simulable. Thus, non-Hermitian physics neither guarantees a quantum advantage nor precludes efficient classical simulation: its complexity is controlled by the singular-value radius of the evolution operator and by the structure of its unitary purification.

Title: Conjectured Bounds for 2-Local Hamiltonians via Token Graphs
Authors: Anuj Apte, Ojas Parekh, James Sud
Abstract: We explain how the maximum energy of the Quantum MaxCut, XY, and EPR Hamiltonians on a graph $G$ are related to the spectral radii of the token graphs of $G$. From numerical study, we conjecture new bounds for these spectral radii based on properties of $G$. We show how these conjectures tighten the analysis of existing algorithms, implying state-of-the-art approximation ratios for all three Hamiltonians. Our conjectures also provide simple combinatorial bounds on the ground state energy of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, which we prove for bipartite graphs.

Title: A Complexity-Based Approach to Quantum Observable Equilibration
Authors: Marcos G. Alpino, Tiago Debarba, Reinaldo O. Vianna, André T. Cesário
Abstract: We investigate the role of a statistical complexity measure to assign equilibration in isolated quantum systems. While unitary dynamics preserve global purity, expectation values of observables often exhibit equilibration-like behavior, raising the question of whether complexity can track this process. In addition to examining observable equilibration, we extend our analysis to study how the complexity of the quantum states evolves, providing insight into the transition from initial coherence to equilibrium. We define a classical statistical complexity measure based on observable entropy and deviation from equilibrium, which captures the dynamical progression towards equilibration and effectively distinguishes between complex and non-complex trajectories. In particular, our measure is sensitive to non-complex dynamics, such as the quasi-periodic behavior exhibited by low effective dimension initial states, where the systems explore a limited region of the Hilbert space as they oscillate in an informational coherence-preserving manner. These findings are supported by numerical simulations of an Ising-like non-integrable Hamiltonian spin-chain model. Our work provides new insight into the emergence of equilibrium behavior from unitary dynamics and advances complexity as a meaningful tool in the study of the emergence of classicality in microscopic systems.

Title: Permutationally-Invariant N-body gates via Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian
Authors: Plato Deliyannis, Iman Marvian
Abstract: Widely used in atomic and superconducting qubit systems, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian is a simple, yet powerful model for a two-level system interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum.

Title: Memory effects in pulsed optomechanical systems
Authors: Hachisko Tapia-Maureira, Bing He, Massimiliano Di Ventra, Ariel Norambuena
Abstract: Memory, understood as time non-locality, is a fundamental property of any physical system, whether classical or quantum, and has important applications in a wide variety of technologies. In the context of quantum technologies, systems with memory can be used in quantum information, communication, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate that cavity optomechanical systems driven by a pulsed laser can operate as programmable quantum memory elements. By engineering the adiabatic and non-adiabatic pulses, particularly the Gaussian and sinusoidal, we induce and control diverse memory phenomena such as dynamical hysteresis, quantized phononic transitions, and distinct energy-storing responses. Within a mean-field approach, we derive the analytical and numerical criteria under which the photonic and phononic observables manifest the memory effects in strongly driven regimes. The memory effects are quantified through a dimensionless geometric form factor, which provides a versatile metric to characterize the memory efficiency. Our protocol is readily compatible with the current optomechanical platforms, highlighting the new possibilities for advanced memory functionalities in quantum technologies.

Title: Exceeding the Parametric Drive Strength Threshold in Nonlinear Circuits
Authors: Mingkang Xia, Cristóbal Lledó, Matthew Capocci, Jacob Repicky, Benjamin D'Anjou, Ian Mondragon-Shem, Ryan Kaufman, Jens Koch, Alexandre Blais, Michael Hatridge
Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits rely on strong drives to implement fast gates, high-fidelity readout, and state stabilization. However, these drives can induce uncontrolled excitations, so-called "ionization", that compromise the fidelity of these operations. While now well-characterized in the context of qubit readout, it remains unclear how general this limitation is across the more general setting of parametric control. Here, we demonstrate that a nonlinear coupler, exemplified by a transmon, undergoes ionization under strong parametric driving, leading to a breakdown of coherent control and thereby limiting the accessible gate speeds. Through experiments and numerical simulations, we associate this behavior with the emergence of drive-induced chaotic dynamics, which we characterize quantitatively using the instantaneous Floquet spectrum. Our results reveal that the Floquet spectrum provides a unifying framework for understanding strong-drive limitations across a wide range of operations on superconducting quantum circuits. This insight establishes fundamental constraints on parametric control and offers design principles for mitigating drive-induced decoherence in next-generation quantum processors.

Title: Benchmarking gate-based quantum devices via certification of qubit von Neumann measurements
Authors: Paulina Lewandowska, Martin Beseda
Abstract: We present an updated version of PyQBench, an open-source Python library designed for benchmarking gate-based quantum computers, with a focus on certifying qubit von Neumann measurements. This version extends PyQBench's capabilities by incorporating a certification scheme of quantum measurements that evaluates the accuracy on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices, alongside its original functionality of von Neumann measurements' discrimination. PyQBench offers a user-friendly command-line interface and Python library integration, allowing users to implement custom measurement schemes and error models for more advanced benchmarking tasks. The new version is specifically designed to support IBM Q devices through integration with the Qiskit library, enabling seamless benchmarking on real quantum hardware. By providing flexible benchmarking tools, PyQBench addresses the critical need for reliable performance metrics in the NISQ era, contributing to the development of error mitigation techniques and the verification of quantum measurement fidelity. The source code is available on GitHub under an open-source license, encouraging community collaboration and further advancements in quantum hardware benchmarking.

Title: Ultralong Room-Temperature Qubit Lifetimes of Covalent Organic Frameworks
Authors: Zhecheng Sun, Weibin Ni, Denan Li, Xiya Du, Shi Liu, Lei Sun
Abstract: Molecular electron spin qubits offer atomic-level tunability and room-temperature quantum coherence. Their integration into engineered solid-state matrices can enhance performance towards ambient quantum information technologies. Herein, we demonstrate covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as programmable matrices of stable organic radical qubits allowing strategic optimization of spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions. Using two classic boronate-ester frameworks, COF-5 and COF-108, to host semiquinone-like radical qubits, we achieve ultralong spin relaxation time (T1 > 300 {\mu}s) at 298 K, which outperforms most molecular qubits and rivals inorganic spin defects. The suppression of spin relaxation is attributed to rigid and neutral structures as well as carbon-centered spin distributions that effectively weaken spin-phonon coupling. Employing dynamical decoupling methods to both COFs improves their quantum coherence and enables room-temperature detection of nuclear spins including 1H, 11B, and 13C. Our work establishes COFs as designer quantum materials, opening new avenues for quantum sensing of nuclear spins at room temperature.

Title: Quantum Secure Key Exchange with Position-based Credentials
Authors: Wen Yu Kon, Ignatius William Primaatmaja, Kaushik Chakraborty, Charles Lim
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides an information-theoretic way of securely exchanging secret keys, and typically relies on pre-shared keys or public keys for message authentication. To lift the requirement of pre-shared or public keys, Buhrman et. al. [SIAM J. Comput. 43, 150 (2014)] proposed utilizing the location of a party as a credential. Here, we extend upon the proposal, develop a QKD protocol with location credentials using quantum position verification (QPV) based message and identity authentication. By using QKD with delayed authentication as a base, and later simplifying QPV-based message authentication, we significantly reduce the number of QPV runs, which currently acts as a bottleneck. Besides demonstrating security for the proposed protocol, we also provide improvements to QPV security analysis, including generalization of the QPV adversary model, tightening a trace distance bound using semidefinite programming, and propose a multi-basis QPV requiring only BB84 state preparation but with multiple measurement basis.

Title: An 11-qubit atom processor in silicon

Abstract: Phosphorus atoms in silicon are an outstanding platform for quantum computing as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence time over seconds. By placing multiple phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometers, they couple via the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables multi-qubit control above the fault-tolerant threshold and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms. To achieve quantum error correction, fast and efficient interconnects have to be implemented between spin registers while maintaining high fidelity across all qubit metrics. Here, we demonstrate such integration with a fully controlled 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers which are linked via electron exchange interaction. Through the development of scalable calibration and control protocols, we achieve coherent coupling between nuclear spins using a combination of single- and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.5% to 99.99%. We verify the efficient all-to-all connectivity by preparing both local and non-local Bell states with a record state fidelity beyond 99% and extend entanglement through the generation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states over all data qubits. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear-spin registers, we realise a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.

Title: Giant Atom with Disorders
Authors: Muming Han, Lingzhen Guo
Abstract: The study of giant atoms goes beyond the local interaction paradigm in the conventional quantum optics, and predicts novel phenomena, such as oscillating bound states in the continuum (BICs) and decoherence-free interaction (DFI) that do not exist in small atoms, for some particular parameter settings of coupling positions and strengths. However, in the realistic experiments to implement giant-atom systems, there is always some level of disorder both in coupling positions and strengths. In this work, we investigate the effects of disorder on the phenomena related to giant atoms. We find that the giant-atom related phenomena are robust to both disorders of coupling positions and strengths in the Markovian regime, but more sensitive to the disorder of coupling positions in the non-Markovian regime. Our work shows that, to observe the non-Markovian phenomenon such as (oscillating) BICs in giant-atom systems, more precision is needed to control the disorder of coupling positions than that of the coupling strengths in the experiments.

Title: Make Some Noise! Measuring Noise Model Quality in Real-World Quantum Software
Authors: Stefan Raimund Maschek, Jürgen Schwitalla, Maja Franz, Wolfgang Mauerer
Abstract: Noise and imperfections are among the prevalent challenges in quantum software engineering for current NISQ systems. They will remain important in the post-NISQ area, as logical, error-corrected qubits will be based on software mechanisms. As real quantum hardware is still limited in size and accessibility, noise models for classical simulation--that in some cases can exceed dimensions of actual systems--play a critical role in obtaining insights into quantum algorithm performance, and the properties of mechanisms for error correction and mitigation. We present, implement and validate a tunable noise model building on the Kraus channel formalism on a large scale quantum simulator system (Qaptiva). We use empirical noise measurements from IBM quantum (IBMQ) systems to calibrate the model and create a realistic simulation environment. Experimental evaluation of our approach with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state preparation and QAOA applied to an industrial use-case validate our approach, and demonstrate accurate simulation of hardware behaviour at reasonable computational cost. We devise and utilise a method that allows for determining the quality of noise models for larger problem instances than is possible with existing metrics in the literature. To identify potentials of future quantum software and algorithms, we extrapolate the noise model to future partially fault-tolerant systems, and give insights into the interplay between hardware-specific noise modelling and hardware-aware algorithm development.

Authors: Aviad Katiyi (1), Alina Karabchevsky (1 and 2) ((1) School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, (2) Department of Physics, Lancaster University, United Kingdom)
Abstract: Optical chips for quantum photonics are cutting-edge technology, merging photonics and quantum mechanics to manipulate light at the quantum level. These chips are crucial for advancing quantum computing, secure communication, and precision sensing by integrating photonic components like waveguides, beam splitters, and detectors to manipulate single photons, the fundamental carriers of quantum information. Key advancements in optical chips include low-loss waveguides, efficient single-photon sources, and high-fidelity quantum gates, all essential for scalable quantum circuits. Integrating these circuits on a chip offers significant advantages in miniaturization, stability, and reproducibility over traditional bulk optics setups. Recent breakthroughs in materials science and nanofabrication have propelled the field forward, enabling the production of chips with higher precision and lower defect rates. Silicon photonics, in particular, has become a prominent platform due to its compatibility with existing semiconductor manufacturing processes, facilitating the integration of quantum photonic circuits with classical electronic systems. Here, we share our vision of the future of optical chips for quantum photonics, which hold promise for various applications. In quantum computing, they enable the development of compact and scalable quantum processors. In communication, they provide the foundation for ultra-secure quantum networks through quantum key distribution. In sensing, they allow for high-precision measurements that surpass classical limits. As research progresses, optical chips are expected to play a critical role in realizing the full potential of quantum technologies.

Title: RhoDARTS: Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search with Density Matrix Simulations
Authors: Swagat Kumar, Jan-Nico Zaech, Colin Michael Wilmott, Luc Van Gool
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach for leveraging powerful Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. When applied to machine learning tasks, VQAs give rise to NISQ-compatible Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), which have been shown to outperform classical neural networks with a similar number of trainable parameters. While the quantum circuit structures of VQAs for physics simulations are determined by the physical properties of the systems, identifying effective QNN architectures for general machine learning tasks is a difficult challenge due to the lack of domain-specific priors. Indeed, existing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms, adaptations of classical neural architecture search techniques, often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By approaching QAS from the ground-up and from a quantum perspective, we resolve this limitation by proposing $\rho$DARTS, a differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, emerging from the search space of quantum architectures. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization, Hamiltonian optimization, and image classification. Further, we demonstrate better convergence against existing QAS techniques and show improved robustness levels to noise.

Title: Muted attack on a high-speed quantum key distribution system
Authors: Jialei Su, Jialin Chen, Fengyu Lu, Zihao Chen, Junxuan Liu, Deyong He, Shuang Wang, Anqi Huang
Abstract: High-speed quantum key distribution (QKD) systems have achieved repetition frequencies above gigahertz through advanced technologies and devices, laying an important foundation for the deployment of high-key-rate QKD system. However, these advancements may introduce unknown security loopholes into the QKD system. Unfortunately, an eavesdropper Eve is challenging to exploit these security loopholes performing the intercept-and-resend attacks due to the limited time window under the high repetition frequency. Here, we disclose a security loophole in the 1-GHz single-photon avalanche detector (SPAD) and propose a muted attack on a high-speed QKD system that does not require intercept-and-resend operation. By sending hundreds of photons each time, Eve can mute Bob's SPADs to control the overall detection response of the QKD receiver, allowing her to learn nearly all the keys. This study reveals the security loopholes introduced by the state-of-the-art SPAD, being exploited to conduct the tailored attack on the high-speed QKD system.

Title: Supporting hyperplanes for Schmidt numbers and Schmidt number witnesses
Authors: Kyung Hoon Han, Seung-Hyeok Kye
Abstract: We consider the compact convex set of all bi-partite states of Schmidt number less than or equal to $k$, together with that of $k$-blockpositive matrices of trace one, which play the roles of Schmidt number witnesses. In this note, we look for hyperplanes which support those convex sets and are perpendicular to a one parameter family through the maximally mixed state. We show that this is equivalent to determining the intervals for the dual objects on the one parameter family. We illustrate our results for the one parameter families including Werner states and isotropic states. Through the discussion, we give a simple decomposition of the separable Werner state into the sum of product states.

Title: Toward Entailment Checking: Explore Eigenmarking Search
Authors: Tatpong Katanyukul
Abstract: Logic entailment is essential to reasoning, but entailment checking has the worst-case complexity of an exponential of the variable size. With recent development, quantum computing when mature may allow an effective approach for various combinatorial problems, including entailment checking. Grover algorithm uses Grover operations, selective phase inversion and amplitude amplification to address a search over unstructured data with quadratic improvement from a classical method. Its original form is intended to a single-winner scenario: exactly one match is promised. Its extension to multiple-winner cases employs probabilistic control over a number of applications of Grover operations, while a no-winner case is handled by time-out. Our study explores various schemes of ``eigenmarking'' approach. Still relying on Grover operations, but the approach introduces additional qubits to tag the eigenstates. The tagged eigenstates are to facilitate an interpretation of the measured results and enhance identification of a no-winner case (related to no logic violation in entailment context). Our investigation experiments three variations of eigenmarking on a two-qubit system using an IBM Aer simulator. The results show strong distinguishability in all schemes with the best relative distinguishabilities of 19 and 53 in worst case and in average case, respectively. Our findings reveal a viable quantum mechanism to differentiate a no-winner case from other scenarios, which could play a pivot role in entailment checking and logic reasoning in general.

Title: Deviation from Complete Positivity: Structural Insights and Quantum Information Applications
Authors: Mohsen Kian
Abstract: We introduce the CP-distance as a measure of how far a Hermitian map is from being completely positive, deriving key properties and bounds. We investigate the role of CP-distance in the structural analysis of positive Hermitian linear maps between matrix algebras, focusing on its implications for quantum information theory. In particular, we derive bounds on the detection strength of entanglement witnesses. We elucidate the interplay between CP-distance and the structural properties of positive maps, offering insights into their decompositions. We also analyze how the CP-distance influences the decompositions of positive Hermitian maps, revealing its impact on the balance between completely positive components.

Title: Towards Quantum Operator-Valued Kernels
Authors: Hachem Kadri, Joachim Tomasi, Yuka Hashimoto, Sandrine Anthoine
Abstract: Quantum kernels are reproducing kernel functions built using quantum-mechanical principles and are studied with the aim of outperforming their classical counterparts. The enthusiasm for quantum kernel machines has been tempered by recent studies that have suggested that quantum kernels could not offer speed-ups when learning on classical data. However, most of the research in this area has been devoted to scalar-valued kernels in standard classification or regression settings for which classical kernel methods are efficient and effective, leaving very little room for improvement with quantum kernels. This position paper argues that quantum kernel research should focus on more expressive kernel classes. We build upon recent advances in operator-valued kernels, and propose guidelines for investigating quantum kernels. This should help to design a new generation of quantum kernel machines and fully explore their potentials.

Title: Exploring entanglement, Wigner negativity and Bell nonlocality for anisotropic two-qutrit states
Authors: Huan Liu, Zu-wu Chen, Xue-feng Zhan, Hong-chun Yuan, Xue-xiang Xu
Abstract: We introduce a family of anisotropic two-qutrit states (AITTSs). These AITTSs are expressed as $\rho _{aiso}=p\left\vert \psi _{\left( \theta,\phi \right) }\right\rangle \left\langle \psi _{\left( \theta ,\phi \right)}\right\vert +(1-p)\frac{1_{9}}{9}$ with $\left\vert \psi _{\left( \theta,\phi \right) }\right\rangle =\sin \theta \cos \phi \left\vert00\right\rangle +\sin \theta \sin \phi \left\vert 11\right\rangle +\cos\theta \left\vert 22\right\rangle $ and $1_{9}=\sum_{j,k=0}^{2}\left\vert jk\right\rangle \left\langle jk\right\vert $. For a given $p\in \lbrack 0,1]$, these states are adjustable in different ($\theta ,\phi $) directions. In the case of ($\theta ,\phi $) = ($\arccos (1/\sqrt{3}),\pi /4$), the AITTS will reduce to the isotropic two-qutrit state $\rho _{iso}$. In addition, the AITTSs are severely affected by the white noise ($\rho _{noise}=1_{9}/9$). Three properties of the AITTSs, including entanglement, Wigner negativity and Bell nonlocality, are explored detailedly in the analytical and numerical ways. Each property is witnessed by an appropriate existing criterion. Some of our results are summarized as follows: (i) Large entanglement does not necessarily mean high Wigner negativity and strong Bell nonlocality. (ii) A pure state with a large Schmidt number does not necessarily have a greater Wigner negativity. (iii) Only when $\left\vert\psi _{\left( \theta ,\phi \right) }\right\rangle $ has the Schmidt number 3, the AITTS has the possibility of exhibiting Bell nonlocality in proper parameter range.

Title: Personalized Improvement of Standard Readout Error Mitigation using Low-Depth Circuits and Machine Learning
Authors: Melody Lee
Abstract: Quantum computers have shown promise in improving algorithms in a variety of fields. The realization of these advancements is limited by the presence of noise and high error rates, which become prominent especially with increasing system size. Mitigation techniques using matrix inversions, unfolding, and deep learning, among others, have been leveraged to reduce this error. However, these methods are not reflective of the entire gate set of the quantum device and may need further tuning depending on the distance from the most recent calibration time. This paper proposes a method of improvement to numerical readout error techniques, where the readout error model is further refined using measured probability distributions from a collection of low-depth circuits. We use machine learning to improve the readout error model for the quantum system, testing the circuits on the simulated IBM Perth backend using Qiskit. We demonstrate a median 6.6% improvement in fidelity, 29.9% improvement for mean-squared error, and 10.3% improvement in Hellinger distance over the standard error mitigation approach for a seven-qubit system with a circuit depth of four. With further focus directed towards such improvement of these error mitigation techniques, we are one step closer to the fault-tolerant quantum computing era.

Title: High-efficiency telecom frequency conversion via a diamond-type atomic ensemble
Authors: Ling-Chun Chen, Meng-Yi Lin, Jiun-Shiuan Shiu, Xuan-Qing Zhong, Po-Han Tseng, Yong-Fan Chen
Abstract: Efficient telecom frequency conversion (TFC) in atomic systems is crucial for integrating atom-based quantum nodes into low-loss fiber-optic quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate high-efficiency TFC from 795 nm to 1367 nm in a cold 87Rb ensemble via diamond-type four-wave mixing (FWM), achieving conversion efficiencies of 66% and 80% at optical depths of 75 and 110, respectively, using a weak coherent probe field. These results surpass all previously reported values in atomic systems, enabled by a systematic investigation of the built-in V-type and cascade-type electromagnetically induced transparency spectra that guided the optimization of FWM conditions. Although this work employs coherent fields, our previous theoretical study has shown that quantum states can be preserved with high fidelity during the conversion process, highlighting the promise of diamond-type atomic FWM as a robust interface for long-distance quantum communication.

Title: Limitations of Quantum Hardware for Molecular Energy Estimation Using VQE
Authors: Abel Carreras, David Casanova, Román Orús
Abstract: Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are among the most promising quantum algorithms for solving electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry, particularly during the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this study, we investigate the capabilities and limitations of VQE algorithms implemented on current quantum hardware for determining molecular ground-state energies, focusing on the adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter ansatz VQE (ADAPT-VQE). To address the significant computational challenges posed by molecular Hamiltonians, we explore various strategies to simplify the Hamiltonian, optimize the ansatz, and improve classical parameter optimization through modifications of the COBYLA optimizer. These enhancements are integrated into a tailored quantum computing implementation designed to minimize the circuit depth and computational cost. Using benzene as a benchmark system, we demonstrate the application of these optimizations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite these improvements, our results highlight the limitations imposed by current quantum hardware, particularly the impact of quantum noise on state preparation and energy measurement. The noise levels in today's devices prevent meaningful evaluations of molecular Hamiltonians with sufficient accuracy to produce reliable quantum chemical insights. Finally, we extrapolate the requirements for future quantum hardware to enable practical and scalable quantum chemistry calculations using VQE algorithms. This work provides a roadmap for advancing quantum algorithms and hardware toward achieving quantum advantage in molecular modeling.

Title: Simulating fluid vortex interactions on a superconducting quantum processor
Authors: Ziteng Wang, Jiarun Zhong, Ke Wang, Zitian Zhu, Zehang Bao, Chenjia Zhu, Wenwen Zhao, Yaomin Zhao, Yue Yang, Chao Song, Shiying Xiong
Abstract: Vortex interactions are commonly observed in atmospheric turbulence, plasma dynamics, and collective behaviors in biological systems. However, accurately simulating these complex interactions is highly challenging due to the need to capture fine-scale details over extended timescales, which places computational burdens on traditional methods. In this study, we introduce a quantum vortex method, reformulating the Navier--Stokes (NS) equations within a quantum mechanical framework to enable the simulation of multi-vortex interactions on a quantum computer. We construct the effective Hamiltonian for the vortex system and implement a spatiotemporal evolution circuit to simulate its dynamics over prolonged periods. By leveraging eight qubits on a superconducting quantum processor with gate fidelities of 99.97\% for single-qubit gates and 99.76\% for two-qubit gates, we successfully reproduce natural vortex interactions. This method bridges classical fluid dynamics and quantum computing, offering a novel computational platform for studying vortex dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum computing to tackle longstanding challenges in fluid dynamics and broaden applications across both natural and engineering systems.

This method enables the efficient classical simulation of a broader class of quantum circuits beyond the stabilizer formalism. We implement the simulator and benchmark its performance on basic quantum algorithms, including the hidden shift and Deutsch--Jozsa algorithms.

Title: A Unitary Encoder for Surface Codes
Authors: Pei-Kai Tsai, Shruti Puri
Abstract: The surface code is a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation and has been implemented in many quantum hardware platforms. In this work, we propose a new non-local unitary circuit to encode a surface code state based on a code conversion between rotated and regular surface codes, which halves the gate count of the fastest encoder known previously. While the unitary encoders can be used to increase the code distance, the fault-distance remains fixed. Nonetheless, they can be used for space-time efficient realization of eigenstates of the surface code operators that can't be easily accessed transversally such as the Pauli Y-eignestate and Clifford eigenstates. It may be expected that error propagation in the non-local circuit will make decoding more challenging compared to local unitary encoding circuits. However, we find this not to be the case and that conventional matching decoders can be effectively used. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to benchmark the performance of our encoder against a previous local unitary encoder and the conventional stabilizer-measurement based encoder for preparing the Pauli Y-eigenstate and find that our encoder can outperform these in experimentally relevant noise regimes. Therefore, our encoder provides practical advantage in platforms where non-local interactions are available such as neutral atoms and trapped ions.

Title: Recursive perturbation approach to time-convolutionless master equations: Explicit construction of generalized Lindblad generators for arbitrary open systems
Authors: Alessandra Colla, Heinz-Peter Breuer, Giulio Gasbarri
Abstract: We develop a recursive perturbative expansion for the time-convolutionless (TCL) generator of an open quantum system in a generalized Lindblad form. This formulation provides a systematic approach to derive the generator at arbitrary order while preserving a Lindblad-like structure, without imposing assumptions on the system or environment beyond an initially uncorrelated state. The generator is written, at all orders, in a canonical form, which also corresponds to the minimal dissipation condition, which uniquely specifies the decomposition of the generator into Hamiltonian and dissipative contributions. To validate the method and show its effectiveness in addressing non-Markovian dynamics and strong-coupling effects, we compute the generator explicitly up to fourth order.

Title: Unveiling coherent dynamics in non-Markovian open quantum systems: exact expression and recursive perturbation expansion
Authors: Alessandra Colla, Heinz-Peter Breuer, Giulio Gasbarri
Abstract: We introduce a systematic framework to derive the effective Hamiltonian governing the coherent dynamics of non-Markovian open quantum systems. By applying the minimal dissipation principle, we uniquely isolate the coherent contribution to the time-local generator of the reduced dynamics. We derive a general expression for the effective Hamiltonian and develop a recursive perturbative expansion that expresses it in terms of system-bath interaction terms and bath correlation functions. This expansion provides a systematic tool for analyzing energy renormalization effects across different coupling regimes. Applying our framework to paradigmatic spin systems, we reveal how environmental correlations influence energy shifts and eigenbasis rotations, offering new insights into strong-coupling effects and non-Markovian quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Spanning-tree-packing protocol for conference key propagation in quantum networks
Authors: Anton Trushechkin, Hermann Kampermann, Dagmar Bruß
Abstract: We consider a network of users connected by pairwise quantum key distribution (QKD) links. Using these pairwise secret keys and public classical communication, the users want to generate a common (conference) secret key at the maximal rate. We propose an algorithm based on spanning tree packing (a known problem in graph theory) and prove its optimality. This algorithm enables optimal conference key generation in modern quantum networks of arbitrary topology. Additionally, we discuss how it can guide the optimal placement of new bipartite links in the network design.

Title: The role of fluctuations in deexcitations and excitations
Authors: Weitao Liu
Abstract: In this work, I analyze the quantum fluctuations and the thermal fluctuations in the frameworkof quantum mechanics. Being recognized as incoherent perturbations with different features, fluctuations of these two types are expressed in the dissipative terms in the Bloch equation. This methodprovides a unified description of the deexcitation and the equilibration such that it is capable to deal with the processes where the impact of the fluctuations are not negligible. The numerical results show that In the zero temperature limit, the method recovers the deexcitation rate estimated by the Weisskopf-Wigner theory. At finite temperature, the method predicts the equilibration toward the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The impact of the fluctuations on the excitations by coherent perturbations are also discussed.

Title: Deep-learned error mitigation via partially knitted circuits for the variational quantum eigensolver
Authors: Simone Cantori, Andrea Mari, David Vitali, Sebastiano Pilati
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is generally regarded as a promising quantum algorithm for near-term noisy quantum computers. However, when implemented with the deep circuits that are in principle required for achieving a satisfactory accuracy, the algorithm is strongly limited by noise. Here, we show how to make VQE functional via a tailored error mitigation technique based on deep learning. Our method employs multilayer perceptrons trained on the fly to predict ideal expectation values from noisy outputs combined with circuit descriptors. Importantly, a circuit knitting technique with partial knitting is adopted to substantially reduce the classical computational cost of creating the training data. We also show that other popular general-purpose quantum error mitigation techniques do not reach comparable accuracies. Our findings highlight the power of deep-learned quantum error mitigation methods tailored to specific circuit families, and of the combined use of variational quantum algorithms and classical deep learning.

Title: Estimation of the reduced density matrix and entanglement entropies using autoregressive networks
Authors: Piotr Białas, Piotr Korcyl, Tomasz Stebel, Dawid Zapolski
Abstract: We present an application of autoregressive neural networks to Monte Carlo simulations of quantum spin chains using the correspondence with classical two-dimensional spin systems. We use a hierarchy of neural networks capable of estimating conditional probabilities of consecutive spins to evaluate elements of reduced density matrices directly. Using the Ising chain as an example, we calculate the continuum limit of the ground state's von Neumann and Rényi bipartite entanglement entropies of an interval built of up to 5 spins. We demonstrate that our architecture is able to estimate all the needed matrix elements with just a single training for a fixed time discretization and lattice volume. Our method can be applied to other types of spin chains, possibly with defects, as well as to estimating entanglement entropies of thermal states at non-zero temperature.

Title: Entanglement renormalization circuits for $2d$ Gaussian Fermion States
Authors: Sing Lam Wong, Andrew C. Potter
Abstract: The simulation of entangled ground-states of quantum materials remains challenging for classical computational methods in more than one spatial dimension, and is a prime target for quantum computational advantage. To this end, an important goal is to identify efficient quantum state preparation protocols that minimize the physical qubit number and circuit depth resources required to capture higher-dimensional quantum correlations. This work introduces a quantum circuit compression algorithm for Gaussian fermion states based on the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), which provides an exponential reduction in the circuit depth required to approximate highly-entangled ground-states relevant for quantum materials simulations. The algorithm, termed two-dimensional Gaussian MERA ($2d$ GMERA), extends MERA techniques to compress higher-dimensional Gaussian states. Through numerical simulations of the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice, the method is shown to accurately capture area-law entangled states including topologically trivial insulators, Chern insulators, and critical Dirac semimetals. While Gaussian states alone are classically simulable, this approach establishes empirical upper bounds on quantum resources needed to prepare free fermion states that are adiabatically connected to correlated ground states, providing guidance for implementing these protocols on near-term quantum devices and offering a foundation for simulating more complex quantum materials. Finally, we develop a novel fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme, based on an expanding $2d$ topological order, that enables implementing fermionic rotations via qubit Pauli rotations with constant Pauli weight independent of system size.

Title: Bridging Quantum Chemistry and MaxCut: Classical Performance Guarantees and Quantum Algorithms for the Hartree-Fock Method
Authors: Alexis Ralli, Tim Weaving, Peter V. Coveney, Peter J. Love
Abstract: In quantum chemistry, self-consistent field (SCF) algorithms define a nonlinear optimization problem, with both continuous and discrete components. In this work, we derive Hartree-Fock-inspired SCF algorithms that can be exactly written as a sequence of Quadratic Unconstrained Spin/Binary Optimization problems (QUSO/QUBO). We reformulate the optimization problem as a series of MaxCut graph problems, which can be efficiently solved using semi-definite programming techniques. This procedure provides performance guarantees at each SCF step, irrespective of the complexity of the optimization landscape. We numerically demonstrate the QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF methods by studying the hydroxide anion OH- and molecular Nitrogen N2. The largest problem addressed in this study involves a system comprised of 220 qubits (equivalently, spin-orbitals). Our results show that QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF suffer much less from internal instabilities compared with conventional SCF calculations. Additionally, we show that the new SCF algorithms can enhance single-reference methods, such as configuration interaction. Finally, we explore how quantum algorithms for optimization can be applied to the QUSO problems arising from the Hartree-Fock method. Four distinct hybrid-quantum classical approaches are introduced: GAS-SCF, QAOA-SCF, QA-SCF and DQI-SCF.

Title: Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator
Authors: S. Mahesh Chandran, Uwe R. Fischer
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.

Authors: Giuseppe Di Caro, Vahagn Kirakosyan, Alexander G. Abanov, Luca Candelori, Nadine Hartmann, Ernest T. Lam, Kharen Musaelian, Ryan Samson, Dario Villani, Martin T. Wells, Richard J. Wenstrup, Mengjia Xu
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chromosomal instability from the morphology of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enables real-time detection of CTCs with high metastatic potential in the context of liquid biopsy diagnostics. However, it presents a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of single-cell digital pathology data. Here, we introduce the application of Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size biomedical contexts. QCML enables the simulation of cognition-like learning for the identification of biologically meaningful prediction of chromosomal instability from CTC morphology, offering a novel tool for CTC classification in liquid biopsy.

Title: Theory of Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy of Altermagnetic Mott Insulators
Authors: Lorenzo Lanzini, Purnendu Das, Michael Knap
Abstract: Altermagnetism has emerged as an unconventional form of collinear magnetism with spatial rotational symmetries, that give rise to strongly spin-split bands despite of an underlying fully-compensated antiferromagnetic order. Here, we develop a theory for the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) response of altermagnetic Mott insulators. Crucially, the spectrum does not simply reflect the non-interacting band structure, but instead a magnetic polaron is formed at low energies, that can be interpreted as a spinon-holon bound state. We develop a spinon-holon parton theory and predict a renormalized bandwidth that we confirm by tensor network simulations. We analyze the characteristic spin-split spectrum and identify a spin-dependent spectral weight of the magnetic polaron, resulting from the altermagnetic symmetry. Our work paves the way for a systematic study of doping effects and correlation phenomena in altermagnetic Mott insulators.

Title: MC-PDFT Nuclear Gradients and L-PDFT Energies with Meta and Hybrid Meta On-Top Functionals for Ground- and Excited-State Geometry Optimization and Vertical Excitation Energies
Authors: Matthew R. Hennefarth, Younghwan Kim, Bhavnesh Jangid, Jacob Wardzala, Matthew R. Hermes, Donald G. Truhlar, Laura Gagliardi
Abstract: Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) is a post-MCSCF multireference electronic-structure method that explicitly models strong electron correlation, and linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed multi-state extension that can accurately model conical intersections and locally-avoided crossings. Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on an on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the on-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated meta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the MC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional specifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and implementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using meta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables analytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top functional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the derivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of meta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use the new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state geometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and benzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other meta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies. We find MC23 performs the best of all nine meta and hybrid meta functionals for vertical excitation energies and is comparable in accuracy to tPBE0 and to the NEVPT2 multireference wave function method. Additionally, we directly compare our MC-PDFT vertical excitation results to previously computed TD-DFT values and find that MC-PDFT outperforms even the best performing Kohn-Sham density functional.

Title: Stable supersolids and boselets in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with three-body interactions
Authors: Rajamanickam Ravisankar, Sanu Kumar Gangwar, Henrique Fabrelli, Yongping Zhang, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Pankaj Kumar Mishra, Emmanuel Kengne, Gao Xianlong, Boris A. Malomed
Abstract: We explore the stability of supersolid striped waves, plane-wave boselets, and other extended states in one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive three-body interactions (R3BIs), modeled by quintic terms in the framework of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equations. In the absence of R3BIs, the extended states are susceptible to the modulational instability (MI) induced by the cubic attractive nonlinearity. Using the linearized Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations, we identify multiple new types of MI, including baseband, passband, mixedband, and zero-wavenumber-gain ones, which give rise to deterministic rogue waves and complex nonlinear wave patterns. Our analysis reveals that R3BIs eliminate baseband and zero-wavenumber-gain MIs, forming, instead, phonon modes that enable stable boselets. Additionally, mixedband and passband MIs are suppressed, which results in a lattice-like phonon-roton mode that supports a stable supersolid phase. These stable supersolids can be realized using currently available ultracold experimental setup.

Title: Enhanced and modulable induced superconducting gap and effective Landé g-factor in Pb-InSb hybrid devices

A. M. Bakkers, Michał P. Nowak, Paweł Wójcik, Li Lu, Jie Shen
Abstract: The hybrid system of a conventional superconductor (SC) on a semiconductor (SM) nanowire with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) represents a promising platform for achieving topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) towards topological quantum computation. While aluminum (Al)-based hybrid nanowire devices have been widely utilized, their limited superconducting gap and intrinsic weak SOC as well as small Landé g-factor may hinder future experimental advancements. In contrast, we demonstrate that lead (Pb)-based hybrid quantum devices exhibit a remarkably large and hard proximity-induced superconducting gap, exceeding that of Al by an order of magnitude. By exploiting electrostatic gating to modulate wavefunction distribution and SC-SM interfacial coupling, this gap can be continuously tuned from its maximum value (~1.4 meV, matching the bulk Pb gap) down to nearly zero while maintaining the hardness. Furthermore, magnetic-field-dependent measurements reveal a radial evolution of the gap structure with anti-crossing feature, indicative of strong SOC and huge effective g-factors up to 76. These findings underscore the superior functionality of Pb-based hybrid systems, significantly advancing their potential for realizing and stabilizing MZMs and the further scalable topological quantum architectures.

Title: The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain
Authors: Akash Sinha, Tinu Justin, Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.

We propose a tensor network based solver that scales polylogarithmically with the mesh size, in both runtime and memory. This provides a promising avenue for tackling the curse of dimensionality that plagues the direct numerical simulations in the field of computational fluid dynamics.

Title: Quantum entanglement in cosmology
Authors: Alessio Belfiglio, Orlando Luongo, Stefano Mancini
Abstract: We discuss recent progress in the study of entanglement within cosmological frameworks, focusing on both momentum and position-space approaches and also reviewing the possibility to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields. Entanglement generation in expanding spacetimes can be traced back to the phenomenon of gravitational particle production, according to which the background gravitational field may transfer energy and momentum to quantum fields. The corresponding entanglement amount and its mode dependence are both sensitive to the field statistics and to the details of spacetime expansion, thus encoding information about the background. Gravitational production processes also play a key role in addressing the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations. In order to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields, local interactions with additional quantum systems, working as detectors, have been suggested, leading to the formulation of the entanglement harvesting protocol. Despite harvesting procedures are currently unfeasible from an experimental point of view, various proposals for implementation exist and a proper modeling of detectors and local interactions is crucial to address entanglement extraction via realistic setups. In the final part of the work, we address entanglement characterization in position space, primarily focusing on black hole spacetimes. We first investigate a possible interpretation of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in terms of the entanglement entropy arising in discrete quantum field theories, on account of the area law. Then, we discuss the resolution of the black hole information paradox via the gravitational fine-grained entropy formula, which provides a new way to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and allows to preserve unitarity in black hole evaporation processes.

Title: The QTF-Backbone: Proposal for a Nationwide Optical Fibre Backbone in Germany for Quantum Technology and Time and Frequency Metrology

Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in the distribution of quantum information and high-precision time and frequency (T&F) signals over long-haul optical fibre networks have transformative potential for physically secure communications, resilience of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and fundamental physics. However, so far these capabilities remain confined to isolated testbeds, with quantum and T&F signals accessible, for example in Germany, to only a few institutions. We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment. As a national and European hub, it will position Germany and Europe at the forefront of quantum networking, as well as time and frequency transfer.

Title: Precision measurement of Cs($nF_J$) quantum defects and calculations of scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_J$ ,$nD_J$ , and $nF_J$ series
Authors: Pinrui Shen, Mariusz Pawlak, Donald Booth, Kent Nickerson, Haddad Miladi, H. R. Sadeghpour, James P. Shaffer
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our recent work on cesium S and D states [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 233005 (2024)] to the F states. We present absolute frequency measurements of the $|6S_{1/2}, F = 3\rangle \rightarrow nF_{5/2,7/2}(n = 28-68)$ Rydberg series to measure the spectrum of $^{133}$Cs. Atomic spectra are obtained using a three-photon excitation scheme referenced to an optical frequency comb in a sample of ultracold $^{133}$Cs. By globally fitting the absolute-frequency measurements to the modified Ritz formula, we determine the quantum defects of the $nF_{5/2}$ and $nF_{7/2}$ series. The ionization potential extracted for both series from the modified Ritz formula agrees with our measurements based on the S and D series. Fine-structure intervals are calculated and parameterized. The wave functions computed for the energies from the quantum defects are used to calculate transition dipole moments. We compare the reduced electric-dipole matrix elements with available benchmarks and find agreement within the precision of those works. The scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_J$ , $nD_J$ and $nF_J$ series are calculated based on the now more accurate set of wave functions. Moreover, we report the polarizability as a series in powers of the effective principal quantum number and find the main coefficients of the expansion. The results will be useful for calculating properties of $^{133}$Cs such as collision and decay rates, polarizabilities, and magic wavelengths.

Title: Transportation cost and contraction coefficient for channels on von Neumann algebras
Authors: Roy Araiza, Marius Junge, Peixue Wu
Abstract: We present a noncommutative optimal transport framework for quantum channels acting on von Neumann algebras. Our central object is the Lipschitz cost measure, a transportation-inspired quantity that evaluates the minimal cost required to move between quantum states via a given channel. Accompanying this is the Lipschitz contraction coefficient, which captures how much the channel contracts the Wasserstein-type distance between states. We establish foundational properties of these quantities, including continuity, dual formulations, and behavior under composition and tensorization. Applications include recovery of several mathematical quantities including expected group word length and Carnot-Carathéodory distance, via transportation cost. Moreover, we show that if the Lipschitz contraction coefficient is strictly less than one, one can get entropy contraction and mixing time estimates for certain classes of non-symmetric channels.

Title: Topological Mixed States: Axiomatic Approaches and Phases of Matter
Authors: Tai-Hsuan Yang, Bowen Shi, Jong Yeon Lee
Abstract: For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e. a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: \emph{mixed-state bootstrap program}. From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical -- demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability-weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.

Title: Realism and causality imply information erasure by measurements
Authors: Alberto Montina, Stefan Wolf
Abstract: A projective measurement cannot decrease the von Neumann entropy if the outcome is ignored. However, under certain sound assumptions and using the quantum violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities, we have previously demonstrated that this property is not inherited by a classical simulation of such a measurement process. In the simulation, a measurement erases prior information by partially resetting the system, suggesting that the quantum-state update following a measurement cannot be entirely epistemic. The erasure of information has been proved by assuming that the maximally mixed quantum state corresponds to maximal ignorance of the classical state. A more intricate proof employed the weaker hypothesis that the entropy is finite at some stage of the simulation. In this paper, we focus on the quantum-foundational implications of this theorem. We first provide a simple proof by directly using the second hypothesis. Second, we identify information erasure as the mechanism breaking the time symmetry in ontological theories. This symmetry break has been previously proved by Pusey and Leifer. Third, we show that information erasure and, thus, symmetry break can be avoided by employing a branching "a la" many-worlds theory. The information flow and the time asymmetry are transferred to the measurement devices and the subsequent comparison of results, which inherently involve time-asymmetric processes. Thus, causality and the absence of information erasure suggest that measurements have multiple actual outcomes. Similarly, Deutsch and Hayden argued that Bell's theorem leads to the same conclusion if locality is given for granted. We conclude by showing that the problem of the clumsiness loophole in an experimental Leggett-Garg test of macrorealism is mitigated by the information-erasure theorem.

Title: Eigenvalue analysis of three-state quantum walks with general coin matrices
Authors: Chusei Kiumi, Jirô Akahori, Takuya Watanabe, Norio Konno
Abstract: Mathematical analysis of the spectral properties of the time evolution operator in quantum walks is essential for understanding key dynamical behaviors such as localization and long-term evolution. The inhomogeneous three-state case, in particular, poses substantial analytical challenges due to its higher internal degrees of freedom and the absence of translational invariance. We develop a general framework for the spectral analysis of three-state quantum walks on the one-dimensional lattice with arbitrary time evolution operators. Our novel approach is based on a transfer matrix formulation that reduces the infinite-dimensional eigenvalue problem to a tractable system of two-dimensional recursions, enabling exact characterization of localized eigenstates. This framework applies broadly to space-inhomogeneous models, including those with finite defects and two-phase structures. We rigorously derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of discrete eigenvalues, along with a complete description of the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenstates, which are known to underlie quantum localization phenomena. Using this method, we perform exact numerical analyses of the Fourier walk with spatial inhomogeneity, revealing the emergence of localization despite its delocalized nature in the homogeneous case. Our results provide mathematical tools and physical insights into the structure of quantum walks, offering a systematic path for identifying and characterizing localized quantum states in complex quantum systems.

Title: How Much Entanglement Is Needed for Topological Codes and Mixed States with Anomalous Symmetry?
Authors: Zhi Li, Dongjin Lee, Beni Yoshida
Abstract: It is known that particles with exotic properties can emerge in systems made of simple constituents such as qubits, due to long-range quantum entanglement. In this paper, we provide quantitative characterizations of entanglement necessary for emergent anyons and fermions by using the geometric entanglement measure (GEM), which quantifies the maximal overlap between a given state and any short-range-entangled states. For systems with emergent anyons, based on the braiding statistics, we show that the GEM scales linearly in the system size regardless of microscopic details. The phenomenon of emergent anyons can also be understood within the framework of quantum error correction (QEC). Specifically, we show that the GEM of any 2D stabilizer codes must be at least quadratic in the code distance. Our proof is based on a generic prescription for constructing string operators, establishing a rigorous and direct connection between emergent anyons and QEC. For systems with emergent fermions, despite that the ground state subspaces could be exponentially huge and their coding properties could be rather poor, we show that the GEM also scales linearly in the system size. Our analysis establishes an intriguing link between quantum anomaly and entanglement: A quantum state respecting anomalous 1-form symmetries, must be long-range-entangled and have large GEM. Our results also extend to mixed states, such as the $ZX$-dephased toric code, providing a provably nontrivial class of intrinsically mixed-state phases.

Title: Simulation of open quantum systems on universal quantum computers
Authors: Huan-Yu Liu, Xiaoshui Lin, Zhao-Yun Chen, Cheng Xue, Tai-Ping Sun, Qing-Song Li, Xi-Ning Zhuang, Yun-Jie Wang, Yu-Chun Wu, Ming Gong, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum computers has enabled demonstrations of quantum advantages on various tasks. However, real quantum systems are always dissipative due to their inevitable interaction with the environment, and the resulting non-unitary dynamics make quantum simulation challenging with only unitary quantum gates. In this work, we present an innovative and scalable method to simulate open quantum systems using quantum computers. We define an adjoint density matrix as a counterpart of the true density matrix, which reduces to a mixed-unitary quantum channel and thus can be effectively sampled using quantum computers. This method has several benefits, including no need for auxiliary qubits and noteworthy scalability. Moreover, some long-time properties like steady states and the thermal equilibrium can also be investigated as the adjoint density matrix and the true dissipated one converge to the same state. Finally, we present deployments of this theory in the dissipative quantum $XY$ model for the evolution of correlation and entropy with short-time dynamics and the disordered Heisenberg model for many-body localization with long-time dynamics. This work promotes the study of real-world many-body dynamics with quantum computers, highlighting the potential to demonstrate practical quantum advantages.

Title: Quantum Natural Stochastic Pairwise Coordinate Descent
Authors: Mohammad Aamir Sohail, Mohsen Heidari, S. Sandeep Pradhan
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, optimized using gradient-based methods, often exhibit sub-optimal convergence performance due to their dependence on Euclidean geometry. Quantum natural gradient descent (QNGD) is a more efficient method that incorporates the geometry of the state space via a quantum information metric. However, QNGD is computationally intensive and suffers from high sample complexity. In this work, we formulate a novel quantum information metric and construct an unbiased estimator for this metric using single-shot measurements. We develop a quantum optimization algorithm that leverages the geometry of the state space via this estimator while avoiding full-state tomography, as in conventional techniques. We provide the convergence analysis of the algorithm under mild conditions. Furthermore, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the better sample complexity and faster convergence of our algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Our results illustrate the algorithm's ability to avoid saddle points and local minima.

Title: Adiabatic Dynamics of Entanglement
Authors: Einar Gabbassov, Achim Kempf
Abstract: We show that, during adiabatic evolution, any changes of entanglement can be traced to a succession of avoided energy level crossings at which eigenvalues swap their eigenvectors. These swaps of eigenvectors weave the entanglement in multipartite systems. The efficiency of this weaving of entanglement depends on the narrowness of the avoided level crossings and it is, therefore, constraining the speed of adiabatic evolution. Applied to adiabatic quantum computation, these results directly relate the adiabatic quantum computation speed to its utilization of the resource of entanglement. Further, the amount of entanglement involved in an adiabatic quantum computation can be related to the ruggedness of its energy landscape. We therefore obtain new tools for exploring the origins of quantum advantage in adiabatic quantum computation.

Title: Time-resolved Stochastic Dynamics of Quantum Thermal Machines
Authors: Abhaya S. Hegde, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonians for Periodic Free Fermion Chains with Defects
Authors: Gavin Rockwood
Abstract: We study the half system entanglement Hamiltonians of the ground state of free fermion critical transverse field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of defects. In general, we observe that these defects introduce non-local terms into the entanglement Hamiltonian, with the most significant being couplings across the defect that decay with distance. We also perform a limited entanglement Hamiltonian reconstruction using an ansatz and analyze how the fitted non-local couplings vary with defect strength.

Title: Stabilizer codes for Heisenberg-limited many-body Hamiltonian estimation
Authors: Santanu Bosu Antu, Sisi Zhou
Abstract: Estimating many-body Hamiltonians has wide applications in quantum technology. By allowing coherent evolution of quantum systems and entanglement across multiple probes, the precision of estimating a fully connected $k$-body interaction can scale up to $(n^kt)^{-1}$, where $n$ is the number of probes and $t$ is the probing time. However, the optimal scaling may no longer be achievable under quantum noise, and it is important to apply quantum error correction in order to recover this limit. In this work, we study the performance of stabilizer quantum error correcting codes in estimating many-body Hamiltonians under noise. When estimating a fully connected $ZZZ$ interaction under single-qubit noise, we showcase three families of stabilizer codes -- thin surface codes, quantum Reed--Muller codes and Shor codes -- that achieve the scalings of $(nt)^{-1}$, $(n^2t)^{-1}$ and $(n^3t)^{-1}$, respectively, all of which are optimal with $t$. We further discuss the relation between stabilizer structure and the scaling with $n$, and identify several no-go theorems. For instance, we find codes with constant-weight stabilizer generators can at most achieve the $n^{-1}$ scaling, while the optimal $n^{-3}$ scaling is achievable if and only if the code bears a repetition code substructure, like in Shor code.

Title: Towards violations of Local Friendliness with quantum computers
Authors: William J. Zeng, Farrokh Labib, Vincent Russo
Abstract: Local Friendliness (LF) inequalities follow from seemingly reasonable assumptions about reality: (i) ``absoluteness of observed events'' (e.g., every observed event happens for all observers) and (ii) ``local agency'' (e.g., free choices can be made uncorrelated with other events outside their future light cone). Extended Wigner's Friend Scenario (EWFS) thought experiments show that textbook quantum mechanics violates these inequalities. Thus, experimental evidence of these violations would make these two assumptions incompatible. In [Nature Physics 16, 1199 (2020)], the authors experimentally implemented an EWFS, using a photonic qubit to play the role of each of the ``friends'' and measured violations of LF. One may question whether a photonic qubit is a physical system that counts as an ``observer'' and thereby question whether the experiment's outcome is significant. Intending to measure increasingly meaningful violations, we propose using a statistical measure called the ``branch factor'' to quantify the ``observerness'' of the system. We then encode the EWFS as a quantum circuit such that the components of the circuit that define the friend are quantum systems of increasing branch factor. We run this circuit on quantum simulators and hardware devices, observing LF violations as the system sizes scale. As errors in quantum computers reduce the significance of the violations, better quantum computers can produce better violations. Our results extend the state of the art in proof-of-concept experimental violations from branch factor 0.0 to branch factor 16.0. This is an initial result in an experimental program for measuring LF violations at increasingly meaningful branch factors using increasingly more powerful quantum processors and networks. We introduce this program as a fundamental science application for near-term and developing quantum technology.

Title: Exponentially-enhanced quantum sensing with many-body phase transitions
Authors: Saubhik Sarkar, Abolfazl Bayat, Sougato Bose, Roopayan Ghosh
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on critical many-body systems are known to exhibit enhanced sensing capability. Such enhancements typically scale algebraically with the probe size. Going beyond algebraic advantage and reaching exponential scaling has remained elusive when all the resources, such as the preparation time, are taken into account. In this work, we show that many-body systems featuring first order quantum phase transitions can indeed achieve exponential scaling of sensitivity, thanks to their exponential energy gap closing. Remarkably, even after considering the preparation time using local adiabatic driving, the exponential scaling is sustained. Our results are demonstrated through comprehensive analysis of three paradigmatic models exhibiting first order phase transitions, namely Grover, $p$-spin, and biclique models. We show that this scaling survives moderate decoherence during state preparation and also can be optimally measured in experimentally available basis. Our findings comply with the fundamental bounds and we show that one can harness the exponential advantage through an adaptive strategy even away from the phase transition point.

Title: 1D Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in thermal equilibrium via Non-Hermitian Construction
Authors: Jia-Bao Wang, Zi-Hao Dong, Yi Zhang
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking generally circumvents one-dimensional systems with local interactions in thermal equilibrium. Here, we analyze a category of one-dimensional Hermitian models via local non-Hermitian constructions. Notably, spontaneous symmetry breaking and long-range order may emerge at finite temperatures in such systems under periodic boundary conditions, in sharp contrast to Hermitian constructions. We demonstrate clear numerical evidence, such as order parameters and specific heat, supporting phase diagrams with robust ordered phases. Non-Hermitian physics plays a vital role in prohibiting domain-wall proliferation and promoting spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermions exhibit an exotic topological nature in their path-integral windings, which uphold nonzero integers -- commonly a non-Hermitian signature -- in the ordered phases, thus offering a novel and spontaneous origin for both symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.

Title: Noisy Stark probes as quantum-enhanced sensors
Authors: Saubhik Sarkar, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: Wannier-Stark localization has been proven to be a resource for quantum-enhanced sensitivity for precise estimation of a gradient field. An extremely promising feature of such probes is their ability to showcase such enhanced scaling even dynamically with system size, on top of the quadratic scaling in time. In this paper, we address the issue of decoherence that occurs during time evolution and characterize how that affects the sensing performance. We determine the parameter domains in which the enhancement is sustained under dephasing dynamics. In addition, we consider an effective non-Hermitian description of the open quantum system dynamics for describing the effect of decoherence on the sensing performance of the probe. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, we show that quantum-enhanced sensitivity can indeed be sustained over certain range of decoherence strength for Wannier-Stark probes. This is demonstrated with two examples of non-Hermitian systems with non-reciprocal couplings.

Title: Fermionic Independent Set and Laplacian of an independence complex are QMA-hard
Authors: Chaithanya Rayudu
Abstract: The Independent Set is a well known NP-hard optimization problem. In this work, we define a fermionic generalization of the Independent Set problem and prove that the optimization problem is QMA-hard in a $k$-particle subspace using perturbative gadgets. We discuss how the Fermionic Independent Set is related to the problem of computing the minimum eigenvalue of the $k^{\text{th}}$-Laplacian of an independence complex of a vertex weighted graph. Consequently, we use the same perturbative gadget to prove QMA-hardness of the later problem resolving an open conjecture from arXiv:2311.17234 and give the first example of a natural topological data analysis problem that is QMA-hard.

Title: Generalized Statistics on Lattice
Authors: Ryohei Kobayashi, Yuyang Li, Hanyu Xue, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.

Title: Topology and Spectrum in Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions
Authors: Hisanori Oshima, Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Yohei Fuji
Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a wide variety of entanglement phases. Here, we propose a general framework based on Lyapunov analysis to characterize topological properties in monitored quantum systems through their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We illustrate this framework by analyzing (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which are known to exhibit topological and trivial area-law entangled phases as well as a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement. Through the Lyapunov analysis, we identify the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our framework thus provides a general route to extend the notion of bulk-edge correspondence to monitored quantum dynamics.

Title: Entropy flow in a parametric amplifier
Authors: Sergei Khlebnikov
Abstract: Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra (typically, radiation), there is a useful definition of entropy flow based on discretizing the signal into Gabor's "atoms," say, by means of a windowed Fourier transform. In particular, applying this method to a parametric amplifier (paramp) driven by a classical pump and coupled to a zero-temperature Markovian bath, we find that the output entropy flux vanishes at large times, even though the energy and photon number fluxes remain nonzero. This is consistent with the manner in which the paramp is expected to release information about its initial state. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the off-diagonal coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to linear environments.

Title: High-Rate Extended Binomial Codes for Multi-Qubit Encoding
Authors: En-Jui Chang
Abstract: We introduce a new class of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes, termed \emph{extended binomial codes}, which generalize the structure of one-mode binomial codes by incorporating ideas from high-rate qubit stabilizer codes. These codes are constructed in close analogy to $[[n,k,d]]$ qubit codes, where the parameter $n$ corresponds to the total excitation budget rather than the number of physical qubits. Our construction achieves a significant reduction in average excitation per mode while preserving error-correcting capabilities, offering improved compatibility with hardware constraints in the strong-dispersive regime. We demonstrate that extended binomial codes not only reduce the mean excitation required for encoding but also simplify syndrome extraction and logical gate implementation, particularly the logical $\bar{X}$ operation. These advantages suggest that extended binomial codes offer a scalable and resource-efficient approach for bosonic quantum error correction.

Title: Improving thermal state preparation of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with reinforcement learning on quantum hardware
Authors: Akash Kundu
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, known for its strong quantum correlations and chaotic behavior, serves as a key platform for quantum gravity studies. However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems ($N>12$, where $N$ is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems $N\geq12$ compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work advances a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for quantum gravity studies and out-of-time-ordered thermal correlators computation in quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.

Title: From Hamilton-Jacobi to Bohm: Why the Wave Function Isn't Just Another Action
Authors: Arnaud Amblard, Aurélien Drezet
Abstract: This paper examines the physical meaning of the wave function in Bohmian mechanics (BM), addressing the debate between causal and nomological interpretations. While BM postulates particles with definite trajectories guided by the wave function, the ontological status of the wave function itself remains contested. Critics of the causal interpretation argue that the wave function's high-dimensionality and lack of back-reaction disqualify it as a physical entity. Proponents of the nomological interpretation, drawing parallels to the classical Hamiltonian, propose that the wave function is a "law-like" entity. However, this view faces challenges, including reliance on speculative quantum gravity frameworks (e.g., the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) and conceptual ambiguities about the nature of "nomological entities". By systematically comparing BM to Hamilton-Jacobi theory, this paper highlights disanalogies between the wave function and the classical action function. These differences, particularly the wave function's dynamical necessity and irreducibility, support a sui generis interpretation, where the wave function represents a novel ontological category unique to quantum theory. The paper concludes that the wave function's role in BM resists classical analogies, demanding a metaphysical framework that accommodates its non-local, high-dimensional, and dynamically irreducible nature.

Title: The anomalously slow dynamics of inhomogeneous quantum annealing
Authors: Mohammadhossein Dadgar, Christopher L. Baldwin
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins $N$. More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in $N$ but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.

Title: Multi-Mode Global Driving of Trapped Ions for Quantum Circuit Synthesis
Authors: Philip Richerme
Abstract: We study the use of global drives with multiple frequency components to improve the efficiency of trapped ion quantum simulations and computations. We show that such `multi-mode' global drives, when combined with a linear number of single-qubit rotations, generate universal Ising-type interactions with shorter overall runtimes than corresponding two-qubit gate implementations. Further, we show how this framework may be extended to efficiently generate $n-$body interactions between any subset $n$ of the ion qubits. Finally, we apply these techniques to encode the Quantum Fourier Transform using quadratically-fewer entangling operations, with quadratically smaller runtime, compared with traditional approaches.

Title: Quantum Logic Spectroscopy of an Electron and Positron for Precise Tests of the Standard Model
Authors: Xing Fan, Atsushi Noguchi, Kento Taniguchi
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum logic spectroscopy of an electron or positron in a Penning trap. An electron or positron in a spectroscopy trap is coupled to a remote logic electron or positron via a wire to achieve motional entanglement. By separating the two traps, one can significantly improve magnetic field homogeneity, microwave characteristics, and detection sensitivity. The proposed scheme will improve the measurement precision of the electron's and positron's magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios, enabling precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.

Title: Efficient approximation of regularized relative entropies and applications
Authors: Kun Fang, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi
Abstract: The quantum relative entropy is a fundamental quantity in quantum information science, characterizing the distinguishability between two quantum states. However, this quantity is not additive in general for correlated quantum states, necessitating regularization for precise characterization of the operational tasks of interest. Recently, we proposed the study of the regularized relative entropy between two sequences of sets of quantum states in [arXiv:2411.04035], which captures a general framework for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we show that given suitable structural assumptions and efficient descriptions of the sets, the regularized relative entropy can be efficiently approximated within an additive error by a quantum relative entropy program of polynomial size. This applies in particular to the regularized relative entropy in adversarial quantum channel discrimination. Moreover, we apply the idea of efficient approximation to quantum resource theories. In particular, when the set of interest does not directly satisfy the required structural assumptions, it can be relaxed to one that does. This provides improved and efficient bounds for the entanglement cost of quantum states and channels, entanglement distillation and magic state distillation. Numerical results demonstrate improvements even for the first level of approximation.

Title: Simulating non-Abelian statistics of parafermions with superconducting processor
Authors: Hong-Yu Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose a novel experimental scheme for the quantum simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding statistics in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the topologically ordered ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding of parafermions, and show the application of this approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermions. We also examine the real experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility of our scheme in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulations of topological defects in SC qubits to qudit systems and opens up a promising way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.

Abstract: Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of obtaining a given state starting from a typically unentangled state. In this work, we show that complexity, when defined through the minimization of a Riemannian cost functional over the manifold of Gaussian states, provides the same information as quantum fidelity and is therefore capable of detecting quantum phase transitions. However, it does not offer a more refined analysis than entanglement entropy for a given state. We conclude that incorporating a notion of spatial locality into the computation of complexity is essential to uncover new physics beyond what is accessible through entanglement entropy and fidelity.

Title: Measurement-based Simulation of Geometric Gates in Topological Qubits on NISQ Devices
Authors: Matthew Brooks, Foster Sabatino, Charles Tahan, Silas Hoffman
Abstract: While the adiabatic exchange of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) enables a non-universal set of geometrically protected gates, realising an experimental implementation of MZM braiding remains challenging. In an alternative proposal, charge-parity measurement of two neighboring MZMs supports braiding by teleportation. Moreover, owing to the lack of definitive evidence of MZMs in semiconducting systems, there have been several simulations of MZMs on NISQ devices which more naturally lend themselves to braiding. In this work, measurement-based braiding about MZM Y-junctions are simulated by multi-qubit Pauli-parity measurements of a logical qubit. Logical single-qubit geometric $S^{(\dagger)}$-gates and entangling two-qubit gates is shown using two-physical-qubit joint measurements alone, whilst partial phase rotations such as a $T^{(\dagger)}$-gates require at least one three-qubit joint measurement. These relatively small scale circuits offer both novel measurement-based geometric gates as well as a measurement-based demonstration of quantum Hamiltonian simulation.

Title: Fast Convex Optimization with Quantum Gradient Methods
Authors: Brandon Augustino, Dylan Herman, Enrico Fontana, Junhyung Lyle Kim, Jacob Watkins, Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Marco Pistoia
Abstract: We study quantum algorithms based on quantum (sub)gradient estimation using noisy function evaluation oracles, and demonstrate the first dimension-independent query complexities (up to poly-logarithmic factors) for zeroth-order convex optimization in both smooth and nonsmooth settings. Interestingly, only using noisy function evaluation oracles, we match the first-order query complexities of classical gradient descent, thereby exhibiting exponential separation between quantum and classical zeroth-order optimization. We then generalize these algorithms to work in non-Euclidean settings by using quantum (sub)gradient estimation to instantiate mirror descent and its variants, including dual averaging and mirror prox. By leveraging a connection between semidefinite programming and eigenvalue optimization, we use our quantum mirror descent method to give a new quantum algorithm for solving semidefinite programs, linear programs, and zero-sum games. We identify a parameter regime in which our zero-sum games algorithm is faster than any existing classical or quantum approach.

Title: Adaptive Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
Authors: Hikaru Wakaura, Rahmat Mulyawan, Andriyan B. Suksmono
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer neuromorphic network. Many groups worldwide have studied this network, including image processing, time series analysis, solving physical problems, and practical applications such as medical use. Therefore, we propose an Adaptive Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) that takes advantage of KAN for Variational Quantum Algorithms in an adaptive manner. The Adaptive VQKAN is VQKAN that uses adaptive ansatz as the ansatz and repeat VQKAN growing the ansatz just like Adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). The scheme inspired by Adaptive VQE is promised to ascend the accuracy of VQKAN to practical value. As a result, Adaptive VQKAN has been revealed to calculate the fitting problem more accurately and faster than Quantum Neural Networks by far less number of parametric gates.

Title: Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
Authors: Hikaru Wakaura, Rahmat Mulyawan, Andriyan B. Suksmono
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer network model recognized for its efficiency in neuromorphic computing, where synapses between neurons are trained linearly. Computations in KAN are performed by generating a polynomial vector from the state vector and layer-wise trained synapses, enabling efficient processing. While KAN can be implemented on quantum computers using block encoding and Quantum Signal Processing, these methods require fault-tolerant quantum devices, making them impractical for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. We propose the Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (EVQKAN) to overcome this limitation, which emulates KAN through variational quantum algorithms. The EVQKAN ansatz employs a tiling technique to emulate layer matrices, leading to significantly higher accuracy compared to conventional Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), even with a smaller number of layers. EVQKAN achieves superior performance with a single-layer architecture, whereas QNN and VQKAN typically struggle. Additionally, EVQKAN eliminates the need for Quantum Signal Processing, enhancing its robustness to noise and making it well-suited for practical deployment on NISQ-era quantum devices.

Title: Characterization of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Pilar Martín Clavero, Alberto Rodríguez
Abstract: The chaotic phase of the tilted Bose-Hubbard model is identified as a function of energy, tilt strength and particle interaction, from the eigenstate structure and the statistical features of the energy spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the chaotic phase of the bare Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian can actually be enhanced by the presence of a moderate tilt. We further unveil the development and scaling of the chaotic regime from the perspective of a homogeneous density configuration typically used in cold atom experiments, providing a valuable phase diagram for future theoretical and experimental studies of this system.

Title: Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator for Quantum Optimal Control
Authors: Dirk Heimann, Felix Wiebe, Tahereh Abad, Elie Mounzer, Tangyou Huang, Frank Kirchner, Shivesh Kumar
Abstract: Quantum optimal control for gate optimization aims to provide accurate, robust, and fast pulse sequences to achieve gate fidelities on quantum systems below the error correction threshold. Many methods have been developed and successfully applied in simulation and on quantum hardware. In this paper, we establish a connection between the iterative linear quadratic regulator and quantum optimal control by adapting it to gate optimization of quantum systems. We include constraints on the controls and their derivatives to enable smoother pulses. We achieve high-fidelity simulation results for X and cross-resonance gates on one- and two-qubit fixed-frequency transmons simulated with two and three levels.

Title: Scrambling Dynamics with Imperfections in a Solvable Model
Authors: Nadie Yiluo LiTenn, Tianci Zhou, Brian Swingle
Abstract: We study how probes of quantum scrambling dynamics respond to two kinds of imperfections -- unequal forward and backward evolutions and decoherence -- in a solvable Brownian circuit model. We calculate a ``renormalized'' out-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show that the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability distribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear equations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\gtrsim 1/\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths. We also show that a generic initial condition $w_0 >1$ leads to a metastable state that eventually collapses to the $w_0=1$ case after a lifetime $\sim \log(N/w_0)$. Our results highlight situations where it is still possible to extract the unperturbed chaos exponent even in the presence of imperfections, and we comment on the applications of our results to existing experiments with nuclear spins and to future scrambling experiments.

Title: Compressed sensing quantum state tomography for qudits: A comparison of Gell-Mann and Heisenberg-Weyl observable bases
Authors: Yoshiyuki Kakihara, Daisuke Yamamoto, Giacomo Marmorini
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an essential technique for reconstructing the density matrix of an unknown quantum state from measurement data, crucial for quantum information processing. However, conventional QST requires an exponentially growing number of measurements as the system dimension increases, posing a significant challenge for high-dimensional systems. To mitigate this issue, compressed sensing quantum state tomography (CS-QST) has been proposed, significantly reducing the required number of measurements. In this study, we investigate the impact of basis selection in CS-QST for qudit systems, which are fundamental to high-dimensional quantum information processing. Specifically, we compare the efficiency of the generalized Gell-Mann (GGM) and Heisenberg-Weyl observable (HWO) bases by numerically reconstructing density matrices and evaluating reconstruction accuracy using fidelity and trace distance metrics. Our results demonstrate that, while both bases allow for successful density matrix reconstruction, the HWO basis becomes more efficient as the qudit dimension increases. Furthermore, we find the best fitting curves that estimate the number of measurement operators required to achieve a fidelity of at least 95%. These findings highlight the significance of basis selection in CS-QST and provide valuable insights for optimizing measurement strategies in high-dimensional quantum state tomography.

Title: Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources
Authors: Arindam Mitra, Sumit Mukherjee, Changhyoup Lee
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and has the potential to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.

Title: Continuous quantum correction on Markovian and Non-Markovian models
Authors: Juan Garcia Nila, Todd A. Brun
Abstract: We investigate continuous quantum error correction, comparing performance under a Markovian error model to two distinct non-Markovian models. The first non-Markovian model involves an interaction Hamiltonian between the system and an environmental qubit via an X-X coupling, with a "cooling" bath acting on the environment qubit. This model is known to exhibit abrupt transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian behavior. The second non-Markovian model uses the post-Markovian master equation (PMME), which represents the bath correlation through a memory kernel; we consider an exponentially decaying kernel and both underdamped and overdamped dynamics. We systematically compare these non-Markovian error models against the Markovian case and against each other, for a variety of different codes. We start with a single qubit, which can be solved analytically. We then consider the three-qubit repetition code and the five-qubit "perfect" code. In all cases, we find that the fidelity decays more rapidly in the Markovian case than in either non-Markovian model, suggesting that continuous quantum error correction has enhanced performance against non-Markovian noise. We attribute this difference to the presence of a quantum Zeno regime in both non-Markovian models.

Title: Mixed state concurrence for symmetric systems
Authors: S. H. Curnoe, D. Gajera, C. Wei
Abstract: We present a method to quantify entanglement in mixed states of highly symmetric systems. Symmetry constrains interactions between parts and predicts the degeneracies of the states. While symmetry alone produces entangled eigenstates, the thermal mixed state (density) which contains all of the eigenstate densities weighted by their Boltzmann factors is not necessarily as entangled as the eigenstates themselves because generally the mixed state can be re-expressed as a sum over densities which are less entangled. The entanglement of the mixed state is the minimum obtained by considering all such re-expressions, but there is no well-defined approach to solving this problem generally. Our method uses symmetry to explicitly construct unentangled densities, which are then optimally included in the thermal mixed state, resulting in a quantitative measure of entanglement that accounts for the reduction of entanglement arising from degenerate states. We present results for several small spin systems.

Title: Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics
Authors: Tian-Hua Yang, Dmitry A. Abanin
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.

Title: Torsional Regularization of Self-Energy and Bare Mass of Electron
Authors: Michael Del Grosso, Nikodem Popławski
Abstract: In the presence of spacetime torsion, the momentum components do not commute; therefore, in quantum field theory, summation over the momentum eigenvalues will replace integration over the momentum. In the Einstein--Cartan theory of gravity, in which torsion is coupled to spin, the separation between the eigenvalues increases with the magnitude of the momentum. Consequently, this replacement regularizes divergent integrals in Feynman diagrams with loops by turning them into convergent sums. In this article, we apply torsional regularization to the self-energy of a charged lepton in quantum electrodynamics. We show that torsion eliminates the ultraviolet divergence of the standard self-energy. We also show that the infrared divergence is absent. In the end, we calculate the finite bare masses of the electron, muon, and tau lepton: $0.4329\,\mbox{MeV}$, $90.95\,\mbox{MeV}$, and $1543\,\mbox{MeV}$, respectively. These values constitute about $85\%$ of the observed, re-normalized masses.

Title: Powerful Primitives in the Bounded Quantum Storage Model
Authors: Mohammed Barhoush, Louis Salvail
Abstract: The bounded quantum storage model aims to achieve security against computationally unbounded adversaries that are restricted only with respect to their quantum memories. In this work, we provide information-theoretic secure constructions in this model for the following powerful primitives: (1) CCA1-secure symmetric key encryption, message authentication codes, and one-time programs. These schemes require no quantum memory for the honest user, while they can be made secure against adversaries with arbitrarily large memories by increasing the transmission length sufficiently. (2) CCA1-secure asymmetric key encryption, encryption tokens, signatures, signature tokens, and program broadcast. These schemes are secure against adversaries with roughly $e^{\sqrt{m}}$ quantum memory where $m$ is the quantum memory required for the honest user. All of the constructions additionally satisfy disappearing security, essentially preventing an adversary from storing and using a transmission later on.

Title: Phonon-limited valley life times in single-particle bilayer graphene quantum dots
Authors: Luca Banszerus, Katrin Hecker, Lin Wang, Samuel Möller, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Guido Burkard, Christian Volk, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.

Title: Observation of vortices in a dipolar supersolid
Authors: Eva Casotti, Elena Poli, Lauritz Klaus, Andrea Litvinov, Clemens Ulm, Claudia Politi, Manfred J. Mark, Thomas Bland, Francesca Ferlaino
Abstract: Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous symmetries: translational invariance due to the appearance of a crystal structure and phase invariance due to phase locking of single-particle wave functions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. While originally predicted to be present in solid helium, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform to observe supersolids, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms. Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been probed through e.g. measurements of the phase coherence and gapless Goldstone modes, but quantized vortices, a hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here, with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate vortices in dipolar gases and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline order, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation of vortices in the supersolid phase. Our work reveals a fundamental difference in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids. This opens the door to study the hydrodynamic properties of exotic quantum systems with multiple spontaneously broken symmetries, in disparate domains such as quantum crystals and neutron stars.

Title: Two-dimensional many-body localized systems coupled to a heat bath
Authors: Joey Li, Amos Chan, Thorsten B. Wahl
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of coupling a two-dimensional many-body localized system to a finite heat bath, using shallow quantum circuits as a variational ansatz. Specifically, we simulate optical lattice experiments with two components of ultracold bosons, where only one species is subject to a random disorder potential and the other acts as a heat bath. We obtain a filling fraction dependent phase diagram with a critical filling consistent with experiments. We also calculate two-point correlation functions and the quantum mutual information between sites. We observe a distribution of the quantum mutual information in the many-body localized regime which is consistent with the presence of resonances, similar to those observed in one-dimensional many-body localized systems.

Title: Abelian Spectral Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points
Authors: Marcus Stålhammar, Lukas Rødland
Abstract: The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological phases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among the most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological properties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only recently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and concomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically fundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an open question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological classification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries, generalize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity relations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local symmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms of the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its derivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is understood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of (Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence, and iii) the classification of vector bundles. The classification scheme further predicts the existence of topological bulk Fermi arcs protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant, induced by non-local symmetries, dubbed $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Fermi arcs. Our work reveals the mathematical foundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will therefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and quantum physics.

Title: Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids
Authors: Tong Liu, Ying-Hai Wu, Hong-Hao Tu, Tao Xiang
Abstract: We employ the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.

Title: Quantum correlations and spatial localization in trapped one-dimensional ultra-cold Bose-Bose-Bose mixtures
Authors: Tran Duong Anh-Tai, Miguel A. García-March, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty
Abstract: We systematically investigate and illustrate the complete ground-state phase diagram for a one-dimensional, three-species mixture of a few repulsively interacting bosons trapped harmonically. To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schrödinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method [T. D. Anh-Tai {\it et al.}, SciPost Physics 15, 048 (2023)], which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit ($g=0$) or close to the hard-core limit ($g\to\infty$). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.

Title: Extended string-net models with all anyons at finite temperature
Authors: André O. Soares, Anna Ritz-Zwilling, Jean-Noël Fuchs
Abstract: The string-net model describes a vast family of topological orders in two spatial dimensions. Here, we consider the effect of thermal fluctuations on these topological phases. In the original string-net model, the description of charge (vertex) excitations can be problematic. Therefore, in order to describe all anyon excitations, we study an extended model [Y. Hu et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 195154 (2018)]. Building on recent methods, we compute the spectral degeneracies of excited states and obtain the exact partition function. In the thermodynamic limit, the latter is dominated by the trivial (vacuum) anyon, so that topological order is destroyed at any nonzero temperature. In contrast, in a finite-size system, order survives up to a finite temperature, revealing a nontrivial scaling between temperature and size similar to that of the one-dimensional classical Ising model. We confirm this scaling by computing the thermal average of several observables such as Wegner-Wilson loops and topological mutual information.

Title: Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics
Authors: Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.

Title: Inverse Microparticle Design for Enhanced Optical Trapping and Detection Efficiency in All Six Degrees of Freedom
Authors: Moosung Lee, Benjamin A. Stickler, Thomas Pertsch, Sungkun Hong
Abstract: Achieving quantum-limited motional control of optically trapped particles beyond the sub-micrometer scale is an outstanding problem in levitated optomechanics. A key obstacle is solving the light scattering problem and identifying particle geometries that allow stable trapping and efficient motional detection of their center of mass and rotational motion in three dimensions. Here, we present a computational framework that combines an efficient electromagnetic scattering solver with the adjoint method to inversely design printable microparticles tailored for levitated optomechanics. Our method allows identifying optimized geometries, characterized by enhanced optical trapping and detection efficiencies compared to conventional microspheres. This improves the feasibility of quantum-limited motional control of all translational and rotational degrees of freedom in a standard standing-wave optical trap.
