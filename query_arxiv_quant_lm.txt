Title: Quantum-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Solutions for Last-Mile On-Demand Delivery
Authors: Farzan Moosavi, Bilal Farooq
Abstract: Quantum computation has demonstrated a promising alternative to solving the NP-hard combinatorial problems. Specifically, when it comes to optimization, classical approaches become intractable to account for large-scale solutions. Specifically, we investigate quantum computing to solve the large-scale Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW). In this regard, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework augmented with a Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is designed to minimize the travel time in a realistic last-mile on-demand delivery. A novel problem-specific encoding quantum circuit with an entangling and variational layer is proposed. Moreover, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) are designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.

Title: Quantum-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks: Comparative Analysis of Classical and Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Kun Ming Goh
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance, narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures, highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

Title: On continuum and resonant spectra from exact WKB analysis
Authors: Okuto Morikawa, Shoya Ogawa
Abstract: Resonance phenomena are central to many quantum systems, where resonant states are typically described by pole singularities of S-matrix. In this work, we apply the complex scaling method (CSM) and exact WKB analysis to describe scattering problems, incorporating both bound and resonant states. We compute continuum spectrum based on the exact WKB analysis and derive the S-matrix for the inverted Rosen--Morse potential. We reinterpret the Aguilar--Balslev--Combes theorem, on which CSM is based; we then discuss the physical significance of the Siegert boundary condition and rigorously define physical states in a modified Hilbert space. Our analysis connects the scattering cross-section and spectral theory, providing insights into the scattering theory and related formulas.

Title: Displaced Janus States: Tunable Non-Gaussianity and Exact Higher-Order Coherences for Quantum Advantage
Authors: Arash Azizi
Abstract: Non-Gaussian states are essential for achieving a quantum advantage in continuous-variable (CV) information processing. Among these, superpositions of squeezed states offer a rich phenomenology, yet a complete analytical understanding of their higher-order quantum statistics-such as the transition from extreme bunching ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to suppression ($g^{(k>2)} \to 0$)-has remained elusive. In this work, we introduce and provide an exact solution for the displaced Janus state-a coherent superposition of two squeezed coherent states. We develop a powerful analytical framework built upon a new family of Generalized Squeezing Polynomials that yields closed-form expressions for its arbitrary-order coherence functions, Wigner function, and quantum Fisher information. This enables a full characterization of the state's tunable non-Gaussianity, revealing how quantum interference can transform the extreme photon bunching of its components into strong antibunching or perfect multiphoton suppression. We identify parameter regimes that generate Wigner negativity and can be harnessed for achieving Heisenberg-limited metrological precision. Our work provides a foundational toolkit for engineering non-Gaussian states, establishing the displaced Janus state as a key resource for hybrid quantum protocols and fault-tolerant CV computation.

Title: A Symmetry-Based Taxonomy of Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Sakshi Kumar, Sumit Chilkoti, Mrittunjoy Guha Majumdar
Abstract: We propose a taxonomy for quantum algorithms grounded in the fundamental symmetries, both continuous and discrete, underlying quantum state spaces, oracles, and circuit dynamics. By organizing algorithms according to their symmetry groups and invariants, we define distinct algorithm classes whose behavior, verification, and complexity can be characterized by the symmetries they preserve or exploit. This symmetry-centric classification not only reflects the deep connection between symmetries and conservation laws in physics, but also yields practical benefits for scalable and reliable quantum computation.

Title: Certifying Quantum States with Uniform Measurements
Authors: Liang Mao, Yifei Wang, Yingfei Gu, Chengshu Li
Abstract: Qubit-resolved operations and measurements are required for most current quantum information processing schemes. However, these operations can be experimentally costly due to the need for local addressing, demanding significant classical control. A more resource-efficient alternative to extract information is uniform measurement, where a site-independent rotation of qubits is performed before measuring in the computational basis. This operation can be performed in parallel, or globally, in atom- and ion-based platforms, reducing resource cost and increasing fidelity. In this work, we initiate the exploration of the utility of this operation in quantum information processing. In particular, we demonstrate that uniform measurements can certify certain graph states, a family of highly entangled and broadly useful quantum states. We provide a sample-efficient certification algorithm with a proved performance guarantee, together with an experimental scheme based on analog-mode Rydberg atom arrays. Uniform measurements, therefore, allow direct and efficient characterization of quantum states on quantum platforms in a hitherto unexplored manner.

Title: Scalable Fluxonium-Transmon Architecture for Error Corrected Quantum Processors
Authors: Lukas Heunisch, Longxiang Huang, Stephan Tasler, Johannes Schirk, Florian Wallner, Verena Feulner, Bijita Sarma, Klaus Liegener, Christian M. F. Schneider, Stefan Filipp, Michael J. Hartmann
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum computing architecture composed of alternating fluxonium and transmon qubits, that are coupled via transmon tunable couplers. We show that this system offers excellent scaling properties, characterized by engineered zero $ZZ$-crosstalk in the idle regime, a substantial reduction of level-crowding challenges through the alternating arrangement of different qubit types within the lattice, and parameter regimes that circumvent the capacitive loading problem commonly associated with fluxoniums. In numerical simulations, we show a parametrically driven CZ-gate that achieves a closed-system infidelity that is orders of magnitude below the coherence limit for gate durations $\gtrsim 30\,\rm{ns}$ using a two-tone flux pulse on the tunable coupler. Furthermore, we show that this gate scheme retains its fidelity in the presence of spectator qubits, making it a scalable solution for large lattices. Moreover, for the implementation of error correcting codes, our approach can leverage the long coherence times and large non-linearities of fluxoniums as data qubits, while fixed-frequency transmons with established readout techniques can serve as measurement ancillas.

Title: Secure authentication via Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions: a review
Authors: Pol Julià Farré, Vladlen Galetsky, Mohamed Belhassen, Gregor Pieplow, Kumar Nilesh, Holger Boche, Tim Schröder, Janis Nötzel, Christian Deppe
Abstract: Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs) offer a physically grounded approach to secure authentication, extending the capabilities of classical PUFs. This review covers their theoretical foundations and key implementation challenges - such as quantum memories and Haar-randomness -, and distinguishes QPUFs from Quantum Readout PUFs (QR-PUFs), more experimentally accessible yet less robust against quantum-capable adversaries. A co-citation-based selection method is employed to trace the evolution of QPUF architectures, from early QR-PUFs to more recent Hybrid PUFs (HPUFs). This method further supports a discussion on the role of information-theoretic analysis in mitigating inconsistencies in QPUF responses, underscoring the deep connection between secret-key generation and authentication. Despite notable advances, achieving practical and robust QPUF-based authentication remains an open challenge.

Title: Quantum correction to the Langevin cross section in resonant-exchange processes
Authors: I. Simbotin, R. Côté
Abstract: Resonant-exchange scattering plays a key role in many-body dynamics and transport phenomena (such as spin, charge, or excitation diffusion) at low and moderate temperatures. Recent investigations have shown that the locking of phase shifts is central to resonant-exchange scattering at low energies. Moreover, phase-shift locking causes an unexpected behavior, namely the resonant-exchange cross section over a broad range of energies is largely dictated by $s$-wave scattering, whose influence extends high above the $s$-wave Wigner regime. Here, we generalize our previous treatment to higher energies and derive an analytical expression for the resonant-exchange cross section which depends on a few parameters and accounts not only for the locking of phase shifts, but also for their gradual unlocking with increased energy. We find good agreement between the computed (fully quantal) cross sections and those obtained with our expression, which we illustrate in great detail for the case of resonant charge-transfer in ion-atom collisions.

Title: Demonstration of a photonic time-frequency Fourier transform and temporal double slit using atomic quantum memory
Authors: Ankit Papneja, Jesse Everett, Cameron Trainor, Aaron D. Tranter, Ben C. Buchler
Abstract: Aquantummemoryforlightisexpectedtoplayacrucialroleinquantumcommunicationprotocols and distributed quantum computing. In addition to storage and buffering, a quantum memory can be used for manipulations of stored states to allow more complex quantum network operations. In this work, we demonstrate an in-memory Fourier transform using a combination of two well-established quantum memory protocols: Gradient Echo Memory and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. Our experiment is realised using an ensemble of rubidium atoms that are laser cooled in an elongated magneto-optic trap to maximise optical depth. The results of our time-frequency Fourier transform can be understood as a temporal double slit. We show that the interference between time-separated pulses depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a well established technique in classical optical systems. Our combination of Fourier manipulation and quantum-compatible memory could be used to bring similar capability to quantum optical systems.

Title: Oscillating bound states in waveguide-QED system with two giant atoms
Authors: F. J. Lü, W. Z. Jia
Abstract: We study the bound states in the continuum (BIC) in a system of two identical two-level giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. By deriving general dark-state conditions, we clarify how coupling configurations and atomic parameters influence decay suppression. Through analysis of the long-time dynamical behaviors of atoms and bound photons, we carry out a detailed classification of bound states and explore the connections between these dynamical behaviors and the system's intrinsic light-matter interactions. The system supports static bound states with persistent atomic excitations, and oscillating bound states with periodic atom-photon or atom-atom excitation exchange. Under certain conditions, oscillating bound states can contain more harmonic components owing to the emergence of additional quasi-dark modes, rendering them promising platforms for high-capacity quantum information processing. These findings advance the understanding of BIC in waveguide quantum electrodynamics with multiple giant atoms and reveal their prospective applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Discovery of energy landscapes towards optimized quantum transport: Environmental effects and long-range tunneling
Authors: Maggie Lawrence, Matthew Pocrnic, Erin Fung, Juan Carrasquilla, Erik M. Gauger, Dvira Segal
Abstract: Carrier transport in quantum networks is governed by a variety of factors, including network dimensionality and connectivity, on-site energies, couplings between sites and whether they are short- or long-range, and environmental effects. In this work, we identify classes of quasi-one-dimensional chains with energy profiles that optimize carrier transport under such influences. Specifically, we optimize on-site energies using Optax's optimistic gradient descent and AdaMax algorithms, enabled by the JAX automatic differentiation framework. Focusing on steady-state transport, we study the system's behavior under combined unitary and nonunitary (dephasing and dissipative) effects using the Lindblad quantum master equation. After validating our optimization scheme on short chains, we extend the study to larger systems where we identify systematic patterns in energy profiles. Our analysis reveals that different types of energy landscape enhance transport, depending on whether inter-site tunneling couplings in the chain are short- or long-range, the existence of environmental interactions, and the temperature of the environment. Our classification and insights of optimal energy landscapes offer guidance for designing efficient transport systems for electronic, photovoltaic and quantum communication applications.

Title: Parallel repetition of expanded, and multiplayer, Quantum games: anchoring, optimal values, generalized error bounds, dependency-breaking as symmetry-breaking
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We demonstrate that parallel repetition of the multiplayer anchored optimal value, $\omega \big( G_{\bot} \big)^{\otimes n}$, decays exponentially. Central to our approach are several probabilistic computations, pertaining to: (1) the computation of expected values for quantifying how the winning probability of the game is likely to change under the anchoring transformation; (2) the computation of positive operator valued measurements, which can be placed into direct correspondence with several probabilistically defined quantities; (3) the computation of Relative, and Relative-min entropies; (4) and lastly, the computation of generalized error bounds, which have previously been analyzed by the author in several multiplayer game-theoretic settings (arXiv: 2505.06322, and arXiv: 2507.03035). This work builds upon observations originally provided by Bavarian, Vidick, and Yuen (arXiv: 1509.07466).

Title: Efficient computation of average subsystem Bures distance in transverse field Ising chain
Authors: Zhouhao Guo, M. A. Rajabpour, Jiaju Zhang
Abstract: The average subsystem trace distance has been proposed as an indicator of quantum many-body chaos and integrability. In integrable systems, evaluating the trace distance faces two challenges: the computational cost for large systems and ambiguities in defining and ordering eigenstates. In this paper, we calculate the average subsystem Bures distance in the spin-1/2 transverse-field Ising chain. We develop an efficient algorithm to evaluate the Bures distance between two Gaussian states, which allows us to access larger system sizes. To address the degeneracy issue, we consider simultaneous eigenstates of all local conserved charges and use these charges to systematically order degenerate states. The results align with the conjectured linear increase with subsystem size. We demonstrate that the distinct scaling behaviors of the average subsystem trace and Bures distances in chaotic versus integrable systems stem from discontinuities of local conserved charges across the spectrum in integrable systems. Additionally, we investigate the average subsystem distances between random pure Gaussian states but do not observe a linear increase.

Title: Surpassing the PLOB bound in continuous-variable quantum secret sharing using a state-discrimination detector
Authors: Qin Liao, Chong Tang, Qingquan Peng, Chao Ding, Lingjin Zhu, Yijun Wang, Xiquan Fu
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum secret sharing (CVQSS) is a promising approach to ensuring multi-party information security. While CVQSS offers practical ease of implementation, its present performance remains limited. In this paper, we propose a novel CVQSS protocol integrated with a state-discrimination detector (SDD), dubbed SDD-CVQSS. In particular, we first develop the detailed procedure of SDD-CVQSS, which replaces the traditional coherent detector with an SDD and eliminates the long-standing necessary step of establishing multiple point-to-point quantum key distribution links between all users and the dealer. We then elaborate on the principle of the specifically designed SDD, which can efficiently discriminate mixed states with a much lower error probability. Finally, we construct a security model for SDD-CVQSS and derive its security bound against beam-splitting collective attacks. Numerical simulations show that SDD-CVQSS outperforms conventional CVQSS in both maximum transmission distance and secret key rate, even surpassing the PLOB bound. Additionally, we find that the performance degradation of SDD-CVQSS in long-distance transmission scenarios can be effectively compensated for using a post-selection scheme, providing a feasible way to achieve high-performance CVQSS.

Title: Realizing Parrondo's Paradox in Single-Qubit Quantum Walks via Local Phase-Induced Spatial Inhomogeneity
Authors: Ran-Yu Chang, Yun-Hsuan Chen, Gooi Zi Liang, Tsung-Wei Huang
Abstract: Parrondo's paradox describes a counterintuitive phenomenon where alternating between two individually losing games results in a winning expectation. While its classical origin relies on capital-dependent bias and noise-induced asymmetry, realizing a robust quantum version of the paradox has remained challenging, especially under the constraint of single-qubit coin systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a genuine quantum Parrondo effect can emerge in discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) by alternating two SU(2) coin operators and introducing a localized phase shift at the origin. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that this minimal model, without entanglement or high-dimensional coins, exhibits sustained positive drift only in the presence of spatial inhomogeneity. We analyze the role of phase angle, coin parameters, and game sequences, and identify optimal regions in which constructive interference enables paradoxical transport. Our findings validate recent theoretical claims that translational symmetry breaking is essential for overcoming interference-induced cancellation, thereby enabling directed quantum motion. This work opens new possibilities for realizing counterintuitive quantum dynamics using low-resource architectures, with potential applications in quantum control, energy harvesting, and coherence-assisted transport.

Title: Lifshitz-like Metastability and Optimal Dephasing in Dissipative Bosonic Lattices
Authors: Stefano Longhi
Abstract: In dissipative bosonic systems, dephasing is typically expected to accelerate relaxation and suppress coherent dynamics. However, we show that in networks of coherently coupled bosonic modes with non-uniform local dissipation, the presence of quasi-dark states leads to a nontrivial response to dephasing: while weak dephasing facilitates equilibration, moderate to strong dephasing induces a pronounced slowdown of relaxation, revealing the existence of an optimal dephasing rate that enhances equilibration. Using exact dynamical equations for second-order moments, we demonstrate that dephasing suppresses coherent transport and gives rise to long-lived collective modes that dominate the system's late-time behavior. This phenomenon bears striking similarities to Lifshitz-tail states, which are known in disordered systems to cause anomalously slow relaxation. Our results uncover a counterintuitive mechanism by which dephasing, rather than promoting equilibration, can dynamically decouple specific modes from dissipation, thereby protecting excitations. These findings highlight how non-Hermitian physics in open bosonic systems can give rise to unexpected dynamical regimes, paving the way for new strategies to control relaxation and decoherence in bosonic quantum systems, with broad implications for both experimental and theoretical quantum science.

Title: Relative Wavefront Errors in Continuous-Variable Quantum Communication
Authors: Nathan K. Long, John Wallis, Alex Frost, Benjamin P. Dix-Matthews, Sascha W. Schediwy, Kenneth J. Grant, Robert Malaney
Abstract: When undertaking continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) across atmospheric channels, strong classical local oscillators (LOs) are often polarization-multiplexed with the weak quantum signals for coherent measurement at the receiver. Although the wavefronts of the quantum signal and LO are often assumed to experience the same distortion across channels, previous theoretical work has shown that they can experience differential distortions, resulting in relative wavefront errors (WFEs). Such errors have previously been shown to limit CV-QKD performance, in some cases leading to zero secure key rates. In this work, for the first time, we provide strong experimental evidence that relative WFEs are present in some circumstances and that standard assumptions in CV-QKD deployments may need to be revisited. In addition, we demonstrate how turbulence can affect the detailed form of the relative WFEs, thereby indicating that long-range links like terrestrial-satellite channels are likely impacted more than short-range terrestrial-only channels.

Title: Interpreting quantum reference frame transformations through a simple example
Authors: Esteban Castro-Ruiz, Thomas D. Galley, Leon Loveridge
Abstract: Quantum reference frame transformations have been proposed to provide a means by which to translate descriptions of quantum systems relative to each other. At present, there are several differing frameworks for describing quantum reference frames, with concomitantly different transformation rules. Here, we investigate a simple example of three qubit systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in order to analyze physical and conceptual distinctions between three contemporary approaches to quantum reference frames -- dubbed perspective-neutral, extra particle and operational. By constructing two three-qubit states that are indistinguishable by observables relative to one frame but are distinguishable by observables relative to another, we show that each of the three approaches provides a distinct transformation rule, which may be understood to reflect differing attitudes towards the global state and the information that can be accessed by each frame. This helps us to shed light on the operational meaning of each approach and the contexts in which they may be most naturally applied.

Title: High-$Q$ superconducting resonators fabricated in an industry-scale semiconductor-fabrication facility
Authors: Nicolas Arlt, Karina Houska, Jochen Braumüller, Michael Kirsch, Gerhard Metzger-Brückl, Wolfgang Raberg, Thomas Stangl, Stefan Filipp, Jash Banker, Florian Brandl
Abstract: Universal quantum computers promise to solve computational problems that are beyond the capabilities of known classical algorithms. To realize such quantum hardware on a superconducting material platform, a vast number of physical qubits has to be manufactured and integrated at high quality and uniformity on a chip. Anticipating the benefits of semiconductor industry processes in terms of process control, uniformity and repeatability, we set out to manufacture superconducting quantum circuits in a semiconductor fabrication facility. In order to set a baseline for the process quality, we report on the fabrication of coplanar waveguide resonators in a 200 mm production line, making use of a two-layer superconducting circuit technology. We demonstrate high material and process quality by cryogenic Q-factor measurements exceeding $10^6$ in the single-photon regime, for microwave resonators made of both Niobium and Tantalum. In addition, we demonstrate the incorporation of superconducting Niobium air bridges in our process, while maintaining the high quality factor of Niobium resonators.

Title: Procedural Generation and Games at the Dawn of Fault Tolerant Quantum Computing
Authors: Daniel Bultrini, James Wootton
Abstract: Quantum computers have long been more of a toy for researchers than a tool for solving complex problems. However, recent advances in the field make exploiting the advantages of fault-tolerant quantum computers feasible in the next 5 to 10 years. It is now time to begin imagining how such devices could be used in practice for game development and deployment. In this work we identify procedural content generation as a very promising area of application and exploration. We examine a selection of algorithmic approaches used in classical procedural content generation and propose promising quantum algorithms that could provide an alternative approach or a computational advantage. We then end with a hypothetical game that exploits a recent quantum algorithm for computing the Jones polynomial exponentially faster than classical computers could.

Title: Stabilizing boundary time crystals through Non-markovian dynamics
Authors: Bandita Das, Rahul Ghosh, Victor Mukherjee
Abstract: We study Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in the presence of non-Markovian dynamics. In contrast to BTCs observed in earlier works in the Markovian regime, we show that non-Markovian dynamics can be highly beneficial for stabilizing BTCs over a wide range of parameter values, even in the presence of intermediate rates of dissipation. We analyze the effect of non-Markovian dynamics on BTCs using quantum Fisher information, order parameter, a measure of non-Markovianity, and a dynamical phase diagram, all of which show complex behaviours with changing non-Markovianity parameters. Our studies can pave the way for stabilizing time crystals in dissipative systems, as well as lead to studies on varied dissipative dynamics on time translational symmetry breaking.

Title: Hybrid Optomechanical Cooling with Kerr Magnons and Squeezed Vacuum
Authors: Xiao-Hong Fan, Qin-Geng Chen, Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong
Abstract: Ground-state cooling is essential for accessing the quantum regime and enabling quantum control of macroscopic systems. However, achieving optomechanical cooling in the unresolved-sideband regime ($\omega_b < \kappa$) remains challenging. In this Letter, we propose an efficient cooling strategy based on a hybrid optomechanical system incorporating a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere embedded in an optomechanical cavity. Under strong cavity driving, the Kerr nonlinearity of the magnons hosted in the YIG sphere gives rise to a two-magnon process. Adiabatic elimination of the magnons yields an effective two-photon process in the cavity, which destructively interferes with all dissipative channels, surpassing the quantum backaction limit and enabling \textit{complete suppression} of heating under optimal conditions, even in the deeply unresolved sideband regime (DUSR: $\omega_b \ll \kappa$). Moreover, injecting squeezed vacuum noise into the cavity not only preserves these advantages but also delivers additional enhancements, including higher net cooling rates, reduced optomechanical coupling requirements, and improved noise robustness. Comparative analysis shows that our approach outperforms existing schemes without Kerr magnons, underscoring the potential of integrating nonlinear magnonics with optomechanics for quantum control of macroscopic mechanical systems.

Title: Entanglement certification from moments of positive maps
Authors: Qing-Hua Zhang, Xiaoyu Ma, Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: Entanglement certification is crucial in physical experiments, particularly when only partial knowledge of the quantum state is available. In this context, we present an entanglement criterion based on positive but not completely positive maps, which eliminates the need to identify eigenvalues of the output state. Notably, the Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm establishes a relationship between the coefficients of characteristic polynomials and the moments of a matrix. This enables the existence of negative eigenvalues through the moments of the output state. The effectiveness of our criterion relies on the selection of positive maps, similar to the original positive maps criterion.

Title: On the Generalization Limits of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks with Pure State Generators
Authors: Jasmin Frkatovic, Akash Malemath, Ivan Kankeu, Yannick Werner, Matthias Tschöpe, Vitor Fortes Rey, Sungho Suh, Paul Lukowicz, Nikolaos Palaiodimopoulos, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis
Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) in image generations tasks. Our analysis centers on fully quantum implementations of both the generator and discriminator. Through extensive numerical testing of current main architectures, we find that QGANs struggle to generalize across datasets, converging on merely the average representation of the training data. When the output of the generator is a pure-state, we analytically derive a lower bound for the discriminator quality given by the fidelity between the pure-state output of the generator and the target data distribution, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the limitations observed in current models. Our findings reveal fundamental challenges in the generalization capabilities of existing quantum generative models. While our analysis focuses on QGANs, the results carry broader implications for the performance of related quantum generative models.

Title: The Role of Symmetry in Generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference and Quantum Metrology
Authors: Éloi Descamps, Arne Keller, Pérola Milman
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer is a foundational tool in quantum optics, with both fundamental and practical significance. Earlier works identified that input-state symmetry under exchange of the two spatial modes is fundamental in the understanding of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We now show that this notion of symmetry is central to generalizing this effect. In particular, this point of view enables the construction of extensions beyond the standard two single-photon case to arbitrary input states, as well as to configurations with more than two spatial modes via a natural generalization of the beam splitter to a discrete Fourier transform interferometer. Beyond its conceptual significance, this framework offers direct insights into quantum metrology, showing how symmetry properties of input states allow the computation of explicit precision bounds. By focusing on symmetry, we provide a perspective that simplifies and unifies a range of known results, while paving the way for new developments in quantum interference and sensing.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Latent Diffusion Models for Medical Image Generation
Authors: Kübra Yeter-Aydeniz, Nora M. Bauer, Pranay Jain, Max Masnick
Abstract: Generative learning models in medical research are crucial in developing training data for deep learning models and advancing diagnostic tools, but the problem of high-quality, diverse images is an open topic of research. Quantum-enhanced generative models have been proposed and tested in the literature but have been restricted to small problems below the scale of industry relevance. In this paper, we propose quantum-enhanced diffusion and variational autoencoder (VAE) models and test them on the fundus retinal image generation task. In our numerical experiments, the images generated using quantum-enhanced models are of higher quality, with 86% classified as gradable by external validation compared to 69% with the classical model, and they match more closely in features to the real image distribution compared to the ones generated using classical diffusion models, even when the classical diffusion models are larger than the quantum model. Additionally, we perform noisy testing to confirm the numerical experiments, finding that quantum-enhanced diffusion model can sometimes produce higher quality images, both in terms of diversity and fidelity, when tested with quantum hardware noise. Our results indicate that quantum diffusion models on current quantum hardware are strong targets for further research on quantum utility in generative modeling for industrially relevant problems.

Title: An integrated photonics platform for high-speed, ultrahigh-extinction, many-channel quantum control
Authors: Mengdi Zhao, Manuj Singh, Anshuman Singh, Henry Thoreen, Robert J. DeAngelo, Daniel Dominguez, Andrew Leenheer, Frédéric Peyskens, Alexander Lukin, Dirk Englund, Matt Eichenfield, Nathan Gemelke, Noel H. Wan
Abstract: High-fidelity control of the thousands to millions of programmable qubits needed for utility-scale quantum computers presents a formidable challenge for control systems. In leading atomic systems, control is optical: UV-NIR beams must be fanned out over numerous spatial channels and modulated to implement gates. While photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a potentially scalable solution, they also need to simultaneously feature high-speed and high-extinction modulation, strong inter-channel isolation, and broad wavelength compatibility. Here, we introduce and experimentally validate a foundry-fabricated PIC platform that overcomes these limitations. Designed for Rubidium-87 neutral atom quantum computers, our 8-channel PICs, fabricated on a 200-mm wafer process, demonstrate an advanced combination of performance metrics. At the 795 nm single-qubit gate wavelength, we achieve a mean extinction ratio (ER) of 71.4 $\pm$ 1.1 dB, nearest-neighbor on-chip crosstalk of -68.0 $\pm$ 1.0 dB, and -50.8 $\pm$ 0.2 dB after parallel beam delivery in free-space. This high-performance operation extends to the 420 nm and 1013 nm wavelengths for two-qubit Rydberg gates, showing ERs of 42.4 dB (detector-limited) and 61.5 dB, respectively. The devices exhibit 10-90% rise times of 26 $\pm$ 7 ns, achieve dynamic switching to -60 dB levels within microsecond timescales, and show pulse stability errors at the $10^{-3}$ level. This work establishes a scalable platform for developing advanced large-scale optical control required in fault-tolerant quantum computers and other precision technologies.

Title: Fault tolerant Operations in Majorana-based Quantum Codes: Gates, Measurements and High Rate Constructions
Authors: Maryam Mudassar, Alexander Schuckert, Daniel Gottesman
Abstract: Majorana-based quantum computation in nanowires and neutral atoms has gained prominence as a promising platform to encode qubits and protect them against noise. In order to run computations reliably on such devices, a fully fault-tolerant scheme is needed for state preparation, gates, and measurements. However, current fault-tolerant schemes have either been limited to specific code families or have not been developed fully. In this work, we develop a general framework for fault-tolerant computation with logical degrees encoded into Majorana hardware. We emphasize the division between even and odd Majorana codes and how it manifests when constructing fault tolerant gadgets for these families. We provide transversal constructions and supplement them with measurements to obtain several examples of fault tolerant Clifford gadgets. For the case of odd codes, we give a novel construction for gadgets using quantum reference frames, that allows to implement operations that are forbidden due to parity superselection. We also provide a fault-tolerant measurement scheme for Majorana codes inspired by Steane error correction, enabling state preparation, measurement of logical operations and error correction. We also point out a construction for odd Majorana codes with transversal T gates. Finally, we construct an asympotically good quantum LDPC Majorana code with qubit degrees of freedom. Our work shows that all necessary elements of fault-tolerant quantum computation can be consistently implemented in fermionic hardware such as Majorana nanowires and fermionic neutral atoms.

Title: Quantum recurrences and the arithmetic of Floquet dynamics
Authors: Amit Anand, Dinesh Valluri, Jack Davis, Shohini Ghose
Abstract: The Poincaré recurrence theorem shows that conservative systems in a bounded region of phase space eventually return arbitrarily close to their initial state after a finite amount of time. An analogous behavior occurs in certain quantum systems where quantum states can recur after sufficiently long unitary evolution, a phenomenon known as quantum recurrence. Periodically driven (i.e. Floquet) quantum systems in particular exhibit complex dynamics even in small dimensions, motivating the study of how interactions and Hamiltonian structure affect recurrence behavior. While most existing studies treat recurrence in an approximate, distance-based sense, here we address the problem of exact, state-independent recurrences in a broad class of finite-dimensional Floquet systems, spanning both integrable and non-integrable models. Leveraging techniques from algebraic field theory, we construct an arithmetic framework that identifies all possible recurrence times by analyzing the cyclotomic structure of the Floquet unitary's spectrum. This computationally efficient approach yields both positive results, enumerating all candidate recurrence times and definitive negative results, rigorously ruling out exact recurrences for given Hamiltonian parameters. We further prove that rational Hamiltonian parameters do not, in general, guarantee exact recurrence, revealing a subtle interplay between system parameters and long-time dynamics. Our findings sharpen the theoretical understanding of quantum recurrences, clarify their relationship to quantum chaos, and highlight parameter regimes of special interest for quantum metrology and control.

Title: Quantum statistics of single-mode radiation emitted by superradiant Dicke states
Authors: A. Yadav, D. D. Yavuz
Abstract: We study the quantum statistics of single-mode radiation emitted by an atomic ensemble when the ensemble is initially prepared in a superradiant Dicke state. We show that while the radiation is well approximated by the Glauber coherent state at early times in the evolution, the emission can be truly quantum at later times. In particular, one can observe a large amount of photon-number squeezing in the emission under certain conditions; even a Fock state can be produced. We discuss the quantum statistics of the emission for various parameters, including different initial conditions for the atomic ensemble. To obtain these results, we have developed a formalism where we are able to calculate the quantum statistics of the emission over long time-scales even when the number of atoms in the ensemble is quite large.

Title: Improving quantum communication rates with permutation-invariant codes
Authors: Sujeet Bhalerao, Felix Leditzky
Abstract: In this work we improve the quantum communication rates of various quantum channels of interest using permutation-invariant quantum codes. We focus in particular on parametrized families of quantum channels and aim to improve bounds on their quantum capacity threshold, defined as the lowest noise level at which the quantum capacity of the channel family vanishes. These thresholds are important quantities as they mark the noise level up to which faithful quantum communication is theoretically possible. Our method exploits the fact that independent and identically distributed quantum channels preserve any permutation symmetry present at the input. The resulting symmetric output states can be described succinctly using the representation theory of the symmetric and general linear groups, which we use to derive an efficient algorithm for computing the channel coherent information of a permutation-invariant code. Our approach allows us to evaluate coherent information values for a large number of channel copies, e.g., at least 100 channel copies for qubit channels. We apply this method to various physically relevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure channel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing channel. For each channel family we obtain improved lower bounds on their quantum capacities. For example, for the 2-Pauli and BB84 channel families we significantly improve the best known quantum capacity thresholds derived in [Fern, Whaley 2008]. These threshold improvements are achieved using a repetition code-like input state with non-orthogonal code states, which we further analyze in our representation-theoretic framework.

Title: Blockchain Network Analysis using Quantum Inspired Graph Neural Networks & Ensemble Models
Authors: Luigi D'Amico, Daniel De Rosso, Ninad Dixit, Raul Salles de Padua, Samuel Palmer, Samuel Mugel, Román Orús, Holger Eble, Ali Abedi
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of financial technology, the detection of illicit transactions within blockchain networks remains a critical challenge, necessitating robust and innovative solutions. This work proposes a novel approach by combining Quantum Inspired Graph Neural Networks (QI-GNN) with flexibility of choice of an Ensemble Model using QBoost or a classic model such as Random Forrest Classifier. This system is tailored specifically for blockchain network analysis in anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. Our methodology to design this system incorporates a novel component, a Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition layer within the graph neural network framework, enhancing its capability to process and analyze complex data structures efficiently. Our technical approach has undergone rigorous evaluation against classical machine learning implementations, achieving an F2 score of 74.8% in detecting fraudulent transactions. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired techniques, supplemented by the structural advancements of the CP layer, to not only match but potentially exceed traditional methods in complex network analysis for financial security. The findings advocate for a broader adoption and further exploration of quantum-inspired algorithms within the financial sector to effectively combat fraud.

Authors: M.I. Estrada-Delgado, Z. Blanco-Garcia
Abstract: This work introduces non-Hermitian position-dependent mass Hamiltonians characterized by complex ladder operators and real, equidistant spectra. By imposing the Heisenberg-Weyl algebraic structure as a constraint, we derive the corresponding potentials, ladder operators, and eigenfunctions. The method provides a systematic procedure for constructing exactly solvable models for arbitrary mass profiles. Specific cases are illustrated for quadratic, cosenoidal, and exponential mass functions.

Title: Entropy Measures for Transition Matrices in Random Systems
Authors: Zhaohui Chen, Rene Meyer, Zhuo-Yu Xian
Abstract: A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can be unbounded or fails to scale with system size.

Title: Survival and Detection of Symmetry-Protected Topology in Loop Quenches
Authors: Nicolò Forcellini, Miklós Horváth, Panagiotis Kotetes
Abstract: We explore a class of dynamical protocols - that we term loop quenches - which are tailored for the study of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) systems. In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus evading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium topology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we introduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes the equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for chiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe measurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question. Our protocol uncovers a direct dynamical signature of SPT phases and, most importantly, paves the way for a general diagnostic framework that can be extended to other symmetry classes and dimensions.

Title: Control of nonlinear Compton scattering in a squeezed vacuum
Authors: A. Di Piazza, K. Qu
Abstract: Electromagnetic radiation by accelerated charges is a fundamental process in physics. Here, we introduce a quantum-optical framework for controlling the emission of radiation of an electron in an intense laser field via squeezed vacuum states. By engineering the quantum fluctuations of the emission modes, we demonstrate that the probability of nonlinear Compton scattering can be significantly enhanced or suppressed through tunable squeezing amplitude and angle. Our predictions are experimentally accessible with current squeezing technologies, establishing a new paradigm for quantum control in high-intensity light-matter interactions.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensate sub-wavelength confinement via superoscillations
Authors: Dusty R. Lindberg, Gerard McCaul, Peisong Peng, Lev Kaplan, Diyar Talbayev, Denys I. Bondar
Abstract: Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in these lattices through \textit{superoscillations}. This generic wave phenomenon occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices.

Title: Ehrenfest Dynamics with Spontaneous Localization
Authors: Anderson A. Tomaz, Rafael S. Mattos, Saikat Mukherjee, Mario Barbatti
Abstract: We propose Ehrenfest Dynamics with Spontaneous Localization (SLED), a decoherence-corrected extension of Ehrenfest dynamics based on the Gisin-Percival quantum-state diffusion (QSD) equation. In SLED, the electronic wavefunction evolves stochastically in the adiabatic energy basis, producing trajectory-level localization. The trajectory ensemble reproduces a Lindblad-type propagation of the reduced electronic density matrix. This approach ensures linearity, trace preservation, and complete positivity, providing a physically consistent alternative to ad hoc decoherence corrections commonly adopted in mixed quantum-classical methods. Benchmark simulations on one-dimensional Tully models and multidimensional spin-boson Hamiltonians demonstrate that SLED reproduces electronic populations and captures the essential features of coherence decay. The tests, however, also revealed that accurate treatment will require generalizing the localization kernel controlling the electron-nucleus coupling strength, from a constant into a function of time and phase space coordinates. SLED is implemented in the newly developed Skitten program and will be integrated into Newton-X. While the present work serves as a proof of concept, SLED establishes a rigorous and extensible framework that bridges mixed quantum-classical dynamics with open quantum system theory.

Title: Phonon interference effects in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires
Authors: Chaitanya Arya, Johannes Trautvetter, Jose M. Sojo-Gordillo, Yashpreet Kaur, Valentina Zannier, Fabio Beltram, Tommaso Albrigi, Alicia Ruiz-Caridad, Lucia Sorba, Riccardo Rurali, Ilaria Zardo
Abstract: Fine-tuning the functional properties of nanomaterials is crucial for technological applications. Superlattices, characterized by periodic repetitions of two or more materials in different dimensions, have emerged as a promising area of investigation. We present a study of the phonon interference effect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp interfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity measurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice nanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a minimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to room temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from coherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed by surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is also observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab initio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculations. These findings provide insights into the wave-like and particle-like transport of phonons in superlattice nanowires and demonstrate the potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the superlattice structure.

Title: Foundational Structure of Local Amplitudes in Quantum Gravity
Authors: Charalampos Theofilis, Wolfgang Wieland
Abstract: There has been recently renewed interest in the quantisation of gravity by considering local subsystems on light-like hypersurfaces. The main purpose of this paper is to present a theory-independent perspective on these developments assuming only basic knowledge of quantum theory and general relativity. In addition, we present a top-down approach to constructing local amplitudes in causal diamonds. The fundamental building block is a slab of light-like geometry (e.g. a segment of a light cone embedded into spacetime). Each slab is a three-dimensional light-like hypersurface bounded by two cuts, its past and future corners. After briefly reviewing the timeless formalism of quantum theory, we equip each null slab a with a kinematical Hilbert space that factorizes into constituents associated to the three-dimensional interior and its two corners. Upon assuming the existence of vacuum states for the bulk and boundary symmetries and a fundamental projector onto physical states, we explain how to introduce local amplitudes by contracting boundary states according to the pattern of a causal diamond. Finally, we show that the resulting local transition amplitudes satisfy Ward identities and charge conservation for the underlying symmetries. The paper closes with a summary and discussion for how different approaches to quantum gravity can realise our proposal in practice.

Authors: G. Arduini, O. Buchmüller, T.A. Bud, S. Calatroni, O. Crespo-Lopez, A. Devienne, J. Ellis, T. Hakulinen, A. Infantino, D. Lafarge, A.P. Marion
Abstract: Building on the feasibility study in CERN-PBC Report-2018-002 (Arduini et al. 2018), this report supported by the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study Group describes the technical implementation of modifications to the PX46 shaft at LHC Point 4 during LS3 (June 2026 - June 2030) that would enable it to accommodate the installation and operation of a vertical long-baseline Atom Interferometer during Run 4 without affecting LHC operations. We specify in detail the necessary civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and design of a mobile elevator platform. Our comprehensive technical assessment identifies no fundamental obstacles or showstoppers to implementation. Refined cost estimates and a critical-path schedule confirm that, from formal approval, all interventions can be completed within a 1.5-year window. These preparations would ensure seamless, concurrent operation of the Atom Interferometer experiment and the HL-LHC, with all technical challenges successfully addressed through established engineering solutions.

Title: Pretty good state transfer in Grover walks on abelian Cayley graphs
Authors: Koushik Bhakta, Bikash Bhattacharjya
Abstract: In this paper, we study pretty good state transfer (PGST) in Grover walks on graphs. We consider transfer of quantum states that are localized at the vertices of a graph and we use Chebyshev polynomials to analyze PGST between such states. In general, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of PGST on graphs. We then focus our analysis on abelian Cayley graphs and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of PGST on such graphs. Consequently, we obtain a complete characterization of PGST on unitary Cayley graphs. Our results yield infinite families of graphs that exhibit PGST but fail to exhibit perfect state transfer.

Title: Toward the "platinum standard" of quantum chemistry on quantum computers: perturbative quadruple corrections in unitary coupled cluster theory
Authors: Zachary W. Windom, Luke Bertels, Daniel Claudino, Rodney J. Bartlett
Abstract: We propose a non-iterative, post hoc correction to the unitary coupled cluster theory with single, double, and triple excitations (UCCSDT) ansatz, which considers the leading-order effects of neglected quadruple excitations. We present two ways to derive this quadruples correction to UCCSDT, henceforth referred to as [Q-6], which leads to an improvement in the correlation energy shown to be correct through sixth-order in many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). A comparison between the UCC-based [Q-6] correction proposed in this work and analogous, "platinum" standard quadruples corrections proposed in conventional coupled cluster (CC) theory recognizes that [Q-6] is distinct from prior corrections since it is constructed entirely from internally connected components. Although Trotterized (t) and full operator variants of UCCSDT exhibit errors in scans of small molecule potential energy surfaces (PESs) that routinely exceed 1.6 mH, we find that t/UCCSDT[Q-6] is nevertheless able to achieve chemical accuracy as measured by the mean-unsigned error (MUE).

Title: Learning complexity of many-body quantum sign structures through the lens of Boolean Fourier analysis
Authors: Ilya Schurov, Anna Kravchenko, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, Andrey A. Bagrov, Tom Westerhout
Abstract: We study sign structures of the ground states of spin-$1/2$ magnetic systems using the methods of Boolean Fourier analysis. Previously it was shown that the sign structures of frustrated systems are of complex nature: specifically, neural networks of popular architectures lack the generalization ability necessary to effectively reconstruct sign structures in supervised learning settings. This is believed to be an obstacle for applications of neural quantum states to frustrated systems. In the present work, we develop an alternative language for the analysis of sign structures based on representing them as polynomial functions defined on the Boolean hypercube - an approach called Boolean Fourier analysis. We discuss the relations between the properties of the Boolean Fourier series and the learning complexity of sign structures, and demonstrate that such polynomials can potentially serve as variational ansätze for the complex sign structures that dramatically outperform neural networks in terms of generalization ability. While ansätze of this type cannot yet be directly used in the context of variational optimization, they indicate that the complexity of sign structures is not an insurmountable curse, and can potentially be learned with better designed NQS architectures. Finally, we show how augmenting data with Boolean functions can aid sign prediction by neural networks.

Title: Evaluation of a deliberate-practice informed supplemental intervention in graduate Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Michael E. Robbins, Guillaume M. Laurent, Eric W. Burkholder
Abstract: Despite the prevalence of physics education research literature related to problem solving, recent studies have illustrated that opportunities for ``authentic'' problem solving -- conceptualized as making decisions with limited information using one's physics knowledge -- are limited at both the graduate and undergraduate levels in physics curricula. Building on one of these studies, we designed a supplemental intervention for a graduate-level quantum mechanics course which scaffolded the practice of making some of these critical decisions using the conceptual framework of deliberate practice. Despite similar incentive structures as prior interventions focused on conceptual understanding in similar contexts, we did not measure any statistically significant improvement in students' problem solving skills following our intervention, though faculty members involved with the next course and written qualifying exams indicated the students showed better-than-usual conceptual understanding. We explore a number of potential explanations for this disconnect and suggest future avenues of research in this area.

Title: Characterizing Universal Gate Sets via Dihedral Benchmarking
Authors: Arnaud Carignan-Dugas, Joel J. Wallman, Joseph Emerson
Abstract: We describe a practical experimental protocol for robustly characterizing the error rates of non-Clifford gates associated with dihedral groups, including gates in SU(2) associated with arbitrarily small angle rotations. Our dihedral benchmarking protocol is a generalization of randomized benchmarking that relaxes the usual unitary 2-design condition. Combining this protocol with existing randomized benchmarking schemes enables an efficient means of characterizing universal gate sets for quantum information processing in a way that is independent of state-preparation and measurement errors. In particular, our protocol enables direct benchmarking of the $T$ gate (sometime called $\pi/8$-gate) even for the gate-dependent error model that is expected in leading approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmonics
Authors: Jay A. Berres, S. Ali Hassani Gangaraj, George W. Hanson
Abstract: We investigate entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons. Nonreciprocal systems are ideal for the enhancement, control, and preservation of entanglement due to the potential for unidirectional beam-like wave propagation, i.e., efficiently transporting photons from one emitter to another. Using a quantum master equation and three-dimensional Green's function analysis, we investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters dominantly interacting via electric current induced nonreciprocal plasmonic modes of a graphene waveguide. We use concurrence as a measure of entanglement. We show that nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons are a promising candidate to generate and mediate concurrence, where it is shown that there is good enhancement and control of entanglement over vacuum, which is beneficial for the broad applications of entanglement as a quantum resource. We believe our findings contribute to the development of quantum devices, enabling efficient and tunable entanglement between two-level systems, which is a central goal in quantum technologies.

Title: Addressing some common objections to generalized noncontextuality
Authors: David Schmid, John H. Selby, Robert W. Spekkens
Abstract: When should a given operational phenomenology be deemed to admit of a classical explanation? When it can be realized in a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. The case for answering the question in this fashion has been made in many previous works, and motivates research on the notion of generalized noncontextuality. Many criticisms and concerns have been raised, however, regarding the definition of this notion and of the possibility of testing it experimentally. In this work, we respond to some of the most common of these objections. One such objection is that the existence of a classical record of which laboratory procedure was actually performed in each run of an experiment implies that the operational equivalence relations that are a necessary ingredient of any proof of the failure of noncontextuality do not hold, and consequently that conclusions of nonclassicality based on these equivalences are mistaken. We explain why this concern in unfounded. Our response affords the opportunity for us to clarify certain facts about generalized noncontextuality, such as the possibility of having proofs of its failure based on a consideration of the subsystem structure of composite systems. Similarly, through our responses to each of the other objections, we elucidate some under-appreciated facts about the notion of generalized noncontextuality and experimental tests thereof.

Title: Every non-signalling channel is common-cause realizable
Authors: Paulo J. Cavalcanti, John H. Selby, Ana Belén Sainz
Abstract: In this work we show that the set of non-signalling resources of a locally-tomographic generalised probabilistic theory (GPT), such as quantum and classical theory, coincides with its set of GPT-common-cause realizable resources, where the common causes come from an associated GPT. From a causal perspective, this result provides a reason for, in the study of resource theories of common-cause processes, taking the non-signalling channels as the resources of the enveloping theory. This answers a critical open question in Ref.~\cite{schmid2020postquantum}. An immediate corollary of our result is that every non-signalling assemblage is realizable in a GPT, answering in the affirmative the question posed in Ref.~\cite{cavalcanti2022post}.

Title: A Quantum Approach For Reducing Communications in Classical Secure Computations with Long Outputs
Authors: Jiayu Zhang
Abstract: How could quantum cryptography help us achieve what are not achievable in classical cryptography? In this work we study the classical cryptographic problem that two parties would like to perform secure computations with long outputs. As a basic primitive and example, we first consider the following problem which we call secure function sampling with long outputs: suppose $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$ is a public, efficient classical function, where $m$ is big; Alice would like to sample $x$ from its domain and sends $f(x)$ to Bob; what Bob knows should be no more than $f(x)$ even if it behaves maliciously. Classical cryptography, like FHE and succinct arguments [Gen09,Kil92,HW15], allows us to achieve this task within communication complexity $O(n+m)$; could we achieve this task with communication complexity independent of $m$? In this work, we first design a quantum cryptographic protocol that achieves secure function sampling with approximate security, within $O(n)$ communication (omitting the dependency on the security parameter and error tolerance). We also prove the classical impossibility using techniques in [HW15], which means that our protocol indeed achieves a type of quantum advantage. Building on the secure function sampling protocol, we further construct protocols for general secure two-party computations [Yao86,GB01] with approximate security, with communication complexity only depending on the input length and the targeted security. In terms of the assumptions, we construct protocols for these problems assuming only the existence of collapsing hash functions [Unr16]; what's more, we also construct a classical-channel protocol for these problems additionally assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [BCMVV,BKVV].

Title: Formulations and Constructions of Remote State Preparation with Verifiability, with Applications
Authors: Jiayu Zhang
Abstract: Remote state preparation with verifiability (RSPV) is an important quantum cryptographic primitive [GV19,Zha22]. In this primitive, a client would like to prepare a quantum state (sampled or chosen from a state family) on the server side, such that ideally the client knows its full description, while the server holds and only holds the state itself. In this work we make several contributions on its formulations, constructions and applications. In more detail: - We first work on the definitions and abstract properties of the RSPV problem. We select and compare different variants of definitions [GV19,GMP22,Zha22], and study their basic properties (like composability and amplification). - We also study a closely related question of how to certify the server's operations (instead of solely the states). We introduce a new notion named remote operator application with verifiability (ROAV). We compare this notion with related existing definitions [SW87,MY04,MV21,NZ23] and study its abstract properties. - Building on the abstract properties and existing results [BGKPV23], we construct a series of new RSPV protocols. Our constructions not only simplify existing results [GV19] but also cover new state families, for example, states in the form of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle|x_0\rangle+|1\rangle|x_1\rangle)$. All these constructions rely only on the existence of weak NTCF [BKVV,AMR22], without additional requirements like the adaptive hardcore bit property [BCMVV,AMR22]. - As a further application, we show that the classical verification of quantum computations (CVQC) problem [ABEM,Mah18] could be constructed from assumptions on group actions [ADMP20]. This is achieved by combining our results on RSPV with group-action-based instantiation of weak NTCF [AMR22], and then with the quantum-gadget-assisted quantum verification protocol [FKD18].

Title: Distributing Arbitrary Quantum Graph States by Graph Transformation
Authors: Tingxiang Ji, Jianqing Liu, Zheshen Zhang
Abstract: Quantum graph state is a special class of nonlocal state among multiple quantum particles, underpinning several nonclassical and promising applications such as quantum computing and quantum secret sharing. Recently, establishing quantum graph states among physically distant nodes has gained increasing popularity owing to its potential in expanding current quantum applications in scale. Existing research on this topic relies on a two-step approach: first distributing low-dimension elementary entanglement to target nodes, and then fusing them into a high-dimension quantum graph state. However, most existing studies focus solely on minimizing costs (e.g., the number of elementary entanglements consumed) to entangle target nodes, while neglecting the structure of the final quantum graph state. This can easily result in weak system entanglement, jeopardizing the graph state under partial measurement or noises. In this paper, we aim to establish any arbitrary quantum graph states of strong entanglement structures at a much lower cost than the state of the art. The method is to search for and establish an alternative state to the target state that is of lowest cost in creation. Subsequently, we transform such an alternative state back to the target state via compressed single-qubit Clifford operations. To verify the performance of our developed algorithm, we conduct comprehensive simulations based on an open dataset containing all graph state structures up to 8 qubits. The results demonstrate fast algorithm convergence, an increased success probability in distributing any graph states, and $53.57\%$ saving in ERP cost compared with the state-of-the-art baseline.

Title: Learning topological states from randomized measurements using variational tensor network tomography
Authors: Yanting Teng, Rhine Samajdar, Katherine Van Kirk, Frederik Wilde, Subir Sachdev, Jens Eisert, Ryan Sweke, Khadijeh Najafi
Abstract: Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ansätze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.

Title: Semi-definite optimization of the measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels
Authors: Zixin Huang, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: The measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels find operational significance in quantum information theory as achievable error rates in hypothesis testing tasks. They are of interest in the near term, as they correspond to hybrid quantum-classical strategies with technological requirements far less challenging to implement than required by the most general strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we prove that these measured relative entropies can be calculated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming, by making use of variational formulas for the measured relative entropies of states and semi-definite representations of the weighted geometric mean and the operator connection of the logarithm. Not only do the semi-definite programs output the optimal values of the measured relative entropies of states and channels, but they also provide numerical characterizations of optimal strategies for achieving them, which is of significant practical interest for designing hypothesis testing protocols.

Title: Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: Instruction Set Architectures, Abstract Machine Models, and Applications

Abstract: Quantum computing with discrete variable (DV, qubit) hardware is approaching the large scales necessary for computations beyond the reach of classical computers. However, important use cases such as quantum simulations of physical models containing bosonic modes, and quantum error correction are challenging for DV-only systems. Separately, hardware containing native continuous-variable (CV, oscillator) systems has received attention as an alternative approach, yet the universal control of such systems is non-trivial. In this work, we show that hybrid CV-DV hardware offers a great advantage in meeting these challenges, offering a powerful computational paradigm that inherits the strengths of both DV and CV processors. We provide a pedagogical introduction to CV-DV systems and the multiple abstraction layers needed to produce a full software stack connecting applications to hardware. We present a variety of new hybrid CV-DV compilation techniques, algorithms, and applications, including the extension of quantum signal processing concepts to CV-DV systems and strategies to simulate systems of interacting spins, fermions, and bosons. To facilitate the development of hybrid CV-DV processor systems, we introduce formal Abstract Machine Models and Instruction Set Architectures -- essential abstractions that enable developers to formulate applications, compile algorithms, and explore the potential of current and future hardware for realizing fault-tolerant circuits, modules, and processors. Hybrid CV-DV quantum computations are beginning to be performed in superconducting, trapped ion, and neutral atom platforms, and large-scale experiments are set to be demonstrated in the near future. We present a timely and comprehensive guide to this relatively unexplored yet promising approach to quantum computation and providing an architectural backbone to guide future development.

Title: Adiabatic Dynamics of Entanglement
Authors: Einar Gabbassov, Achim Kempf
Abstract: We show that, during adiabatic evolution, any changes in entanglement can be attributed to a succession of avoided energy level crossings at which eigenvalues swap their eigenvectors. These swaps mediate the generation and redistribution of entanglement in multipartite systems. The efficiency of this redistribution depends on the narrowness of the avoided level crossings and thus constrains the speed of adiabatic evolution. Moreover, we relate the amount of entanglement involved to the ruggedness of the energy landscape, which directly affects the hardness of a computational problem. This enables an analysis of computational complexity and quantum advantage from the point of view of entanglement requirements. Applied to adiabatic quantum computation, our findings directly relate the computation's speed to its utilization of entanglement as a resource. The same principles extend to gate-based discretized adiabatic quantum algorithms, including those for Hamiltonian simulation and combinatorial optimization.

Title: Estimating quantum Markov chains using coherent absorber post-processing and pattern counting estimator
Authors: Federico Girotti, Alfred Godley, Mădălin Guţă
Abstract: We propose a two step strategy for estimating one-dimensional dynamical parameters of a quantum Markov chain, which involves quantum post-processing the output using a coherent quantum absorber and a "pattern counting'' estimator computed as a simple additive functional of the outcomes trajectory produced by sequential, identical measurements on the output units. We provide strong theoretical and numerical evidence that the estimator achieves the quantum Cramer-Rao bound in the limit of large output size. Our estimation method is underpinned by an asymptotic theory of translationally invariant modes (TIMs) built as averages of shifted tensor products of output operators, labelled by binary patterns. For large times, the TIMs form a bosonic algebra and the output state approaches a joint coherent state of the TIMs whose amplitude depends linearly on the mismatch between system and absorber parameters. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime the TIMs capture the full quantum Fisher information of the output state. While directly probing the TIMs' quadratures seems impractical, we show that the standard sequential measurement is an effective joint measurement of all the TIMs number operators; indeed, we show that counts of different binary patterns extracted from the measurement trajectory have the expected joint Poisson distribution. Together with the displaced-null methodology of J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 245304 2024 this provides a computationally efficient estimator which only depends on the total number of patterns. This opens the way for similar estimation strategies in continuous-time dynamics, expanding the results of Phys. Rev. X 13, 031012 2023.

Title: CTRQNets & LQNets: Continuous Time Recurrent and Liquid Quantum Neural Networks
Authors: Alejandro Antonio Mayorga, Alexander Yuan, Andrew Yuan, Tyler Wooldridge, Xiaodi Wang
Abstract: Neural networks have continued to gain prevalence in the modern era for their ability to model complex data through pattern recognition and behavior remodeling. However, the static construction of traditional neural networks inhibits dynamic intelligence. This makes them inflexible to temporal changes in data and unfit to capture complex dependencies. With the advent of quantum technology, there has been significant progress in creating quantum algorithms. In recent years, researchers have developed quantum neural networks that leverage the capabilities of qubits to outperform classical networks. However, their current formulation exhibits a static construction limiting the system's dynamic intelligence. To address these weaknesses, we develop a Liquid Quantum Neural Network (LQNet) and a Continuous Time Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (CTRQNet). Both models demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing quantum neural networks (QNNs), achieving accuracy increases as high as 40\% on CIFAR 10 through binary classification. We propose LQNets and CTRQNets might shine a light on quantum machine learning's black box.

Title: Tuning the terahertz response of liquids by creating polar many-body excitations
Authors: Gerard McCaul, Matthias Runge, Michael Woerner, Diyar Talbayev, Thomas Elsaesser, Denys I. Bondar
Abstract: A surprising result from the theory of quantum control is the degree to which the properties of a physical system can be manipulated. Both atomic and many-body solid state models admit the possibility of creating a 'driven imposter', in which the optical response of one material mimics that of a dynamically distinct system. Here we apply these techniques to polarons in polar liquids. Such quasiparticles describe solvated electrons interacting with many-body degrees of freedom of their environment. The polaron frequency, which depends on the electron concentration in the liquid, is controlled with a pump field, rendering the polaron frequency of three different liquids identical. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of 'polar impostorons', a so far purely theoretical phenomenon.

Title: Simulating and investigating various dynamic aspects of the $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model
Authors: Jiangchuan You, Ran Chen, Wanshun Li, Hui-hui Miao, Yuri Igorevich Ozhigov
Abstract: A basic model of hydrogen bonds related to $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$, which is adapted from the Jaynes--Cummings model, is suggested, and its different dynamic features are studied theoretically. In this model, the making and breaking of hydrogen bonds happen alongside the creation and destruction of phonons in the surrounding medium. A number of simplifying assumptions about the dynamics of the molecules involved are used. The rotating wave approximation is applied under consideration of the strong-coupling condition. Dissipative dynamics under the Markovian approximation is obtained through solving the quantum master equation -- Lindbladian. We obtain the probabilities of reaction channels involving hydrogen bonds based on the parameters of the external environment. Differences between unitary and dissipative evolutions are discussed. Consideration is given to the effects of all kinds of potential interactions and dissipation on evolution. Consideration is also given to the reverse processes (inflows) of dissipation. The results show that the magnitude changes of the interactions and dissipation have a slight effect on the formation of hydrogen bonds, but the variation of the inflows significantly affects the formation of hydrogen bonds. According to the findings, the dynamics of the $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model can be controlled by selectively choosing system parameters. The results will be used as a basis to extend the research to more complex chemical and biological models in the future.

Title: Scalable Quantum Simulations of Scattering in Scalar Field Theory on 120 Qubits
Authors: Nikita A. Zemlevskiy
Abstract: Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.

Title: Unified framework for bosonic quantum information encoding, resources and universality from superselection rules
Authors: Eloi Descamps, Astghik Saharyan, Adrien Chivet, Arne Keller, Pérola Milman
Abstract: A convenient way to represent quantum optical states is through the quadrature basis of single-modes of the field. This framework provides intuitive definitions for quasi-classical states, their phase-space representations, and enables the definition of a universal gate set. In this widely adopted representation of quantum optics, most pure states consist of coherent superpositions of photon-number states. However, this approach neglects the particle-number superselection rule - which prohibits coherence between states of differing photon numbers - and implicitly assumes a phase reference. We adopt a representation of quantum optical states that respects the superselection rule and revisit key tools and results in quantum optics and information encoding within quantum optics. This approach preserves the intuitive aspects of the traditional quadrature representation while unifying insights from quantum optics with those from symmetric spin-like and angular momentum systems. More than just an alternative representation, we show that a superselection rule-compliant framework provides a unified formalism for all bosonic encodings, from single-photon to continuous-variable encodings. This perspective allows for a precise characterization of the roles of Gaussian and non-Gaussian resources, as well as the interplay between modes and states in quantum universality and potential computational advantage.

Title: Generalized Numerical Framework for Improved Finite-Sized Key Rates with Rényi Entropy
Authors: Rebecca R.B. Chung, Nelly H.Y. Ng, Yu Cai
Abstract: Quantum key distribution requires tight and reliable bounds on the secret key rate to ensure robust security. This is particularly so for the regime of finite block sizes, where the optimization of generalized \R'enyi entropic quantities is known to provide tighter bounds on the key rate. However, such an optimization is often non-trivial, and the non-monotonicity of the key rate in terms of the \R'enyi parameter demands additional optimization to determine the optimal \R'enyi parameter as a function of block sizes. In this work, we present a tight analytical bound on the \R'enyi entropy in terms of the \R'enyi divergence and derive the analytical gradient of the \R'enyi divergence. This enables us to generalize existing state-of-the-art numerical frameworks for the optimization of the key rate. With this generalized framework, we show improvements in regimes of high loss and low block sizes, which are particularly relevant for long-distance satellite-based protocols.

Title: Time-resolved second-order autocorrelation function of parametric downconversion
Authors: D. B. Horoshko, S. Srivastava, F. Sośnicki, M. Mikołajczyk, M. Karpiński, B. Brecht, M. I. Kolobov
Abstract: We study a possibility of measuring the time-resolved second-order autocorrelation function of one of two beams generated in type-II parametric downconversion by means of temporal magnification of this beam, bringing its correlation time from the picosecond to the nanosecond scale, which can be resolved by modern photodetectors. We show that such a measurement enables one to infer directly the degree of global coherence of that beam, which is linked by a simple relation to the number of modes characterizing the entanglement between the two generated beams. We illustrate the proposed method by an example of photon pairs generated in a periodically poled KTP crystal with a symmetric group velocity matching for various durations of the pump pulse, resulting in different numbers of modes. Our theoretical model also shows that the magnified double-heralded autocorrelation function of one beam exhibits a local maximum around zero delay time, corresponding to photon bunching at a short time scale.

Title: Doubly-polylog-time-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation by a polylog-time parallel minimum-weight perfect matching decoder
Authors: Yugo Takada, Hayata Yamasaki
Abstract: Reducing space and time overheads of fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) has been receiving increasing attention as it is crucial for the development of quantum computers and also plays a fundamental role in understanding the feasibility and limitations of realizing quantum advantages. Shorter time overheads are particularly essential for demonstrating quantum computational speedups without compromising runtime advantages. However, surpassing the conventional polylogarithmic (polylog) scaling of time overheads has remained a significant challenge, since it requires addressing all potential bottlenecks, including the nonzero runtime of classical computation for decoding in practical implementations. In this work, we construct a protocol that achieves FTQC with doubly polylog time overhead while maintaining the conventional polylog space overhead. The key to our approach is the development of a highly parallelizable minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, which achieves a polylog parallel runtime in terms of the code size while providing theoretical guarantees on threshold existence and overhead bounds. Our protocol integrates this decoder with a topological-code protocol that incorporates single-shot decoding for efficient syndrome extraction; furthermore, we concatenate this with the concatenated Steane codes to guarantee the existence of the threshold while avoiding a backlog problem, enabling us to achieve doubly polylog time overheads even when accounting for the decoder's runtime. These results suggest the feasibility of surpassing the conventional polylog-time-overhead barrier, opening a new frontier in low-overhead FTQC.

Title: Towards a Digital Twin of Noisy Quantum Computers: Calibration-Driven Emulation of Transmon Qubits
Authors: Ronny Müller, Maximilian Zanner, Mika Schielein, Martin Rüfenacht, David Rabanus, Eduardo Schätzle, Kristel Michielsen, Ashwin Karnad, Dennis Willsch, Elise Jennings, Cica Gustiani
Abstract: We develop a parametric error model to construct a digital twin of a superconducting transmon qubit device. The model parameters are extracted from hardware calibration data and supplementary benchmarking circuits, providing a dynamic, system-specific representation of noise and gate imperfections. Given the strong dependence of qubit performance on calibration procedures, our approach captures real-time device fluctuations. By incorporating predominant noise sources derived from underlying physical processes, we enhance the emulation's accuracy while reducing the data required for model fitting. Finally, we validate our model by comparing its predictions with experimental results from a 5-qubit QPU, achieving a mean total variation distance of 0.15 between the shot distributions. This digital twin can be leveraged for predictive performance analysis, error mitigation strategies, and the optimization of quantum protocols, contributing to more reliable quantum computations.

Title: A Fully Device-Independent Ternary Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Based on the Impossible Colouring Game
Authors: Aniket Basak, Rajeet Ghosh, Rohit Sarma Sarkar, Chandan Goswami, Avishek Adhikari
Abstract: We propose a Ternary Fully Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (TFDIQKD) protocol based on the two-party Impossible Colouring pseudo-telepathy game, utilizing maximally entangled qutrit states to enable secure key generation between distant parties. The protocol harnesses Bell inequality violations that arise from contextuality in the Kochen-Specker theorem, thereby offering a quantum advantage in a task that is classically impossible and eliminating reliance on assumptions about the internal functioning of quantum devices. A specially designed qutrit quantum circuit is used for state preparation. Security and device independence are rigorously analyzed within a composable framework, employing Bell-inequality violations, smooth min-entropy, von Neumann entropy, and Shannon entropy. The protocol achieves optimal key rates in the ideal case and maintains security under significant noise, with a finite-key analysis that supports its practical viability. Overall, the protocol operates within an adequate security framework and demonstrates an improved key generation rate compared to standard quantum key distribution schemes, highlighting the potential of high-dimensional quantum systems for secure communication.

Abstract: Quantum simulation has emerged as a powerful framework for investigating complex many - body phenomena. A key requirement for emulating these dynamics is the realization of fully controllable quantum systems enabling various spin interactions. Yet, quantum simulators remain constrained in the types of attainable interactions. Here we demonstrate experimental realization of multiple microwave - engineered spin interactions in superconducting quantum circuits. By precisely controlling the native XY interaction and microwave drives, we achieve tunable spin Hamiltonians including: (i) XYZ spin models with continuously adjustable parameters, (ii) transverse - field Ising systems, and (iii) Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya interacting systems. Our work expands the toolbox for analogue - digital quantum simulation, enabling exploration of a wide range of exotic quantum spin models.

Title: A Complexity-Based Approach to Quantum Observable Equilibration
Authors: Marcos G. Alpino, Tiago Debarba, Reinaldo O. Vianna, André T. Cesário
Abstract: We investigate the role of a statistical complexity measure to assign equilibration in isolated quantum systems. While unitary dynamics preserve global purity, expectation values of observables often exhibit equilibration-like behavior, raising the question of whether complexity can track this process. In addition to examining observable equilibration, we extend our analysis to study how the complexity of the quantum states evolves, providing insight into the transition from initial coherence to equilibrium. We define a classical statistical complexity measure based on observable entropy and deviation from equilibrium, which captures the dynamical progression towards equilibration and effectively distinguishes between complex and non-complex trajectories. In particular, our measure is sensitive to non-complex dynamics, such as the quasi-periodic behavior exhibited by low effective dimension initial states, where the systems explore a limited region of the Hilbert space as they oscillate in an informational coherence-preserving manner. These findings are supported by numerical simulations of an Ising-like non-integrable Hamiltonian spin-chain model. Our work provides new insight into the emergence of equilibrium behavior from unitary dynamics and advances complexity as a meaningful tool in the study of the emergence of classicality in microscopic systems.

Title: Non-Perturbative Topological Gadgets for Many-Body Coupling
Authors: David Headley, Nicholas Chancellor
Abstract: Continuous-time quantum hardware implementations generally lack the native capability to implement high-order terms that would facilitate efficient compilation of quantum algorithms. This limitation has, in part, motivated the development of perturbative gadgets -- multi-qubit constructions used to effect a desired Hamiltonian using engineered low-energy subspaces of a larger system constructed using simpler, usually two-body, primitives. In this work, we demonstrate how a class of non-perturbative gadgets can produce high-order multi-body interactions by taking advantage of the odd-even properties of topological defect subspaces. The simplest example is based on domain-wall defects forming an effective Ising spin-chain based on three-body coupling with linear connectivity, alongside three-, or five-body driving terms depending on the intended use. Although this will be the main focus of the paper due to conceptual simplicity, there exist systems constructed with only two-body couplings where the boundaries determine whether there are an odd or even number of defects, namely ice-like systems which may yield more complex gadget-like constructions.

Title: Toward Scalable Quantum Compilation for Modular Architecture: Qubit Mapping and Reuse via Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Sokea Sang, Leanghok Hour, Youngsun Han
Abstract: Modular quantum architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling quantum computing systems by connecting multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). However, this approach introduces significant challenges due to costly inter-core operations between chips and quantum state transfers, which contribute to noise and quantum decoherence. This paper presents QARMA, a novel Qubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for Modular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that incorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an attention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal qubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core communications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a transformer-based encoder that captures both the global circuit structure and local qubit interactions and (2) a dynamic qubit reuse compilation mechanism that leverages mid-circuit measurement and reset operations to reduce inter-operation and qubit requirements. Our experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular architecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to 100% (on average 86%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger circuits without reuse. Against traditional modular qubit mapping, our approach achieves 97-100% reduction in inter-core operation. The proposed methods advance quantum circuit compilation techniques and enable the execution of more extensive quantum algorithms on resource-constrained modular quantum systems, contributing to the growing body of research on scalable quantum computing architectures.

Title: Fiber transmission of cluster states via multi-level time-bin encoding
Authors: Philip Rübeling, Robert Johanning, Jan Heine, Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Michael Kues
Abstract: The next generation of telecommunication networks will rely on the transmission of complex quantum states to enable secure and transformative information processing, utilizing entanglement and superposition. Cluster states - multipartite entangled states that retain entanglement under local measurements - are a vital resource for quantum networking applications such as blind photonic quantum computing, quantum state teleportation and all-photonic quantum repeaters. However, the transmission of cluster states over optical fiber has remained elusive with previous approaches. Here, we demonstrate the first transmission of a four-qubit cluster state over 25 km of single-mode fiber by using a two-photon multi-level time-bin encoding. We directly generate the state by exploiting coherent control of a parametric generation process, rendering a resource-intensive controlled-phase gate obsolete. To enable efficient and reconfigurable projective measurements on the multi-level time-bin encoded state, we introduce chirped-pulse modulation and implement the first time-bin beam splitter, allowing us to certify genuine multipartite entanglement and to demonstrate one-way computing operations. Our approach enables the transmission of complex quantum states over long-distance fibers, permitting the implementation of multipartite protocols and laying the foundation for large-scale quantum resource networks.

Title: Free-Fermion Dynamics with Measurements: Topological Classification and Adaptive Preparation of Topological States
Authors: Asadullah Bhuiyan, Haining Pan, Chao-Ming Jian
Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and (2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime \textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in \textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in ${\cal O}(1)$ circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit protocol to coherent noise.

Title: Quantum and classical algorithms for SOCP based on the multiplicative weights update method
Authors: M. Isabel Franco Garrido, Alexander M. Dalzell, Sam McArdle
Abstract: We give classical and quantum algorithms for approximately solving second-order cone programs (SOCPs) based on the multiplicative weights (MW) update method. Our approach follows the MW framework previously applied to semidefinite programs (SDPs), of which SOCP is a special case. We show that the additional structure of SOCPs can be exploited to give better runtime with SOCP-specific algorithms. For an SOCP with $m$ linear constraints over $n$ variables partitioned into $r \leq n$ second-order cones, our quantum algorithm requires $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{r}\gamma^5 + \sqrt{m}\gamma^4)$ (coherent) queries to the underlying data defining the instance, where $\gamma$ is a scale-invariant parameter proportional to the inverse precision. This nearly matches the complexity of solving linear programs (LPs), which are a less expressive subset of SOCP. It also outperforms (especially if $n \gg r$) the naive approach that applies existing SDP algorithms onto SOCPs, which has complexity $\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{4}(n + \gamma \sqrt{n} + \sqrt{m}))$. Our classical algorithm for SOCP has complexity $\widetilde{O}(n\gamma^4 + m \gamma^6)$ in the sample-and-query model.

Title: Dynamical and Emission Properties of Quantum Emitters driven by Ultra-Short Laser Pulses
Authors: Juan E. Ardila-García, Juan S. Sierra-Jaraba, Herbert Vinck-Posada
Abstract: The development of high-performance quantum technologies relies on the ability to prepare the quantum states of solid-state emitters with high fidelity while cleanly separating the emitted photons from the driving field. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical comparison of three single-pulse coherent control protocols: resonant Rabi oscillations, adiabatic rapid passage (ARP), and notch-filtered ARP (NARP). To establish an ideal performance baseline, we first map the parameter spaces for each protocol in a closed system, identifying the regions of robust population inversion. We then use a Lindblad master equation to compute the time-resolved emission spectra in the presence of decoherence. Our results show that while all three schemes can generate identical, transform-limited Lorentzian photons, NARP uniquely combines the high-fidelity robustness of adiabatic passage with intrinsic spectral separability. Our findings, which align with the work on NARP by Wilbur et al., establish a clear design framework for engineering the next generation of quantum light sources.

Title: Is the Full Power of Gaussian Boson Sampling Required for Simulating Vibronic Spectra Using Photonics?

Abstract: Simulating vibronic spectra is a central task in physical chemistry, offering insight into important properties of molecules. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that photonic platforms based on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) are capable of performing these simulations. However, whether an actual GBS approach is required depends on the molecule under investigation. To develop a better understanding on the requirements for simulating vibronic spectra, we explore connections between theoretical approximations in physical chemistry and their photonic counterparts. Mapping these approximations into photonics, we show that for certain molecules the GBS approach is unnecessary. We place special emphasis on the linear coupling approximation, which in photonics corresponds to sampling from multiple coherent states. By implementing this approach in experiments, we demonstrate improved similarities over previously reported GBS results for formic acid and identify the particular attributes that a molecule must exhibit for this, and other approximations, to be valid. These results highlight the importance in forming deeper connections between traditional methods and photonic approaches.

Title: Microscopic analysis of above-threshold ionization driven by squeezed light
Authors: J. Rivera-Dean, P. Stammer, C. Figueira de Morisson Faria, M. Lewenstein
Abstract: Above-threshold ionization (ATI) is a strong-field-driven process where electrons absorb more photons than required for ionization. While ATI dynamics and outputs are well-understood when driven by classical, perfectly coherent light, the recent development of non-classical light sources for strong-field phenomena has spurred interest in their effect on the involved electron dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic quantum optical theory describing ATI under the influence of strong squeezed light. We observe that squeezed light significantly enhances the coupling between light and matter, making their mutual backaction more important than under classical driving. This backaction profoundly impacts the electronic ionization times, as well as the non-classical properties of the joint electron-light state. This results in pronounced entanglement features, both immediately after ionization, and at later times. These entanglement features are reflected in the properties of the quantum optical state of the driving field revealing notable non-Gaussian features that depend on both, the amount of squeezing, and the number of ionization events occurring during the interaction.

Title: Quantum Reservoir GAN
Authors: Hikaru Wakaura
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is known as one of the promising applications of quantum computers. Many types of quantum machine learning methods have been released, such as Quantum Annealer, Quantum Neural Network, Variational Quantum Algorithms, and Quantum Reservoir Computers. They can work consuming far less energy for networks of equivalent size. Quantum Reservoir Computers, in particular, have no limit on the size of input data. However, their accuracy is not enough for practical use, and the effort to improve accuracy is mainly focused on hardware improvements. Therefore, we propose the approach from software called Quantum Reservoir Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which uses Quantum Reservoir Computers as a generator of GAN. We performed the generation of handwritten single digits and monochrome pictures on the CIFAR10 dataset. As a result, Quantum Reservoir GAN is confirmed to be more accurate than Quantum GAN, Classical Neural Network, and ordinary Quantum Reservoir Computers.

Title: The vast world of quantum advantage
Authors: Hsin-Yuan Huang, Soonwon Choi, Jarrod R. McClean, John Preskill
Abstract: The quest to identify quantum advantages lies at the heart of quantum technology. While quantum devices promise extraordinary capabilities, from exponential computational speedups to unprecedented measurement precision, distinguishing genuine advantages from mere illusions remains a formidable challenge. In this endeavor, quantum theorists are like prophets attempting to foretell the future, yet the boundary between visionary insight and unfounded fantasy is perilously thin. In this perspective, we examine our mathematical tools for navigating the vast world of quantum advantages across computation, learning, sensing, and communication. We explore five keystone properties: predictability, typicality, robustness, verifiability, and usefulness that define an ideal quantum advantage, and envision what new quantum advantages could arise in a future with ubiquitous quantum technology. We prove that some quantum advantages are inherently unpredictable using classical resources alone, suggesting a landscape far richer than what we can currently foresee. While mathematical rigor remains our indispensable guide, the ultimate power of quantum technologies may emerge from advantages we cannot yet conceive.

Title: Positive-divisibility of Subsystems in Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Anumita Mukhopadhyay, Praggnyamita Ghosh, Shibdas Roy
Abstract: It is known that the existence of memory effect can revive quantum correlations in open system dynamics. In this regard, the backflow of information from environment to the system can be identified with Complete Positive (CP) indivisibility as well as Positive (P) indivisibility criteria. It is also known that if a quantum system is CP-divisible, it can also have memory effect which can be witnessed by P-indivisibility. Here, we have explored the relation of P-divisibility with unitality condition of noise channels, showing that a unital channel is P-divisible. We have shown how a system channel and its environment need to be both P-divisible, but cannot be both P-indivisible, provided the system-environment joint quantum state evolves unitarily. We have also established our results using three unitaries acting on different sets of states. In particular, due to backflow of information from the environment, quantumness of a system can increase, as shown for an example of the three-qubit W state.

Title: Quantum-centric simulation of hydrogen abstraction by sample-based quantum diagonalization and entanglement forging

Abstract: The simulation of electronic systems is an anticipated application for quantum-centric computers, i.e. heterogeneous architectures where classical and quantum processing units operate in concert. An important application is the computation of radical chain reactions, including those responsible for the photodegradation of composite materials used in aerospace engineering. Here, we compute the activation energy and reaction energy for hydrogen abstraction from 2,2-diphenyldipropane, used as a minimal model for a step in a radical chain reaction. Calculations are performed using a superconducting quantum processor of the IBM Heron family and classical computing resources. To this end, we combine a qubit-reduction technique called entanglement forging (EF) with sample based quantum diagonalization (SQD), a method that projects the Schrödinger equation into a subspace of configurations sampled from a quantum device. In conventional quantum simulations, a qubit represents a spin-orbital. In contrast, EF maps a qubit to a spatial orbital, reducing the required number of qubits by half. We provide a complete derivation and a detailed description of the combined EF and SQD approach, and we assess its accuracy across active spaces of varying sizes.

Title: Superradiant Phase Transition and Statistical Properties in Dicke-Stark Model
Authors: Weilin Wang, Ronghai Liu, Fangcheng Qiu, Mingshu Zhao, Jinying Ma, Zhanyuan Yan
Abstract: In this study, the energy spectrum and thermal equilibrium states of the finite-size Dicke-Stark model were numerically obtained within the extended coherent state space by solving the dressed master equation for strongly coupled light-atom systems. The critical point of the superradiant phase transition in the infinite-size Dicke-Stark model was analytically derived using the mean-field approach and confirmed with numerical calculation. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay two-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the finite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases, the light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching and then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and minimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding coupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and spin squeezing. As temperature rises, entanglement gradually diminishes, while strong coupling facilitates the preservation of entanglement in the system state. Atom-spin squeezing spin squeezing is highly sensitive to temperature and vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena in Dicke-Stark systems.

Title: Finite-dimensional approximations of generalized squeezing
Authors: Sahel Ashhab, Felix Fischer, Davide Lonigro, Daniel Braak, Daniel Burgarth
Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.

Title: Bridging Theory and Practice in Quantum Game Theory: Optimized Implementation of the Battle of the Sexes with Error Mitigation on NISQ Hardware
Authors: Germán Díaz Agreda, Carlos Andres Duran Paredes, Mateo Buenaventura Samboni, Jhon Alejandro Andrade, Sebastián Andrés Cajas Ordoñez
Abstract: Implementing quantum game theory on real hardware is challenging due to noise, decoherence, and limited qubit connectivity, yet such demonstrations are essential to validate theoretical predictions. We present one of the first full experimental realizations of the Battle of the Sexes game under the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) framework on IBM Quantum's ibm sherbrooke superconducting processor. Four quantum strategies (I, H, $R(\pi/4)$, $R(\pi)$) were evaluated across 31 entanglement values $\gamma \in [0, \pi]$ using 2048 shots per configuration, enabling a direct comparison between analytical predictions and hardware execution. To mitigate noise and variability, we introduce a Guided Circuit Mapping (GCM) method that dynamically selects qubit pairs and optimizes routing based on real-time topology and calibration data. The analytical model forecasts up to $108\%$ payoff improvement over the classical equilibrium, and despite hardware-induced deviations, experimental results with GCM preserve the expected payoff trends within $3.5\%$-$12\%$ relative error. These findings show that quantum advantages in strategic coordination can persist under realistic NISQ conditions, providing a pathway toward practical applications of quantum game theory in multi-agent, economic, and distributed decision-making systems.

Abstract: The creation of large-scale, high-fidelity quantum computers is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but also provides increasingly robust proofs of quantum computational advantage (QCA) in the presence of unavoidable noise and the dynamic competition with classical algorithm improvements. To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take > $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\mu$s to produce a sample. This work establishes a new frontier of QCA and paves the way to fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing hardware.

Title: Coherent control of interacting solid-state spins below the diffraction limit
Authors: Haitong Xu, Mehmet T. Uysal, Lukasz Dusanowski, Adam Turflinger, Ashwin K. Boddeti, Joseph Alexander, Jeff D. Thompson
Abstract: Optically addressed atomic defects in the solid-state are widely used as single-photon sources and memories for quantum network applications. The solid-state environment allows for a high density of electron and nuclear spins with the potential to form registers for coherent information processing. However, it is challenging to reliably address individual spins at nanometer separations where interactions are large. Rare-earth ions offer a unique solution, as their narrow homogeneous optical linewidth allows frequency-domain resolution of a large number of emitters without regard to their spatial separation. In this work, we realize coherent optical and spin control of a pair of interacting Er$^{3+}$ ions, together with a nearby nuclear spin ancilla. We demonstrate two-qubit electron-electron gates and use them to perform repeated quantum non-demolition measurements on one of the Er$^{3+}$ ions. We also demonstrate electron-nuclear gates to allow coherent storage and retrieval of qubit information in a nuclear spin, and show that the nuclear spin coherence survives readout of the electron spin. These techniques can be readily scaled to larger numbers of electron and nuclear spins, paving the way for massively multiplexed quantum network nodes.

Title: Forecasting steam mass flow in power plants using the parallel hybrid network
Authors: Andrii Kurkin, Jonas Hegemann, Mo Kordzanganeh, Alexey Melnikov
Abstract: Efficient and sustainable power generation is a crucial concern in the energy sector. In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first parallel hybrid quantum-classical architecture deployed on a real-world power-plant dataset, illustrating how near-term quantum resources can already augment classical analytics in the energy sector.

Title: The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.

Title: Enhanced metrology based on flipping trajectory of cold Rydberg gases
Authors: Ya-Jun Wang, Jun Zhang, Zheng-Yuan Zhang, Shi-Yao Shao, Qing Li, Han-Chao Chen, Yu Ma, Tian-Yu Han, Qi-Feng Wang, Jia-Dou Nan, Yi-Ming Yin, Dong-Yang Zhu, Qiao-Qiao Fang, Chao Yu, Xin Liu, Guang-Can Guo, Bang Liu, Li-Hua Zhang, Dong-Sheng Ding, Bao-Sen Shi
Abstract: The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.

Title: Analytic bulk-edge connection in circular-symmetric models
Authors: Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: We propose a systematic analysis of the eigenfunctions of two-band systems in two dimensions with a circular edge. Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations. Our analytic approach is compared with the topological bulk-edge correspondence, which is based on the Chern number of the bulk.

Title: Untwisted and Twisted Rényi Negativities: Toward a Rényi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems
Authors: Fo-Hong Wang, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, Rényi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving Rényi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true Rényi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted Rényi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent Rényi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.

Title: Hydrogen Atom in a Fuzzy Spherical Cavity
Authors: Matej Hrmo, Samuel Kováčik, Patrik Rusnák, Juraj Tekel
Abstract: The fuzzy onion model formed by connecting a set of concentric fuzzy spheres of increasing radius is motivated by studies of quantum space but can also be used to study standard physics. The main feature of the model is that functions in three-dimensional space -- like scalar fields or wavefunctions -- are expressed in terms of Hermitian matrices of a certain structure. Relevant equations are then matrix equations, and some problems, such as searching for the energy spectrum for fixed quantum numbers $(l,m)$, can be expressed as an eigenvalue problem. We show how this simple approach can reproduce the results of other studies analyzing the hydrogen atom in a spherical cavity. We also test the effect of the short-distance quantum structure of the space on these solutions -- not looking for the phenomenological consequences, as the scale of quantum space is many orders below the order of the Bohr radius, but to understand the effect of quantum space in general. We observe a set of solutions without a classical counterpart which have been suggested also in a former theoretical study.

Title: The Birth of Quantum Mechanics: A Historical Study Through the Canonical Papers
Authors: Eren Volkan Küçük
Abstract: This paper explores the historical development of the theory of quantum mechanics between 1900 and 1927 by chronological examination of the foundational papers and ideas. Beginning with Planck's introduction of energy quantisation in blackbody radiation, we follow the emergence of Einstein's light quanta hypothesis, Bohr's atomic model, and the statistical implications of indistinguishable particles. Special emphasis is placed on the transition from the Old Quantum Theory to modern quantum mechanics, particularly through Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schrödinger's wave mechanics. This study aims to provide a structured historical account, offering insights into the conceptual transformations that led to quantum mechanics while making the development accessible to physicists, historians of science, and advanced students interested in the origins of modern quantum theory.

Title: Spin models from nonlinear cellular automata
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Stephen Powell, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study classical and quantum spin models derived from one-dimensional cellular automata (CA) with nonlinear update rules, focusing on rules 30, 54 and 201. We argue that the classical models, defined such that their ground states correspond to allowed trajectories of the CA, are frustrated and can be described in terms of local defect variables. Including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state phase diagram and quantum phase transitions. We show that the nonlinearity of the CA rule leads to a quantum order-by-disorder mechanism, which selects a particular (rule-dependent) spatial structure for small transverse fields, with spontaneous breaking of the translation symmetry in some cases. Using numerical results for larger fields, we also observe a first-order quantum phase transition into a quantum paramagnet, as in previous studies of spin models based on linear CA rules.

Title: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation of quantum emitters as a probe of local refractive index changes
Authors: Yevhenii Morozov, Anatoliy Lapchuk
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in photonic integrated circuit (PIC) cavities offer a scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). Unlike traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach uses lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, CMOS-compatible modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance regime with linear, high sensitivity to small perturbations. Using silicon PICs as an example, we show detection limits down to 10^{-9} RIU for Q = 10^5-10^7 cavities, matching or exceeding plasmonic and microresonator sensors with simpler instrumentation. Long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon allow sub-nanosecond shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of silicon-based quantum emitters remains unproven, the concept is generic and applicable to other PIC platforms, including diamond-, silicon nitride-, and silicon carbide-based systems where such operation is established.

Title: SUSY hierarchies of Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians with different detuning parameters
Authors: İsmail Burak Ateş, Şengül Kuru, Javier Negro
Abstract: The aim of this work is to show how supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics can be applied to the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian of quantum optics. These SUSY transformations connect pairs of Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians characterized by different detuning parameters as well as Jaynes-Cummings to anti-Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians. Therefore, JC Hamiltonians can be classified in hierarchies or sequences which are connected through SUSY transformations. As a byproduct, the symmetries of JC Hamiltonians are found as well as the special case of a sequence of resonant-like interacting systems having the form of a simple shape invariant JC Hamiltonian hierarchy.

Title: Parasitic RF-SQUIDs in superconducting qubits due to wirebonds
Authors: B. Berlitz, E. Daum, S. Deck, A.V. Ustinov, J. Lisenfeld
Abstract: Superconducting qubits show great promise to realize practical quantum computers from micro-fabricated integrated circuits. However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducing circuits.

Title: Zitterbewegung, momentum and spin dynamics of electromagnetic wave in linear dielectric medium
Authors: Adam B. Cahaya
Abstract: The momentum of light in dielectric media has been a century-long controversy that continues to attract significant interest. In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index $n$, the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of $n$ according to Max Abraham, and larger by the same factor according to Hermann Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung-like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wavepacket motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.

Title: Time inversion symmetry in the Dirac and Schrödinger-Pauli theories
Authors: R. Winkler, U. Zülicke
Abstract: The Schrödinger-Pauli theory is generally believed to give a faithful representation of the nonrelativistic and weakly relativistic limit of the Dirac theory. However, the Schrödinger-Pauli theory is fundamentally incomplete in its account of broken time inversion symmetry, e.g., in magnetically ordered systems. In the Dirac theory of the electron, magnetic order breaks time inversion symmetry even in the nonrelativistic limit, whereas time inversion symmetry is effectively preserved in the Schrödinger-Pauli theory in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In the Dirac theory, the Berry curvature $1/(2m^2c^2)$ is thus an intrinsic property of nonrelativistic electrons similar to the well-known spin magnetic moment $e\hbar/(2m)$, while this result is missed by the nonrelativistic or weakly relativistic Schrödinger-Pauli equation. In ferromagnetically ordered systems, the intrinsic Berry curvature yields a contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity independent of spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Measures of Systems of Oscillators and Properties of Trajectories
Authors: Vsevolod Sakbaev (1), Igor Volovich (1) ((1) Steklov Mathematical Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences)
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of trajectories in harmonic oscillator systems equipped with a point, absolutely continuous, or singular measure. As demonstrated in [30], infinite-dimensional linear flows of countable oscillator systems exhibit a new class of trajectory behavior. Specifically, these trajectories are non-periodic, and their projections onto any four-dimensional symplectic subspace fail to be dense in the corresponding projection of the invariant torus. Such trajectories do not arise in finite-dimensional systems, are non-generic for countable oscillator systems, but become generic in the continual case. We prove that for a countable harmonic oscillator system, every point on a non-degenerate invariant torus is a non-wandering point of the flow. In contrast, for a continual system with an absolutely continuous measure, all points on such a torus are wandering. Furthermore, for continual systems with a singular measure, we establish sufficient conditions on the measure and torus that rule out the existence of both transitive trajectories and non-wandering points. As an application, we exhibit a class of singular Bernoulli measures satisfying these conditions.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning in Transportation: A Case Study of Pedestrian Stress Modelling
Authors: Bara Rababah, Bilal Farooq
Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

Title: Floquet Theory of lattice electrons coupled to an off-resonant cavity
Authors: Jules Sueiro, Gian Marcello Andolina, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We use Floquet theory and the High-Frequency expansion to derive an effective Hamiltonian for electrons coupled to an off resonant cavity mode, either in its vacuum or driven by classical light. For vacuum fields, we show that long-range hopping and cavity-mediated interactions arise as a direct consequence of quantum fluctuations. As an application, this method is applied to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion. Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior dependent on the cavity parameters.

Title: Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering
Authors: Kazuki Doi, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.

Title: Generalized Krylov Complexity
Authors: Amin Faraji Astaneh, Niloofar Vardian
Abstract: We extend the concept of Krylov complexity to include general unitary evolutions involving multiple generators. This generalization enables us to formulate a framework for generalized Krylov complexity, which serves as a measure of the complexity of states associated with continuous symmetries within a model. Furthermore, we investigate scenarios where different directions of transformation lead to varying degrees of complexity, which can be compared to geometric approaches to understanding complexity, such as Nielsen complexity. In this context, we introduce a generalized orthogonalization algorithm and delineate its computational framework, which is structured as a network of orthogonal blocks rather than a simple linear chain. Additionally, we provide explicit evaluations of specific illustrative examples to demonstrate the practical application of this framework.

Title: Self-adjoint realizations of higher-order squeezing operators
Authors: Felix Fischer, Daniel Burgarth, Davide Lonigro
Abstract: Higher-order squeezing captures non-Gaussian features of quantum light by probing moments of the field beyond the variance, and is associated with operators involving nonlinear combinations of creation and annihilation operators. Here we study a class of operators of the form $\xi (a^†)^ka^l+\xi^\ast (a^†)^la^k+f(a^†a)$, which arise naturally in the analysis of higher-order quantum fluctuations. The operators are defined on the linear span of Fock states. We show that the essential self-adjointness of these operators depends on the asymptotics of the real-valued function $f(n)$ at infinity. In particular, pure higher-order squeezing operators ($k\geq3$, $l=0$, and $f(n)=0$) are not essentially self-adjoint, but adding a properly chosen term $f(a^†a)$, like a Kerr term, can have a regularizing effect and restore essential self-adjointness. In the non-self-adjoint regime, we compute the deficiency indices and classify all self-adjoint extensions. Our results provide a rigorous operator-theoretic foundation for modeling and interpreting higher-order squeezing in quantum optics, and reveal interesting connections with the Birkhoff-Trjitzinsky theory of asymptotic expansions for recurrence relations.
