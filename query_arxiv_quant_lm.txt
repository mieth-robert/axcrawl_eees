Title: Microscopic Dynamics of False Vacuum Decay in the $2+1$D Quantum Ising Model
Authors: Umberto Borla, Achilleas Lazarides, Christian Groß, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: False vacuum decay, which is understood to happen through bubble nucleation, is a prominent phenomenon relevant to elementary particle physics and early-universe cosmology. Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.

Title: Rare-Event Quantum Sensing using Logical Qubits
Authors: Robert Ott, Torsten V. Zache, Soonwon Choi, Adam M. Kaufman, Hannes Pichler
Abstract: We present a novel protocol to detect rare signals in a noisy environment using quantum error correction (QEC). The key feature of our protocol is the discrimination between signal and noise through distinct higher-order correlations, realized by the non-linear processing that occurs during syndrome extraction in QEC. In this scheme, QEC has two effects: First, it sacrifices part of the signal $\epsilon$ by recording a reduced, stochastic, logical phase $\phi_L = \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$. Second, it corrects the physical noise and extends the (logical) coherence time for signal acquisition. For rare signals occurring at random times in the presence of local Markovian noise, we explicitly demonstrate an improved sensitivity of our approach over more conventional sensing strategies.

Title: Quantum sensing with critical systems: impact of symmetry, imperfections, and decoherence
Authors: Yinan Chen, Sara Murciano, Pablo Sala, Jason Alicea
Abstract: Entangled many-body states enable high-precision quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. We develop interferometric sensing protocols based on quantum critical wavefunctions and compare their performance with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and spin-squeezed states. Building on the idea of symmetries as a metrological resource, we introduce a symmetry-based algorithm to identify optimal measurement strategies. We illustrate this algorithm both for magnetic systems with internal symmetries and Rydberg-atom arrays with spatial symmetries. We study the robustness of criticality for quantum sensing under non-unitary deformations, symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking decoherence, and qubit loss -- identifying regimes where critical systems outperform GHZ states and showing that non-unitary deformation can even enhance sensing precision. Combined with recent results on log-depth preparation of critical wavefunctions, interferometric sensing in this setting appears increasingly promising.

Title: Solving nonlinear PDEs with Quantum Neural Networks: A variational approach to the Bratu Equation
Authors: Nikolaos Cheimarios
Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to solve the nonlinear one-dimensional Bratu equation. By formulating the boundary value problem within a variational framework and encoding the solution in a parameterized quantum neural network (QNN), the problem reduces to an optimization task over quantum circuit parameters. The trial solution incorporates both classical approximations and boundary-enforcing terms, allowing the circuit to focus on minimizing the residual of the differential operator. Using a noiseless quantum simulator, we demonstrate that the method accurately captures both solution branches of the Bratu equation and shows excellent agreement with classical pseudo arc-length continuation results.

Title: Thermodynamic significance of QUBO encoding on quantum annealers
Authors: Emery Doucet, Zakaria Mzaouali, Reece Robertson, Bartłomiej Gardas, Sebastian Deffner, Krzysztof Domino
Abstract: Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is the standard interface to quantum annealers, yet a single constrained task admits many QUBO encodings whose penalty choices reshape the energy landscape experienced by hardware. We study a Job Shop Scheduling instance using a two-parameter family of encodings controlled by penalty weights $p_{\rm sum}$ (one-hot/sum constraints) and $p_{\rm pair}$ (precedence constraints). Sweeping $(p_{\rm sum},p_{\rm pair})$, we observe sharp transitions in feasibility and solver success across classical annealing-inspired heuristics and on a D-Wave Advantage processor. Going beyond solution probability, we treat the annealer as an open thermodynamic system and perform cyclic reverse-annealing experiments initialized from thermal samples, measuring the stochastic processor energy change. From the first two moments of this energy change we infer lower bounds on entropy production, work, and exchanged heat via thermodynamic uncertainty relations, and corroborate the observed trends with adiabatic master equation simulations. We find that the same encoding transitions that govern computational hardness also reorganize dissipation: weak penalties generate low-energy infeasible manifolds, while overly strong penalties suppress the effective problem energy scale and increase irreversibility, reducing the thermodynamic efficiency. Our results establish QUBO penalties as thermodynamic control knobs and motivate thermodynamics-aware encoding strategies for noisy intermediate-scale quantum annealers.

Title: Exact Multimode Quantization of Superconducting Circuits via Boundary Admittance
Authors: Mustafa Bakr, Robin Wopalenski
Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.

Title: Implementation of Tensor Network Simulation TN-Sim under NWQ-Sim
Authors: Aaron C. Hoyt, Jonathan S. Bersson, Sean Garner, Chenxu Liu, Ang Li
Abstract: Large-scale tensor network simulations are crucial for developing robust complexity-theoretic bounds on classical quantum simulation, enabling circuit cutting approaches, and optimizing circuit compilation, all of which aid efficient quantum computation on limited quantum resources. Modern exascale high-performance computing platforms offer significant potential for advancing tensor network quantum circuit simulation capabilities. We implement TN-Sim, a tensor network simulator backend within the NWQ-Sim software package that utilizes the Tensor Algebra for Many-body Methods (TAMM) framework to support both distributed HPC-scale computations and local simulations with ITensor. To optimize the scale up in computation across multiple nodes we implement a task based parallelization scheme to demonstrate parallelized gate contraction for wide quantum circuits with many gates per layer. Through the integration of the TAMM framework with Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor network approaches, we deliver a simulation environment that can scale from local systems to HPC clusters. We demonstrate an MPS tensor network simulator running on the state-of-the-art Perlmutter (NVIDIA) supercomputer and discuss the potential portability of this software to HPC clusters such as Frontier (AMD) and Aurora (Intel). We also discuss future improvements including support for different tensor network topologies and enhanced computational efficiency.

Title: Solving nonlinear differential equations on noisy $156$-qubit quantum computers
Authors: Karla Baumann, Youcef Modheb, Roman Randrianarisoa, Roland Katz, Aoife Boyle, Frédéric Holweck
Abstract: In this paper, we report on the resolution of nonlinear differential equations using IBM's quantum platform. More specifically, we demonstrate that the hybrid classical-quantum algorithm H-DES successfully solves a one-dimensional material deformation problem and the inviscid Burgers' equation on IBM's 156-qubit quantum computers. These results constitute a step toward performing physically relevant simulations on present-day Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

Title: A Broadband Nanowire Quantum Dot Cavity Design for the Efficient Extraction of Entangled Photons
Authors: Sayan Gangopadhyay, Sasan V. Grayli, Sathursan Kokilathasan, Michael E. Reimer
Abstract: A bright source of on-demand entangled photons is needed for quantum networks. A single quantum dot in a site-selected nanowire waveguide is a promising candidate for realizing such sources. However, such sources are associated with poor single-photon indistinguishability, limiting their applicability in quantum networks. A common approach for enhancing the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum dot-based entangled photon sources is to implement a broadband optical cavity. Achieving a high-Purcell cavity while retaining the advantages of the nanowire, such as directional emission, a broad operational bandwidth, and high light extraction efficiency, has been a significant challenge. Here, we propose a nanowire cavity based on quasi-bound states in the continuum formed by the strong coupling of two resonant optical modes. We numerically predict this design to support a cavity mode with 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of $\sim$17. This cavity mode enables a directional far-field emission profile (88% overlap with a Gaussian) with a light extraction efficiency of $\sim$74%. Our solution opens up a route for generating entangled photon pairs with enhanced extraction efficiency and single-photon indistinguishability for the practical realization of quantum networks.

Title: Pauli Measurements Are Near-Optimal for Pure State Tomography
Authors: Sabee Grewal, Meghal Gupta, William He, Aniruddha Sen, Mihir Singhal
Abstract: We give an algorithm for pure state tomography with near-optimal copy complexity using single-qubit measurements. Specifically, given $\widetilde{O}(2^n/\epsilon)$ copies of an unknown pure $n$-qubit state $\lvert\psi\rangle$, the algorithm performs only \textit{nonadaptive Pauli measurements}, runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(2^n,1/\epsilon)$, and outputs $\lvert \widehat{\psi} \rangle$ that has fidelity $1-\epsilon$ with $\lvert \psi \rangle$ with high probability. This improves upon the previous best copy complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(3^n/\epsilon)$.

Title: Holographic codes seen through ZX-calculus
Authors: Kwok Ho Wan, H.C.W. Price, Qing Yao
Abstract: We re-visit the pentagon holographic quantum error correcting code from a ZX-calculus perspective. By expressing the underlying tensors as ZX-diagrams, we study the stabiliser structure of the code via Pauli webs. In addition, we obtain a diagrammatic understanding of its logical operators, encoding isometries, Rényi entropy and toy models of black holes/wormholes. Then, motivated by the pentagon holographic code's ZX-diagram, we introduce a family of codes constructed from ZX-diagrams on its dual hyperbolic tessellations and study their logical error rates using belief propagation decoders.

Title: Momentum-Space Entanglement Entropy as a Universal Signature of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Kaiyuan Cao, Mingzhi Li, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Shu Chen, Jian Wang
Abstract: We introduce a momentum-space entanglement entropy to quantify quantum correlations between distinct momentum modes following a quench. We prove analytically in the transverse-field Ising (TFI) model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that every critical momentum $k^{*}$ associated with a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) saturates its entanglement entropy to the maximal value $\ln{d}$ ($d=2$ in TFI and SSH models), coinciding with the vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. This saturation of mode entanglement thus provides a universal, direct signature of DQPTs. Our work thus establishes a unified, entanglement-based perspective on dynamical quantum phase transitions.

Title: Increasing the secret key rates and point-to-multipoint extension for experimental coherent-one-way quantum key distribution protocol
Authors: Venkat Abhignan, Mohit Mittal, Aditi Das, Megha Shrivastava
Abstract: Using quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, a secret key is created between two distant users (transmitter and receiver) at a particular key rate. Quantum technology can facilitate secure communication for cryptographic applications, combining QKD with one-time-pad (OTP) encryption. In order to ensure the continuous operation of QKD in real-world networks, efforts have been concentrated on optimizing the use of components and effective QKD protocols to improve secret key rates and increase the transmission between multiple users. Generally, in experimental implementations, the secret key rates are limited by single-photon detectors, which are used at the receivers of QKD and create a bottleneck due to their limited detection rates (detectors with low detection efficiency and high detector dead-time). We experimentally show that secret key rates can be increased by combining the time-bin information of two such detectors on the data line of the receiver for the coherent-one-way (COW) QKD protocol with a minimal increase in quantum bit error rate (QBER, the proportion of erroneous bits). Further, we implement a point-to-multipoint COW QKD protocol, introducing an additional receiver module. The three users (one transmitter and two receivers) share the secret key in post-processing, relying on OTP encryption. Typically, the dual-receiver extension can improve the combined secret key rates of the system; however, one has to optimise the experimental parameters to achieve this within security margins. These methods are general and can be applied to any implementation of the COW protocol.

Title: Observation of ΔJ=0 Rotational Excitation in Dense Hydrogens
Authors: Jie Feng, XiaoDi Liu, Haian Xu, Pu Wang, Graeme J. Ackland, Eugene Gregoryanz
Abstract: Raman measurements performed on dense H2, D2 and H2+D2 in a wide pressure-temperature range reveal the presence of the {\Delta}J=0 rotational excitation. In the gas/fluid state this excitation has zero Raman shift, but in the solid, the crystal field drive s it away from the zero value e.g. 75 cm-1 at around 50 GPa and 10 K for both isotopes and their mixture. In the case of deuterium, the {\Delta}J=0 mode splits upon entering phase II suggesting a very complex molecular environment of the broken symmetry phase (BSP). In the fluid state and phases I and II the frequencies (energies) of the {\Delta}J=0 transition for H2 and D2 do not scale either as rotational (by factor of 2) nor vibrational (by square 2) modes and appear to be completely isotope independent. This independence on mass marks this transition as unique and a fundamentally different type of excitation from the commonly considered harmonic oscillator and quantum rotor.

Title: Multimode Fock-State Measurements using Dispersive Shifts in a Trapped Ion
Authors: Wonhyeong Choi, Jiyong Kang, Kyunghye Kim, Jaehun You, Kyungmin Lee, Taehyun Kim
Abstract: Trapped ions naturally host multiple motional modes alongside long-lived spin qubits, providing a scalable multimode bosonic register. Efficiently characterizing such bosonic registers requires the ability to access many motional modes with limited spin resources. Here we introduce a single-spin, multimode measurement primitive using dispersive shifts in the far-detuned multimode Jaynes-Cummings interaction. We implement a Ramsey sequence that maps phonon-number-dependent phases onto the spin, thereby realizing a multimode spin-dependent rotation (SDR). We also introduce a selective-decoupling scheme that cancels the phase induced by the carrier AC-Stark shift while preserving the phonon-number-dependent phase induced by the dispersive shift. Using this SDR-based Ramsey sequence on a single trapped ion, we experimentally extract two-mode Fock-state distributions, perform parity-based filtering of two-mode motional states, and realize a nondestructive single-shot measurement of a single-mode Fock state via repeated filtering steps.

Title: Path Integral Lindblad Dynamics in Presence of Time-Dependent Fields
Authors: Amartya Bose
Abstract: The path integral Lindblad dynamics (PILD) method [A. Bose, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 15(12), 3363-3368 (2024)] had been introduced as a way of incorporating the impact of certain empirical processes like pumps and drains on the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with thermal environments. The method being based on the time-translational invariance of the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel, however, was not able to account for time-dependent external fields. In this communication, we give an alternate, simpler formulation of PILD, that allows us to go beyond this limitation. It does not require the evaluation of the non-Markovian memory kernel directly, and consequently can be applied to Floquet systems as well.

Title: Hardy nonlocality for entangled pairs in a four-particle system
Authors: Duc Manh Doan, Hung Q. Nguyen
Abstract: Nonlocality can be studied through different approaches, such as Bell's inequalities, and it can be found in numerous quantum states, including GHZ states or graph states. Hardy's paradox, or Hardy-type nonlocality, provides a way to investigate nonlocality for entangled states of particles without using inequalities. Previous studies of Hardy's nonlocality have mostly focused on the fully entangled systems, while other entanglement configurations remain less explored. In this work, the system under investigation consists of four particles arranged in a cyclic entanglement configuration, where each particle forms entangled pairs with two neighbors, while non-neighboring particles remain unentangled. We found that this entanglement structure offers a larger set of conditions that lead to the contradiction with the LHV model, compared to the fully entangled systems. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of multiple excluded states and correlations, in which the measurement result of a particle only influences the result of its paired partners. We implement quantum circuits compatible with the cyclic entanglement structure, and through simulation, the correlation patterns and the states of interest are identified. We further execute the proposed circuits on IBM Brisbane, a practical backend; however, the results show considerable deviations from the simulation counterparts.

Title: SurgeQ: A Hybrid Framework for Ultra-Fast Quantum Processor Design and Crosstalk-Aware Circuit Execution
Authors: Xinxuan Chen, Hongxiang Zhu, Zhaohui Yang, Zhaofeng Su, Jianxin Chen, Feng Wu, Hui-Hai Zhao
Abstract: Executing quantum circuits on superconducting platforms requires balancing the trade-off between gate errors and crosstalk. To address this, we introduce SurgeQ, a hardware-software co-design strategy consisting of a design phase and an execution phase, to achieve accelerated circuit execution and improve overall program fidelity. SurgeQ employs coupling-strengthened, faster two-qubit gates while mitigating their increased crosstalk through a tailored scheduling strategy. With detailed consideration of composite noise models, we establish a systematic evaluation pipeline to identify the optimal coupling strength. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of real-world benchmarks show that SurgeQ generally achieves higher fidelity than up-to-date baselines, and remains effective in combating exponential fidelity decay, achieving up to a million-fold improvement in large-scale circuits.

Title: Regularization from Superpositions of Time Evolutions
Authors: Eliahu Cohen, Tomer Shushi
Abstract: Short-time approximations and path integrals can be dominated by high-energy or large-field contributions, especially in the presence of singular interactions, motivating regulators that are suppressive yet removable. Standard regulators typically impose such suppressions by hand (e.g. cutoffs, higher-derivative terms, heat-kernel smearing, lattice discretizations), while here we show that closely related smooth filters can arise as the conditional map produced by interference in a coherently controlled, postselected superposition of evolutions. A successful postselection implements a single heralded operator that is a coherent linear combination of time-evolution operators. For a Gaussian superposition of time translations in quantum mechanics, the postselected step is $V_{\sigma,\Delta t}=e^{-iH\Delta t}\,e^{-\frac12\sigma^2\Delta t^2H^2}$, i.e.\ the desired unitary step multiplied by a Gaussian energy filter suppressing energies above order $1/(\sigma\Delta t)$. This renders short-time kernels in time-sliced path-integral approximations well behaved for singular potentials, while the target unitary dynamics is recovered as $\sigma\to0$ and (for fixed $\sigma$) also as $\Delta t\to0$ at fixed $t$. In scalar QFT, a local Gaussian smearing of the quartic coupling induces a positive $(\sigma^2/2)\phi^8$ term in the Euclidean action, providing a symmetry-compatible large-field stabilizer; it is naturally viewed as an irrelevant operator whose effects can be renormalized at fixed $\sigma$ (together with a conventional UV regulator) and removed by taking $\sigma\to0$. We give short-time error bounds and analyze multi-step success probabilities.

Title: The Role of Quantum in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks: A Realistic Assessment
Authors: Dominik Freinberger, Philipp Moser
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising application domain for near-term quantum hardware, particularly through hybrid quantum-classical models that leverage both classical and quantum processing. Although numerous hybrid architectures have been proposed and demonstrated successfully on benchmark tasks, a significant open question remains regarding the specific contribution of quantum components to the overall performance of these models. In this work, we aim to shed light on the impact of quantum processing within hybrid quantum-classical neural network architectures through a rigorous statistical study. We systematically assess common hybrid models on medical signal data as well as planar and volumetric images, examining the influence attributable to classical and quantum aspects such as encoding schemes, entanglement, and circuit size. We find that in best-case scenarios, hybrid models show performance comparable to their classical counterparts, however, in most cases, performance metrics deteriorate under the influence of quantum components. Our multi-modal analysis provides realistic insights into the contributions of quantum components and advocates for cautious claims and design choices for hybrid models in near-term applications.

Title: A scalable gallium-phosphide-on-diamond spin-photon interface
Authors: Nicholas S. Yama, Chun-Chi Wu, Fariba Hatami, Kai-Mei C. Fu
Abstract: The efficient interfacing of quantum emitters and photons is fundamental to quantum networking. Quantum defects embedded in integrated nanophotonic circuits are promising for such applications due to the deterministic light-matter interactions of high-cooperativity ($C>1$) cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential for scalable integration with active photonic processing. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1>0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout. These results, coupled with GaP's strong nonlinear properties, establish GaP-on-diamond as a scalable planar platform for quantum network applications.

Title: Bound state solutions with a linear combination of Yuakawa plus four-parameter diatomic potentials using path integral approach: Thermodynamic properties
Authors: Mohamed Améziane Sadoun, Redouane Zamoum, Abdellah Touati
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximate analytical bound states with a linear combination of two diatomic molecule potentials, Yukawa and four parameters potentials, within the framework of the path integral formalism. With the help of an appropriate approximation to evaluate the centrifugal term, the energy spectrum and the normalized wave functions of the bound states are derived from the poles of Green's function and its residues. The partition function and other thermodynamic properties were obtained using the compact form of the energy equation.

Title: Fast thermal state preparation beyond native interactions
Authors: Alexander van Lomwel, Paul M. Schindler, Modesto Orozco-Ruiz, Marin Bukov, Nguyen H. Le, Florian Mintert
Abstract: While questions on quantum simulation of ground state physics are mostly focussed on the realization of effective interactions, most work on quantum simulation of thermal physics explores the realization of dynamics towards a thermal mixed state under native interactions. Many open questions that could be answered with quantum simulations, however, involve thermal states with respect to synthetic interactions. We present a framework based solely on unitary dynamics to design quantum simulations for thermal states with respect to Hamiltonians that include non-native interactions, suitable for both present-day digital and analogue devices. By classical means, our method finds the control sequence to reach a target thermal state for system sizes well out of reach of state-vector or density-matrix control methods, even though quantum hardware is required to explicitly simulate the thermal state dynamics. With the illustrative example of the cluster Ising model that includes non-native three-body interactions, we find that required experimental resources, such as the total evolution time, are independent of temperature and criticality.

Title: Quantum Wiener architecture for quantum reservoir computing
Authors: Alessio Benavoli, Felix Binder
Abstract: This work focuses on quantum reservoir computing and, in particular, on quantum Wiener architectures (qWiener), consisting of quantum linear dynamic networks with weak continuous measurements and classical nonlinear static readouts. We provide the first rigorous proof that qWiener systems retain the fading-memory property and universality of classical Wiener architectures, despite quantum constraints on linear dynamics and measurement back-action. Furthermore, we develop a kernel-theoretic interpretation showing that qWiener reservoirs naturally induce deep kernels, providing a principled framework for analysing their expressiveness. We further characterise the simplest qWiener instantiation, consisting of concatenated quantum harmonic oscillators, and show the difference with respect to the classical case. Finally, we empirically evaluate the architecture on standard reservoir computing benchmarks, demonstrating systematic performance gains over prior classical and quantum reservoir computing models.

Title: PACOX: A FPGA-based Pauli Composer Accelerator for Pauli String Computation
Authors: Tran Xuan Hieu Le, Tuan Hai Vu, Vu Trung Duong Le, Hoai Luan Pham, Yasuhiko Nakashima
Abstract: Pauli strings are a fundamental computational primitive in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. However, classical computation of Pauli strings suffers from exponential complexity and quickly becomes a performance bottleneck as the number of qubits increases. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Pauli Composer Accelerator (PACOX), the first dedicated FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation. PACOX employs a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation. Based on this formulation, we design a parallel and pipelined processing element (PE) cluster architecture that efficiently exploits data-level parallelism on FPGA. Experimental results on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA show that PACOX operates at 250 MHz with a dynamic power consumption of 0.33 W, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. For Pauli strings of up to 19 qubits, PACOX achieves speedups of up to 100 times compared with state-of-the-art CPU-based methods, while requiring significantly less memory and achieving a much lower power-delay product. These results demonstrate that PACOX delivers high computational speed with superior energy efficiency for Pauli-based workloads in hybrid quantum-classical systems.

Title: Noise tailoring for error mitigation and for diagnozing digital quantum computers
Authors: Thibault Scoquart, Hugo Perrin, Kyrylo Snizhko
Abstract: Error mitigation (EM) methods are crucial for obtaining reliable results in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, where noise significantly impacts output accuracy. Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that. In this article, we introduce Noise Tailoring (NT) -- an innovative strategy designed to modify the structure of the noise associated with two-qubit gates through statistical sampling. We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development.

Title: Unconditionally teleported quantum gates between remote solid-state qubit registers
Authors: Mariagrazia Iuliano, Nicolas Demetriou, H. Benjamin van Ommen, Constantijn Karels, Tim H. Taminiau, Ronald Hanson
Abstract: Quantum networks connecting quantum processing nodes via photonic links enable distributed and modular quantum computation. In this framework, quantum gates between remote qubits can be realized using quantum teleportation protocols. The essential requirements for such non-local gates are remote entanglement, local quantum logic within each processor, and classical communication between nodes to perform operations based on measurement outcomes. Here, we demonstrate an unconditional Controlled-NOT quantum gate between remote diamond-based qubit devices. The control and target qubits are Carbon-13 nuclear spins, while NV electron spins enable local logic, readout, and remote entanglement generation. We benchmark the system by creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, showing genuine 4-partite entanglement shared between nodes. Using deterministic logic, single-shot readout, and real-time feed-forward, we implement non-local gates without post-selection. These results demonstrate a key capability for solid-state quantum networks, enabling exploration of distributed quantum computing and testing of complex network protocols on fully integrated systems.

Title: Distinguishing Coherent and Incoherent Errors in Multi-Round Time-Reversed Dynamics via Scramblons
Authors: Zeyu Liu, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: Despite the rapid development of quantum science and technology, errors are inevitable and play a crucial role in quantum simulation and quantum computation. In quantum chaotic systems, coherent errors arising from imperfect Hamiltonian control and incoherent errors induced by coupling to the environment are both exponentially amplified during time evolution due to information scrambling. A fundamental question is how these two classes of errors imprint distinct signatures on the emergent irreversibility of many-body dynamics. In this Letter, we address this question by investigating multi-round time-reversed dynamics in the presence of both coherent and incoherent errors. By applying scramblon theory, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Loschmidt echo over different rounds of time-reversed evolution. For incoherent errors, the error accumulates linearly with the number of rounds, whereas coherent errors exhibit a crossover from quadratic to linear accumulation. These predictions are explicitly verified using the solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for characterizing and calibrating coherent and incoherent errors in reversed dynamics, with particular relevance to nuclear magnetic resonance systems.

Title: Quantenlogische Systeme und Tensorproduktraeume
Authors: Tobias Starke
Abstract: In this work we present an intuitive construction of the quantum logical axiomatic system provided by George Mackey. The goal of this work is a detailed discussion of the results from the paper 'Physical justification for using the tensor product to describe two quantum systems as one joint system' [1] published by Diederik Aerts and Ingrid Daubechies. This means that we want to show how certain composed physical systems from classical and quantum mechanics should be described logically. To reach this goal, we will, like in [1], discuss a special class of axiomatically defined composed physical systems. With the help of certain results from lattice and c-morphism theory (see [2] and [23]), we will present a detailed proof of the statement, that in the quantum mechanical case, a composed physical system must be described via a tensor product space.

Title: Virtual temperatures as a key quantifier for passive states in quantum thermodynamic processes
Authors: Sachin Sonkar, Ramandeep S. Johal
Abstract: We analyze the role of virtual temperatures for passive quantum states through the lens of majorization theory. A mean temperature over the virtual temperatures of adjacent energy levels is defined to compare the passive states of the system resulting from isoenergetic and isoentropic transformations. The role of the minimum and the maximum (min-max) values of the virtual temperatures in determining the direction of heat flow between the system and the environment is argued based on majorization relations. We characterize the intermediate passive states in a quantum Otto engine using these virtual temperatures and derive an upper bound for the Otto efficiency that can be expressed in terms of the min-max virtual temperatures of the working medium. An explicit example of the coupled-spins system is worked out. Moreover, virtual temperatures serve to draw interesting parallels between the quantum thermodynamic processes and their classical counterparts. Thus, virtual temperature emerges as a key operational quantity linking passivity and majorization to the optimal performance of quantum thermal machines.

Title: High-Rate Free-Running Reference-Frame-Independent Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution with Classified Distillation
Authors: Xin Liu, Zhicheng Luo, Kaibiao Qin, Jiawang Liu, Zhenrong Zhang, Kejin Wei
Abstract: Reference-frame-independent measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (RFI-MDI-QKD) eliminates detector side-channel attacks and avoids reference-frame calibration. While its feasibility has been widely demonstrated, existing implementations typically assume fixed or slowly drifting reference-frame misalignment, conditions rarely satisfied outside the laboratory. In realistic environments, rapid and free-running reference-frame variations can severely degrade both the key rate and transmission distance of conventional RFI-MDI-QKD. Here we propose a free-running RFI-MDI-QKD protocol that maintains high-rate key generation under rapid reference-frame variations. By introducing a classification-distillation method that reclassifies total detection events, secure keys can be extracted without modifying the experimental setup. Our protocol achieves a key rate more than nine times higher than the best previous RFI-MDI-QKD scheme and tolerates channel losses exceeding 24 dB, where earlier approaches fail. These results enable practical quantum key distribution on mobile platforms, including satellite-to-ground links and airborne nodes.

Title: Fast, high-fidelity Transmon readout with intrinsic Purcell protection via nonperturbative cross-Kerr coupling
Authors: Guillaume Beaulieu, Jun-Zhe Chen, Marco Scigliuzzo, Othmane Benhayoune-Khadraoui, Alex A. Chapple, Peter A. Spring, Alexandre Blais, Pasquale Scarlino
Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits relies on a transverse capacitive coupling that hybridizes the qubit with the readout resonator, subjecting the qubit to Purcell decay and measurement-induced state transitions (MIST). Despite the widespread use of Purcell filters to suppress qubit decay and near-quantum-limited amplifiers, dispersive readout often lags behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate junction readout, a simple readout architecture that realizes a strong qubit-resonator cross-Kerr interaction without relying on a transverse coupling. This interaction is achieved by coupling a transmon qubit to its readout resonator through both a capacitance and a Josephson junction. By varying the qubit frequency, we show that this hybrid coupling provides intrinsic Purcell protection and enhanced resilience to MIST, enabling readout at high photon numbers. While junction readout is compatible with conventional linear measurement, in this work we exploit the nonlinear coupling to intentionally engineer a large Kerr nonlinearity in the resonator, enabling bifurcation-based readout. Using this approach, we achieve a 99.4 % assignment fidelity with a 68 ns integration time and a 98.4 % QND fidelity without an external Purcell filter or a near-quantum-limited amplifier. These results establish the junction readout architecture with bifurcation-based readout as a scalable and practical alternative to dispersive readout, enabling fast, high-fidelity qubit measurement with reduced hardware overhead.

Title: Machine learning-aided direct estimation of coherence and entanglement for unknown states
Authors: Ting Lin, Zhihua Chen, Kai Wu, Zhihua Guo, Zhihao Ma, Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: Quantum coherence and entanglement are fundamental resources in quantum technologies, yet their efficient estimation for unknown states by employing minimal resources in experimental settings remains challenging, particularly in high-dimensional systems. We present a machine learning approach based on support vector regression (SVR) that directly estimates the coherence measures and the geometric measure of quantum entanglement using minimal experimental resources. Our method requires only the diagonal entries of the density matrix, along with the traces of the squared and cubed density matrices for quantum coherence, and additionally along with the traces of the squared and cubed reduced density matrix for estimating quantum entanglement. These quantities can be obtained through random measurements or a hybrid quantum-classical framework. This approach significantly reduces the resource overhead compared to quantum state tomography while maintaining high accuracy. {Furthermore, the support vector quantile regression (SVQR) with pinball loss is employed to prevent SVR overestimation. This model not only ensures that over 95\% of predictions are conservative lower bounds in most cases, but also maintains this lower-bound reliability for over 93\% of predictions, despite 2\% perturbations in the input features.} The proposed technique provides a practical and scalable tool for characterizing quantum resources across computation, communication, and metrology applications.

Title: Signatures of Spin Coherence in Chiral Coupled Quantum Dots
Authors: Hanna T. Fridman, Rotem Malkinson, Amir Hen, Shira Yochelis, Yossi Paltiel, Nir Bar-gill
Abstract: Chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) enables spin selectivity of charge carriers in chiral molecular systems without magnetic materials. While spin selectivity has been widely investigated, its quantum coherence has not yet been explored. Here, we in- vestigate spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) dynamics in multilayer quantum-dot (QD) assemblies coupled by chiral linkers. Using circularly polarized excitation in the presence of an external magnetic field, we observe a pronounced modulation of the PL lifetime that depends on the magnetic field magnitude and geometry. The lifetime difference between left- and right-circularly polarized excitations exhibits a field-angle dependence, consistent with spin precession driven by the transverse magnetic-field component relative to the chiral axis. A model incorporating coupled spin precession and decay processes reproduces the experimental trends. These results establish chiral QD assemblies as a room-temperature platform for probing quantum coherent manifestations of the CISS effect, with implications for spintronic and quantum technologies.

Title: Quantum Neural Network Training and Inference with Low Resolution Control Electronics
Authors: Rupayan Bhattacharjee, Sergi Abadal, Carmen G. Almudever, Eduard Alarcon
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers requires tight integration of cryogenic control electronics with quantum processors, where Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) face severe power and area constraints. We investigate quantum neural network (QNN) training and inference under finite DAC resolution constraints across various DAC resolutions. Pre-trained QNNs achieve accuracy nearly indistinguishable from infinite-precision baselines when deployed on quantum systems with 6-bit DAC control electronics, exhibiting an elbow curve with diminishing returns beyond 4 bits. However, training under quantization reveals gradient deadlock below 12-bit resolution as gradient magnitudes fall below quantization step sizes. We introduce temperature-controlled stochasticity that overcomes this through probabilistic parameter updates, enabling successful training at 4-10 bit resolutions that remarkably matches or exceeds infinite-precision baseline performance. Our findings demonstrate that low-resolution control electronics need not compromise QML performance, enabling significant power and area reduction in cryogenic control systems for practical deployment as quantum hardware scales.

Title: Encoding complex-balanced thermalization in quantum circuits
Authors: Yiting Mao, Peigeng Zhong, Haiqing Lin, Xiaoqun Wang, Shijie Hu
Abstract: We propose a protocol for effectively implementing complex-balanced thermalization via Markovian processes on a quantum-circuit platform that couples the system with engineered reservoir qubits. The non-orthogonality of qubit eigenstates facilitates non-uniform heating through a modified Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation, while simultaneously supports amplification-dissipation dynamics by violating microscopic time-reversibility. This offers a new approach to realizing out-of-equilibrium states at given temperatures. We show two applications of this platform: temporally-correlated dichromatic emission and Liouvillian exception point protected quantum synchronization at finite temperatures, both of which are challenging to achieve with conventional thermal reservoirs.

Title: Landau Zener Interaction Enhanced Quantum Sensing in Spin Defects of Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Mohammad Abdullah Sadi, Tiamike Dudley, Luca Basso, Thomas Poirier, James H. Edgar, Jacob Henshaw, Peter A. Bermel, Yong P. Chen, Andrew Mounce
Abstract: Negatively charged boron vacancies (V$_{\text{B}}^{-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) comprise a promising quantum sensing platform, optically addressable at room temperature and transferrable onto samples. However, broad hyperfine-split spin transitions of the ensemble pose challenges for quantum sensing with conventional resonant excitation due to limited spectral coverage. While isotopically enriched hBN using $^{10}$B and $^{15}$N isotopes (h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N) exhibits sharper spectral features, significant inhomogeneous broadening persists. We demonstrate that, implemented via frequency modulation on an FPGA, a frequency-ramped microwave pulse achieves around 4-fold greater $|0\rangle\rightarrow|-1\rangle$ spin-state population transfer and thus contrast than resonant microwave excitation and thus 16-fold shorter measurement time for spin relaxation based quantum sensing. Quantum dynamics simulations reveal that an effective two-state Landau-Zener model captures the complex relationship between population inversion and pulse length with relaxations incorporated. Our approach is robust and valuable for quantum relaxometry with spin defects in hBN in noisy environments.

Title: Exponential capacity scaling of classical GANs compared to hybrid latent style-based quantum GANs
Authors: Milan Liepelt, Julien Baglio
Abstract: Quantum generative modeling is a very active area of research in looking for practical advantage in data analysis. Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator. This hints toward a type of quantum advantage for quantum generative modeling.

Title: Anomaly to Resource: The Mpemba Effect in Quantum Thermometry
Authors: Pritam Chattopadhyay, Jonas F. G. Santos, Avijit Misra
Abstract: Quantum thermometry provides a key capability for nanoscale devices and quantum technologies, but most existing strategies rely on probes initialized near equilibrium. This equilibrium paradigm imposes intrinsic limitations: sensitivity is tied to long-time thermalization and often cannot be improved in fast, noisy, or nonstationary settings. In contrast, the \textit{Mpemba effect}, the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter states relax faster than colder ones, has mostly been viewed as a thermodynamic anomaly. Here, we bridge this gap by proving that Mpemba-type inversions generically yield a finite-time enhancement of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation, thereby converting an anomalous relaxation effect into a concrete metrological resource. Through explicit analyses of two-level and $\Lambda$-level probes coupled to bosonic baths, we show that nonequilibrium initializations can transiently outperform both equilibrium strategies and colder states, realizing a \emph{metrological Mpemba effect}. Our results establish anomalous relaxation as a general design principle for nonequilibrium quantum thermometry, enabling ultrafast and nanoscale sensing protocols that exploit, rather than avoid, transient dynamics.

Title: Preconditioned Multivariate Quantum Solution Extraction
Authors: Gumaro Rendon, Stepan Smid
Abstract: Numerically solving partial differential equations is a ubiquitous computational task with broad applications in many fields of science. Quantum computers can potentially provide high-degree polynomial speed-ups for solving PDEs, however many algorithms simply end with preparing the quantum state encoding the solution in its amplitudes. Trying to access explicit properties of the solution naively with quantum amplitude estimation can subsequently diminish the potential speed-up. In this work, we present a technique for extracting a smooth positive function encoded in the amplitudes of a quantum state, which achieves the Heisenberg limit scaling. We improve upon previous methods by allowing higher dimensional functions, by significantly reducing the quantum complexity with respect to the number of qubits encoding the function, and by removing the dependency on the minimum of the function using preconditioning. Our technique works by sampling the cumulative distribution of the given function, fitting it with Chebyshev polynomials, and subsequently extracting a representation of the whole encoded function. Finally, we trial our method by carrying out small scale numerical simulations.

Title: Unitary fault-tolerant encoding of Pauli states in surface codes
Authors: Luis Colmenarez, Remmy Zen, Jan Olle, Florian Marquardt, Markus Müller
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computation, the preparation of logical states is a ubiquitous subroutine, yet significant challenges persist even for the simplest states required. In the present work, we present a unitary, scalable, distance-preserving encoding scheme for preparing Pauli eigenstates in surface codes. Unlike previous unitary approaches whose fault-distance remains constant with increasing code distance, our scheme ensures that the protection offered by the code is preserved during state preparation. Building on strategies discovered by reinforcement learning for the surface-17 code, we generalize the construction to arbitrary code distances and both rotated and unrotated surface codes. The proposed encoding relies only on geometrically local gates, and is therefore fully compatible with planar 2D qubit connectivity, and it achieves circuit depth scaling as $\mathcal{O}(d)$, consistent with fundamental entanglement-generation bounds. We design explicit stabilizer-expanding circuits with and without ancilla-mediated connectivity and analyze their error-propagation behavior. Numerical simulations under depolarizing noise show that our unitary encoding without ancillas outperforms standard stabilizer-measurement-based schemes, reducing logical error rates by up to an order of magnitude. These results make the scheme particularly relevant for platforms such as trapped ions and neutral atoms, where measurements are costly relative to gates and idling noise is considerably weaker than gate noise. Our work bridges the gap between measurement-based and unitary encodings of surface-code states and opens new directions for distance-preserving state preparation in fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Scalable Generation of Macroscopic Fock States Exceeding 10,000 Photons
Authors: Ming Li, Weizhou Cai, Ziyue Hua, Yifang Xu, Yilong Zhou, Zi-Jie Chen, Xu-Bo Zou, Guang-Can Guo, Luyan Sun, Chang-Ling Zou
Abstract: The scalable preparation of bosonic quantum states with macroscopic excitations poses a fundamental challenge in quantum technologies, limited by control complexity and photon-loss rates that severely constrain prior theoretical and experimental efforts to merely dozens of excitations per mode. Here, based on the duality of the quantum state evolution in Fock state space and the optical wave-function propagation in a waveguide array, we introduce a Kerr-engineered multi-lens protocol in a single bosonic mode to deterministically generate Fock states exceeding $10,000$ photons. By optimizing phase and displacement operations across lens groups, our approach compensates for non-paraxial aberrations, achieving fidelities above $73\%$ in numerical simulations for photon numbers up to $N=100,000$. Counterintuitively, the protocol's execution time scales as $N^{-1/2}$ with the target photon number $N$, exhibiting robustness against the photon loss. Our framework enables exploration of quantum-to-classical transitions of giant Fock states, paving the way for advanced quantum metrology with significant quantum gains, and error-corrected quantum information processing in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Title: Simulation of noisy quantum circuits using frame representations
Authors: Janek Denzler, Jose Carrasco, Jens Eisert, Tommaso Guaita
Abstract: One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources.

Title: Composable simultaneous purification: when all communication scenarios reduce to spatial correlations
Authors: Matilde Baroni, Dominik Leichtle, Ivan Šupić, Damian Markham, Marco Túlio Quintino
Abstract: Bell non-locality is a powerful framework to distinguish classical, quantum and post-quantum resources, which relies on non-communicating players. Under which restriction can we have the same separations, if we allow for communication? Non-signalling state assemblages, and the fact that they can always be simultaneously purified, turned out to be the key element to restrict the simplest bipartite communication scenario, the prepare-and-measure, to the standard bipartite Bell scenario. Yet, many distinctive features of quantum theory are genuinely multipartite and cannot be reduced to two-party behaviour. In this work we are interested in extending this simultaneous purification inspired result to all multipartite communication schemes. As a first step, we unify and extend the simultaneous purification result from states to instruments and super-instruments, which are composable structures, and open up the possibility to explore more complex communication scenarios. Our main contribution is to establish that arbitrary compositions of non-signalling assemblages cannot escape the standard spatial quantum Bell correlations set. As a consequence, any interactive quantum realization of correlations outside of this set must involve at least one signalling assemblage of quantum operations, even when the resulting correlations are non-signalling.

Title: Quantum Elastic Network Models and their Application to Graphene
Authors: Ioannis Kolotouros, Adithya Sireesh, Stuart Ferguson, Sean Thrasher, Petros Wallden, Julien Michel
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are a central computational methodology in materials design for relating atomic composition to mechanical properties. However, simulating materials with atomic-level resolution on a macroscopic scale is infeasible on current classical hardware, even when using the simplest elastic network models (ENMs) that represent molecular vibrations as a network of coupled oscillators. To address this issue, we introduce Quantum Elastic Network Models (QENMs) and utilize the quantum algorithm of Babbush et al. (PRX, 2023), which offers an exponential advantage when simulating systems of coupled oscillators under some specific conditions and assumptions. Here, we demonstrate how our method enables the efficient simulation of planar materials. As an example, we apply our algorithm to the task of simulating a 2D graphene sheet. We analyze the exact complexity for initial-state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and measurement of this material, and provide two real-world applications: heat transfer and the out-of-plane rippling effect. We estimate that an atomistic simulation of a graphene sheet on the centimeter scale, classically requiring hundreds of petabytes of memory and prohibitive runtimes, could be encoded and simulated with as few as $\sim 160$ logical qubits.

Title: Fast convergence of Majorana Propagation for weakly interacting fermions
Authors: Giorgio Facelli, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi
Abstract: Simulating the time dynamics of an observable under Hamiltonian evolution is one of the most promising candidates for quantum advantage as we do not expect efficient classical algorithms for this problem except in restricted settings. Here, we introduce such a setting by showing that Majorana Propagation, a simple algorithm combining Trotter steps and truncations, efficiently finds a low-degree approximation of the time-evolved observable as soon as such an approximation exists. This provides the first provable guarantee about Majorana Propagation for Hamiltonian evolution. As an application of this result, we prove that Majorana Propagation can efficiently simulate the time dynamics of any sparse quartic Hamiltonian up to time $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ depending on the interaction strength $u$. For a time horizon $t \leq t_{\text{max}}(u)$, the runtime of the algorithm is $N^{O(\log(t/\varepsilon))}$ where $N$ is the number of Majorana modes and $\varepsilon$ is the error measured in the normalized Frobenius norm. Importantly, in the limit of small $u$, $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ goes to $+\infty$, formalizing the intuition that the algorithm is accurate at all times when the Hamiltonian is quadratic.

Title: Scalable Suppression of XY Crosstalk by Pulse-Level Control in Superconducting Quantum Processors
Authors: Hui-Hang Chen, Chiao-Hsuan Wang
Abstract: As superconducting quantum processors continue to scale, high-performance quantum control becomes increasingly critical. In densely integrated architectures, unwanted interactions between nearby qubits give rise to crosstalk errors that limit operational performance. In particular, direct exchange-type (XY) interactions are typically minimized by designing large frequency detunings between neighboring qubits at the hardware level. However, frequency crowding in large-scale systems ultimately restricts the achievable frequency separation. While such XY coupling facilitates entangling gate operations, its residual presence poses a key challenge during single-qubit controls. Here, we propose a scalable pulse-level control framework, incorporating frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD), to suppress XY crosstalk errors. This framework operates independently of coupling strengths, reducing calibration overhead and naturally supporting multi-qubit connectivity. Numerical simulations show orders-of-magnitude reductions in infidelity for both idle and single-qubit gates in a two-qubit system. We further validate scalability in a five-qubit layout, where crosstalk between a central qubit and four neighbors is simultaneously suppressed. Our crosstalk suppression framework provides a practical route toward high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures.

Title: Gauging Open EFTs from the top down
Authors: Greg Kaplanek, Maria Mylova, Andrew J. Tolley
Abstract: We present explicit top-down calculations of Open EFTs for gauged degrees of freedom with a focus on the effects of gauge fixing. Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and Stückelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase. The latter serves as an example of an open system for Stückelberg/Goldstone fields.

Title: Chiral Lattice Gauge Theories from Symmetry Disentanglers
Authors: Ryan Thorngren, John Preskill, Lukasz Fidkowski
Abstract: We propose a Hamiltonian framework for constructing chiral gauge theories on the lattice based on symmetry disentanglers: constant-depth circuits of local unitaries that transform not-on-site symmetries into on-site ones. When chiral symmetry can be realized not-on-site and such a disentangler exists, the symmetry can be implemented in a strictly local Hamiltonian and gauged by standard lattice methods. Using lattice rotor models, we realize this idea in 1+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions for $U(1)$ symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies, and show that symmetry disentanglers can be constructed when anomalies cancel. As an example, we present an exactly solvable Hamiltonian lattice model of the (1+1)-dimensional "3450" chiral gauge theory, and we argue that a related construction applies to the $U(1)$ hypercharge symmetry of the Standard Model fermions in 3+1 dimensions. Our results open a new route toward fully local, nonperturbative formulations of chiral gauge theories.

Title: Scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a $3+1$D U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter
Authors: Simone Orlando, Guo-Xian Su, Bing Yang, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: The stated overarching goal of the highly active field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP) is to achieve the capability to study \textit{ab-initio} real-time microscopic dynamics of $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, existing experimental realizations and theoretical proposals for future ones have remained restricted to one or two spatial dimensions. Here, we take a big step towards this goal by proposing a concrete experimentally feasible scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a U$(1)$ quantum link model of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in three spatial dimensions, employing \textit{linear gauge protection} to stabilize gauge invariance. Using tree tensor network simulations, we benchmark the performance of this quantum simulator through near- and far-from-equilibrium observables, showing excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory. Additionally, we introduce a method for \textit{analog quantum error mitigation} that accounts for unwanted first-order tunneling processes, vastly improving agreement between quantum-simulator and ideal-gauge-theory results. Our findings pave the way towards realistic quantum simulators of $3+1$D lattice gauge theories that can probe regimes well beyond classical simulability.

Title: Distribution-Guided and Constrained Quantum Machine Unlearning
Authors: Nausherwan Malik, Zubair Khalid, Muhammad Faryad
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a learned model without full retraining. While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.

Title: Classical solution of the FeMo-cofactor model to chemical accuracy and its implications
Authors: Huanchen Zhai, Chenghan Li, Xing Zhang, Zhendong Li, Seunghoon Lee, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: The main source of reduced nitrogen for living things comes from nitrogenase, which converts N2 to NH3 at the FeMo-cofactor (FeMo-co). Because of its role in supporting life, the uncertainty surrounding the catalytic cycle, and its compositional richness with eight transition metal ions, FeMo-co has fascinated scientists for decades. After much effort, the complete atomic structure was resolved. However, its electronic structure, central to reactivity, remains under intense debate. FeMo-co's complexity, arising from many unpaired electrons, has led to suggestions that it lies beyond the reach of classical computing. Consequently, there has been much interest in the potential of quantum algorithms to compute its electronic structure. Estimating the cost to compute the ground-state to chemical accuracy (~1 kcal/mol) within one or more FeMo-co models is a common benchmark of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry, with numerous resource estimates in the literature. Here we address how to perform the same task using classical computation. We use a 76 orbital/152 qubit resting state model, the subject of most quantum resource estimates. Based on insight into the multiple configuration nature of the states, we devise classical protocols that yield rigorous or empirical upper bounds to the ground-state energy. Extrapolating these we predict the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty on the order of chemical accuracy. Having performed this long-discussed computational task, we next consider implications beyond the model. We distill a simpler computational procedure which we apply to reveal the electronic landscape in realistic representations of the cofactor. We thus illustrate a path to a precise computational understanding of FeMo-co electronic structure.

Title: Topological sensing of superfluid rotation using non-Hermitian optical dimers
Authors: Aritra Ghosh, Nilamoni Daloi, M. Bhattacharya
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a non-Hermitian optical dimer whose parameters are renormalized by dispersive and dissipative backaction from the coupling of the passive cavity with a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\pm \ell \hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid.

Title: Floquet-driven tunneling control in monolayer MoS$_2$
Authors: Rachid El Aitouni, Aotmane En Naciri, Clarence Cortes, David Laroze, Ahmed Jellal
Abstract: We study how fermions in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ interact with a laser field and a static potential barrier, focusing on the transmission probability. Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \pm \hbar\omega$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters. This highlights the potential of laser-driven MoS$_2$ structures for highly sensitive electromagnetic sensors and advanced optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: The relaxation of ortho states of a helium-like Mg donor in silicon is investigated by measuring the modulation of background radiation transmission through impurity centers under pulsed photoexcitation. Long-lived states of the spin-triplet 1s(3T2) group with a lifetime of about 20 ms are observed. The temperature dependence indicates that the relaxation is governed by the Orbach mechanism with an activation energy ~13 meV, which is close to the exchange splitting energy of the excited 1s states of the Mg donor.

Title: Entanglement negativity for a free scalar chiral current
Authors: Malen Arias, Marina Huerta, Andrei Rotaru, Erik Tonni
Abstract: We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.

Title: Low-loss Material for Infrared Protection of Cryogenic Quantum Applications
Authors: Markus Griedel, Max Kristen, Biliana Gasharova, Yves-Laurent Mathis, Alexey V. Ustinov, Hannes Rotzinger
Abstract: The fragile quantum states of low-temperature quantum applications require protection from infrared radiation caused by higher-temperature stages or other sources. We propose a material system that can efficiently block radiation up to the optical range while transmitting photons at low gigahertz frequencies. It is based on the effect that incident photons are strongly scattered when their wavelength is comparable to the size of particles embedded in a weakly absorbing medium (Mie-scattering). The goal of this work is to tailor the absorption and transmission spectrum of an non-magnetic epoxy resin containing sapphire spheres by simulating its dependence on the size distribution. Additionally, we fabricate several material compositions, characterize them, as well as other materials, at optical, infrared, and gigahertz frequencies. In the infrared region (stop band) the attenuation of the Mie-scattering optimized material is high and comparable to that of other commonly used filter materials. At gigahertz frequencies (pass-band), the prototype filter exhibits a high transmission at millikelvin temperatures, with an insertion loss of less than $0.4\,$dB below $10\,$GHz.

Title: Beyond the imbalance: site-resolved dynamics probing resonances in many-body localization
Authors: Asmi Haldar, Thibault Scoquart, Fabien Alet, Nicolas Laflorencie
Abstract: We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols. Overall, our experimentally testable predictions highlight the necessity of a refined, site-resolved approach to fully understand the complexities of MBL and its connection to rare-region effects.

Title: Chiral Graviton Modes in Fermionic Fractional Chern Insulators
Authors: Min Long, Zeno Bacciconi, Hongyu Lu, Hernan B. Xavier, Zi Yang Meng, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: Chiral graviton modes are hallmark collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.

Title: Cat states and violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic Quantum Field Theory
Authors: M. S. Guimaraes, I. Roditi, S. P. Sorella
Abstract: A cat state localized in the right Rindler wedge is employed to study the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in a relativistic scalar free Quantum Field Theory. By means of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\varphi(f))$, where $\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, it turns out that the Bell-CHSH correlator can be evaluated in closed analytic form in terms of the imaginary error function. Being the superposition of two coherent states, cat states allow for the existence of interference terms which give rise to a violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. As such, the present setup can be considered as an explicit realization of the results obtained by Summers-Werner.

Title: When and why non-Hermitian eigenvalues miss eigenstates in topological physics
Authors: Lucien Jezequel, Loïc Herviou, Jens Bardarson
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a fundamental spectral dichotomy absent in Hermitian physics: the eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenstate spectrum can deviate significantly in the thermodynamic limit. We explain how non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can support eigenstates completely undetected by eigenvalues, with the unidirectional Hatano-Nelson model serving as both a minimal realization and universal paradigm for this phenomenon. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding. Our framework explains how the apparent bulk-edge correspondence failures in models like the non-Hermitian SSH chain instead reflect the systematic inability of the eigenvalue spectrum to detect certain eigenstates in systems with a skin-effect. These results establish the limitation of the eigenvalue spectrum and suggest how the eigenstate approach can lead to improved characterization of non-Hermitian topology.

Title: Security proof for quantum cryptography against entanglement-measurement attack
Authors: Zhaoxu Ji, Huanguo Zhang
Abstract: Entanglement-measurement attack is one of the most famous attacks against quantum cryptography. In quantum cryptography protocols, eavesdropping checking is an effective means to resist this attack. There are currently two commonly used eavesdropping checking methods: one is to prepare two sets of non-orthogonal single-particle states as decoy states, and determine whether there are eavesdroppers in the quantum channel by comparing the states obtained by measurements with the original states; The other is to prepare two sets of non-orthogonal entangled states and use their entanglement correlations to judge whether there are eavesdroppers in the quantum channel. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate how quantum cryptography can utilize these two eavesdropping checking methods to resist entanglement-measurement attacks. We take the quantum cryptography protocols based on maximally entangled states as examples to demonstrate the proof process, transitioning from qubit-based protocols to qudit-based ones.

Title: Randomized adiabatic quantum linear solver algorithm with optimal complexity scaling and detailed running costs
Authors: David Jennings, Matteo Lostaglio, Sam Pallister, Andrew T Sornborger, Yiğit Subaşı
Abstract: Solving linear systems of equations is a fundamental problem with a wide variety of applications across many fields of science, and there is increasing effort to develop quantum linear solver algorithms. [Subaşi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. (2019)] proposed a randomized algorithm inspired by adiabatic quantum computing, based on a sequence of random Hamiltonian simulation steps, with suboptimal scaling in the condition number $\kappa$ of the linear system and the target error $\epsilon$. Here we go beyond these results in several ways. Firstly, using filtering~[Lin et al., Quantum (2019)] and Poissonization techniques [Cunningham et al., arXiv:2406.03972 (2024)], the algorithm complexity is improved to the optimal scaling $O(\kappa \log(1/\epsilon))$ -- an exponential improvement in $\epsilon$, and a shaving of a $\log \kappa$ scaling factor in $\kappa$. Secondly, the algorithm is further modified to achieve constant factor improvements, which are vital as we progress towards hardware implementations on fault-tolerant devices. We introduce a cheaper randomized walk operator method replacing Hamiltonian simulation -- which also removes the need for potentially challenging classical precomputations; randomized routines are sampled over optimized random variables; circuit constructions are improved. We obtain a closed formula rigorously upper bounding the expected number of times one needs to apply a block-encoding of the linear system matrix to output a quantum state encoding the solution to the linear system. The upper bound is $837 \kappa$ at $\epsilon=10^{-10}$ for Hermitian matrices.

Title: The Fate of Entanglement
Authors: Gilles Parez, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.

Title: Simulating decoherence of two coupled spins using the generalized cluster correlation expansion
Authors: Xiao Chen, Silas Hoffman, James N. Fry, Hai-Ping Cheng
Abstract: We simulate the coherence of two coupled electron spins interacting with a bath of nuclei using the generalized cluster correlation expansion (gCCE) method. An exchange interaction between the electrons facilitates a family of entangling gates that can be spoiled by nuclear-induced dephasing. Consequently, we study the dephasing of the coherent two-electron system by characterizing the $T_2$ and $T_2^*$ of the two-electron reduced density matrix for various system parameters in the range mimicking magnetic molecules, including magnetic field strength and orientation, exchange interaction strength, distance between the two spins, minimum distance between electron and nuclei and between nuclei, and nuclei density. We find the optimal regime for each parameter in which the coherence time is maximized and provide a physical understanding of it.

Title: Entanglement-Based Artificial Topology: Neighboring Remote Network Nodes
Authors: Si-Yi Chen, Jessica Illiano, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti, Marcello Caleffi
Abstract: Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.

Title: Fourier Neural Operators for Learning Dynamics in Quantum Spin Systems
Authors: Freya Shah, Taylor L. Patti, Julius Berner, Bahareh Tolooshams, Jean Kossaifi, Anima Anandkumar
Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) excel on tasks using functional data, such as those originating from partial differential equations. Such characteristics render them an effective approach for simulating the time evolution of quantum wavefunctions, which is a computationally challenging, yet coveted task for studying quantum systems. In this manuscript, we use FNOs to model the evolution of quantum spin systems, so chosen due to their representative quantum dynamics. We explore two distinct FNO architectures, examining their performance for learning and predicting time evolution on both random and low-energy input states. We find that standard neural networks in fixed dimensions, such as U-Net, exhibit limited ability to extrapolate beyond the training time interval, whereas FNOs reliably capture the underlying time-evolution operator, generalizing effectively to unseen times. Additionally, we apply FNOs to a compact set of Hamiltonian observables ($\sim\text{poly}(n)$) instead of the entire $2^n$ quantum wavefunction, which greatly reduces the size of our FNO inputs, outputs and model dimensions. Moreover, this Hamiltonian observable-based method demonstrates that FNOs can effectively distill information from high-dimensional spaces into lower-dimensional spaces. Using this approach, we perform numerical experiments on a 20-qubit system and extrapolate Hamiltonian observables to twice the training time with a relative error of $5.8\%$. Relative to numerical time-evolution methods, FNO achieves an inference speedup of approximately $10^{4}\times$ for 20-qubit systems. The extrapolation of Hamiltonian observables to times later than those used in training is of particular interest, as this stands to fundamentally increase the simulatability of quantum systems past both the coherence times of contemporary quantum architectures and the circuit-depths of tractable tensor networks.

Title: Enhanced Fault-tolerance in Photonic Quantum Computing: Comparing the Honeycomb Floquet Code and the Surface Code in Tailored Architecture
Authors: Théo Dessertaine, Boris Bourdoncle, Aurélie Denys, Grégoire de Gliniasty, Pierre Colonna d'Istria, Gerard Valentí-Rojas, Shane Mansfield, Paul Hilaire
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing is crucial for realizing large-scale quantum computation, and the interplay between hardware architecture and quantum error-correcting codes is a key consideration. We present a comparative study of two quantum error-correcting codes - the surface code and the honeycomb Floquet code - implemented on the spin-optical quantum computing architecture, either with controlled-Z operations or with direct parity measurements. This allows for a direct comparison of the codes using consistent noise models. Notably, we achieve a loss threshold of 6.3% with the honeycomb Floquet code implemented on our tailored architecture, almost twice as high as the loss threshold obtained with the surface code on the previous architecture, all the while requiring less physical qubits. This finding is particularly significant given that photon loss is the primary source of errors in photon-mediated quantum computing. Moreover, we benchmark the general performances of the two codes in a multi-error setting by computing the volume of the fault-tolerant region, and show that the fault-tolerant region of the honeycomb code is over twice as large as that of the surface code.

Title: Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Noisy Quantum Circuits with Naturally Fault-Tolerant Gates
Authors: Jon Nelson, Joel Rajakumar, Dominik Hangleiter, Michael J. Gullans
Abstract: We construct a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the output distribution of noisy geometrically local Clifford circuits with any product-state input and single-qubit measurements in any basis. Our results apply to circuits with nearest-neighbor gates on an $O(1)$-D architecture with depolarizing noise after each gate. Importantly, we assume that the circuit does not contain qubit resets or mid-circuit measurements. This class of circuits includes Clifford-magic circuits and Conjugated-Clifford circuits, which are important candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage using non-universal gates. Additionally, our results can be extended to the case of IQP circuits augmented with CNOT gates, which is another class of non-universal circuits that are relevant to current experiments. Importantly, these results do not require randomness assumptions over the circuit families considered (such as anticoncentration properties) and instead hold for every circuit in each class as long as the depth is above a constant threshold. This allows us to rule out the possibility of fault-tolerance in these circuit models. As a key technical step, we prove that interspersed noise causes a decay of long-range entanglement at depths beyond a critical threshold. To prove our results, we merge techniques from percolation theory and Pauli path analysis.

Title: Variational decision diagrams for quantum-inspired machine learning applications
Authors: Vladimir Vargas-Calderón, Santiago Acevedo-Mancera, Herbert Vinck-Posada
Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) have emerged as an efficient tool for simulating quantum circuits due to their capacity to exploit data redundancies in quantum states and quantum operations, enabling the efficient computation of probability amplitudes. However, their application in quantum machine learning (QML) has remained unexplored. This paper introduces variational decision diagrams (VDDs), a novel graph structure that combines the structural benefits of DDs with the adaptability of variational methods for efficiently representing quantum states. We investigate the trainability of VDDs by applying them to the ground state estimation problem for transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg Hamiltonians. Analysis of gradient variance suggests that training VDDs is possible, as no signs of vanishing gradients--also known as barren plateaus--are observed. This work provides new insights into the use of decision diagrams in QML as an alternative to design and train variational ansätze.

Title: QUIET-SR: Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Single Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Siddhant Dutta, Nouhaila Innan, Khadijeh Najafi, Sadok Ben Yahia, Muhammad Shafique
Abstract: Recent advancements in Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) using deep learning have significantly improved image restoration quality. However, the high computational cost of processing high-resolution images due to the large number of parameters in classical models, along with the scalability challenges of quantum algorithms for image processing, remains a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We evaluate our framework in MNIST (30.24 PSNR, 0.989 SSIM), FashionMNIST (29.76 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM) and the MedMNIST dataset collection, demonstrating that QUIET-SR achieves PSNR and SSIM scores comparable to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. Our efficient batching strategy directly enables massive parallelization on multiple QPU's paving the way for practical quantum-enhanced image super-resolution through coordinated QPU-GPU quantum supercomputing.

Title: Time-delayed collective dynamics in waveguide QED and bosonic quantum networks
Authors: Carlos Barahona-Pascual, Hong Jiang, Alan C. Santos, Juan José García-Ripoll
Abstract: This work introduces a theoretical framework to model the collective dynamics of quantum emitters in highly non-Markovian environments, interacting through the exchange of photons with significant retardations. The formalism consists on a set of coupled delay differential equations for the emitter's polarizations $\sigma^\pm_i$, supplemented by input-output relations that describe the field mediating the interactions. These equations capture the dynamics of both linear (bosonic) and nonlinear (two-level) emitter arrays. It is exact in some limits$-$e.g., bosonic emitters or generic systems with up to one collective excitation$-$and can be integrated to provide accurate results for larger numbers of photons. These equations support a study of collective spontaneous emission of emitter arrays in open waveguide-QED environments. This study uncovers an effect we term cascaded super- and sub-radiance, characterized by light-cone-limited propagation and increasingly correlated photon emission across distant emitters. The collective nature of this dynamics for two-level systems is evident both in the enhancement of collective emission rates, as well as in a superradiant burst with a faster than linear growth. While these effects should be observable in existing circuit QED devices or slight generalizations thereof, the formalism put forward in this work can be extended to model other systems such as network of quantum emitters or the generation of correlated photon states.

Title: Operator-Level Quantum Acceleration of Non-Logconcave Sampling
Authors: Jiaqi Leng, Zhiyan Ding, Zherui Chen, Lin Lin
Abstract: Sampling from probability distributions of the form $\sigma \propto e^{-\beta V}$, where $V$ is a continuous potential, is a fundamental task across physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, and statistics. However, when $V$ is non-convex, the resulting distribution becomes non-logconcave, and classical methods such as Langevin dynamics often exhibit poor performance. We introduce the first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value thresholding and yields up to a quartic quantum speedup over best-known classical Langevin-based methods in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this framework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates replica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from complex, rugged energy landscapes.

Title: Temporal coherence of single photons emitted by hexagonal Boron Nitride defects at room temperature
Authors: J.-V. Vidal Martínez-Pons, S.-K. Kim, M. Behrens, A. Izquierdo-Molina, A. Menendez Rua, S. Paçal, S. Ateş, L. Viña, C. Antón-Solanas
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) emerge as promising quantum light sources at room temperature, with potential applications in quantum communications, among others. The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e. their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.

Authors: Milajiguli Rexiti, Stefano Mancini
Abstract: We address the issue of multishot discrimination between two qubit channels by invoking a simple adaptive protocol that employs Helstrom measurement at each step and classical information feedforward, beside separable inputs. We contrast the performance of Bayesian and Markovian strategies. We show that the former is only slightly advantageous and for a limited parameters' region.

Title: Quantum Data Centres: Why Entanglement Changes Everything
Authors: Angela Sara Cacciapuoti, Claudio Pellitteri, Jessica Illiano, Laura d'Avossa, Francesco Mazza, Siyi Chen, Marcello Caleffi
Abstract: The Quantum Internet is key for distributed quantum computing, by interconnecting multiple quantum processors into a virtual quantum computation system. This allows to scale the number of qubits, by overcoming the inherent limitations of noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Thus, the Quantum Internet is the foundation for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Among the distributed architectures, Quantum Data Centres emerge as the most viable in the medium-term, since they integrate multiple quantum processors within a localized network infrastructure, by allowing modular design of quantum networking. We analyze the physical and topological constraints of Quantum Data Centres, by emphasizing the role of entanglement orchestrators in dynamically reconfiguring network topologies through local operations. We examine the major hardware challenge of quantum transduction, essential for interfacing heterogeneous quantum systems. Furthermore, we explore how interconnecting multiple Quantum Data Centres could enable large-scale quantum networks. We discuss the topological constraints of such a scaling and identify open challenges, including entanglement routing and synchronization. The carried analysis positions Quantum Data Centres as both a practical implementation platform and strategic framework for the future Quantum Internet.

Title: Erasure cost of a quantum process: A thermodynamic meaning of the dynamical min-entropy
Authors: Himanshu Badhani, Dhanuja G S, Swati Choudhary, Vishal Anand, Siddhartha Das
Abstract: The erasure of information is fundamentally an irreversible logical operation, carrying profound consequences for the energetics of computation and information processing. We investigate the thermodynamic costs associated with erasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we analyze an arbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary input-output systems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the ground state. We focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced dynamics -- that is, the minimal thermodynamic work cost to erase the logical output of the gate for any logical input, assuming full access to the ancilla but no access to any purifying reference of the logical input state. We determine that this adversarial erasure cost is directly proportional to the negative min-entropy of the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the dynamical min-entropy a clear operational meaning. The dynamical min-entropy can take positive and negative values, depending on the underlying quantum dynamics. The negative value of the erasure cost implies that the extraction of thermodynamic work is possible instead of its consumption during the process. A key foundation of this result is the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates the decoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges thermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum computation.

Title: Enhancing Expressivity of Quantum Neural Networks Based on the SWAP test
Authors: Sebastian Nagies, Emiliano Tolotti, Davide Pastorello, Enrico Blanzieri
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) based on parametrized quantum circuits are promising candidates for machine learning applications, yet many architectures lack clear connections to classical models, potentially limiting their ability to leverage established classical neural network techniques. We examine QNNs built from SWAP test circuits and discuss their equivalence to classical two-layer feedforward networks with quadratic activations under amplitude encoding. Evaluation on real-world and synthetic datasets shows that while this architecture learns many practical binary classification tasks, it has fundamental expressivity limitations: polynomial activation functions do not satisfy the universal approximation theorem, and we show analytically that the architecture cannot learn the parity check function beyond two dimensions, regardless of network size. To address this, we introduce generalized SWAP test circuits with multiple Fredkin gates sharing an ancilla, implementing product layers with polynomial activations of arbitrary even degree. This modification enables successful learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions as well as binary n-spiral tasks, and we provide numerical evidence that the expressivity enhancement extends to alternative encoding schemes such as angle (Z) and ZZ feature maps. We validate the practical feasibility of our proposed architecture by implementing a classically pretrained instance on the IBM Torino quantum processor, achieving 84% classification accuracy on the three-dimensional parity check despite hardware noise. Our work establishes a framework for analyzing and enhancing QNN expressivity through correspondence with classical architectures, and demonstrates that SWAP test-based QNNs possess broad representational capacity relevant to both classical and potentially quantum learning tasks.

Title: Spectral Bias in Variational Quantum Machine Learning
Authors: Callum Duffy, Marcin Jastrzebski
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence. We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs). Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes. Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement schemes tend to slow convergence.

Title: Inter-qubit correlation dynamics driven by mutual interactions
Authors: Aleksandra Kwiatkowska, Waldemar Kłobus
Abstract: A particularly useful tool for characterizing multi-qubit systems is the correlation tensor, providing an experimentally friendly and theoretically concise representation of quantum states. In this work, we analyze the evolution of the correlation tensor elements of quantum systems composed of $\frac12$-spins, generated by mutual interactions and the influence of the external field. We focus on two-body interactions in the form of anisotropic Heisenberg as well as antisymmetric exchange interaction models. The evolution of the system is visualized in the form of a trajectory in a suitable correlation space, which, depending on the system's frequencies, exhibits periodic or nonperiodic behavior. In the case of two $\frac12$-spins we study the stationary correlations for several classes of Hamiltonians, which allows a full characterization of the families of density matrices invariant under the evolution generated by the Hamiltonians. We discuss some common properties shared by the 2- and 3-qubit systems and show how a strong external field can play a stabilizing factor with respect to certain correlation characteristics.

Title: Efficient Characterization of Coherent and Correlated Low-Degree Noise in Layers of Gates
Authors: Marianna Crupi, J. Ignacio Cirac, Flavio Baccari
Abstract: We present a quantum process-tomography protocol based on a low-degree ansatz for the quantum channel, i.e. when it can be expressed as a fixed-degree polynomial in terms of Pauli operators. We demonstrate how to perform tomography of such channels with a logarithmic amount of effort relative to the size of the system, by employing random state preparation and measurements in the Pauli basis. We extend the applicability of the protocol to channels consisting of a layer of quantum gates with a polylogarithmic number of non-Clifford gates, followed by a low-degree noise channel. Rather than inverting the layer of quantum gates on the hardware-which would introduce additional errors-we instead carry out the inversion in classical postprocessing, while adding to the sample complexity a factor at most polynomial in system size. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the feasibility of our method.

Title: Symmetric orthogonalization and probabilistic weights in resource quantification
Authors: Gökhan Torun
Abstract: Transforming non-orthogonal bases into orthogonal ones often compromises essential properties or physical meaning in quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate that Löwdin symmetric orthogonalization (LSO) outperforms the widely used Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) in characterizing and quantifying quantum resources, with particular emphasis on coherence and superposition. We employ LSO both to construct an orthogonal basis from a non-orthogonal one and to obtain a non-orthogonal basis from an orthogonal set, thereby mitigating ambiguity related to the basis choice in defining quantum coherence. Unlike GSO, which depends on the ordering of input states, LSO applies a symmetric transformation that treats all vectors equally and minimizes deviation from the original basis. This procedure yields basis sets with enhanced stability, preserving the closest possible correspondence to the original physical states while satisfying orthogonality. Building on LSO, we also introduce Löwdin weights -- probabilistic weights for non-orthogonal representations that provide a consistent measure of resource content. We explicitly contrast these with Chirgwin-Coulson weights, demonstrating that Löwdin weights ensure non-negativity, a prerequisite for information-theoretic measures. These weights further enable the quantification of coherence and the characterization of superposition, providing a degree of superposition as a distinct measure, as well as facilitating the assessment of state delocalization through entropy and participation ratios. Our theoretical and numerical analyses confirm LSO's superior preservation of quantum state symmetry and resource characteristics, underscoring the critical role of orthogonalization methods and Löwdin weights in resource theory frameworks involving non-orthogonal bases.

Title: Improving Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding
Authors: Jack Morgan, Hamed Mohammadbagherpoor, Eric Ghysels
Abstract: Quantum machine learning holds promise for advancing time series forecasting. The Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN), inspired by classical RNNs, encodes temporal data into quantum states that are periodically input into a quantum circuit. While prior QRNN work has predominantly used angle encoding, alternative encoding strategies like amplitude encoding remain underexplored due to their high computational complexity. In this paper, we evaluate and improve amplitude-based QRNNs using EnQode, a recently introduced method for approximate amplitude encoding. We propose a simple pre-processing technique that augments amplitude encoded inputs with their pre-normalized magnitudes, leading to improved generalization on two real world data sets. Additionally, we introduce a novel circuit architecture for the QRNN that is mathematically equivalent to the original model but achieves a substantial reduction in circuit depth. Together, these contributions demonstrate practical improvements to QRNN design in both model performance and quantum resource efficiency.

Title: Photon emission without quantum jumps
Authors: Thomas Hartwell, Daniel Hodgson, Huda Alshemmari, Gin Jose, Almut Beige
Abstract: When modelling photon emission, we often assume that the emitter experiences a random quantum jump. When a quantum jump occurs, the emitter transitions suddenly into a lower energy level, while spontaneously generating a single photon. However, this point of view is misleading when modelling quantum optical systems which rely on far-field interference effects for applications like distributed quantum computing and non-invasive photonic quantum sensing. In this paper, we highlight that the dynamics of an emitter in the free radiation field can be described by simply solving a Schroedinger equation based on a locally-acting Hamiltonian without invoking the notion of quantum jumps. Our approach is nevertheless consistent with quantum optical master equations.

Title: Comparing quantum incompatibility of device sets from an operational perspective
Authors: Kensei Torii, Ryo Takakura, Ryotaro Imamura
Abstract: To effectively utilize quantum incompatibility as a resource in quantum information processing, it is crucial to evaluate how incompatible a set of devices is. In this study, we propose an ordering to compare incompatibility and reveal its various properties based on the operational intuition that larger incompatibility can be detected with fewer states. We especially focus on typical class of incompatibility exhibited by mutually unbiased qubit observables and numerically demonstrate that the ordering yields new classifications among sets of devices. Moreover, the equivalence relation induced by this ordering is proved to uniquely characterize mutually unbiased qubit observables among all pairs of unbiased qubit observables. The operational ordering also has a direct implication for a specific protocol called distributed sampling.

Title: Long-distance distribution of atom-photon entanglement based on a cavity-free cold atomic ensemble
Authors: Tian-Yu Wang, Ren-Hui Chen, Yan Li, Ze-Hao Shen, Xiao-Song Fan, Zheng-Bang Ju, Tian-Ci Tang, Xia-Wei Li, Jing-Yuan Peng, Zhi-Yuan Zhou, Wei Zhang, Guang-Can Guo, Bao-Sen Shi
Abstract: Constructing a quantum memory node with the ability of long-distance atom-photon distribution is the essential task for future quantum networks, enabling distributed quantum computing, quantum cryptography and remote sensing. Here we report the demonstration of a quantum-network node with a simple cavity-free cold atomic ensemble. This node gives an initial retrieval efficiency of approximately 50\% and memory lifetime of 160 $\mu$s for atomic qubits. With the aid of a high-efficiency and polarization-independent quantum frequency conversion (QFC) module, the generated entangled photon in the node at 780-nm wavelength is converted to telecom S band at 1522 nm, enabling atom-photon distribution over long distance. We observe an entanglement fidelity between the atoms and telecom photon exceeding 80\% after photon transmission over 20-km fiber, the remaining infidelity being dominated by atomic decoherence. The low-noise QFC with an external efficiency up to 48.5\% gives a signal-to-noise-ratio of 6.9 for transmitted photons with fiber length up to 100 km, laying the cornerstone for entanglement distribution at a hundred-km level. This result provides a new platform towards the realization of a long-distance quantum network.

Title: Electronically-controlled one- and two-qubit gates for transmon quasicharge qubits
Authors: Nicholas M. Christopher, Deniz E. Stiegemann, Abhijeet Alase, Thomas M. Stace
Abstract: Superconducting protected qubits aim to achieve sufficiently low error rates so as to allow realization of error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computers. A recent proposal encodes a protected qubit in the quasicharge degree of freedom of the conventional transmon device. Operating such a protected `quasicharge qubit' requires implementing new strategies. Here we show that an electronically-controllable tunnel junction formed by two topological superconductors can be used to implement single- and two-qubit gates on quasicharge qubits. Schemes for both these gates are based on the same dynamical $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and therefore have the same gate times and error characteristics. We simulate the dynamics of a topological Josephson junction in a parameter regime with non-negligible charging energy, and characterize the robustness of such gate operations against charge noise. Our results point to a compelling strategy for implementation of quasicharge qubit gates based on junctions of minimal Kitaev chains of quantum dots.

Title: Mutually Unbiased Bases and Orthogonal Latin Squares- version 2
Authors: Stefan Joka
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the existence of a complete set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in N-dimensional Hilbert space implies the existence of a complete set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLSs) of order N. In particular, we prove that a complete set of MUBs does not exist in dimension six (the first dimension which is not a power of prime).

Title: Taming Barren Plateaus in Arbitrary Parameterized Quantum Circuits without Sacrificing Expressibility
Authors: Zhenyu Chen, Yuguo Shao, Zhengwei Liu, Zhaohui Wei
Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to near-term quantum hardware. Numerical simulations demonstrate that MPQC effectively eliminates barren plateaus in PQCs for preparing thermal states of systems with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers. Furthermore, in end-to-end simulations, MPQC significantly outperforms PQC in finding the ground-state energy of a complex Hamiltonian.

Title: Scalable Quantum Computational Science: A Perspective from Block-Encodings and Polynomial Transformations
Authors: Kevin J. Joven, Elin Ranjan Das, Joel Bierman, Aishwarya Majumdar, Masoud Hakimi Heris, Yuan Liu
Abstract: Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. Recent advancements on these topics are presented including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. The scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures is also highlighted. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.

Title: Universal Quantum Random Access Memory: A Data-Independent Unitary with a Commuting-Projector Hamiltonian
Authors: Leonardo Bohac
Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a central primitive for coherent data access in quantum algorithms, yet it remains controversial in practice because the wall-clock cost of "one lookup" can hide routing depth, control overhead, and geometric constraints. We present a universal QRAM construction (U-QRAM) in which the database is a physical memory register that participates in the lookup unitary as quantum control. This yields a single fixed, data-independent lookup unitary on $A \otimes D \otimes M$ that is correct for all basis-encoded databases. Our first contribution is an explicit, exact Hamiltonian realization: U-QRAM equals a single time-independent evolution $U_{QRAM} = \exp(-iH_{tot})$ where $H_{tot}$ is a sum of mutually commuting projector terms, one per memory cell, and the construction avoids control-dependent phase ambiguities. Our second contribution is an architectural sharpening: under unary (one-hot, mode-addressed) encoding of the address, each cell term becomes uniform and 3-local, delineating the most direct path toward constant-latency interpretations. We keep claims conservative by separating latency from work and stating explicit hardware assumptions required for constant wall-clock queries.

Title: El Agente Cuántico: Automating quantum simulations
Authors: Ignacio Gustin, Luis Mantilla Calderón, Juan B. Pérez-Sánchez, Jérôme F. Gonthier, Yuma Nakamura, Karthik Panicker, Manav Ramprasad, Zijian Zhang, Yunheng Zou, Varinia Bernales, Alán Aspuru-Guzik
Abstract: Quantum simulation is central to understanding and designing quantum systems across physics and chemistry. Yet it has barriers to access from both computational complexity and computational perspectives, due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space and the complexity of modern software tools. Here we introduce{\cinzel El Agente Cuántico}, a multi-agent AI system that automates quantum-simulation workflows by translating natural-language scientific intent into executed and validated computations across heterogeneous quantum-software frameworks. By reasoning directly over library documentation and APIs, our agentic system dynamically assembles end-to-end simulations spanning state preparation, closed- and open-system dynamics, tensor-network methods, quantum control, quantum error correction, and quantum resource estimation. The developed system unifies traditionally distinct simulation paradigms behind a single natural-language interface. Beyond reducing technical barriers, this approach opens a path toward scalable, adaptive, and increasingly autonomous quantum simulation, enabling faster exploration of physical models, rapid hypothesis testing, and closer integration between theory, simulation, and emerging quantum hardware.

Title: Entangled photon triplets using lithium niobate nanophotonics
Authors: Nathan A. Harper, Ayantika Sengupta, Emily Y. Hwang, Scott K. Cushing
Abstract: Multiphoton states are needed for quantum communication and computation. Multiphoton states are significantly more difficult to generate than one- and two-photon states because two individual down-conversion processes must be cascaded. Only efficiencies of $<100$ Hz/mW have been reported to date. We integrate two down-converters on the same thin-film lithium niobate waveguide, significantly enhancing the cascaded process efficiency to $237 \pm 36$ kHz/mW. The measured $4.4 \times 10^{-5}$ probability of the second down-converter, which sets the limit on detectable triplet rates, exceeds those of previous triplet sources by an order of magnitude and demonstrates a path towards MHz rates of triplets for quantum applications.

Title: Four-Photon Interference with a High-Efficiency Quantum Dot Source
Authors: Alistair J. Brash, Luke Brunswick, Mark R. Hogg, Catherine L. Phillips, Malwina A. Marczak, Timon L. Baltisberger, Sascha R. Valentin, Arne Ludwig, Richard J. Warburton
Abstract: While two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility has become a standard metric for single-photon sources, many optical quantum technologies require the generation and manipulation of larger photonic states. To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \pm 0.1~\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \pm 1.0~\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of "deep fringes" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.

Title: Simulating Non-Markovian Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Meng Xu, Vasilii Vadimov, J. T. Stockburger, J. Ankerhold
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies and related experiments have created a need for highly accurate, versatile, and computationally efficient simulation techniques for the dynamics of open quantum systems. Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes. This in turn offers a comprehensive understanding of existing methods, elucidating their physical interpretations, interconnections, and applicability.

Title: Phase-Randomized Laser Pulse Generation at 10 GHz for Quantum Photonic Applications
Authors: Yuen San Lo, Adam H. Brzosko, Peter R. Smith, Robert I. Woodward, Davide G. Marangon, James F. Dynes, Sergio Juárez, Taofiq K. Paraïso, R. Mark Stevenson, Andrew J. Shields
Abstract: Gain-switching laser diodes is a well-established technique for generating optical pulses with random phases, where the quantum randomness arises naturally from spontaneous emission. However, the maximum switching rate is limited by phase diffusion: at high repetition rates, residual photons in the cavity seed subsequent pulses, leading to phase correlations, which degrade randomness. We present a method to overcome this limitation by employing an external source of spontaneous emission in conjunction with the laser. Our results show that this approach effectively removes interpulse phase correlations and restores phase randomization at repetition rates as high as 10 GHz. This technique opens new opportunities for high-rate quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation.

Title: A quantum machine learning classifier to search for new physics
Authors: Ji-Chong Yang, Shuai Zhang, Chong-Xing Yue
Abstract: Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small. Consequently, future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as precision tests advance, rare processes with many final-state particles require consideration which demands the analysis of a vast number of observables. The high luminosity produces a large amount of experimental data spanning a large observable space, posing a significant data-processing challenge. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose quantum searching neighbor~(QSN) and variational QSN~(VQSN) algorithms to search for NP. The QSN is a classification algorithm. The VQSN introduces variation to the QSN to process classical data. As applications, we apply the (V)QSN in the phenomenological study of the NP at the Large Hadron Collider and muon colliders. Examples are implemented on a real quantum hardware, which confirms reliable performance under noisy conditions. The results indicate that the VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency in the sense of computational complexity to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.

Title: Optical vortex generation by magnons with spin-orbit-coupled light
Authors: Ryusuke Hisatomi, Alto Osada, Kotaro Taga, Haruka Komiyama, Takuya Takahashi, Shutaro Karube, Yoichi Shiota, Teruo Ono
Abstract: Light possesses both spin and orbital angular momentum. In spatially asymmetric optical fields, these properties undergo spontaneous coupling, referred to as optical spin-orbit coupling. The study of the coupling has recently become central in modern optics due to its substantial applications in communications, sensing, and quantum control. A key challenge is to clarify the relationship between the origins of spatially asymmetric optical fields and the resulting spin-orbit coupling. Current research focuses on materials and configurations exhibiting spatial asymmetry, such as focusing lenses, interfaces, inhomogeneous media, and metasurfaces. However, Maxwell's equations indicate that matter can introduce both spatial and temporal asymmetry into optical fields. For instance, magnetic ordering breaks the time-reversal symmetry of interacting optical fields via the magneto-optical effect, introducing nonreciprocity in the resulting optical phenomena. Despite the importance, optical phenomena involving both spatially and temporally asymmetric optical fields remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that breaking time and spatial symmetries through magnons and light focusing, respectively, transforms an input Gaussian beam into a specific optical vortex beam in a nonreciprocal manner. This phenomenon is quantitatively explained by integrating the physics of magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering with optical spin-orbit coupling. The observed conservation of total angular momentum, encompassing both magnons and photons, further indicates that magnons can control both spin and orbital angular momentum of light. Finally, we outline future research directions enabled by asymmetric optical fields in both space and time.

Title: Quantum Workshop for IT-Professionals
Authors: Bettina Just, Jörg Hettel, Gerhard Hellstern
Abstract: Quantum computing is gaining strategic relevance beyond research-driven industries. However, many companies lack the expertise to evaluate its potential for real-world applications. Traditional training formats often focus on physical principles without demonstrating practical relevance for their Business Processes, which limits success. This paper presents a user-centered workshop concept tailored to IT professionals without prior quantum knowledge. Using a business simulation game set in a fictitious company, participants explore quantum technologies through relatable, application-driven scenarios. The flexible design allows customization for different organizational contexts. Evaluation results from a one-day implementation at the IT-Tage 2024 indicate clear learning progress and increased awareness of practical use cases. The approach effectively bridges the gap between complex quantum concepts and industry-specific application needs.

Title: Algebraic approach to a $d$-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian with so($d+1)$ symmetry
Authors: Christiane Quesne
Abstract: A novel spin-extended so($d+1$,1) algebra is introduced and shown to provide an interesting framework for discussing the properties of a $d$-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian with spin 1/2 and so($d+1$) symmetry. With some $d+2$ additional operators, spanning a basis of an so($d+1$,1) irreducible representation, the so($d+1$,1) generators provide a very easy way for deriving the integrals of motion of the matrix Hamiltonian in Sturm representation. Such integrals of motion are then transformed into those of the matrix Hamiltonian in Schrödinger representation, including a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector with spin. This leads to a derivation of the latter, as well as its properties in a more extended algebraic framework.

Title: Fast hydrogen atom diffraction through monocrystalline graphene
Authors: Pierre Guichard, Arnaud Dochain, Raphaël Marion, Pauline de Crombrugghe de Picquendaele, Nicolas Lejeune, Benoît Hackens, Paul-Antoine Hervieux, Xavier Urbain
Abstract: We report fast atom diffraction through single-layer graphene using hydrogen atoms at kinetic energies from 150 to 1200 eV. High-resolution images reveal overlapping hexagonal patterns from coexisting monocrystalline domains. Time-of-flight tagging confirms negligible energy loss, making the method suitable for matter-wave interferometry. The diffraction is well described by the eikonal approximation, with accurate modeling requiring the full 3D interaction potential from DFT. Simpler models fail to reproduce the data, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of diffraction patterns to atom-surface interactions and their potential for spectroscopic applications.

Title: The Thermodynamics of the Gravity from Entropy Theory
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory is associated with the GfE Lagrangian given by the Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) between the true metric and the metric induced by the matter fields and the curvature. The GfE action leads to the GfE modified gravity equations displaying an emergent dynamical cosmological constant. Interestingly, the GfE equations of motion reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view and we associate the energy density of the GfE to the emergent dynamical cosmological constant of the theory. Focusing on homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, we reveal that the GfE universes associated with the FRW metrics are thermal. Indeed they are associated with the $k$-temperatures and the $k$-pressures which are related to their local GQRE and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated in the low energy, small curvature limit with matter content modelled as perfect fluid, where the solutions of the GfE equations of motion are well approximated by the Friedmann universes. We show that while the total GQRE per unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of GfE universes is not decreasing in time. These results provide a natural thermodynamic interpretation of GfE cosmologies and a framework for reconciling local complexity with the global increase in entropy of the universe.

Title: Interaction-Induced Quasicrystalline Order: Emergence of Quasi-Solid and Quasi-Supersolid Phases
Authors: Chao Zhang
Abstract: Deterministic quasiperiodicity in quantum systems has long been associated with localization, criticality, or glassy behavior, and has therefore been believed to suppress long-range order rather than stabilize it. Here we demonstrate the opposite: quasiperiodicity in interactions--without any quasiperiodic potential, disorder, or geometric modulation--can generate coherent, ordered quantum phases. We study hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic long-range interactions, V_{ij}=V_0 \cos(\pi \alpha i)\cos(\pi \alpha j), where n=\alpha=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Using large-scale path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover thermodynamically stable incompressible plateaus at irrational densities tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus exhibit sharp incommensurate Bragg peaks, signaling an emergent quasi-solid with long-range quasicrystalline density order. More strikingly, at nearby fillings and interaction strengths, we identify a quasi-supersolid phase that supports both Fibonacci density ordering and finite superfluid density--demonstrating that interaction-induced quasiperiodicity can stabilize supersolid coherence. Our results establish a new mechanism for realizing ordered quasicrystalline quantum matter, and provide realistic guidance for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays, multimode cavity-QED systems, and trapped-ion quantum simulators.

Title: Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation
Authors: Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover
Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.

Title: Quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention for spatial permeability prediction in oilfield reservoirs
Authors: Muzhen Zhang, Yujie Cheng, Zhanxiang Lei
Abstract: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters, especially permeability, is crucial for oil and gas exploration and development. However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.
