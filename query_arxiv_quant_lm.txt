Title: Quantum neural ordinary and partial differential equations
Authors: Yu Cao, Shi Jin, Nana Liu
Abstract: We present a unified framework called Quantum Neural Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (QNODEs and QNPDEs) that brings the continuous-time formalism of classical neural ODEs/PDEs into quantum machine learning and quantum control. We define QNODEs as the evolution of finite-dimensional quantum systems, and QNPDEs as infinite-dimensional (continuous-variable) counterparts, governed by generalised Schrodinger-type Hamiltonian dynamics with unitary evolution, coupled with a corresponding loss function. Notably, this formalism permits gradient estimation using an adjoint-state method, facilitating efficient learning of quantum dynamics, and other dynamics that can be mapped (relatively easily) to quantum dynamics. Using this method, we present quantum algorithms for computing gradients with and without time discretisation, enabling efficient gradient computation that would otherwise be less efficient on classical devices. The formalism subsumes a wide array of applications, including quantum state preparation, Hamiltonian learning, learning dynamics in open systems, and the learning of both autonomous and non-autonomous classical ODEs and PDEs. In many of these applications, we consider scenarios where the Hamiltonian has relatively few tunable parameters, yet the corresponding classical simulation remains inefficient, making quantum approaches advantageous for gradient estimation. This continuous-time perspective can also serve as a blueprint for designing novel quantum neural network architectures, generalising discrete-layered models into continuous-depth models.

Title: Gain-Assisted and Dynamically Controlled Optical Bistability for Quantum Logic Gate Applications
Authors: Parkhi Bhardwaj, Poonam Yadav, Bodhaditya Santra, Shubhrangshu Dasgupta
Abstract: The propagation of a probe field in an N-type four level cold atomic system is investigated under the influence of multiple coherent fields. Coherent control of quantum interference enables switching of the probe field between transparency and gain regimes. Subsequent analysis focuses on how the introduction of gain in the probe transition lowers the threshold for optical bistability, thereby enhancing the nonlinear response of the system at reduced input intensities. A detailed analysis of optical bistability is presented, focusing on its threshold, stability, and switching efficiency as functions of field strengths and detunings. Structured light beams, specifically Laguerre Gaussian modes carrying orbital angular momentum, are employed to tailor the bistable characteristics. The impact of Orbital angular momentum through the topological charge and azimuthal phase is shown to significantly influence the bistable behavior. Based on these features, a theoretical scheme is proposed to realize a Controlled-NOT gate via dynamic modulation of bistability. These results highlight the potential of integrating nonlinear optical effects with structured light in cold atomic systems for implementing scalable quantum logic and advancing photonic information processing.

Title: Finding trail covers: near-optimal decompositions of graph states as linear fusion networks
Authors: William Cashman, Giovanni de Felice, Aleks Kissinger
Abstract: Quantum compilation requires the development of new algorithms that optimise the cost of implementing quantum computations on physical hardware. Often this gives rise to problems which are asymptotically hard to solve classically, and for which heuristics and reductions to known problems are of great practical use. In this paper, we study three graph-theoretic problems which can be seen as generalisations of the Eulerian and Hamiltonian path problems. These arise in photonic implementations of measurement-based quantum computing, where graph states are constructed by fusing bounded-length linear resource states. Since the fusion operation succeeds with probability smaller than one, we wish to minimise the number of fusions required to build a particular graph state and this corresponds to finding a minimal path or trail cover of the graph. We show that these covering problems are NP-hard in most cases and give heuristic algorithms for finding trail covers in graphs including a reduction to the travelling salesman problem. We propose new rewrite strategies for graph states that reduce the number of fusions required to build a given graph. Finally, we apply these algorithms to the compilation of photonic fusion networks and provide a series of benchmarks showing the performance of our algorithms on common error-correcting codes and circuits from the QASMBench set.

Title: Quantum Markovian master equation in the high-temperature limit
Authors: Ricardo C. Zamar, J. Agustín Taboada
Abstract: We present a critical derivation of the high-temperature quantum Markovian master equation (HTME), examining its foundational assumptions, their quantum-mechanical implications, and its range of validity. Starting from the Born-Markov master equation, and combining the spin Hamiltonian eigenoperator formalism with a linear expansion in statistical coefficients, as the only assumption, we obtain a quantum dissipator that generalizes the Abragam-Redfield-Hubbard inhomogeneous master equation (ARH-IME). Our derivation naturally incorporates an additional term for non-thermal, high-order initial states, while reducing to ARH-IME for spin states evolving near thermal equilibrium (weak-order). Through an alternative operator-based derivation of the HTME, we confirm these results and reveal a symmetrization condition for the spectral densities in the linear thermal regime. We rigorously analyze the internal consistency of both approaches and compare them with prior literature. To illustrate these findings, we study: (i) A canonical spin-1/2 system interacting with a bosonic bath, demonstrating first-principles symmetrization of spectral densities at high temperatures. (ii) Singlet-triplet conversion in a correlated two-spin system, where the ARH-IME fails, exposing the limitations of the weak-order hypothesis in strongly correlated regimes. Our results challenge the traditional boundaries of NMR spin-lattice relaxation theory and provide a refined framework for modeling open quantum systems beyond weak order.

Title: state-o-gram --A Novel 2D Visualization for Quantum States
Authors: Fritz Schinkel
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly gaining popularity, necessitating intuitive visualization tools for complex quantum states. While the Bloch Sphere effectively visualizes single-qubit states, it fundamentally lacks scalability for multi-qubit systems. Existing multi-qubit visualization attempts, such as VENUS, have shown promise but often face limitations in scalability beyond a few qubits. This paper introduces state-o-gram, a novel 2D visualization approach designed to intuitively represent quantum states for an arbitrary number of qubits. state-o-gram effectively visualizes probability amplitudes and phase angles in a unified 2D framework, addressing the limitations of prior art. We detail its design principles, visual elements, and application to multi-qubit systems, aiming to provide a scalable and intuitive tool for quantum state analysis. We evaluate the applicability by visualizing the states throughout the Deutsch-Josza algorithm.

Title: A Group-Theoretic Perspective on the PPT and Realignment Entanglement Criteria
Authors: Tobias C. Sutter, Christopher Popp, Beatrix C. Hiesmayr
Abstract: Entanglement is a key feature in many quantum technologies, including secure communication protocols and quantum computing. However, detecting it in mixed quantum states remains a challenging task. While the PPT and realignment criteria are well-established tools for entanglement detection in general, and are especially effective in Bell-diagonal states, their connection to the underlying group structure of this state family has not been fully explored. In this work, we analyze the PPT and realignment criteria for Bell-diagonal states from a group-theoretic point of view. Our results demonstrate that the group structure of Bell-diagonal states provides a clear framework for analyzing and computing these two entanglement detection criteria. This unified perspective offers new insights into the mathematical and physical properties of entanglement in structured quantum systems, like the connection of the PPT criterion to experimentally accessible entanglement witnesses, thus opening a path for extending the group formalism to more complex quantum systems.

Title: Time Domain Design of a Josephson Parametric Amplifier and Comparison with Input Output Theory
Authors: Emre Küçükyılmaz, Mehmet Ünlü, Ali Bozbey
Abstract: Quantum-limited amplifiers, such as Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPAs) and Joseph- son Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs), are essential components in quantum computers. They amplify low-power microwave signals from qubits at the 10 mK stage before further amplification at the 4 K stage using HEMT amplifiers. In JPAs, parametric amplification is based on the nonlinear properties of Josephson Junctions. While JPAs are typically designed and analyzed using input-output theory based on quantum physics, we propose an alternative approach based on an equivalent circuit model of JPAs, implemented using open-source Josephson circuit simula- tors. We compare the results with those obtained from input- output theory. This method enables the use of circuit optimizers for various objective functions and significantly reduces design time compared to quantum theory-based approaches.

Title: Vectorized Attention with Learnable Encoding for Quantum Transformer
Authors: Ziqing Guo, Ziwen Pan, Alex Khan, Jan Balewski
Abstract: Vectorized quantum block encoding provides a way to embed classical data into Hilbert space, offering a pathway for quantum models, such as Quantum Transformers (QT), that replace classical self-attention with quantum circuit simulations to operate more efficiently. Current QTs rely on deep parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), rendering them vulnerable to QPU noise, and thus hindering their practical performance. In this paper, we propose the Vectorized Quantum Transformer (VQT), a model that supports ideal masked attention matrix computation through quantum approximation simulation and efficient training via vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, yielding shot-efficient and gradient-free quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and reduced classical sampling overhead. In addition, we demonstrate an accuracy comparison for IBM and IonQ in quantum circuit simulation and competitive results in benchmarking natural language processing tasks on IBM state-of-the-art and high-fidelity Kingston QPU. Our noise intermediate-scale quantum friendly VQT approach unlocks a novel architecture for end-to-end machine learning in quantum computing.

Title: Entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting fermions on Graphic-Processing-Units
Authors: Bo Fan, Can Yin, Antonio M. García-García
Abstract: The description of the entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting fermions, including the existence of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), is a challenging problem with conflicting results in the literature. The mapping of the problem onto a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) indicates that relatively large lattice sizes are required to determine the nature of the entanglement entropy (EE) in the thermodynamics limit. Here we address this problem numerically for monitored non-interacting fermions with $U(1)$ symmetry. The use of Graphic-Processing-Unit (GPU) techniques, even with outdated hardware, makes possible to reach much larger lattice sizes ($L = 16384$ and $160\times160$ in one (1d) and two (2d) dimensions respectively) than in previous studies which enables us to characterize quantitatively the entanglement dynamics. In 1d, we show that in order to confirm the absence of a MIPT, for both projective and homodyne measurements, predicted by the NLSM it is necessary to reach $L \sim 10000$. In 2d, also as predicted by the NLSM, we observe for both protocols a MIPT at finite monitoring rate characterized by a scale invariant mutual information. The critical monitoring strength depends on the protocol while the critical exponent $\nu \approx 1.3$ governing the approach to the MIPT is similar in both cases. These features are not correctly predicted by the NLSM. Our results paves the way for a fully quantitative description of the entanglement dynamics of monitoring quantum systems.

Title: Can Classical Initialization Help Variational Quantum Circuits Escape the Barren Plateau?
Authors: Yifeng Peng, Xinyi Li, Zhemin Zhang, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Zhiding Liang, Ying Wang
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a leading paradigm in near-term quantum computing, yet their performance can be hindered by the so-called barren plateau problem, where gradients vanish exponentially with system size or circuit depth. While most existing VQA research employs simple Gaussian or zero-initialization schemes, classical deep learning has long benefited from sophisticated weight initialization strategies such as Xavier, He, and orthogonal initialization to improve gradient flow and expedite convergence. In this work, we systematically investigate whether these classical methods can mitigate barren plateaus in quantum circuits. We first review each initialization's theoretical grounding and outline how to adapt the notions from neural networks to VQAs. We then conduct extensive numerical experiments on various circuit architectures and optimization tasks. Our findings indicate that while the initial heuristics, inspired by classical initialization, yield moderate improvements in certain experiments, their overall benefits remain marginal. By outlining a preliminary exploration plan in this paper, we aim to offer the research community a broader perspective and accessible demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose future research directions that may be further refined by leveraging the insights gained from this work.

Title: Extendibility of Fermionic Gaussian States
Authors: Amir-Reza Negari, Farzin Salek
Abstract: We investigate $(k_1,k_2)$-extendibility of fermionic Gaussian states, a property central to quantum correlations and approximations of separability. We show that these states are $(k_1,k_2)$-extendible if and only if they admit a fermionic Gaussian extension, yielding a complete covariance-matrix characterization and a simple semidefinite program (SDP) whose size scales linearly with the number of modes. This provides necessary conditions for arbitrary fermionic states and is sufficient within the Gaussian setting. Our main result is a finite de Finetti--type theorem: we derive trace-norm bounds between $(k_1,k_2)$-extendible fermionic Gaussian states and separable states, improving previous exponential scaling to linear in the number of modes, with complementary relative entropy and squashed entanglement bounds. For two modes, upper and lower bounds match at order $1/\sqrt{k_1 k_2}$. Extendibility also provides operational support for one of the different notions of separability in fermionic systems. Finally, for fermionic Gaussian channels, we provide an SDP criterion for anti-degradability and show that entanglement-breaking channels coincide with replacement channels, implying no nontrivial entanglement-breaking fermionic Gaussian channels exist.

Title: Chiral Discrimination on Gate-Based Quantum Computers
Authors: Muhammad Arsalan Ali Akbar, Sabre Kais
Abstract: We present a novel approach to chiral discrimination using gate-based quantum processors, addressing a key challenge in adapting conventional control techniques using modern quantum computing. Schemes such as stimulated rapid adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAP) have shown strong potential for enantiomer discrimination; their reliance on analog and continuous-time control makes them incompatible with digital gate-based quantum computing architectures. Here, we adapt these protocols for quantum computers by discretizing their Gaussian-shaped pulses through Trotterization. We simulate the chiral molecule 1,2-propanediol and experimentally validate this gate-based implementation on IBM quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that this approach is a viable foundation for advancing chiral discrimination protocols, preparing the way for quantum-level manipulation of molecular chirality on accessible quantum architectures.

Title: Anisotropic Heisenberg Su-Schrieffer-Heeger spin chain as a quantum channel
Authors: Lautaro Moragues, Diego Acosta Coden, Omar Osenda, Alejandro Ferrón
Abstract: Quantum state transmission in spin chains is a fundamental problem within quantum technologies. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, first introduced in the context of polyacetylene, provides a paradigmatic example of a system exhibiting topological and non-topological phases. We explore the transmission of one and two excitations in anisotropic Heisenberg SSH spin chains and analyze the relationship between topological properties and state transfer efficiency. We examine the robustness of quantum state transmission against static disorder in the trivial and topological regimes, exploring how topological protection influences transmission fidelity. We also consider the effect of dipolar interactions, introducing long-range couplings and breaking the conservation of total magnetization. Furthermore, we employ optimal control theory to design driving pulses for state transmission, finding substantial differences between optimizing in the trivial and topological regimes. Our results provide insights about the interplay between topology, disorder, interactions, and control strategies in quantum state transfer.

Title: Violation of kinetic uncertainty relation in maser heat engines: Role of spontaneous emission
Authors: Varinder Singh, Euijoon Kwon, Jae Sung Lee
Abstract: We investigate the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR)-a fundamental trade-off between dynamical activity and current fluctuations-in two configurations of a maser heat engine. We find that KUR violations arise only in one model. This asymmetry originates from spontaneous emission, which breaks the structural symmetry between the configurations and modifies their coherence dynamics. While we analyze several contributing factors-including statistical signatures such as the Fano factor and the ratio of dynamical activity to current-our results show that the decisive mechanism is the slower decoherence in one configuration, which enables quantum violations of the classical steady-state KUR bound. By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration suppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior. These findings highlight the critical role of decoherence mechanisms in determining fundamental thermodynamic bounds and provide insights for the design of quantum heat engines in which the control of decoherence is central to suppressing fluctuations and enhancing reliable performance.

Title: Polarization dynamics of the spin-boson model in the shifted boson Hilbert space
Authors: Yang Zhao, Lipeng Chen
Abstract: Faithfully simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems requires efficiently addressing the challenge of an infinite Hilbert space. Inspired by the shifted boson operator technique used in ground-state studies of the spin-boson model (SBM), we develop a novel algorithm that integrates a shifted optimized boson basis with the time-evolving block decimation method. We validate our approach by accurately reproducing the polarization dynamics of the sub-Ohmic SBM at a significantly reduced computational cost. For the Ohmic SBM, we demonstrate that the time-evolved final state converges precisely to the variational prediction at both zero and finite temperatures. Furthermore, our method reveals a new aperiodic pseudocoherent phase in the super-Ohmic SBM with an initially polarized bath. This work establishes an efficient and powerful approach for simulating the real-time dynamics of open quantum systems.

Title: Achieving High-Quality Portfolio Optimization with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Anbang Wang, Zhonggang Lv, Zhenyuan Ma, Dunbo Cai, Zhihong Zhang
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a fundamental problem in finance that aims to determine the optimal allocation of assets within a portfolio to maximize returns while minimizing risk. It can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, which is NP-hard. Quantum computing offers the potential to solve such problems more efficiently than classical methods. In this work, we employ the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to address the portfolio optimization problem. To increase the likelihood of converging to high-quality solutions, we propose using the Weighted Conditional Value-at-Risk (WCVaR) as the cost function and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) as the optimizer. Our experiments are conducted using the classical simulations on the Wuyue QuantumAI platform. The results demonstrate that the combination of WCVaR and CMA-ES leads to improved performance in solving the portfolio optimization problem.

Title: Enhanced Algorithmic Perfect State Transfer on IBM Quantum Computers
Authors: Zong-Yuan Ge, Lian-Ao Wu, Zhao-Ming Wang
Abstract: Perfect state transfer (PST) through a spin chain can be theoretically obtained via predesigned PST couplings. However, the corresponding experiment on IBM quantum computers demonstrates low transmission success probability (SP) due to noises. Using few qubits of their 127-qubit Eagle processors, we perform the simulation of algorithmic PST through an XY spin chain with PST couplings on ibm_sherbrooke and ibm_brisbane processors, alongside Qiskit simulations. The peak SP cannot reach 1 ($\sim$0.725 peak SP for N=4). We then propose a comprehensive noise model including Pauli errors, thermal relaxation ($T_1$) and dephasing ($T_2$), and ZZ crosstalk. Based on the experimental parameters provided by the IBM superconducting quantum computing platform, we perform the Qiskit simulation with the comprehensive noise model, and find that the time evolution of the SP is highly consistent with the experimental results. This simulation yields a peak SP of 0.761 at $\textstyle t\approx\pi/4$, closely matching the results on hardware. To mitigate the impact of noise, we use rescaling techniques to correct noise-induced time shifts and SP decay, achieving an SP improvement of 0.210 (27.60%) in simulators and 0.263 (38.23%) on hardware, aligning hitting times closer to ideal values. Additionally, optimal couplings designed via grid search and refined by Bayesian optimization under the comprehensive noise model achieve an SP improvement of 0.190 (26.21%) in simulators and 0.056 (7.72%) on hardware. Our work highlights challenges in implementing algorithmic PST on current quantum computers, proposes a comprehensive noise model to effectively describe the system dynamics, and provides insights for developing noise-robust quantum communication protocols.

Title: Equality condition for a matrix inequality by partial transpose
Authors: Nalan Wang, Lin Chen
Abstract: The partial transpose map is a linear map widely used quantum information theory. We study the equality condition for a matrix inequality generated by partial transpose, namely $\rank(\sum^K_{j=1} A_j^T \otimes B_j)\le K \cdot \rank(\sum^K_{j=1} A_j \otimes B_j)$, where $A_j$'s and $B_j$'s are respectively the matrices of the same size, and $K$ is the Schmidt rank. We explicitly construct the condition when $A_i$'s are column or row vectors, or $2\times 2$ matrices. For the case where the Schmidt rank equals the dimension of $A_j$, we extend the results from $2\times 2$ matrices to square matrices, and further to rectangular matrices. In detail, we show that $\sum^K_{j=1} A_j \otimes B_j$ is locally equivalent to an elegant block-diagonal form consisting solely of identity and zero matrices. We also study the general case for $K=2$, and it turns out that the key is to characterize the expression of matrices $A_j$'s and $B_j$'s.

Title: On-Demand Zeeman Nuclear Frequency Comb Quantum Memory
Authors: Yanli Shi, Xiwen Zhang, Yuri Shvyd'ko, Olga Kocharovskaya
Abstract: The emerging hard X-ray - nuclear interfaces offer unique potential advantages over traditional optical-atomic interfaces for room-temperature, solid-state quantum information processing, including lower background noise, tighter focusing, and exceptionally high resonance quality. Leveraging such interfaces, a major milestone was recently achieved with the first implementation of nuclear quantum memory in the hard X-ray range [S. Velten et al., Nuclear quantum memory for hard X-ray photon wave packets, Sci. Adv. 10, eadn9825 (2024)] using the Doppler frequency comb protocol. However, this approach relies on the synchronous mechanical motion of multiple nuclear absorbers, posing experimental challenges for on-demand photon retrieval. We propose an on-demand hard X-ray quantum memory based on reversing the direction of an external magnetic field in a single stationary solid-state nuclear absorber with sets of Zeeman sublevels. This scheme is exemplified by the quantum storage of an 1.41-$\mu$s single photon wave packet at 6.2 keV for over 10 $\mu$s in a $^{181}$Ta metallic foil, providing a feasible pathway for the first experimental demonstration of on-demand hard X-ray photon storage.

Authors: Arianne Ornella Lemo, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Deepa Kundur, Adam W. Skorek
Abstract: The convergence of digital twin technology and quantum computing is opening new horizons for the modeling, control, and optimization of smart grid systems. This paper reviews the current research landscape at the intersection of these fields, with a focus on how quantum algorithms can enhance the performance of digital twins in smart energy systems. We conduct a thematic literature review and identify key research trends, technical challenges, and gaps in real-world adoption. Further, a conceptual framework is proposed to integrate quantum modules into classical digital twin architectures. The potential benefits of this hybrid approach for smart grid operation and future research directions are also discussed.

Title: Quantum computing on encrypted data with arbitrary rotation gates
Authors: Mohit Joshi, Manoj Kumar Mishra, S. Karthikeyan
Abstract: An efficient technique of computing on encrypted data allows a client with limited capability to perform complex operations on a remote fault-tolerant server without leaking anything about the input or output. Quantum computing provides information-theoretic security to solve such a problem, and many such techniques have been proposed under the premises of half-blind quantum computation. However, they are dependent on a fixed non-parametric resource set that comprises some universal combination of $H,S,T,CX, CZ$ or $CCX$ gates. In this study, we show that recursive decryption of the parametric gate, $R_z(\theta)$, is possible exactly when $\theta=\pm\pi/2^m$ for $m\in \mathbb{Z^{+}}$, and approximately with arbitrary precision $\epsilon$ for given $\theta$. We also show that a blind algorithm based on such a technique needs at most $O(\log_2^2(\pi/\epsilon))$ computation steps and communication rounds, while the techniques based on a non-parametric resource set require $O(\ln^{3.97}(1/\epsilon))$ rounds. We use these results to propose a universal scheme of half-blind quantum computation for computing on encrypted data using arbitrary rotation gates. This substantial reduction in the depth of blind circuit is an affirmative step towards the practical application of such techniques in secure NISQ-era computing.

Title: Spontaneous Collapse Models
Authors: Matteo Carlesso, Sandro Donadi
Abstract: Collapse models are phenomenological models introduced to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. They modify the Schrödinger equation by adding non-linear and stochastic terms, which induce the wavefunction collapse in space. The collapse effects are negligible for microscopic systems but become dominant in the macroscopic regime, thus also describing coherently the quantum-to-classical transition. Collapse models make different predictions compared to those of quantum mechanics; hence they can be tested. Here we introduce the most relevant collapse models present in the literature, and describe their main features. We also discuss how one can test them in different experiments, underlying the differences with predictions of quantum mechanics, and show how these experiments can set bounds on the collapse parameters. We conclude with a brief summary of the colored and dissipative generalization of such models and their experimental tests.

Title: Quantum-Circuit-Based Visual Fractal Image Generation in Qiskit and Analytics
Authors: Hillol Biswas
Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite its simplicity, the Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics produces incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit, highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape based on a quantum art theme.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Branch-and-Price Method for the Vertex Coloring Problem
Authors: Chiara Vercellino, M. Yassine Naghmouchi, Wesley Coelho, Giacomo Vitali, Alberto Scionti, Paolo Viviani, Olivier Terzo, Bartolomeo Montrucchio
Abstract: This paper introduces Quantum Classical Branch-and-Price (QCBP), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the Vertex Coloring problem on neutral-atom Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). QCBP embeds quantum computation within the classical Branch-and-Price (BP) framework to address three bottlenecks in classical BP algorithms: the computational cost of Pricing Subproblems (PSPs), branching efficiency, and the quality of primal heuristics. It uses quantum-assisted Column Generation (CG) based on Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms (QAA) to sample high-quality maximum-weight independent sets (MWIS), reducing the need to repeatedly solve NP-hard PSPs. The adapted branching strategy leverages quantum-generated independent sets to explore fewer nodes, tighten lower bounds, and converge faster. A classical primal heuristic rapidly builds feasible solutions from quantum-generated sets, avoiding unnecessary quantum calls or additional Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solves. Compared with our prior Hybrid Column Generation (HCG) and Branch-and-Bound through maximal Independent Set (BBQ-mIS), QCBP improves both quantum-resource utilization and solution quality. Extensive experiments show QCBP significantly outperforms HCG and BBQ-mIS, reaching optimality on $\approx 98\%$ of benchmark instances. Preliminary validation on real neutral-atom hardware indicates robustness to quantum noise and hardware constraints, supporting practical applicability and scalability to larger graph instances. QCBP emerges as a viable hybrid method for combinatorial optimization with promising scalability on near-term quantum hardware.

Title: Quantum Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Spin Chains at Criticality
Authors: Zijun Wei, Mingdi Xu, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan
Abstract: The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.

Title: Controlling the $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry Breaking Threshold in Bipartite Lattice Systems with Floquet Topological Edge States
Authors: Xinguang Li, Hongzheng Wu, Yangchun Zhao, Jinpeng Xiao, Yu Guo, Lei Li, Yajiang Chen, Xiaobing Luo
Abstract: We investigate the control of the parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetry breaking threshold in a periodically driven one-dimensional dimerized lattice with spatially symmetric gain and loss defects. We elucidate the contrasting roles played by Floquet topological edge states in determining the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking threshold within the high- and low-frequency driving regimes. In the high-frequency regime, the participation of topological edge states in $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking is contingent upon the position of the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric defect pairs, whereas in the low-frequency regime, their participation is unconditional and independent of the defect pairs placement, resulting in a universal zero threshold. We establish a direct link between the symmetry-breaking threshold and how the spatial profile of the Floquet topological edge states evolves over one driving period. We further demonstrate that lattices with an odd number of sites exhibit unique threshold patterns, in contrast to even-sized systems. Moreover, applying co-frequency periodic driving to the defect pairs, which preserves time-reversal symmetry, can significantly enhance the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-breaking threshold.

Title: Amplifying Two-Mode Squeezing in Nanomechanical Resonators
Authors: Muhdin Abdo Wodedo, Tesfay Gebremariam Tesfahannes, Tewodros Yirgashewa Darge, Mauro Pereira, Berihu Teklu
Abstract: Quantum squeezing plays a crucial role in enhancing the precision of quantum metrology and improving the efficiency of quantum information processing protocols. We thus propose a scheme to amplify two-mode squeezing in nanomechanical resonators, harnessing parametric amplification and two-tone laser controls. The red-detuned laser drives facilitate the cooling of the nanomechanical resonators down to their ground state and allow optimal quantum state transfer in the weak-coupling, resolved sideband regime. In particular, the competing blue-detuned lasers in the driving pairs induce displacement squeezing in mechanical resonators. Thus, the quantum state transfer of the squeezing in nanomechanical resonators and the intracavity correlated photons of the parametric amplifier significantly enhance the two-mode mechanical squeezing. Notably, increasing the coupling strength of the red detuned laser and the ratio of blue-to-red detuned laser dramatically amplifies the two-mode mechanical squeezing under realistic experiment parameters of a typical optomechanical system. Our findings reveal that the proposed cooperative mechanism effectively enhances the level of two-mode mechanical squeezing with a considerable improvement and demonstrates exceptional resilience to thermal noise.

Title: Optical charge state manipulation of lead-vacancy centers in diamond
Authors: Yiyang Chen, Yoshiyuki Miyamoto, Eiki Ota, Ryotaro Abe, Takashi Taniguchi, Shinobu Onoda, Mutsuko Hatano, Takayuki Iwasaki
Abstract: Group-IV vacancy centers in diamond exhibit excellent optical and spin coherence properties, making them highly promising and scalable spin qubit candidates. Since only specific charge states are magneto-optically active, control over the charge state is fundamental for quantum applications. Here, we realize the charge state control of lead-vacancy centers (PbV) through multi-color laser irradiation. We achieve tunable population manipulation of the negatively charged state from 0 to 89%, paving the way for spin control of the negatively charged PbV center. Furthermore, through analysis of charge state dynamics, we propose a charge cycle between the neutral and negatively charged states, indicating a possible pathway to the neutral PbV center with a spin-1 system.

Title: Iterative Partition Search Variational Quantum Algorithm for Solving Shortest Vector Problem
Authors: Zi-Wen Huang, Xiao-Hui Ni, Jia-Cheng Fan, Su-Juan Qin, Wei Huang, Bing-Jie Xu, Fei Gao
Abstract: The Partition Search Algorithm (PSA) and the Iterative Quantum Optimization with an Adaptive Problem (IQOAP) framework are two existing Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) for solving the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), but both suffer from certain limitations. In this work, we proposed the Iterative Partition Search Algorithm (IPSA), which is a targeted synthesis and refinement of these preceding methods. Our algorithm inherits the core idea of ``partitioning to circumvent the zero vector" from PSA and the ``iterative lattice basis reduction" framework from IQOAP. A key feature of IPSA is the ``1-tailed search spaces", which can be viewed as a highly constrained variant of PSA's partitioning strategy, specifically designed for optimal performance within IQOAP's iterative structure. We supplant IQOAP's fixed iteration count with a dynamic, stack-managed process and substitute a more expressive and shallower circuit structure for its original ansatz. Crucially, the 1-tailed design fundamentally ensures that every successful VQA execution yields an effective lattice basis update, thereby eliminating the issue of ineffective iterations in IQOAP. This evolutionary path of refinement allows IPSA to overcome the drawbacks of its predecessors precisely. Numerical simulations on 4- to 6-dimensional SVP instances demonstrate that IPSA achieves at least a 73\% improvement in success rate for finding optimal solutions and over a 35\% improvement in average solution quality compared with the methods above while maintaining comparable total circuit depth.

Title: Private Quantum Database
Authors: Giancarlo Gatti, Rihan Hai
Abstract: Quantum databases open an exciting new frontier in data management by offering privacy guarantees that classical systems cannot match. Traditional engines tackle user privacy, which hides the records being queried, or data privacy, which prevents a user from learning more than she has queried. We propose a quantum database that protects both by leveraging quantum mechanics: when the user measures her chosen basis, the superposition collapses and the unqueried rows become physically inaccessible. We encode relational tables as a sequence of Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) over mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), transmit a bounded number of quantum states, and let a single, destructive measurement reconstruct only the selected tuple. This allows us to preserve data privacy and user privacy at once without trusted hardware or heavyweight cryptography. Moreover, we envision a novel hybrid quantum-classical architecture ready for early deployment, which ensures compatibility with the limitations of today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.

Title: Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators
Authors: Hong-Ye Hu, Abigail McClain Gomez, Liyuan Chen, Aaron Trowbridge, Andy J. Goldschmidt, Zachary Manchester, Frederic T. Chong, Arthur Jaffe, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Title: Improved lower bound for the worst case Pretty Good Measurement
Authors: Austin Pechan, Sergio Escobar
Abstract: We derive a new lower bound on the success probability of the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM) for worst-case quantum state discrimination among $m$ pure states. Our bound is strictly tighter than the previously known Gram-matrix-based bound for $m\geq 4$. The proof adapts techniques from Barnum and Knill's analysis of the average-case PGM, applied here to the worst-case scenario. By comparing the PGM to the sequential measurement algorithm, we obtain a guarantee showing that, in the low-fidelity regime, the PGM's success probability decreases quadratically with respect to the pairwise overlap, rather than linearly as in earlier bounds.

Title: Efficient and scalable inter-module switching for distributed quantum computing architectures
Authors: Kamil Bradler
Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers of the future will likely be modular by necessity or by design. Modularity is inevitable if the substrate cannot support the desired error-correction code due to its planar geometry or manufacturing constraints resulting in a limited number of logical qubits per module. Even if the computer is compact enough there may be functional requirements to distribute the quantum computation substrate over distant regions of varying scales. In both cases, matter-based quantum information, such as spins, ions or neutral atoms, is the most conveniently transmitted or mediated by photonic interconnects. To avoid long algorithm execution times and reduce errors, each module of a universal quantum computer should be dynamically interconnected with as many other modules as possible. This task relies on an optical switching network providing any-to-any or sufficiently high simultaneous connectivity. In this work we construct several novel and decentralized switching schemes based on the properties of the Generalized Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (GMZI) that are more economic and less noisy compared to commonly considered alternatives while achieving the same functionality.

Title: Work extraction from a quantum battery charged through an array of coupled cavities
Authors: I. Beder, D. Ferraro, P. A. Brandão
Abstract: We investigate the problem of work extraction from a cavity-based quantum battery that is remotely charged via a transmission line composed of an array of coupled single-mode cavities. For uniform coupling along the line, we show that the ergotropy of the battery, evaluated at the point of maximum power transfer, decreases with the length of the charging line and vanishes beyond a critical size. By carefully engineering the initial state of the charger, nonzero ergotropy can still be harvested even beyond this critical length. We further examine scenarios in which the charging line is initialized in an entangled state, as well as configurations with nonuniform, parabolically varying coupling strengths. In the latter case, we demonstrate that high ergotropy values can be restored, highlighting the potential of spatially engineered interactions to enhance quantum battery performance.

Title: Architecting Distributed Quantum Computers: Design Insights from Resource Estimation
Authors: Dmitry Filippov, Peter Yang, Prakash Murali
Abstract: To enable practically useful quantum computing, we require hundreds to thousands of logical qubits (collections of physical qubits with error correction). Current monolithic device architectures have scaling limits beyond few tens of logical qubits. To scale up, we require architectures that orchestrate several monolithic devices into a distributed quantum computing system. Currently, resource estimation, which is crucial for determining hardware needs and bottlenecks, focuses exclusively on monolithic systems. Our work fills this gap and answers key architectural design questions about distributed systems, including the impact of distribution on application resource needs, the organization of qubits across nodes and the requirements of entanglement distillation (quantum network). To answer these questions, we develop a novel resource estimation framework that models the key components of the distributed execution stack. We analyse the performance of practical quantum algorithms on various hardware configurations, spanning different qubit speeds, entanglement generation rates and distillation protocols. We show that distributed architectures have practically feasible resource requirements; for a node size of 45K qubits, distributed systems need on average 1.4X higher number of physical qubits and 4X higher execution time compared to monolithic architectures, but with more favourable hardware implementation prospects. Our insights on entanglement generation rates, node sizes and architecture have the potential to inform system designs in the coming years.

Title: Unquestionable Bell theorem for interwoven frustrated down conversion processes
Authors: Paweł Cieśliński, Marcin Markiewicz, Konrad Schlichtholz, Jan-Åke Larsson, Marek Żukowski
Abstract: In the Wang et al. paper "Violation of Bell inequality with unentangled photons'' [Science Advances, 1 Aug 2025 Vol 11, Issue 31], in which a brilliant experiment involving two interwoven frustrated down conversion processes is reported, Bell non-classicality of the observed interference processes is conjectured under some tacit additional assumptions. To clear any doubts about Bell non-classicality of the interference processes observed by Wang et al., we give an unconditional Bell-type proof that a modified version of the experiment indeed would reveal a violation of local realism. The data of the Wang et al. experiment show destructive interference which surpasses the required threshold for Bell non-classicality in the modified version, and thus effectively constitutes a positive experimental Bell non-classicality test employing our proposal. The essence of our method is to abandon the usual approach in which macroscopically controlled optical phases define the measurement settings in a Bell experiment. Instead, in our case, the local settings are determined by switching on or off the local pumping fields of the parametric down conversion crystals at the local measuring stations of "Alice and Bob''. We also show that in a standard framework of local hidden variable theories that do not require any additional assumptions, it is possible to construct a local realistic model which exactly reproduces the probabilities on which the conjecture by Wang et al. violation of local realism was based. Thus, we prove that the tacit additional assumptions in the Bell analysis of Wang et al. constrain the class of local realistic models refuted by the experiment. Also, we claim that the non-classical effects in the Wang et al. experiment cannot be ascribed to unentangled photons.

Title: Optimal quantum simulation of linear non-unitary dynamics
Authors: Guang Hao Low, Rolando D. Somma
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution generated by any bounded, time-dependent operator $-A$ with non-positive logarithmic norm, thereby serving as a natural generalization of the Hamiltonian simulation problem. Our method generalizes the recent Linear-Combination-of-Hamiltonian-Simulation (LCHS) framework. In instances where $A$ is time-independent, we provide a block-encoding of the evolution operator $e^{-At}$ with $\mathcal{O}\big(t\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ queries to the block-encoding oracle for $A$. We also show how the normalized evolved state can be prepared with $\mathcal{O}(1/\|e^{-At}|{\vec{u}_0}\rangle\|)$ queries to the oracle that prepares the normalized initial state $|{\vec{u}_0}\rangle$. These complexities are optimal in all parameters and improve the error scaling over prior results. Furthermore, we show that any improvement of our approach exceeding a constant factor of approximately 3 is infeasible. For general time-dependent operators $A$, we also prove that a uniform trapezoidal rule on our LCHS construction yields exponential convergence, leading to simplified quantum circuits with improved gate complexity compared to prior nonuniform-quadrature methods.

Title: New Twists on Topological Quantum Error Correcting Codes
Authors: Mohamad Mousa, Amit Jamadagni, Eugene Dumitrescu
Abstract: We derive a new family of quantum error-correcting codes. The main technical tool used to do so is the physically intuitive concept of condensation, which is employed to create new domain walls between the quantum double of $\Z_4$ and an instance of the doubled semion phase. Specifically, we provide explicit constructions, first at the lattice-level and then subsequently at the macroscopic logical-level. To provide intuition, we provide a series of explicit examples using the derived topological interfaces. We discuss the code's utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error-correction with an emphasis on the interplay between logical error rates and decoding. We conclude by outlining how such codes' representation and design can be automated. We expect our results, which provide explicit step-by-step instructions in the form of algorithms, to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in configurations that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.

Title: On Quantum BSDE Solver for High-Dimensional Parabolic PDEs
Authors: Howard Su, Huan-Hsin Tseng
Abstract: We propose a quantum machine learning framework for approximating solutions to high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that can be reformulated as backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). In contrast to popular quantum-classical network hybrid approaches, this study employs the pure Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) as the core solver without trainable classical neural networks. The quantum BSDE solver performs pathwise approximation via temporal discretization and Monte Carlo simulation, framed as model-based reinforcement learning. We benchmark VQCbased and classical deep neural network (DNN) solvers on two canonical PDEs as representatives: the Black-Scholes and nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The VQC achieves lower variance and improved accuracy in most cases, particularly in highly nonlinear regimes and for out-of-themoney options, demonstrating greater robustness than DNNs. These results, obtained via quantum circuit simulation, highlight the potential of VQCs as scalable and stable solvers for highdimensional stochastic control problems.

Title: Mapping of Fermionic Lattice Models for Ising Solvers
Authors: Lakshya Nagpal, Aditya Kumar, S. R. Hassan
Abstract: We present an end-to-end, symmetry-aware pipeline that converts interacting fermionic and quantum-spin models into annealer-ready QUBOs while preserving low-energy physics. The workflow combines Bravyi-Kitaev encoding, exact Z2 symmetry tapering, Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) diagonalization to a Z-only form, and k-local to 2-local quadratization, with ground energies recovered via a Dinkelbach fixed-point over the resulting Ising objective. We validate the approach across a complexity ladder: (i) a frustrated 2D Ising model run on a D-Wave Advantage QPU reproduces the known ferromagnet-stripe transition; (ii) finite-temperature checks on 1D Ising recover standard finite-size trends; (iii) a genuinely quantum spin target (XXZ) matches exact diagonalization (ED) on small chains; and (iv) interacting fermions (t-V) in 1D (rings L=2-8) show ED-level energies and the expected kink near V/t ~ 2, with a 2D 2x2 cluster tracking ED slopes up to a uniform offset. A replication-factor study quantifies the accuracy-overhead trade-off, with order-of-magnitude error reduction and diminishing returns beyond r ~ Nq. Except for the classical Ising benchmark and molecular benchmarks, experiments use D-Wave's public DIMOD and Neal simulators; a molecular benzene case in the appendix illustrates portability beyond lattices. The results establish a practical pathway for mapping quantum matter to current annealers, with clear knobs for fidelity, resources, and embedding.

Title: ER = EPR in Loop Quantum Gravity: the Immirzi Parameter and the Continuum Limit
Authors: Fabrizio Tamburini
Abstract: We recast the finite-region analysis of Einstein's equations that underpins the ER=EPR program into the loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework. By translating curvature-energy uncertainty relations into holonomy-flux kinematics, and by identifying Planckian Einstein-Rosen throats with single-puncture cuts through spin networks, we obtain a precise dictionary between entanglement and quantum geometry. Within this dictionary we derive the Barbero-Immirzi parameter directly from the entanglement/area increment of a minimal bridge, and show that a boundary edge-mode construction renders the Bekenstein - Hawking entropy coefficient universal and independent of $\gamma$ under a natural complex polarization. We further establish a refinement renormalization flow for spin-foam amplitudes driven by the finite-region curvature energy bound, which suppresses bubble divergences and yields a regulator-independent continuum limit under explicit conditions. Finally, we indicate observational consequences that follow from an $N$-party generalized uncertainty relation.

Title: Driven inhomogeneous CFT as a theory in curved space-time
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger, Jani Kastikainen, Tim Schuhmann
Abstract: For two-dimensional conformal field theories driven by evolving background space-time metrics in a closed universe, we present an operator formulation as a driven inhomogeneous CFT. The Hamiltonian of this theory is given by a background space-time dependent smearing of the stress tensor over the spatial slice. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of the curved-space Weyl anomaly, which we show is realized by the difference between Schrödinger and Heisenberg picture Hamiltonians once an appropriate renormalization scheme, the chirally split scheme, is chosen. As a result, the unitary evolution generated by the background metric coincides with that of a Virasoro quantum circuit. To showcase our formalism, we consider the stress tensor one-point function and the entanglement entropy of an interval in both operator and curved-space formulations. We find that these curved-space observables admit a state interpretation only in the chirally split scheme. Finally, we derive the holographic dual of the driven CFT in three-dimensional gravity, extending previous works to arbitrary driving. The holographic dictionary reproduces the stress tensor one-point function and the entanglement entropy in a diffeomorphism invariant scheme.

Title: Destructive Interference induced constraints in Floquet systems
Authors: Somsubhra Ghosh, Indranil Paul, K. Sengupta, Lev Vidmar
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of destructive many-body interference between quantum trajectories as a means to systematically generate prethermal kinetically constrained dynamics in Floquet systems driven at special frequencies. Depending on the processes that are suppressed by interference, the constraint may or may not be associated with an emergent global conservation; the latter kind having no mechanism of generation in time-independent settings. As an example, we construct an one-dimensional interacting spin model exhibiting strong Hilbert space fragmentation with and without dipole moment conservation, depending on the drive frequency. By probing the spatiotemporal profile of the out-of-time-ordered correlator, we show that this model, in particular, has initial states in which quantum information can be spatially localized - a useful feature in the field of quantum technologies. Our paradigm unifies various types of Hilbert space fragmentation that can be realized in driven systems.

Title: Imprints of screened dark energy on non-local quantum correlations
Authors: Fabiano Feleppa, Gaetano Lambiase, Sunny Vagnozzi
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.

Title: Twisted light drives chiral excitations of interacting electrons in nanostructures with magnetic field
Authors: F.J. Rodríguez, L. Quiroga, N.F.Johnson
Abstract: Twisted light (TL), a special kind of light carrying orbital angular momentum, provides a powerful tool for driving symmetry resolved transitions in quantum confined nanostructures. We study a realistic model where a TL pulse excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. To include image charge effects in layered systems, we use an effective electron electron potential of the form 1/r^n. For n = 2, the system exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and angular momentum resolved absorption. We show that the bare Coulomb 1/r interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light driven excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise symmetry-forbidden. In particular, TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem, exposing internal excitations through multi quanta orbital processes. More broadly, our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations, symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems, uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption.

Title: Breaking Through Barren Plateaus: Reinforcement Learning Initializations for Deep Variational Quantum Circuits
Authors: Yifeng Peng, Xinyi Li, Zhemin Zhang, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Zhiding Liang, Ying Wang
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality. Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum, especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

Title: Theoretical and experimental study of the correlation between pulsed light repetition frequency and electric field measurement
Authors: Ke Di, Chenglin Ye, Yijie Du, Meihui Liu, Pengfei Shi, Yu Liu, Jiajia Du, Jun He
Abstract: We innovatively propose a method to improve the performance of Rydberg atom sensors based on the repetition frequency of pulsed lasers, which is verified in experiments. Rydberg atoms excited by pulsed lasers are influenced significantly by the repetition frequency of the pulsed laser on the Rydberg state population. As the number of Rydberg atoms increases, the measurement sensitivity of the sensor to external fields also increases, directly enhancing the performance of the sensor. This paper investigates the response of the sensor to the same electric field when the repetition frequency of the pulsed laser is at the MHz level, with a focus on its gain effects on the broadcast communication frequency bands of 66MHz and 88MHz. This study validates the unique advantages of pulsed light for Rydberg atom excitation, improving the effective detection of weak signals and providing a new approach for fabricating more sensitive atomic sensors.

Title: Isofrequency spin-wave imaging using color center magnetometry for magnon spintronics
Authors: Samuel Mañas-Valero, Yasmin C. Doedes, Artem Bondarenko, Michael Borst, Samer Kurdi, Thomas Poirier, James H. Edgar, Vincent Jacques, Yaroslav M. Blanter, Toeno van der Sar
Abstract: Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature. Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the spin-wave control fields -selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy axes orthogonal to the film magnetization- and by using color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave technologies.

Title: Weighted Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method for interacting fermions: An application to ultracold Fermi superfluids
Authors: Nikolai Kaschewski, Axel Pelster, Carlos A. R. Sá de Melo
Abstract: For several decades it has been known that divergences arise in the ground-state energy and chemical potential of unitary superfluids, where the scattering length diverges, due to particle-hole scattering. Leading textbooks and research articles recognize that there are serious issues but ignore them due to the lack of an approach that can regularize these divergences. We find a solution to this difficulty by proposing a general method, called the weighted Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, to handle multiple decomposition channels originating from the same interaction. We distribute the interaction in weighted channels determined by minimization of the action, and we apply this idea to unpolarized Fermi superfluids. Using our method, we solve a long-standing difficulty in the partitioning of the interaction into Hartree, Fock, and Bogoliubov channels for Fermi superfluids, and we obtain a phase diagram at the saddle-point level, which contains multichannel nonperturbative corrections. In particular, we find a previously overlooked superfluid phase for weak interactions, which is dominated by particle-hole processes, in addition to the usual superfluid phase only containing particle-particle physics.

Title: Single-Photon Detection in Few-Layer NbSe$_2$ Superconducting Nanowires

Abstract: Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies due to their ability to detect single photons with ultra-high efficiency, low dark counts and fast temporal resolution. Superconducting materials exhibiting high uniformity, large absorption cross-section and atomic-scale thickness are desirable to extend single-photon detection from the near-infrared up to the terahertz regime, where existing material choices are especially constrained. Substrate independence would further open the way to integrate detectors onto functional materials and heterostructures, enhancing performance and enabling proximal read-out of a wide range of individual excitations. Here, we top-down shape the prototypical two-dimensional superconductor niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) into few-layer nanowires less than 100 nm wide and demonstrate single-photon detection at 780 and 1550 nm. At the same time, the dark-count rate remains below 1 Hz up to the switching current and we achieve a timing jitter below 50 ps. We use a diffusive hot-spot model to estimate a theoretical cut-off wavelength that surpasses the millimetre range. Our results open up routes toward quantum limited detectors integrated into quantum-photonic circuits and quantum devices, with the potential for novel detection capabilities and unprecedented energy sensitivity.

Title: Photo-Thermally Tunable Photon-Pair Generation in Dielectric Metasurfaces
Authors: Omer Can Karaman, Hua Li, Elif Nur Dayi, Christophe Galland, Giulia Tagliabue
Abstract: Photon-pair sources based on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in integrated photonics are often spectrally static. We demonstrate and model a fundamental thermo-optical mechanism that modulates photon-pair generation in amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films and metasurfaces via SFWM. Femtosecond-pulsed excitation yields g2(0) higher than 400 in unpatterned a-Si, confirming high-purity nonclassical emission. Resonant a-Si metasurfaces produce photon pairs at rates exceeding 3.8 kHz under 0.6 mW pump power through Mie-type modes. Pump absorption induces localized heating that redshifts resonances, altering modal overlap and SFWM efficiency, leading to deviations from the quadratic power scaling expected in the undepleted regime. Coupled electromagnetic and heat-transfer simulations quantitatively reproduce these trends. Polarization-resolved measurements show nearly isotropic nonlinear responses, with 3 times higher third-order susceptibility of a-Si compared to poly-Si. This work positions a-Si as a bright, CMOS-compatible quantum photonics platform and identifies thermo-optical detuning as a key mechanism that should be considered-and potentially harnessed-in integrated photon-pair sources.

Title: Measuring high field gradients of cobalt nanomagnets in a spin-mechanical setup
Authors: Felix Hahne, Teresa Klara Pfau, Liza Žaper, Lucio Stefan, Thibault Capelle, Andrea Ranfagni, Martino Poggio, Albert Schliesser
Abstract: Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.

Title: Temperature dependence in Krylov space
Authors: Nikolaos Angelinos, Debarghya Chakraborty, Anatoly Dymarsky
Abstract: We consider the recursion method applied to a generic 2pt function of a quantum system and show, in full generality, that the temperature dependence of the corresponding Lanczos coefficients is governed by integrable dynamics. After an appropriate change of variables, Lanczos coefficients with even and odd indices are described by two independent Toda chains, related at the level of the initial conditions. Consistency of the resulting equations can be used to show that certain scale-invariant models necessarily have a degenerate spectrum. We dub this self-consistency-based approach the ''Krylov bootstrap''. The known analytic behavior of the Toda chain at late times translates into analytic control over the 2pt function and Krylov complexity at very low temperatures. We also discuss the behavior of Lanczos coefficients when the temperature is low but not much smaller than the spectral gap, and elucidate the origin of the staggering behavior of Lanczos coefficients in this regime.

Title: Phase Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Tellurium Flakes
Authors: Mohammad Hafijur Rahaman, Nathan Sawyers, Mourad Benamara, Trudie Culverhouse, Repaka Maheswar, Qiyuan He, Hugh Churchill, Dharmraj Kotekar Patil
Abstract: Elemental tellurium (Te) is a compelling van der Waals material due to its interesting chiral crystal structure and predicted topological properties. Here, we report the fabrication and comprehensive quantum transport study of devices based on Te flakes with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate a hole mobility reaching up to 1000 cm2/V.s in a 17 nm thick flake at 30 Kelvin. At deep cryogenic temperatures (< 50mK), the transport characteristics transition from Coulomb blockade in the low carrier density regime to pronounced Fabry-Pérot (F-P) interference at higher densities. Notably, the visibility of these F-P oscillations is significantly enhanced in the thinner flake device. The application of a magnetic field reveals a clear Zeeman splitting of the conductance peaks. The rich variety of quantum transport phenomena observed underscores the high quality of our thin Te flakes and establishes them as a promising platform for exploring novel physics and device concepts, such as topological superconductivity and low-power spintronic applications.

Title: A Quantum Theory with Non-Collapsing Measurements
Authors: Vincenzo Fiorentino, Stefan Weigert
Abstract: A collapse-free version of quantum theory is examined to systematically study the role of the projection postulate. This foil theory assumes "passive" measurements that do not update quantum states although measurement outcomes still occur probabilistically, and in accordance with Born's rule. The Hilbert space setting of quantum theory is retained. "Passive quantum theory" is shown to reproduce preparational uncertainty relations, the no-cloning theorem, and no-signalling, among other properties. Striking differences occur, however, if protocols involve post-measurement states. For example, a single system, rather than an ensemble, is sufficient to reconstruct the state of the system. The possibility to "observe" a state increases the computational power of some quantum algorithms. Passive quantum theory is not locally tomographic but capable of "simulating" quantum measurements modulo a finite delay. Outcome probabilities for composite systems may violate Bell inequalities, without however entailing an argument against local hidden variables.

Title: Quantum multifractality as a probe of phase space in the Dicke model
Authors: Miguel A. Bastarrachea-Magnani, David Villaseñor, Jorge Chávez-Carlos, Sergio Lerma-Hernández, Lea F. Santos, Jorge G. Hirsch
Abstract: We study the multifractal behavior of coherent states projected in the energy eigenbasis of the spin-boson Dicke Hamiltonian, a paradigmatic model describing the collective interaction between a single bosonic mode and a set of two-level systems. By examining the linear approximation and parabolic correction to the mass exponents, we find ergodic and multifractal coherent states and show that they reflect details of the structure of the classical phase space, including chaos, regularity, and features of localization. The analysis of multifractality stands as a sensitive tool to detect changes and structures in phase space, complementary to classical tools to investigate it. We also address the difficulties involved in the multifractal analyses of systems with unbounded Hilbert spaces.

Title: Local Harmonic Approximation to Quantum Mean Force Gibbs State
Authors: Prem Kumar
Abstract: When the strength of interaction between a quantum system and bath is non-negligible, the equilibrium state can deviate from the Gibbs state. But the expression of such a mean force Gibbs state in an arbitrary parameter regime is unknown and is numerically challenging to determine. In this work, we first review the local harmonic approximation to this problem [Maier et al., Phys. Rev. E 81, 021107 (2010)], which can accurately determine the mean force Gibbs state when either the system-bath coupling or the temperature is large, or when the third and higher derivatives of the potential are small compared to certain system-bath specific parameters. In the appropriate limit, we show that the local harmonic approximation reduces to the ultra-strong coupling and high temperature results recently derived in the literature. After deriving an estimate for the error induced by this method, we apply it to study some systems, like a quartic oscillator and a particle in a quartic double-well potential. We also apply this method to analyze the proton tunneling problem in a DNA recently studied in literature [Slocombe et al., Comm. Phys., vol. 5, no. 1, p. 109, 2022], where our results suggest the equilibrium value of the probability of mutation to be orders of magnitude lower than the steady state value obtained there ($10^{-8}$ vs $10^{-4}$).

Title: Learnability of a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for graph-structured quantum data
Authors: Yanying Liang, Sile Tang, Zhehao Yi, Haozhen Situ, Zhu-Jun Zheng
Abstract: Graph-structured data commonly arise in many real-world applications, and this extends naturally into the quantum setting, where quantum data with inherent graph structures are frequently generated by typical quantum data sources. However, existing state-of-the-art models often lack training and evaluation on deeper quantum neural networks. In this work, we design a hybrid quantum-classical neural network with deep residual learning, termed Res-HQCNN, specifically designed to handle graph-structured quantum this http URL upon this architecture, we systematically explore the interplay between residual block structures and graph information in both training and testing phases. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that incorporating graph structure information into the quantum data significantly improves learning efficiency compared to the existing model. Additionally, we conduct comparative experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of residual blocks. Our results show that the residual structure enables deeper Res-HQCNN models to learn graph-structured quantum data more efficiently and accurately.

Title: Coordinating Decisions via Quantum Telepathy
Authors: Dawei Ding, Liang Jiang
Abstract: Quantum telepathy is the phenomenon where two non-communicating parties can exhibit correlated behaviors that are impossible to achieve using classical resources. This is also known as Bell inequality violation and is made possible by quantum entanglement. In this work, we present a conceptual framework for applying quantum telepathy to real-world problems. In general, the problems involve multiple parties making local observations that need to coordinate their decisions but are unable to communicate. We argue this inability is actually quite prevalent in the modern era where the decision-making timescales of computer processors are so short that the speed of light delay is appreciable in comparison. We highlight the example of high-frequency trading (HFT), where trades are made at microsecond timescales, but the speed of light delay between different stock exchanges are on the order of 100 microseconds to 10 milliseconds. Due to the maturity of Bell inequality violation experiments, experimental realization of quantum telepathy schemes that can attain a quantum advantage for real-world problems $\textit{is already almost immediately possible}$. We demonstrate this by conducting a case study for a concrete HFT scenario that gives rise to a generalization of the CHSH game and evaluate different possible physical implementations for achieving a quantum advantage. It is well known that Bell inequality violation is a rigorous mathematical proof of a quantum advantage over any classical strategy and does not need any complexity-theoretic assumptions such as $\text{BQP}\neq\text{BPP}$. Moreover, fault tolerance is not necessary to realize a quantum advantage: for example, violating the CHSH inequality only requires single-qubit operations on two entangled physical qubits.

Title: Continuity bounds for quantum entropies arising from a fundamental entropic inequality
Authors: Koenraad Audenaert, Bjarne Bergh, Nilanjana Datta, Michael G. Jabbour, Ángela Capel, Paul Gondolf
Abstract: We establish a tight upper bound for the difference in von Neumann entropies between two quantum states, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$. This bound is expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropies of the mutually orthogonal states derived from the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the difference operator $(\rho_1 - \rho_2)$. This yields a novel entropic inequality that implies the well-known Audenaert-Fannes (AF) inequality. In fact, it also leads to a refinement of the AF inequality. We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide. We additionally use it to derive a continuity bound for the quantum relative entropy in both variables. Interestingly, the fundamental entropic inequality is also valid in infinite dimensions.

Title: An abstract structure determines the contextuality degree of observable-based Kochen-Specker proofs
Authors: Axel Muller, Alain Giorgetti
Abstract: This article delves into the concept of quantum contextuality, specifically focusing on proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem obtained by assigning Pauli observables to hypergraph vertices satisfying a given commutation relation. The abstract structure composed of this hypergraph and the graph of anticommutations is named a hypergram. Its labelings with Pauli observables generalize the well-known magic sets. A first result is that all these correct quantum labelings of a given hypergram inherently possess the same degree of contextuality. Then we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such quantum labelings and an efficient algorithm to find one of them. We finally attach to each assignable hypergram an abstract notion of contextuality degree. By presenting the study of observable-based Kochen-Specker proofs from the perspectives of graphs and matrices, this abstraction opens the way to new methods to search for original contextual configurations.

Title: Flow of dynamical causal structures with an application to correlations
Authors: Ämin Baumeler, Stefan Wolf
Abstract: Causal models capture cause-effect relations both qualitatively - via the graphical causal structure - and quantitatively - via the model parameters. They offer a powerful framework for analyzing and constructing processes. Here, we introduce a tool - the flow of causal structures - to visualize and explore the dynamical aspect of classical-deterministic processes, arguably like those present in general relativity. The flow describes all possible ways in which the causal structure of a process can evolve. We also present an algorithm to construct its supergraph - the superflow - from the causal structure only, without invoking the model parameters. As an application, we show that if all leaves of a flow are trivial, then the corresponding process produces causal correlations only, i.e., correlations where future data cannot influence past events. This strengthens the result that processes, where every directed cycle in their causal structure is chordless, establish causal correlations only. We also discuss the main difficulties for the quantum generalization of the present algorithms.

Title: Targeted Clifford logical gates for hypergraph product codes
Authors: Adway Patra, Alexander Barg
Abstract: Starting with an explicit framework for designing logical Clifford circuits for CSS codes, we construct logical gates for Hypergraph Product Codes. We first derive symplectic matrices for CNOT, CZ, Phase, and Hadamard operators, which together generate the Clifford group. This enables us to design explicit transformations that result in targeted logical gates for arbitrary codes in this family. As a concrete example, we give logical circuits for the $[[18,2,3]]$ toric code.

Title: Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions
Authors: Subhayan Sahu, Guifre Vidal
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.

Title: Classical simulability of Clifford+T circuits with Clifford-augmented matrix product states
Authors: Zejun Liu, Bryan K. Clark
Abstract: Determining the quantum-classical boundary between quantum circuits which can be efficiently simulated classically and those which cannot remains a fundamental question. One approach to classical simulation is to represent the output of a quantum circuit as a Clifford-augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) which, via a disentangling algorithm, decomposes the wave function into Clifford and MPS components and from which Pauli expectation values can be computed in time polynomial in the MPS bond-dimension. In this work, we develop an optimization-free disentangling (OFD) algorithm for Clifford circuits either doped with multi-qubit gates of the form $\alpha I+\beta P$. We give a simple algebraic criterion which characterizes the individual quantum circuits for which OFD generates an efficient CAMPS - the bond-dimension is exponential in the null space of a GF(2) matrix induced by a tableau of the twisted Pauli strings $P$. This significantly increases the number of circuits with rigorous polynomial time classical simulations. We also give evidence that the typical $N$ qubit random Clifford circuit doped with $N$ uniformly distributed $T$ gates of poly-logarithmic depth or greater has a CAMPS with polynomial bond-dimension. In addition, we compare OFD against disentangling by optimization. We further explore the representability of CAMPS for random Clifford circuits doped with more than $N$ $T$-gates. We also propose algorithms for sampling, probability and amplitude estimation of bitstrings, and evaluation of entanglement Rényi entropy from CAMPS, which, though still having exponential complexity, are more efficient than standard MPS simulations. This work establishes a versatile framework for understanding classical simulatability of Clifford+$T$ circuits and explores the interplay between quantum entanglement and quantum magic in quantum systems.

Title: Squeezing generation crossing a mean-field critical point: Work statistics, irreversibility and critical fingerprints
Authors: Fernando J. Gómez-Ruiz, Stefano Gherardini, Ricardo Puebla
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical consequences of quantum phase transitions on thermodynamical quantities, such as work statistics and entropy production, is one of the most intriguing aspect of quantum many-body systems, pinpointing the emergence of irreversibility to critical features. In this work, we investigate the critical fingerprints appearing in these key thermodynamical quantities for a mean-field critical system undergoing a finite-time cycle, starting from a thermal state at a generic inverse temperature. In contrast to non-zero dimensional many-body systems, the presence of a mean-field critical point in a finite-time cycle leads to constant irreversible work even in the limit of infinitely slow driving. This links with the fact that a slow finite-time cycle results in a constant amount of squeezing, which enables us to derive analytical expressions for the work statistics and irreversible entropy, depending solely on the mean-field critical exponents and the functional form of the control parameter near the critical point. We find that the probability of observing negative work values, corresponding to negative irreversible entropy, is inversely proportional to the time the system remains near to the critical point, and this trend becomes less pronounced the lower the temperature of the initial thermal state. Finally, we determine the irreversibility traits under squeezing generation at zero-temperature using the relative entropy of coherence.

Title: Harnessing Quantum Dynamics for Robust and Scalable Quantum Extreme Learning Machines
Authors: Payal D. Solanki, Anh Pham
Abstract: Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) is an emerging hybrid quantum machine learning framework that leverages quantum system dynamics to enhance classical models. However, QELM can suffer from the exponential concentration problem, where excessive entanglement reduces model expressivity. In this work, we gain insight into this challenge and demonstrate how tensor network methods specifically, the Time Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) with Matrix Product States (MPS) can efficiently simulate quantum systems while controlling entanglement and mitigating exponential concentration. Using numerical experiments on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, we show that time-evolving an MPS system modeled as a chain of Rydberg atoms produces high-quality data embeddings with low classical computational overhead. Our findings indicate that exact simulation of quantum dynamics is not necessary for strong machine learning performance; even approximate quantum embeddings can yield competitive results. Furthermore, we observe that both increased disorder in the quantum state achieved by tuning Hamiltonian parameters and careful control of entanglement directly correlate with improved model accuracy, highlighting the importance of these factors in optimizing QELM performance.

Title: Eigen-SNAP gate for photonic qubits in a cavity-transmon system
Authors: Marcus Meschede, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.

Title: Relativistic limits on the discretization and temporal resolution of a quantum clock
Authors: Tommaso Favalli
Abstract: We provide a brief discussion regarding relativistic limits on the discretization and temporal resolution of time values in a quantum clock. Our clock is characterized by a time observable chosen to be the complement of a bounded and discrete Hamiltonian which can have an equally-spaced or a generic spectrum. In the first case the time observable can be described by an Hermitian operator and we find a limit in the discretization for the time eigenvalues. Nevertheless, in both cases, the time observable can be described by a POVM and, by increasing the number of time states, we can arbitrarily reduce the bound on the minimum time quantum, demonstrating that we can safely take the time values as continuous when the number of time states tends to infinity. Finally, we find a limit for temporal resolution of our time observable when the clock is used (together with light signals) in a relativistic framework for measuring spacetime distances.

Title: Spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric sphere in the modified Langevin noise formalism
Authors: Giovanni Miano, Loris Maria Cangemi, Carlo Forestiere
Abstract: This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter is described via two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density and initial quantum state. For initial thermal states of the two reservoirs at different temperatures, the standard approach based on the knowledge of the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object at the quantum emitter position cannot be employed. We map the two reservoirs to a single equivalent reservoir with a temperature-dependent effective spectral density and initially in its vacuum state, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach.

Title: Predictability of quantum observables: Applications in QKD and top quarks
Authors: Dennis I. Martínez-Moreno, Miguel Castillo-Celeita, Diego G. Bussandri
Abstract: We deepen our understanding of transmitting classical information using quantum means by analyzing the prediction of local quantum observables enhanced by quantum correlations. Our approach focuses on two complementary measures of prediction error, the Bayes risk and the inference variance, both rooted in statistical learning theory. We provide, to our knowledge, the first analytical minimizations of these quantities for arbitrary two-qubit states, together with the optimal measurement strategies. We further analyze their averaged forms, revealing a direct connection to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criteria. We also embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol, demonstrating higher secure-key rates than the standard BB84 scheme under realistic noise. Finally, we illustrate our results for (i) amplitude-damped Bell pairs, and (ii) spin correlations in top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy collisions, highlighting quantum states produced in colliders as a novel platform for quantum information tasks.

Title: Recycling Reflections for Perfect Photon Capture
Authors: Yat Wong, Liang Jiang
Abstract: Efficient photon capture in optical cavities is essential for quantum networks and computing, yet single-pass methods suffer from uncaptured reflections due to finite capture windows and coupling strengths, precluding perfect transfer of arbitrary photonic states. We introduce a two-pass `pitch-and-catch' method that recycles initial reflections to achieve perfect capture of arbitrary pulses in the noiseless regime and enhances fidelity under intrinsic losses. The method extends to photon emission, enabling arbitrary pulse shaping. This advance offers significant improvements for quantum repeaters, memories, and transduction, enhancing the toolkit for quantum information processing.

Title: Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics
Authors: Tian-Hua Yang, Dmitry A. Abanin
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.

Title: Out of Tune: Demystifying Noise-Effects on Quantum Fourier Models
Authors: Maja Franz, Melvin Strobl, Leonid Chaichenets, Eileen Kuehn, Achim Streit, Wolfgang Mauerer
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have received substantial theoretical and empirical attention. As the underlying variational quantum circuit (VQC) can be represented by Fourier series that contain an exponentially large spectrum in the number of input features, hope for quantum advantage remains. Nevertheless, it remains an open problem if and how quantum Fourier models (QFMs) can concretely outperform classical alternatives, as the eventual sources of non-classical computational power (for instance, the role of entanglement) are far from being fully understood. Likewise, hardware noise continues to pose a challenge that will persist also along the path towards fault tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we study VQCs with Fourier lenses, which provides possibilities to improve their understanding, while also illuminating and quantifying constraints and challenges. We seek to elucidate critical characteristics of QFMs under the influence of noise. Specifically, we undertake a systematic investigation into the impact of noise on the Fourier spectrum, expressibility, and entangling capability of QFMs through extensive numerical simulations and link these properties to training performance. The insights may inform more efficient utilisation of quantum hardware and support the design of tailored error mitigation and correction strategies. Decoherence imparts an expected and broad detrimental influence across all Ansätze. Nonetheless, we observe that the severity of these deleterious effects varies among different model architectures, suggesting that certain configurations may exhibit enhanced robustness to noise and show computational utility.

Title: Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology

Title: Abelian multi-cycle codes for single-shot error correction
Authors: Hsiang-Ku Lin, Pak Kau Lim, Alexey A. Kovalev, Leonid P. Pryadko
Abstract: We construct a family of quantum low-density parity-check codes locally equivalent to higher-dimensional quantum hypergraph-product (QHP) codes. Similarly to QHP codes, the proposed codes have highly redundant sets of low-weight stabilizer generators, which improves decoding accuracy in a fault-tolerant regime and gives them single-shot properties. The advantage of the new construction is that it gives shorter codes. We derive simple expressions for the dimension of the proposed codes in two important special cases, give bounds on the distances, and explicitly construct some relatively short codes. Circuit simulations for codes locally equivalent to 4-dimensional toric codes show a (pseudo)threshold close to 1.1%, better than for toric or surface codes with a similar noise model.

Title: Barren-plateau free variational quantum simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theories
Authors: Fariha Azad, Matteo Inajetovic, Stefan Kühn, Anna Pappa
Abstract: In this work, we design a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) suitable for investigating ground states and static string breaking in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT). We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore, strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.

Title: Positive-divisibility of Subsystems in Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Anumita Mukhopadhyay, Praggnyamita Ghosh, Shibdas Roy
Abstract: It is known that the existence of memory effect can revive quantum correlations in open system dynamics. In this regard, the backflow of information from environment to the system can be identified with Complete Positive (CP) indivisibility as well as Positive (P) indivisibility criteria. It is also known that if a quantum system is CP-divisible, it can also have memory effect which can be witnessed by P-indivisibility. Here, we have explored the relation of P-divisibility with unitality condition of noise channels, showing that a unital channel is P-divisible. We have shown how a system channel and its environment need to be both P-divisible, but cannot be both P-indivisible, provided the system-environment joint quantum state evolves unitarily. We have also established our results using three unitaries acting on different sets of states. In particular, due to backflow of information from the environment, quantumness of a system can increase, as shown for an example of the three-qubit W state.

Title: Why Bohmian velocity might not be the only quantum velocity and the role of quantum diffusion flux is super-luminal wave packets
Authors: Charalampos Antonakos
Abstract: In this short-length paper, we will present some math that play a central role in quantum hydrodynamics and that were presented by Mita in the past. In this formulation of QM, a quantity is involved which is called the diffusion flux. As we will see, this quantity plays a crucial role on the evolution of wave packets. More specifically, we will initially briefly explain some results derived in Mita's papers, by analyzing Gaussian and soliton wave packets, while our main focus is on the role of diffusion in the evolution of super-luminal wave packets. Also, A very brief discussion will be made about the presence of the osmotic velocity field in quantum dynamics

Title: Realizing Parrondo's Paradox in Single-Qubit Quantum Walks via Local Phase-Induced Spatial Inhomogeneity
Authors: Ran-Yu Chang, Yun-Hsuan Chen, Gooi Zi Liang, Tsung-Wei Huang
Abstract: Parrondo's paradox describes a counterintuitive phenomenon where alternating between two individually losing games results in a winning expectation. While its classical origin relies on capital-dependent bias and noise-induced asymmetry, realizing a robust quantum version of the paradox has remained challenging, especially under the constraint of single-qubit coin systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a genuine quantum Parrondo effect can emerge in discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) by alternating two SU(2) coin operators and introducing a localized phase shift at the origin. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that this minimal model, without entanglement or high-dimensional coins, exhibits sustained positive drift only in the presence of spatial inhomogeneity. We analyze the role of phase angle, coin parameters, and game sequences, and identify optimal regions in which constructive interference enables paradoxical transport. Our findings validate recent theoretical claims that translational symmetry breaking is essential for overcoming interference-induced cancellation, thereby enabling directed quantum motion. This work opens new possibilities for realizing counterintuitive quantum dynamics using low-resource architectures, with potential applications in quantum control, energy harvesting, and coherence-assisted transport.

Title: Random Unitaries in Constant (Quantum) Time
Authors: Ben Foxman, Natalie Parham, Francisca Vasconcelos, Henry Yuen
Abstract: Random unitaries are a central object of study in quantum information, with applications to quantum computation, quantum many-body physics, and quantum cryptography. Recent work has constructed unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) using $\Theta(\log \log n)$-depth unitary circuits with two-qubit gates. In this work, we show that unitary designs and PRUs can be efficiently constructed in several well-studied models of $\textit{constant-time}$ quantum computation (i.e., the time complexity on the quantum computer is independent of the system size). These models are constant-depth circuits augmented with certain nonlocal operations, such as (a) many-qubit TOFFOLI gates, (b) many-qubit FANOUT gates, or (c) mid-circuit measurements with classical feedforward control. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware suggest experimental feasibility of these models in the near future. Our results demonstrate that unitary designs and PRUs can be constructed in much weaker circuit models than previously thought. Furthermore, our construction of PRUs in constant-depth with many-qubit TOFFOLI gates shows that, under cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial-time learning algorithm for the circuit class $\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Finally, our results suggest a new approach towards proving that PARITY is not computable in $\mathsf{QAC}^0$, a long-standing question in quantum complexity theory.

Title: Optimal Circuit Size for Fixed-Hamming-Weight Quantum States Preparation
Authors: Jingquan Luo, Lvzhou Li
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently preparing fixed-Hamming-weight (HW-$k$) quantum states, which are superpositions of $n$-qubit computational basis states with exactly $k$ ones. We present a quantum circuit construction that prepares any $n$-qubit HW-$k$ state with a circuit size of $O(\binom{n}{k})$ using at most $\max\{0, n-3\}$ ancillary qubits. This is the first construction that achieves the theoretical lower bound on circuit size while using only a small number of ancillary qubits. We believe that the techniques presented in this work can be extended to other quantum state preparation algorithms based on decision diagrams, potentially reducing the reliance on ancillary qubits or lowering the overall circuit size.

Title: Efficient Non-Adaptive Quantum Algorithms for Tolerant Junta Testing
Authors: Zongbo Bao, Yuxuan Liu, Penghui Yao, Zekun Ye, Jialin Zhang
Abstract: We consider the problem of deciding whether an $n$-qubit unitary (or $n$-bit Boolean function) is $\varepsilon_1$-close to some $k$-junta or $\varepsilon_2$-far from every $k$-junta, where $k$-junta unitaries act non-trivially on at most $k$ qubits and as the identity on the rest, and $k$-junta Boolean functions depend on at most $k$ variables. For constant numbers $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2$ such that $0 < \varepsilon_1 < \varepsilon_2 < 1$, we show the following. (1) A non-adaptive $O(k\log k)$-query tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for $k$-junta unitaries when $2\sqrt{2}\varepsilon_1 < \varepsilon_2$. (2) A non-adaptive tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for Boolean functions with $O(k \log k)$ quantum queries when $4\varepsilon_1 < \varepsilon_2$. (3) A $2^{\widetilde{O}(k)}$-query tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for $k$-junta unitaries for any $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2$. The first algorithm provides an exponential improvement over the best-known quantum algorithms. The second algorithm shows an exponential quantum advantage over any non-adaptive classical algorithm. The third tester gives the first tolerant junta unitary testing result for an arbitrary gap. Besides, we adapt the first two quantum algorithms to be implemented using only single-qubit operations, thereby enhancing experimental feasibility, with a slightly more stringent requirement for the parameter gap.

Title: Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization
Authors: Hayato Goto, Ryo Hidaka, Kosuke Tatsumura
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.

Title: Collinear Three-Photon Excitation of a Strongly Forbidden Optical Clock Transition
Authors: Samuel P. Carman, Jan Rudolph, Benjamin E. Garber, Michael J. Van de Graaff, Hunter Swan, Yijun Jiang, Megan Nantel, Mahiro Abe, Rachel L. Barcklay, Jason M. Hogan
Abstract: The ${{^1\mathrm{S}_0}\!-\!{^3\mathrm{P}_0}}$ clock transition in strontium serves as the foundation for the world's best atomic clocks and for gravitational wave detector concepts in clock atom interferometry. This transition is weakly allowed in the fermionic isotope $^{87}$Sr but strongly forbidden in bosonic isotopes. Here, we demonstrate coherent excitation of the clock transition in bosonic ${}^{88}$Sr using a novel collinear three-photon process in a weak magnetic field. We observe Rabi oscillations with frequencies of up to $50~\text{kHz}$ using $\text{W}/\text{cm}^{2}$ laser intensities and Gauss-level magnetic field amplitudes. The absence of nuclear spin in bosonic isotopes offers decreased sensitivity to magnetic fields and optical lattice light shifts, enabling atomic clocks with reduced systematic errors. The collinear propagation of the laser fields permits the interrogation of spatially separated atomic ensembles with common laser pulses, a key requirement for dark matter searches and gravitational wave detection with next-generation quantum sensors.

Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.

Title: Multi-timescale time encoding for CNN prediction of Fenna-Matthews-Olson energy-transfer dynamics
Authors: Shun-Cai Zhao, Yi-Meng Huang, Yi-Fan Yang, Zi-Ran Zhao
Abstract: Machine learning simulations of open quantum dynamics often rely on recursive predictors that accumulate error. We develop a non-recursive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that maps system parameters and a redundant time encoding directly to excitation-energy-transfer populations in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The encoding-modified logistic plus $\tanh$ functions-normalizes time and resolves fast, transitional, and quasi-steady regimes, while physics-informed labels enforce population conservation and inter-site consistency. Trained only on 0\(\sim\)7 \(ps\) reference trajectories generated with a Lindblad model in QuTiP, the network accurately predicts 0\(\sim\)100 \(ps\) dynamics across a range of reorganization energies, bath rates, and temperatures. Beyond 20 \(ps\), the absolute relative error remains below 0.05, demonstrating stable long-time extrapolation. By avoiding step-by-step recursion, the method suppresses error accumulation and generalizes across timescales. These results show that redundant time encoding enables data-efficient inference of long-time quantum dissipative dynamics in realistic pigment-protein complexes, and may aid the data-driven design of light-harvesting materials.

Title: Dynamically assisted Klein tunneling in the Furry picture
Authors: Makoto Ochiai, Shunsuke Shibayama
Abstract: One-dimensional scattering of a wave packet of a relativistic fermion under a temporally oscillating electric field superimposed on a potential step is discussed by using the Furry-picture perturbation theory, where the oscillating electric field is treated as a perturbation. Reflection and transmission probabilities of the wave packet, which in its single-mode limit are consistent with those in the stationary scattering off the potential step alone, are investigated up to the second order. We show that even in the absence of the so-called Klein region, a positive-frequency incoming wave can penetrate the negative-frequency region below the potential step by emitting its energy to the oscillating electric field with a finite tunneling probability.

Title: Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral
Authors: Sami Kaya, Pratik Rath, Kyle Ritchie
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the Rényi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.

Title: Revisiting the operator extension of strong subadditivity
Authors: Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming
Abstract: We give a new proof of the operator extension of the strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy $\rho_{AB} \otimes \sigma_{C}^{-1} \leq \rho_{A} \otimes \sigma_{BC}^{-1}$ by identifying the mathematical structure behind it as Connes' theory of spatial derivatives. This immediately generalizes the inequality to arbitrary inclusions of von Neumann algebras. In the case of standard representations, it reduces to the monotonicity of the relative modular operator.
