Title: Study of the Quartic Anharmonic Oscillator Using the System's Wave Function Expansion in the Oscillator Basis
Authors: V. A. Babenko, A. V. Nesterov
Abstract: The quantum quartic anharmonic oscillator with the Hamiltonian $H=\frac{1}{2}\left( p^{2}+x^{2}\right) +\lambda x^{4}$ is a classical and fundamental model that plays a key role in various branches of physics, including quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, high-energy particle physics, and other areas. To study this model, we apply a method based on a convergent expansion of the system's wave function in a complete set of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions -- namely, the basis of eigenfunctions $\varphi^{(0)}_n$ of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H^{(0)}=\frac{1}{2}\left(p^{2}+x^{2}\right)$. This approach enables a thorough analysis and calculation of the oscillator's physical characteristics. We demonstrate very good convergence of all calculated quantities with respect to the number of basis functions included in the expansion, over a wide range of $\lambda$ values. We have computed the energies of the ground and the first six excited states for a broad range of the coupling constant $\lambda$, and also calculated and constructed the corresponding wave functions. Additionally, we propose and detail an improved version of the expansion method using a modified optimized oscillator basis with variable frequency. This modification significantly accelerates the convergence of expansions across the entire range of $\lambda$, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of the method and allowing accurate calculations with a very small number of expansion functions $N\lesssim 10$. As a result, this modified approach provides an essentially complete, simple, and efficient solution to the problem of the anharmonic oscillator, enabling straightforward computation of all its physical properties -- including the energies and wave functions of both ground and excited states -- for arbitrary values of $\lambda$.

Title: Quantum strategies, error bounds, optimality, and duality gaps for multiplayer XOR, $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, compiled XOR, $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and strong parallel repetiton of XOR, $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and FFL games
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We characterize exact, and approximate, optimality of games that players can interact with using quantum strategies. In comparison to a previous work of the author, arXiv: 2311.12887, which applied a 2016 framework due to Ostrev for constructing error bounds beyond CHSH and XOR games, in addition to the existence of well-posed semidefinite programs for determining primal feasible solutions, along with quantum-classical duality gaps, it continues to remain of interest to further develop the construction of error bounds, and related objects, to game-theoretic settings with several participants. In such settings, one encounters a rich information theoretic landscape, not only from the fact that there exists a significantly larger combinatorial space of possible strategies for each player, but also several opportunities for pronounced quantum advantage. We conclude this effort by describing other variants of other possible strategies, as proposed sources for quantum advantage, in $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, compiled $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and strong parallel repetition variants of $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ games.

Title: 2D Quon Language: Unifying Framework for Cliffords, Matchgates, and Beyond
Authors: Byungmin Kang, Chen Zhao, Zhengwei Liu, Xun Gao, Soonwon Choi
Abstract: Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.

Title: Quasiprobabilistic imaginary-time evolution on quantum computers
Authors: Annie Ray, Esha Swaroop, Ningping Cao, Michael Vasmer, Anirban Chowdhury
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution plays an important role in algorithms for computing ground-state and thermal equilibrium properties of quantum systems, but can be challenging to simulate on classical computers. Many quantum algorithms for imaginary-time evolution have resource requirements that are prohibitive for current quantum devices and face performance issues due to noise. Here, we propose a new algorithm for computing imaginary-time evolved expectation values on quantum computers, inspired by probabilistic error cancellation, an error-mitigation technique. Our algorithm works by decomposing a Trotterization of imaginary-time evolution into a probabilistic linear combination of operations, each of which is then implemented on a quantum computer. The measurement data is then classically post-processed to obtain the expectation value of the imaginary-time evolved state. Our algorithm requires no ancillary qubits and can be made noise-resilient without additional error mitigation. It is well-suited for estimating thermal expectation values by making use of the notion of a thermal pure quantum state. We demonstrate our algorithm by performing numerical simulations of thermal pure quantum state preparation for the 1D Heisenberg Hamiltonian on 8 qubits, and by using an IBM quantum computer to estimate the energy of the same Hamiltonian on 2 qubits. We observe promising results compared to the exact values, illustrating the potential of our algorithm for probing the physics of quantum many-body systems on current hardware.

Title: Quantum State Preparation via Large-Language-Model-Driven Evolution
Authors: Qing-Hong Cao, Zong-Yue Hou, Ying-Ying Li, Xiaohui Liu, Zhuo-Yang Song, Liang-Qi Zhang, Shutao Zhang, Ke Zhao
Abstract: We propose an automated framework for quantum circuit design by integrating large-language models (LLMs) with evolutionary optimization to overcome the rigidity, scalability limitations, and expert dependence of traditional ones in variational quantum algorithms. Our approach (FunSearch) autonomously discovers hardware-efficient ansätze with new features of scalability and system-size-independent number of variational parameters entirely from scratch. Demonstrations on the Ising and XY spin chains with n = 9 qubits yield circuits containing 4 parameters, achieving near-exact energy extrapolation across system sizes. Implementations on quantum hardware (Zuchongzhi chip) validate practicality, where two-qubit quantum gate noises can be effectively mitigated via zero-noise extrapolations for a spin chain system as large as 20 sites. This framework bridges algorithmic design and experimental constraints, complementing contemporary quantum architecture search frameworks to advance scalable quantum simulations.

Title: Fault Tolerant Decoding of QLDPC-GKP Codes with Circuit Level Soft Information
Authors: Shantom K. Borah, Asit K. Pradhan, Nithin Raveendran, Michele Pacenti, Bane Vasic
Abstract: Concatenated bosonic-stabilizer codes have recently gained prominence as promising candidates for achieving low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing in the long term. In such systems, analog information obtained from the syndrome measurements of an inner bosonic code is used to inform decoding for an outer code layer consisting of a discrete-variable stabilizer code such as a surface code. The use of Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) codes as an outer code is of particular interest due to the significantly higher encoding rates offered by these code families, leading to a further reduction in overhead for large-scale quantum computing. Recent works have investigated the performance of QLDPC-GKP codes in detail, and the use of analog information from the inner code significantly boosts decoder performance. However, the noise models assumed in these works are typically limited to depolarizing or phenomenological noise. In this paper, we investigate the performance of QLDPC-GKP concatenated codes under circuit-level noise, based on a model introduced by Noh et al. in the context of the surface-GKP code. To demonstrate the performance boost from analog information, we investigate three scenarios: (a) decoding without soft information, (b) decoding with precomputed error probabilities but without real-time soft information, and (c) decoding with real-time soft information obtained from round-to-round decoding of the inner GKP code. Results show minimal improvement between (a) and (b), but a significant boost in (c), indicating that real-time soft information is critical for concatenated decoding under circuit-level noise. We also study the effect of measurement schedules with varying depths and show that using a schedule with minimum depth is essential for obtaining reliable soft information from the inner code.

Title: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Can Require Exponential Time to Optimize Linear Functions
Authors: Francisco Chicano, Zakaria Abdelmoiz Dahi, Gabiel Luque
Abstract: QAOA is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve optimization problems in gate-based quantum computers. It is based on a variational quantum circuit that can be interpreted as a discretization of the annealing process that quantum annealers follow to find a minimum energy state of a given Hamiltonian. This ensures that QAOA must find an optimal solution for any given optimization problem when the number of layers, $p$, used in the variational quantum circuit tends to infinity. In practice, the number of layers is usually bounded by a small number. This is a must in current quantum computers of the NISQ era, due to the depth limit of the circuits they can run to avoid problems with decoherence and noise. In this paper, we show mathematical evidence that QAOA requires exponential time to solve linear functions when the number of layers is less than the number of different coefficients of the linear function $n$. We conjecture that QAOA needs exponential time to find the global optimum of linear functions for any constant value of $p$, and that the runtime is linear only if $p \geq n$. We conclude that we need new quantum algorithms to reach quantum supremacy in quantum optimization.

Title: Performance Analysis and Noise Impact of a Novel Quantum KNN Algorithm for Machine Learning
Authors: Asif Akhtab Ronggon, Md. Saifur Rahman
Abstract: This paper presents a novel quantum K-nearest neighbors (QKNN) algorithm, which offers improved performance over the classical k-NN technique by incorporating quantum computing (QC) techniques to enhance classification accuracy, scalability, and robustness. The proposed modifications focus on optimizing quantum data encoding using Hadamard and rotation gates, ensuring more effective rendering of classical data in quantum states. In addition, the quantum feature extraction process is significantly enhanced by the use of entangled gates such as IsingXY and CNOT, which enables better feature interactions and class separability. A novel quantum distance metric, based on the swap test, is introduced to calculate similarity measures between various quantum states, offering superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional Euclidean distance metrics. We assess the achievement of the proposed QKNN algorithm on three benchmark datasets: Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Iris, and Bank Note Authentication, and have noted its superior performance relative to both classical k-NN (CKNN) and Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The proposed QKNN algorithm is found to achieve prediction accuracies of 98.25%, 100%, and 99.27% ,respectively, for the three datasets, while the customized QNN shows prediction accuracies of only 97.17%, 83.33%, and 86.18%, respectively. Furthermore, we address the challenges of quantum noise by incorporating a repetition encoding-based error mitigation strategy, which ensures the stability and resilience of the algorithm in noisy quantum environments. The results highlight the potential of the proposed QKNN as a scalable, efficient and robust quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithm, especially in high-dimensional and complex datasets, when traditional approaches frequently fail.

Title: Reconstructing Real-Valued Quantum States
Authors: Zhixin Song, Hang Ren, Melody Lee, Bryan Gard, Nicolas Renaud, Spencer H. Bryngelson
Abstract: Quantum tomography is a crucial tool for characterizing quantum states and devices and estimating nonlinear properties of the systems. Performing full quantum state tomography (FQST) on an $N_\mathrm{q}$ qubit system requires an exponentially increasing overhead with $O(3^{N_\mathrm{q}})$ distinct Pauli measurement settings to resolve all complex phases and reconstruct the density matrix. However, many appealing applications of quantum computing, such as quantum linear system algorithms, require only real-valued amplitudes. Here we introduce a novel readout method for real-valued quantum states that reduces measurement settings required for state vector reconstruction to $O(N_\mathrm{q})$, while the post-processing cost remains exponential. This approach offers a substantial speedup over conventional tomography. We experimentally validate our method up to 10~qubits on the latest available IBM quantum processor and demonstrate that it accurately extracts key properties such as entanglement and magic. Our method also outperforms the standard SWAP test for state overlap estimation. This calculation resembles a numerical integration in certain cases and can be applied to extract nonlinear properties, which are important in application fields.

Title: Quantum medical image encoding and compression using Fourier-based methods
Authors: Taehee Ko, Inho Lee, Hyeong Won Yu
Abstract: Quantum image processing (QIMP) has recently emerged as a promising field for modern image processing applications. In QIMP algorithms, encoding classical image informaiton into quantum circuit is important as the first step. However, most of existing encoding methods use gates almost twice the number of pixels in an image, and simulating even a modest sized image is computationally demanding. In this work, we propose a quantum image encoding method that effectively reduces gates than the number of pixels by a factor at least 4. We demonstrate our method for various 1024 by 1024 high-quality medical images captured during the Bilateral Axillo-Breast Approach (BABA) robotic thyroidectomy surgery. Additionally, two compression techniques are proposed to further reduce the number of gates as well as pre-processing time with negligible loss of image quality. We suggest our image encoding strategy as a valuable option for large scale medical imaging.

Title: Hamiltonian Locality Testing via Trotterized Postselection
Authors: John Kallaugher, Daniel Liang
Abstract: The (tolerant) Hamiltonian locality testing problem, introduced in [Bluhm, Caro,Oufkir `24], is to determine whether a Hamiltonian $H$ is $\varepsilon_1$-close to being $k$-local (i.e. can be written as the sum of weight-$k$ Pauli operators) or $\varepsilon_2$-far from any $k$-local Hamiltonian, given access to its time evolution operator and using as little total evolution time as possible, with distance typically defined by the normalized Frobenius norm. We give the tightest known bounds for this problem, proving an $\text{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_2}{(\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1)^5}}\right)$ evolution time upper bound and an $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1}\right)$ lower bound. Our algorithm does not require reverse time evolution or controlled application of the time evolution operator, although our lower bound applies to algorithms using either tool. Furthermore, we show that if we are allowed reverse time evolution, this lower bound is tight, giving a matching $\text{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1}\right)$ evolution time algorithm.

Title: The Quantum Toll Framework: A Thermodynamic Model of Collapse and Coherence
Authors: L. S. Montejo
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic rendering model in which the traditional quantum observer is reframed as a special case of a coherence-constrained interface. Collapse is treated not as an interpretive postulate but as a structural threshold -- reached when the energetic cost of stabilizing superposition exceeds a system's available budget. The Quantum Toll Framework (QTF) formalizes this by recasting observation as a bounded rendering process, governed by entropy, energy, and failure. Extending Landauer's principle, we show that the thermodynamic cost of observation includes not only information erasure but also the sustainment of rendered states. Collapse is thus reinterpreted as a solvable, testable thermodynamic transition. This model explains classical emergence, time asymmetry, and measurement without invoking consciousness or symbolic cognition. Under QTF, the observer is not fundamental but derivative -- a biological and technological interface evolved to stabilize collapse. Empirical consequences, including spatial constraints on collapse in cloud chambers, are discussed.

Title: Direct space-time modeling of mechanically dressed dipole-dipole interactions with electromagnetically-coupled oscillating dipoles
Authors: Yi-Ming Chang, Kamran Akbari, Matthew Filipovich, Stephen Hughes
Abstract: We study the radiative dynamics of coupled electric dipoles, modelled as Lorentz oscillators (LOs), in the presence of real-time mechanical oscillations. The dipoles are treated in a self-consistent way through a direct electromagnetic simulation approach that fully includes the dynamical movement of the charges, accounting for radiation reaction, emission and absorption. This allows for a powerful numerical solution of optomechanical resonances without any perturbative approximations for the mechanical motion. The scaled population (excitation) dynamics of the LOs are investigated as well as the emitted radiation and electromagnetic spectra, which demonstrates how the usual dipole-dipole resonances couple to the underlying Floquet states, yielding multiple spectral peaks that are separated from the superradiant and subradiant states by an integer number of the mechanical oscillation frequency. Moreover, we observe that when the mechanical amplitude and frequency are sufficiently large, these additional spectral peaks undergo further modification, including spectral splitting, spectral squeezing, or shifting. These observations are fully corroborated by a theoretical Floquet analysis conducted on two coupled harmonic oscillators.

Title: Interplay between defects and the non-Hermitian skin effect
Authors: Yin Huang, Wenna Zhang, Yu Zhou, Yuecheng Shen, Georgios Veronis, Wenchen Luo
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is an intriguing phenomenon in which an extensive number of bulk eigenstates localize at the boundaries of a non-Hermitian system with non-reciprocal hoppings. Here we study the interplay of this effect and a defect in non-reciprocal one-dimensional lattices. We show that the interplay of the NHSE and defects is size-dependent. We demonstrate a novel class of hybrid skin-defect states in finite-size systems resulting from the coupling between the skin and defect states. Next, we consider a single defect in a topologically nontrivial lattice with time-reversal symmetry based on the non-reciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger configuration. We unveil how topologically nontrivial defect states and non-Hermiticity interplay by competing with each other, exhibiting a transition from topologically nontrivial defect states to skin states. In addition, we show that decreasing the defect strength can result in a transition from trivial defect states to skin states. Our work promotes the understanding of the interplay between defects and the NHSE, and especially the importance of the energy spectra of the system with the defect under periodic boundary conditions.

Title: Micius, the world's first quantum communication satellite, was hackable
Authors: Alexander Miller
Abstract: The decoy-state BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) is used on Micius, the world's first satellite for quantum communications. The method of decoy states can detect photon-number-splitting eavesdropping and thus enables, in theory, secure QKD using weak coherent pulses over long distances with high channel loss inherent in satellite communication systems. However, it is widely known that realistic QKD devices can be vulnerable to various types of side-channel attacks that rely on flaws in experimental implementation. In most free-space QKD systems, including that on board Micius, multiple semiconductor lasers with passive optics are utilized to randomly generate polarization states. Optical pulses from independent laser diodes can to some extent differ in their temporal, spectral, and/or spatial distribution, and the quantum states can thus be distinguishable. Such distinguishability of photons in additional non-operational degrees of freedom compromises unconditional security of QKD since an eavesdropper can exploit this loophole to improve their attack strategy. The author carried out a thorough analysis of the experimental data obtained during multiple communication sessions between Micius and one of the ground stations designed specifically for it. Relative time delays between all the eight laser diodes on board have been found. The typical desynchronization between the lasers exceeds 100 ps, which is comparable with their pulse duration of 200 ps. The largest time delay was observed between signal and decoy states for vertically polarized photons and is about 300 ps. With such mismatch in timing, a potential attacker using as perfect equipment as possible unless it violates the laws of physics was shown to be capable of distinguishing decoy states from signal ones in at least 98.7% of cases.

Title: A Relativistic Pseudo-Unitary Version of Schwinger's Quantum Mechanical Symbolism of Atomic Measurements
Authors: J. G. Cardoso
Abstract: The measurement processes that are traditionally described within the realm of non-relativistic quantum-mechanics are transcribed into the covariant framework of Cartan's space, the four-valued representation space of the restricted conformal group for special relativity. It is assumed that the non-relativistic quantum measurement mechanisms of state reductions as well as the definition of Born probabilities should remain unaltered when the passage to the covariant framework is worked out. The correlations between observations registered in different spacetime frames, concerning intermediate steps and outcomes of microscopic measurements, are attained through the implementation of the orthochronous proper Poincaré subgroup of an appropriate realization of SU(2,2). It appears that the work may supply an elementary theoretical background to the construction of relativistic quantum computational gates.

Title: New constructions of multipartite entanglement resistant to particle loss
Authors: Wanchen Zhang, Zicheng Han, Fei Shi, Xiande Zhang
Abstract: An entangled state is called m-resistant if it remains entangled after losing an arbitrary subset of mparticles but becomes fully separable after losing any number of particles larger than m. Quinta et al. [Phys. Rev. A (2019)] conjectured that for any N-particle systems, there always exists an m-resistant pure state. In this paper, we give two general constructions of m-resistant pure states. One is from the mixtures of Dicke states, which provides strong (N - k)-resistant pure N-qubit states with k = 4 or 5. The other is from classical error correcting codes, which provides new m-resistant qudit states for certain m < N/2.

Title: Identifying optimal magnetic field configurations for decoherence mitigation of boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Basanta Mistri, Saksham Mahajan, Felix Donaldson, Rama K. Kamineni, Siddharth Dhomkar
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.

Title: Asymmetric Biphoton Generation under Ground-State Decoherence and Phase Mismatch in a Cold Atomic Ensemble
Authors: Jiun-Shiuan Shiu, Chang-Wei Lin, Yong-Fan Chen
Abstract: We present an experimental investigation of how ground-state decoherence and phase mismatch influence biphoton generation in double-{\Lambda} spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) within a cold atomic ensemble. Our results reveal significant asymmetry in the Stokes and anti-Stokes photon generation rates, arising from the distinct effects of phase mismatch and ground-state decoherence. While phase mismatch primarily drives this asymmetry under minimal decoherence, larger decoherence further amplifies it, underscoring the complex interplay between these factors. Using the coincidence count rate representation, we provide insights into pairing ratios and demonstrate that the stimulated four-wave mixing process inherent in SFWM explains the observed phenomena. Interestingly, although ground-state decoherence reduces the generation of temporally correlated photons, it paradoxically enhances biphoton purity, as confirmed through conditional autocorrelation measurements. This counterintuitive phenomenon is reported here for the first time. Furthermore, unconditional autocorrelation measurements show that the generated photons follow a thermal-state distribution, consistent with theoretical predictions. This study advances the understanding of biphoton generation dynamics and temporal photon correlations in SFWM, offering valuable insights for optimizing SFWM-based biphoton sources and their applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Structure Theorem for Quantum Replacer Codes
Authors: Eric Chitambar, Sarah Hagen, David W. Kribs, Mike I. Nelson, Andrew Nemec
Abstract: Quantum replacer codes are codes that can be protected from errors induced by a given set of quantum replacer channels, an important class of quantum channels that includes the erasures of subsets of qubits that arise in quantum error correction. We prove a structure theorem for such codes that synthesizes a variety of special cases with earlier theoretical work in quantum error correction. We present several examples and applications of the theorem, including a mix of new observations and results together with some subclasses of codes revisited from this new perspective.

Title: Entangled laser beams and quantum ghost frequency comb
Authors: Yanhua Shih
Abstract: This letter reports on the study of entangled laser beams, or entangled coherent states, from their generation to their nonlocal coherent behavior. Although in continuous wave operation, the entangled laser beams are able to produce comb-like correlation with 100\% contrast in distant joint photodetection. We name this comb-function quantum ghost frequency comb (QGFC). What is the cause of these periodic sharp correlations? Can we trust zero-coincidences, or anti-correlation, in the joint measurement of CW laser beams? Besides its fundamental interests, bright QGFCs make important contributions to the fields of nonlocal precision spectroscopy, positioning, and time transfer. Superior to entangled photon pairs, measurements of entangled laser beams do not rely on photon counting and can be performed over greater distance in shorter time with higher resolution and accuracy.

Title: Satellites promise global-scale quantum networks

Abstract: Academia, governments, and industry around the world are on a quest to build long-distance quantum communication networks for a future quantum internet. Using air and fiber channels, quantum communication quickly faced the daunting challenge of exponential photon loss with distance. Quantum repeaters were invented to solve the loss problem by probabilistically establishing entanglement over short distances and using quantum memories to synchronize the teleportation of such entanglement to long distances. However, due to imperfections and complexities of quantum memories, ground-based proof-of-concept repeater demonstrations have been restricted to metropolitan-scale distances. In contrast, direct photon transmission from satellites through empty space faces almost no exponential absorption loss and only quadratic beam divergence loss. A single satellite successfully distributed entanglement over more than 1,200 km. It is becoming increasingly clear that quantum communication over large intercontinental distances (e.g. 4,000-20,000 km) will likely employ a satellite-based architecture. This could involve quantum memories and repeater protocols in satellites, or memory-less satellite-chains through which photons are simply reflected, or some combination thereof. Rapid advancements in the space launch and classical satellite communications industry provide a strong tailwind for satellite quantum communication, promising economical and easier deployment of quantum communication satellites.

Title: Heisenberg limit in phase measurements: the threshold detection approach
Authors: D. I. Salykina, V. S. Liamin, V. L. Gorshenin, B. N. Nougmanov, F.Ya. Khalili
Abstract: We analyze the fundamental sensitivity limits, achievable by the standard (single- and two-arm) optical interferometers using the Gaussian (squeezed coherent) quantum states of the probing light. We consider two types of the measurements of the output light -- the standard homodyne measurement and the non-linear threshold measurement [Helstrom, ``Quantum detection and estimation theory'' (1976)]. The latter one allow to recover in one-shot measurement the phase information carried out by the second momenta of the quadrature amplitudes of the output light, providing the sensitivity saturating the Quantum Cramer-Rao bound. We show that in all considered cases, the Heisenberg scaling for the phase measurement error $\Delta\phi = K/N$ can be achieved, where $K\sim1$ is a numerical prefactor and $N$ is the mean photon number. The specific value of the prefactor depends on the interferometer topology, the measurement type, and the quantum state of the probing light. The smaller it is, the more narrow is the range of the values of $\phi$ where the sensitivity that close to the best one for this specific case is provided.

Title: Online Job Scheduler for Fault-tolerant Quantum Multiprogramming
Authors: Shin Nishio, Ryo Wakizaka, Daisuke Sakuma, Yosuke Ueno, Yasunari Suzuki
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers are expected to be offered as cloud services due to their significant resource and infrastructure requirements. Quantum multiprogramming, which runs multiple quantum jobs in parallel, is a promising approach to maximize the utilization of such systems. A key challenge in this setting is the need for an online scheduler capable of handling jobs submitted dynamically while other programs are already running. In this study, we formulate the online job scheduling problem for fault-tolerant quantum computing systems based on lattice surgery and propose an efficient scheduler to address it. To meet the responsiveness required in an online environment, our scheduler approximates lattice surgery programs, originally represented as polycubes, by using simpler cuboid representations. This approximation enables efficient scheduling while improving overall throughput. In addition, we incorporate a defragmentation mechanism into the scheduling process, demonstrating that it can further enhance QPU utilization.

Title: Sending absolutely maximally entangled states through noisy quantum channels
Authors: Maria Stawska, Jan Wójcik, Andrzej Grudka, Antoni Wójcik
Abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled states are quantum states that exhibit maximal entanglement across any bipartition, making them valuable for applications. This study investigates the behavior of qubit AME states under the influence of noisy quantum channels. Our results demonstrate that for certain channels, such as the depolarizing channel, the entanglement properties remain invariant under local unitary transformations and are independent of the choice of qubits in each subset. However, for channels like the dephasing channel, the entanglement behavior can vary depending on the specific AME state and the choice of qubits, revealing a symmetry-breaking effect. These findings highlight the nuanced relationship between AME states and noise, providing insights into their robustness and potential applications in noisy quantum systems.

Title: Quantum RNNs and LSTMs Through Entangling and Disentangling Power of Unitary Transformations
Authors: Ammar Daskin
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how quantum recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their enhanced version, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can be modeled using the core ideas presented in Ref.[1], where the entangling and disentangling power of unitary transformations is investigated. In particular, we interpret entangling and disentangling power as information retention and forgetting mechanisms in LSTMs. Therefore, entanglement becomes a key component of the optimization (training) process. We believe that, by leveraging prior knowledge of the entangling power of unitaries, the proposed quantum-classical framework can guide and help to design better-parameterized quantum circuits for various real-world applications.

Title: The Quantum Optical Master Equation is of the same order of approximation as the Redfield Equation
Authors: Niklas J. Jung, Francesco Rosati, Gabriel L. Rath, Frank K. Wilhelm, Peter K. Schuhmacher
Abstract: Quantum master equations are widely used to describe the dynamics of open quantum systems. All these different master equations rely on specific approximations that may or may not be justified. Starting from a microscopic model, applying the justified approximations only may not result in the desired Lindblad form preserving positivity. The recently proposed Universal Lindblad Equation is in Lindblad form and still retains the same order of approximation as the Redfield master equation [arXiv:2004.01469]. In this work, we prove that the well-known Quantum Optical Master Equation is also in the same equivalence class of approximations. We furthermore compare the Quantum Optical Master Equation and the Universal Lindblad Equation numerically and show numerical evidence that the Quantum Optical Master Equation yields more accurate results.

Title: Autoregressive pairwise Graphical Models efficiently find ground state representations of stoquastic Hamiltonians
Authors: Yuchen Pang, Abhijith Jayakumar, Evan McKinney, Carleton Coffrin, Marc Vuffray, Andrey Y. Lokhov
Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Graphical Models (AGMs) as an Ansatz for modeling the ground states of stoquastic Hamiltonians. Exact learning of these models for smaller systems show the dominance of the pairwise terms in the autoregressive decomposition, which informs our modeling choices when the Ansatz is used to find representations for ground states of larger systems. We find that simple AGMs with pairwise energy functions trained using first-order stochastic gradient methods often outperform more complex non-linear models trained using the more expensive stochastic reconfiguration method. We also test our models on Hamiltonians with frustration and observe that the simpler linear model used here shows faster convergence to the variational minimum in a resource-limited setting.

However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems. Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN) design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system. Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T}1 and T2 of the IBM Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on superconducting hardware.

Title: Composable framework for device-independent state certification
Authors: Rutvij Bhavsar, Lewis Wooltorton, Joonwoo Bae
Abstract: Certifying a quantum state in a device-independent (DI) manner, in which no trust is placed on the internal workings of any physical components, is a fundamental task bearing various applications in quantum information theory. The composability of a state certification protocol is key to its integration as a subroutine within information-theoretic protocols. In this work, we present a composable certification of quantum states in a DI manner under the assumption that a source prepares a finite sequence of independent quantum states that are not necessarily identical. We show that the security relies on the DI analog of the fidelity, called the extractability. We develop methods to compute this quantity under local operations and classical communication in certain Bell scenarios that self-test the singlet state, which may also be of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by certifying the singlet states in a composable and DI manner using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality.

Title: Feedback-enhanced distant entanglement of magnon and phonon modes with atomic ensembles in coupled cavities
Authors: Muhammad Awais Altaf, Muhammad Irfan
Abstract: The generation and manipulation of distant entanglement between disparate systems is crucial for various quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate a system of coupled cavities comprising an ensemble in cavity-1, a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere in cavity-2, and a coherent feedback loop (CFL) that feeds the output of cavity-1 back into cavity-1 through a beam splitter. This system features five excitation modes: cavity-1 photons, atomic ensemble, cavity-2 photons, the magnon, and phonon modes of the YIG sphere. Thus various combinations of bipartite entanglements can be studied. Our main focus is the study of various combinations of distant bipartite entanglements, especially the entanglement of the atomic ensemble and photons in cavity-1 with the magnon and phonon modes of the YIG sphere in cavity-2. Compared to the previously reported results, introducing a CFL significantly enhances all the bipartite entanglements. Besides, the degree of entanglement of various modes, the parameters space, where the strong entanglement exists, is also significantly enhanced due to CFL. Moreover, the entanglement is more robust against thermal noise. We believe our results are important for quantum technologies where the distribution of entanglement on quantum networks is crucial.

Title: Observation of modulation-induced Feshbach resonance
Authors: Tongkang Wang, Yuqi Liu, Jundong Wang, Youjia Huang, Wenlan Chen, Zhendong Zhang, Jiazhong Hu
Abstract: In this work, we observe a novel resonant mechanism, namely the modulation-induced Feshbach resonance. By applying a far-detuned laser to the cesium D2 transition with intensity modulation, we periodically shake the energy levels of atomic collisional states. This periodic shaking connects the free-scattering states to shallow molecular states. At specific frequencies, we observe significant atom loss, which corresponds to the resonant coupling between these two types of states. This precisely corresponds to a form of Feshbach resonance, yet in the frequency domain rather than the magnetic-field domain. Using this method, we can directly scan the energy spectrum of molecular bound states without synthesizing any molecules. In addition to these bound states, we can also probe the molecular states embedded in the continuum, which are typically very difficult to detect by the conventional methods based on molecular synthesis. Moreover, by using a far-detuned laser instead of a magnetic field coil, it enables spatially dependent control over atomic interactions, coupling multiple levels simultaneously, and inducing new Feshbach resonances for those atoms that do not have conventional magnetic resonances. Therefore, we believe that this new resonant mechanism offers new opportunities for controlling atomic and molecular interactions in quantum simulations.

Title: Entanglement saturation in quantum electrodynamics scattering processes
Authors: Massimo Blasone, Silvio De Siena, Gaetano Lambiase, Cristina Matrella, Bruno Micciola
Abstract: We investigate the properties of quantum electrodynamics (QED) two-particle scattering processes when an arbitrarily sharp filtering of the outgoing particles in momentum space is performed. We find that these processes are described by dynamical quantum maps, whose structure is such that any initial state is transformed into a maximally entangled state, after an infinite number of iterations of the map. This structural property is exactly realized if all the colliding particles are massive fermions while, when photons are involved, it is verified in a partial way, depending on the process under consideration.

Title: Unraveling Quantum Environments: Transformer-Assisted Learning in Lindblad Dynamics
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, En-Jui Kuo
Abstract: Understanding dissipation in open quantum systems is crucial for the development of robust quantum technologies. In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based machine learning framework to infer time-dependent dissipation rates in quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. Our approach uses time series of observable quantities, such as expectation values of single Pauli operators, as input to learn dissipation profiles without requiring knowledge of the initial quantum state or even the system Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a hierarchy of open quantum models of increasing complexity, including single-qubit systems with time-independent or time-dependent jump rates, two-qubit interacting systems (e.g., Heisenberg and transverse Ising models), and the Jaynes--Cummings model involving light--matter interaction and cavity loss with time-dependent decay rates. Our method accurately reconstructs both fixed and time-dependent decay rates from observable time series. To support this, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, the jump rates in all these models are uniquely determined by a finite set of observables, such as qubit and photon measurements. In practice, we combine Transformer-based architectures with lightweight feature extraction techniques to efficiently learn these dynamics. Our results suggest that modern machine learning tools can serve as scalable and data-driven alternatives for identifying unknown environments in open quantum systems.

Title: Generation and Stabilization of Bound States in the Continuum in Dissipative Floquet Optical Lattices
Authors: Yangchun Zhao, Hongzheng Wu, Xinguang Li, Lei Li, Jinpeng Xiao, Zhao-Yun Zeng, Yajiang Chen, Xiaobing Luo
Abstract: This paper investigates the generation and stabilization of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in a one-dimensional dissipative Floquet lattice. We find a different mechanism for the generation of stable BICs in the open one-dimensional lattice system, which stems from a peculiar dark Floquet state, a state with zero quasi-energy and negligible population on the lossy sites. Our results reveal that the evolutionary stability of BICs resulting from the dark Floquet state can be significantly enhanced, as evidenced by their very low decay rate, by increasing the driving frequency or, counterintuitively, increasing the dissipation strength. We further demonstrate that stable dark Floquet BICs can robustly persist even in nonlinear regimes. The existence of these stable dark Floquet BICs can be attributed to the role of higher-order correction terms in the effective Floquet Hamiltonian derived via the high-frequency expansion (HFE) method. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating non-Hermitian dissipation can extend the parameter regime for the existence of BICs, and the dissipation-induced BICs can lead to complete reflection of wave packets. Our findings provide theoretical support for the experimental realization of stable BICs in dissipative quantum systems.

Title: Multi-party dynamic quantum homomorphic encryption scheme based on rotation operators
Authors: Zhen-Zhen Li, Ming-Kui Liu, Wen-Ling Yang, Bo Gao, Zi-Chen Li
Abstract: Quantum homomorphic encryption is the corresponding technology of classical homomorphic encryption in the quantum field. Due to its ability to ensure the correctness of computation and the security of data, it is particularly suitable for delegated computation in quantum cloud networks. However, previous schemes were unable to simultaneously handle the volatility problem of servers dynamically and eliminate the error caused by homomorphic evaluation of T-gate non-interactively. Therefore, a novel multi-party dynamic quantum homomorphic encryption scheme based on rotation operators is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the proposed scheme uses the rotation operators to solve the phase gate error that occurs during the homomorphic evaluation of T-gate non-interactively. Secondly, the scheme can dynamically deal with instability of servers, such as adding a server or removing a server. Then, the trusted key center is introduced, which is responsible for key updating and circuit replacement, which lowers the requirements for quantum capabilities on the client. Finally, this scheme extends the single-client multi-server model to the multi-client multi-server model, making it more suitable for quantum distributed networks and enhancing its practicality. In addition, we theoretically prove the correctness and fully homomorphic property of the proposed scheme, and verify it through the simulation conducted on the IBM Quantum Experience. Security analysis and efficiency analysis further demonstrate that the proposed scheme is information-theoretically secure and possesses high qubit efficiency.

Title: Constant-Overhead Magic State Injection into qLDPC Codes with Error Independence Guarantees
Authors: Guo Zhang, Yuanye Zhu, Xiao Yuan, Ying Li
Abstract: Magic states are essential yet resource-intensive components for realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. Preparing magic states within emerging quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes poses additional challenges, due to the complex encoding structures. Here, we introduce a generic and scalable method for magic state injection into arbitrarily selected logical qubits encoded using qLDPC codes. Our approach, based on parallelized code surgery, supports the injection from either physical qubits or low-distance logical qubits. For qLDPC code families with asymptotically constant encoding rates, the method achieves injection into $\Theta(k)$ logical qubits -- where $k$ denotes the logical qubit number of the code -- with only constant qubit overhead and a time complexity of $\tilde{O}(d^2)$, where $d$ is the code distance. A central contribution of this work is a rigorous proof that errors affecting the injected magic states remain independent throughout the procedure. This independence ensures the resilience of logical qubits against interactions with noisy ancillae and preserves the presumption of subsequent magic state distillation protocols. We further support our theoretical results with numerical validation through circuit-level simulations. These findings advance the feasibility of scalable, fault-tolerant universal quantum computing using qLDPC codes, offering a pathway to significantly reduced qubit resource requirements in magic state injection.

Title: Physical Probability and Locality in No-Collapse Quantum Theory
Authors: Simon Saunders
Abstract: Probability is distinguished into two kinds: physical and epistemic, also, but less accurately, called objective and subjective. Simple postulates are given for physical probability, the only novel one being a locality condition. Translated into no-collapse quantum mechanics, without hidden variables, the postulates imply that the elements in any equiamplitude expansion of the quantum state are equiprobable. Such expansions therefore provide ensembles of microstates that can be used to define probabilities in the manner of frequentism, in von Mises sense (where the probability of P is the frequency of occurrence of P in a suitable ensemble). The result is the Born rule. Since satisfying our postulates, and in particular the locality condition (meaning no action-at-a-distance), these probabilities for no-collapse quantum mechanics are perfectly local, even though they violate Bell inequalities. The latter can be traced to a violation of outcome independence, used to derive the inequalities. But in no-collapse theory that is not a locality condition; it is a criterion for entanglement, not locality.

Title: Exact Spin Elimination in Ising Hamiltonians and Energy-Based Machine Learning
Authors: Natalia G. Berloff
Abstract: We present an exact spin-elimination technique that reduces the dimensionality of both quadratic and k-local Ising Hamiltonians while preserving their original ground-state configurations. By systematically replacing each removed spin with an effective interaction among its neighbors, our method lowers the total spin count without invoking approximations or iterative recalculations. This capability is especially beneficial for hardware-constrained platforms, classical or quantum, that can directly implement multi-body interactions but have limited qubit or spin resources. We demonstrate three key advances enabled by this technique. First, we handle larger instances of benchmark problems such as Max-Cut on cubic graphs without exceeding a 2-local interaction limit. Second, we reduce qubit requirements in QAOA-based integer factorization on near-term quantum devices, thus extending the feasible range of integers to be factorized. Third, we improve memory capacity in Hopfield associative memories and enhance memory retrieval by suppressing spurious attractors, enhancing retrieval performance. Our spin-elimination procedure trades local spin complexity for higher-order couplings or higher node degrees in a single pass, opening new avenues for scaling up combinatorial optimization and energy-based machine learning on near-term hardware. Finally, these results underscore that the next-generation physical spin machines will likely capitalize on k-local spin Hamiltonians to offer an alternative to classical computations.

Title: Suppressing Measurement Noise in Logical Qubits Through Measurement Scheduling
Authors: Xiao-Yue Xu, Chen Ding, Wan-Su Bao
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for reliable quantum computation, where surface codes demonstrate high fault-tolerant thresholds and hardware efficiency. However, noise in single-shot measurements limits logical readout fidelity, forming a critical bottleneck for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We propose a dynamic measurement scheduling protocol that suppresses logical readout errors by adaptively redistributing measurement tasks from error-prone qubits to stable nodes. Using shallow entangled circuits, the protocol balances gate errors and measurement noise. This is achieved by dynamically prioritizing resource allocation based on topological criticality and error metrics. When addressing realistic scenarios where temporal constraints are governed by decoherence limits and error-correction requirements, we implement reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve adaptive measurement scheduling. Numerical simulations show that logical error rates can be reduced by up to 34% across code distances for 3 to 11, with enhanced robustness in measurement-noise-dominated systems. Our protocol offers a versatile, hardware-efficient solution for high-fidelity quantum error correction, advancing large-scale quantum computing.

Title: Efficiently Computable Limits on EPR Pair Generation in Quantum Broadcast Channels
Authors: Patrick Hayden, Debbie Leung, Hjalmar Rall, Farzin Salek
Abstract: We investigate the generation of EPR pairs between three observers in a general causally structured setting, where communication occurs via a noisy quantum broadcast channel. The most general quantum codes for this setup take the form of tripartite quantum channels. Since the receivers are constrained by causal ordering, additional temporal relationships naturally emerge between the parties. These causal constraints enforce intrinsic no-signalling conditions on any tripartite operation, ensuring that it constitutes a physically realizable quantum code for a quantum broadcast channel. We analyze these constraints and, more broadly, characterize the most general quantum codes for communication over such channels. We examine the capabilities of codes that are fully no-signalling among the three parties, positive partial transpose (PPT)-preserving, or both, and derive simple semidefinite programs to compute the achievable entanglement fidelity. We then establish a hierarchy of semidefinite programming converse bounds -- both weak and strong -- for the capacity of quantum broadcast channels for EPR pair generation, in both one-shot and asymptotic regimes. Notably, in the special case of a point-to-point channel, our strong converse bound recovers and strengthens existing results. Finally, we demonstrate how the PPT-preserving codes we develop can be leveraged to construct PPT-preserving entanglement combing schemes, and vice versa.

Title: Beyond Boson Sampling: Higher Spin Sampling as a Practical Path to Quantum Supremacy
Authors: Chon-Fai Kam, En-Jui Kuo
Abstract: Since the dawn of quantum computation science, a range of quantum algorithms have been proposed, yet few have experimentally demonstrated a definitive quantum advantage. Shor's algorithm, while renowned, has not been realized at a scale to outperform classical methods. In contrast, Fock-state boson sampling has been theoretically established as a means of achieving quantum supremacy. However, most existing experimental realizations of boson sampling to date have been based on Gaussian boson sampling, in which the input states consist of squeezed states of light. In this work, we first introduce spin sampling for arbitrary spin-$S$ states as a practical path to quantum supremacy. We identified a quasi-linear scaling relation between the number of sites $m$ and the number of spins $n$ as $m\sim n^{1+\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon=3/(2S)$ is inversely proportional to the spin quantum number. This suggests that, within a spin system, an equivalent Fock-state boson sampling task in the linear mode region, characterized by $m\sim \Omega(n^{1+\epsilon})$, is experimentally feasible with reduced resource requirements.

Title: Higher-order exceptional lines in a non-Hermitian JaynesCummings triangle
Authors: Hao Chen, Xiao Qin, Jian-Jun Dong, Yu-Yu Zhang, Zi-Xiang Hu
Abstract: Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems showcase diverse physical phenomena but require more parameter space freedom or symmetries. It leads to a challenge for the exploration of high-order EP geometries in low-dimensional systems. Here we observe both a third-order exceptional surface and line in a Jaynes-Cummings triangle consisting of three cavities arranged in a ring. A fine-tuning artificial magnetic field dramatically enriches the emergence of the third-order exceptional lines ($3$ELs), which require only three tuning parameters in the presence of chiral symmetry and parity-time (PT) symmetry. Third-order EPs amplify the effect of perturbations through a cube-root response mechanism, displaying a greater sensitivity than second-order EPs. We develop novel fidelity and Loschmidt echo using the associated-state biorthogonal approach, which successfully characterizes EPs and quench dynamics even in PT breaking regime. Our work advances the use of higher-order EPs in quantum technology applications.

Title: Characterizing the Generalized Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen State
Authors: Rashi Adhikari, Tabish Qureshi
Abstract: In their seminal paper, Einstein Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) had introduced a momentum entangled state for two particles. That state, referred to as the EPR state, has been widely used in studies on entangled particles with continuous degrees of freedom. Later that state was generalized to a form that allows varying degree of entanglement, known as the generalized EPR state. In a suitable limit it reduces to the EPR state. The generalized EPR state is theoretically analyzed here and its entanglement quantified. This state can also be applied to entangled photons produced from spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). The present analysis is then used in quantifying the entanglement of photons produced from the SPDC process, in terms of certain experimental parameters. A comparison is also made with the Schmidt number, which is normally used as an entanglement measure in such situations.

Title: Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices
Authors: Alto Osada, Koichiro Miyanishi
Abstract: Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.

Title: Statistical analysis of Bell tests via generalized measurements
Authors: Alfredo Luis
Abstract: We provide a fully statistical analysis of the results of a Bell test beyond mean values. This is possible in a practical scheme where all the observables involved in the test are simultaneously measured at the expense of unavoidably additional noise. To deal with this noise we can follow two strategies leading to the same results. These are to adapt the Bell bound to include the noise, or to remove the additional noise via suitable data inversion.

Title: Prethermal discrete time crystals in one-dimensional classical Floquet systems with nearest-neighbor interactions
Authors: Zhuo-Yi Li, Yu-Ran Zhang
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs), an emergent non-equilibrium phase of matter, have been studied in two- and higher-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions and one-dimensional (1D) lattices with long-range interactions. However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free PDTCs in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and depends on the energy density of the initial state, which are two key signatures of PDTCs. The robustness of 1D classical PDTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. The emergence of 1D classical PDTCs can be explained by mapping the 1D classical spin chain with NN interacting to a quantum spin-half system with effective long-range interactions. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order.

Title: Out-of-time-order correlation in the quantum Ising Floquet spin system and magnonic crystals
Authors: Rohit Kumar Shukla
Abstract: In recent times out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC) have been established as a tool to understand butterfly effects, quantum information scrambling, and many-body localization. They can also be useful in determining different phases of quantum critical systems. OTOCs can identify the quantum chaos within a system undergoing time evolution; and therefore, they can distinguish between chaotic and regular dynamics. This motivates us to study OTOCs in integrable and nonintegrable periodically kicked quantum spin models. A periodically kicked quantum Ising spin system, known as the quantum Ising Floquet system, is a variant of the transverse Ising model. In place of constant transverse magnetic fields in the transverse Ising system, time-periodic fields are applied in the form of delta pulses in the quantum Ising Floquet spin system. It provides very interesting and peculiar dynamics separate from that of the transverse Ising system.

Title: Time evolution of the quantum Ising model in two dimensions using Tree Tensor Networks
Authors: Wladislaw Krinitsin, Niklas Tausendpfund, Markus Heyl, Matteo Rizzi, Markus Schmitt
Abstract: The numerical simulation of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems away from equilibrium constitutes a major challenge for all known computational methods. We investigate the utility of Tree Tensor Network (TTN) states to solve the dynamics of the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. Within the perturbative regime of small transverse fields, TTNs faithfully reproduce analytically known, but non-trivial and physically interesting results, for lattices up to $16 \times 16$ sites. Limitations of the method related to the rapid growth of entanglement entropy are explored within more general, paradigmatic quench settings. We provide and discuss comprehensive benchmarks regarding the benefit of \emph{GPU} acceleration and the impact of using local operator sums on the performance.

Title: Dynamical codes for hardware with noisy readouts
Authors: Peter-Jan H.S. Derks, Alex Townsend-Teague, Jens Eisert, Markus S. Kesselring, Oscar Higgott, Benjamin J. Brown
Abstract: Dynamical stabilizer codes may offer a practical route to large-scale quantum computation. Such codes are defined by a schedule of error-detecting measurements, which allows for flexibility in their construction. In this work, we ask how best to optimise the measurement schedule of dynamically condensed colour codes in various limits of noise bias. We take a particular focus on the setting where measurements introduce more noise than unitary and idling operations - a noise model relevant to some hardware proposals. For measurement-biased noise models, we improve code performance by strategically repeating measurements within the schedule. For unbiased or $Z$-biased noise models, we find repeating measurements offers little improvement - somewhat contrary to our expectations - and investigate why this is. To perform this analysis, we generalise a metric called the teraquop footprint to the teraquop volume. This is the product of the number of qubits and number of rounds of measurements required such that the probability of a spacelike or timelike logical error occurring is less than $10^{-12}$. In most cases, we find differences in performance are primarily due to the number of rounds of measurements required, rather than the number of qubits - emphasising the importance of using the teraquop volume in the analysis. Additionally, our results provide another example of the importance of making use of correlated errors when decoding, in that using belief matching rather than minimum-weight perfect matching can turn a worst-performing code under a given noise model into a best-performing code.

Abstract: Accurate and robust quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for verifying quantum gates and diagnosing implementation faults in experiments aimed at building universal quantum computers. However, the reliability of QPT protocols is often compromised by faulty probes, particularly state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, which introduce fundamental inconsistencies in traditional QPT algorithms. We propose and investigate enhanced QPT for multi-qubit systems by integrating the error matrix in a digital twin of the identity process matrix, enabling statistical refinement of SPAM error learning and improving QPT precision. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our approach enables highly accurate and faithful process characterization. We further validate our method experimentally using superconducting quantum gates, achieving at least an order-of-magnitude fidelity improvement over standard QPT. Our results provide a practical and precise method for assessing quantum gate fidelity and enhancing QPT on a given hardware.

Title: Circulators based on Coupled Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators and Resonators
Authors: Luis A. Martinez, Nick Du, Nicholas Materise, Sean O' Kelley, Xian Wu, Gang Qiu, Kang L. Wang, P. Gianpaolo, Tony Low, Dong-Xia Qu
Abstract: Integrated plasmonics is advancing rapidly, enabling a wide range of functionalities to be incorporated onto a single chip. Applications span information processing, computation, quantum sensing, and dark-matter detection. This progress has driven the development of integrated non-reciprocal devices, which are essential for preventing unwanted feedback that can degrade system performance. While non-reciprocal devices have been realized in edge magnetoplasmon materials via classical interference effects, their operation is often complicated by a dependence on input power. Here, we demonstrate that topological circulators utilizing asymmetric coupling offer improved input power range, isolation, and insertion loss. In this configuration, non-reciprocal behavior arises from the coupling between a chiral edge magnetoplasmonic resonator and LC resonators, leading to non-Hermitian dynamics. The coherent photon-plasmon interaction enables a circulator with up to 50 dB of isolation across a broad range of excitation intensities. This is the first experimental demonstration showing that magnetic topological insulators can support the study of chiral plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics at radio frequencies, underscoring their potential to enable chip-scale quantum-classical interfaces in superconducting quantum information processing systems.

Title: Mixed state deep thermalization
Authors: Xie-Hang Yu, Wen Wei Ho, Pavel Kos
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.

Title: PT symmetry and the square well potential: Antilinear symmetry rather than Hermiticity in scattering processes
Authors: Philip D. Mannheim
Abstract: While a Hamiltonian with a real potential acts as a Hermitian operator when it operates on bound states, it produces resonances with complex energies in a scattering experiment. The scattering states are not square integrable, being instead delta function normalized. This lack of square integrability breaks the connection between Hermiticity and real eigenvalues, to thus allow for real bound state sector eigenvalues and complex scattering sector eigenvalues. When written as contour integrals delta functions take support in the complex plane, with the scattering amplitude being able to take support in the complex energy plane too. However, the scattering amplitude is $CPT$ symmetric (or $PT$ symmetric if $C$ is conserved), regardless of whether states are square integrable or not. For resonance scattering this antilinear symmetry requires the presence of a complex conjugate pair of energies, one to describe the excitation of the resonance and the other to describe its decay, with it being their interplay that enforces probability conservation. Each complex pair of energy eigenvalues corresponds to only one observable resonance not two. Our analysis shows that the nonrelativistic square well problem with a real potential possesses $PT$ symmetry in both the bound and scattering sectors, with there being complex conjugate pairs of energy eigenvalues in the scattering sector.

Title: Quon Classical Simulation: Unifying Clifford, Matchgates and Entanglement
Authors: Zixuan Feng, Zhengwei Liu, Fan Lu, Ningfeng Wang
Abstract: We propose a unified classical simulation framework for quantum circuits, termed Quon Classical Simulation (QCS), built upon the diagrammatic formalism of the Quon language. Central to this framework is the introduction of magic holes, a topological feature that captures the global source of computational hardness in simulating quantum systems. Unlike conventional measures, the complexity of QCS is governed by the topological entanglement entropy associated with these magic holes. We show that Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of magic holes and thus efficiently simulable within our model. To capture the interaction structure of magic holes, we define a topological tensor network representation and develop novel skein relations and reduction algorithms to simplify circuit representations. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of classical simulations and provides a unified explanation for the tractability of various known quantum circuit classes. Our work offers a new topological perspective on the classical simulability of quantum systems and topological complexity.

Title: Observing structural disorder induced interacting topological phase in an atom array
Authors: Zongpei Yue, Yu-Feng Mao, Xinhui Liang, Zhen-Xing Hua, Peiyun Ge, Yu-Xin Chao, Kai Li, Chen Jia, Meng Khoon Tey, Yong Xu, Li You
Abstract: Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Quantum Entrepreneurship Lab: Training a Future Workforce for the Quantum Industry
Authors: Aaron Sander, Rosaria Cercola, Andrea Capogrosso, Stefan Filipp, Bernhard Jobst, Christian B. Mendl, Frank Pollmann, Christopher Trummer, Isabell Welpe, Max Werninghaus, Robert Wille, Christian Wimmer
Abstract: The Quantum Entrepreneurship Lab (QEL) is a one-semester, project-based course at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), designed to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial application in the quantum sector. As part of the Munich Quantum Valley (MQV) ecosystem, the course fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between technical and business students, equipping them with the skills necessary to contribute to or lead in the emerging quantum industry. The QEL curriculum integrates two complementary tracks. First, technical students form teams where they engage in cutting-edge, industry-relevant research topics under academic supervision. Meanwhile business students in a parallel course explore commercialization strategies, risks, and opportunities within the quantum technology landscape. Midway through the semester, a selection of the business students join the technical course to form interdisciplinary teams which assess the feasibility of transforming scientific concepts into viable business solutions. The course culminates in three key deliverables: a publication-style technical report, a white paper analyzing the business potential and financial requirements, and a startup pitch presented to the quantum community at a Demo Day. This work outlines the course structure, objectives, and outcomes, providing a model for other institutions seeking to cultivate a highly skilled, innovation-driven workforce in quantum science and technology.

Title: Manipulating the topological spin of Majoranas
Authors: Stijn R. de Wit, Emre Duman, A. Mert Bozkurt, Alexander Brinkman, Inanc Adagideli
Abstract: The non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana zero modes make them interesting for both technological applications and fundamental research. Unlike their non-Abelian counterpart, the Abelian contribution $e^{i \theta}$, where $\theta$ is directly related to the Majorana's topological spin, is often neglected. However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin can differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors, the Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising from a vortex encircling an $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this fractional charge and hence the topological spin can be manipulated, introducing an additional knob for braiding operations in topological quantum computing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment that reveals the effect of this fractional charge through measurable shifts in the critical current.

Title: Initialization and training of matrix product state probabilistic models
Authors: Xun Tang, Yuehaw Khoo, Lexing Ying
Abstract: Modeling probability distributions via the wave function of a quantum state is central to quantum-inspired generative modeling and quantum state tomography (QST). We investigate a common failure mode in training randomly initialized matrix product states (MPS) using gradient descent. The results show that the trained MPS models do not accurately predict the strong interactions between boundary sites in periodic spin chain models. In the case of the Born machine algorithm, we further identify a causality trap, where the trained MPS models resemble causal models that ignore the non-local correlations in the true distribution. We propose two complementary strategies to overcome the training failure -- one through optimization and one through initialization. First, we develop a natural gradient descent (NGD) method, which approximately simulates the gradient flow on tensor manifolds and significantly enhances training efficiency. Numerical experiments show that NGD avoids local minima in both Born machines and in general MPS tomography. Remarkably, we show that NGD with line search can converge to the global minimum in only a few iterations. Second, for the BM algorithm, we introduce a warm-start initialization based on the TTNS-Sketch algorithm. We show that gradient descent under a warm initialization does not encounter the causality trap and admits rapid convergence to the ground truth.

Authors: Francisco Caruso, Vitor Oguri
Abstract: Faz-se uma breve reconstrução histórica de alguns pontos que, de algum modo, contribuíram para o trabalho seminal de Louis de Broglie. Em particular, enfatiza-se a relevância de sua tese de doutorado, principalmente por seu valor epistemológico, ao ampliar a crise que havia sido introduzida na descrição da radiação pelo \textit{quantum} de Planck, abrindo caminho para sua solução.

Title: Enhancing optical lattice clock coherence times with erasure conversion
Authors: Shuo Ma, Jonathan Dolde, Xin Zheng, Dhruva Ganapathy, Alexander Shtov, Jenny Chen, Anke Stoeltzel, Shimon Kolkowitz
Abstract: The pursuit of ever-longer optical coherence is central to advancing the precision of optical clocks. Synchronous differential clock comparisons have now demonstrated atomic coherence times on optical transitions that far exceed the coherence time of the clock laser. In optical lattice and tweezer clocks the atom coherence times are then primarily limited by errors induced by Raman scattering from the trapping light, as well as radiative decay due to the finite lifetime of the excited clock state, broadening and loss from two-body collisions, and loss due to heating. Importantly, many of these errors take the atoms out of the clock transition subspace, and can therefore be converted into "erasure" errors if the appropriate readout scheme is employed. Here we experimentally demonstrate a hyperfine-resolved readout technique for 87Sr optical lattice clocks that mitigates decoherence from Raman scattering induced by the lattice trapping light as well as radiative decay. By employing hyperfine-resolved readout in synchronous differential comparisons between 87Sr ensembles with both Ramsey and spin echo spectroscopy sequences, we achieve enhanced atomic coherence times exceeding 100 s and 150 s, respectively, and demonstrate that the differential instability becomes less sensitive to the interrogation time, enabling longer coherent measurements without a reduction in performance. We anticipate that this hyperfine-resolved readout technique will benefit applications of state-of-the-art optical lattice clock comparisons in which the coherence times or stabilities are constrained by Raman scattering or radiative decay.

Title: Interface-Bound States and Majorana Zero Modes in Lateral Heterostructures of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with Proximity-Induced Superconductivity
Authors: Yoonkang Kim
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the emergence of interface-bound states, particularly Majorana zero modes (MZMs), in a lateral heterostructure composed of two three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, under the influence of proximity-induced superconductivity from niobium (Nb) contacts. We develop an advanced two-dimensional Dirac model for the topological surface states (TSS), incorporating spatially varying chemical potentials and s-wave superconducting pairing. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism, we derive analytical solutions for the bound states and compute the local density of states (LDOS) at the interface, revealing zero-energy modes characteristic of MZMs. The topological nature of these states is rigorously analyzed through winding numbers and Pfaffian invariants, and their robustness is explored under various physical perturbations, including gating effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this heterostructure as a platform for topological quantum computing, with detailed predictions for experimental signatures via tunneling spectroscopy.

Title: Doping Topological Dirac Semimetal with magnetic impurities: electronic structure of Mn-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$
Authors: H. Ness, I. Leahy, A. Rice, D. Pashov, K. Alberi, M. van Schilfgaarde
Abstract: The prospect of transforming a Dirac topological semimetal (TSM) into a Weyl TSM phase, following doping by magnetic impurities, is central to TSM applications. The magnetic field from polarized $d$ levels of magnetic impurities produces a field with a sharp local structure. To what extent magnetic impurities act in the same manner as an applied field and what are the effects of such a field on the electronic structure of a Dirac TSM is the subject of this paper. We present electronic structure calculations of bulk Cd$_3$As$_2$ with substitutional doping of Mn impurities in the dilute alloy range. Quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) ab-initio electronic structure calculations are used in conjunction with $k \cdot p$ model Hamiltonian calculations. As expected, we observe the splitting of the Dirac points into pairs of Weyl points following the doping with Mn. We also show that the electronic structure of Mn-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ can be emulated by the electronic structure of pristine Cd$_3$As$_2$ with an appropriate external magnetic field. Some properties of the conductivity of bulk Cd$_3$As$_2$ for different magnetic field orientations are also investigated. Our results inform future opportunities for unique device functionality based on band structure tuning not found in conventional magnetic Weyl TSM.

Title: Energy self-balance as the physical basis of orbit quantization
Authors: Álvaro G. López, Rahil N. Valani
Abstract: We show that work done by the non conservative forces along a stable limit cycle attractor of a dissipative dynamical system is always equal to zero. Thus, mechanical energy is preserved on average along periodic orbits. This balance between energy gain and energy loss along different phases of the self sustained oscillation is responsible for the existence of quantized orbits in such systems. Furthermore, we show that the instantaneous preservation of projected phase space areas along quantized orbits describes the neutral dynamics of the phase, allowing us to derive from this equation the Wilson Sommerfeld like quantization condition. We apply our general results to near Hamiltonian systems, identifying the fixed points of Krylov Bogoliubov radial equation governing the dynamics of the limit cycles with the zeros of the Melnikov function. Moreover, we relate the instantaneous preservation of the phase space area along the quantized orbits to the second Krylov Bogoliubov equation describing the dynamics of the phase. We test the two quantization conditions in the context of hydrodynamic quantum analogs, where a megastable spectra of quantized orbits have recently been discovered. Specifically, we use a generalized pilot wave model for a walking droplet confined in a harmonic potential, and find a countably infinite set of nested limit cycle attractors representing a classical analog of quantized orbits. We compute the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions of this self excited system.

Title: Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks
Authors: Lucas Jordao, Qi Huang, Swarnabha Chattaraj, Siyuan Lu, Jiefei Zhang, Anupam Madhukar
Abstract: On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, characteristic of a delicate balance between the confinement potential volume, depth, and the resulting binding energy of the center of mass motion of the exciton and the exciton binding energy. In the exciton's weak confinement regime, direct enhancement of the quantum dot oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated for emitters in large arrays. Our findings provide compelling incentive for investigations of the potential of SESRE based tailored MTSQDs of lattice matched and mismatched material combinations for fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by these unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis correlations via non-linear Hydrodynamics
Authors: Jiaozi Wang, Ruchira Mishra, Tian-Hua Yang, Luca V. Delacrétaz, Silvia Pappalardi
Abstract: The thermalizing dynamics of many-body systems is often described through the lens of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). ETH postulates that the statistical properties of observables, when expressed in the energy eigenbasis, are described by smooth functions, that also describe correlations among the matrix elements. However, the form of these functions is usually left undetermined. In this work, we investigate the structure of such smooth functions by focusing on their Fourier transform, recently identified as free cumulants. Using non-linear hydrodynamics, we provide a prediction for the late-time behavior of time-ordered free cumulants in the thermodynamic limit. The prediction is further corroborated by large-scale numerical simulations of a non-integrable spin-$1$ Ising model, which exhibits diffusive transport behavior. Good agreement is observed in both infinite and finite-temperature regimes and for a collection of local observables. Our results indicate that the smooth multi-point correlation functions within the ETH framework admit a universal hydrodynamic description at low frequencies.

Title: Surface hopping simulations show valley depolarization driven by exciton-phonon resonance
Authors: Alex Krotz, Roel Tempelaar
Abstract: Monolayer MoS$_2$ has long served as a prototypical material exhibiting valleytronic behavior, yet it remains unclear exactly how phonons induce a valley depolarization of its excitonic states. Here, we apply a mixed quantum--classical simulation framework to study the phonon-induced mechanisms affecting valley polarization at short times. Our framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, while retaining explicit information on transient phonon occupancies. By means of such occupancies, our simulations show a resonance between the lowest exciton band and the dominant optical phonon branch to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle-Silva-Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.

Title: Emergence of gravity from quantum field theory in triangulated spacetime and the QFT vector model
Authors: Matti Raasakka
Abstract: We formulate quantum field theory in triangulated spacetime using compositional quantum field theory and tensor network methods. We show that gravitational interactions emerge as a low-energy effective phenomenon in this framework. For concrete calculations we use free massive scalar field theory in two-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, but the results generalize to other models and higher dimensions. Finally, our results lead us to propose a new approach to the unification of quantum field theory with gravity, the QFT vector model, which combines insights and techniques from various current approaches to quantum gravity such as causal dynamical triangulations, random tensor models, group field theory, emergent gravity and holography.

Title: Pseudo-Goldstone Modes at Finite Temperature
Authors: Xiyue Lin, Tao Shi
Abstract: Goldstone's theorem and its extension to pseudo-Goldstone (PG) modes have profound implications across diverse areas of physics, from quantum chromodynamics to quantum magnetism. PG modes emerge from accidental degeneracies lifted by quantum and thermal fluctuations, leading to a finite gap--a phenomenon known as "order by disorder." In this paper, we derive a general curvature formula for the PG gap at finite temperature, applicable to both collinear (e.g., ferromagnets and anti-ferromagnets) and noncollinear magnetic orders (e.g., coplanar orders in frustrated magnetic systems). After validating our formula against known models, we apply it to the XXZ model on the triangular lattice, which hosts coplanar magnetic orders in equilibrium and is relevant to materials such as Na2BaCo(PO4)2 and K2Co(SeO3)2, known for their supersolid phases and giant magnetocaloric effects. Our results reveal a distinct scaling behavior: a linear decrease of the PG gap with temperature, driven by entropy effects from magnon scattering across multiple bands. This stands in stark contrast to the high-temperature scaling recently proposed for systems with a single magnon band. This work establishes a general framework for investigating PG modes at finite temperatures and opens an avenue to explore rich quantum phases and dynamics in frustrated systems with noncollinear magnetic orders.

Title: A Black-box Testing Framework for Oracle Quantum Programs
Authors: Peixun Long, Jianjun Zhao
Abstract: Oracle quantum programs are a fundamental class of quantum programs that serve as a critical bridge between quantum computing and classical computing. Many important quantum algorithms are built upon oracle quantum programs, making it essential to ensure their correctness during development. While software testing is a well-established approach for improving program reliability, no systematic method has been developed to test oracle quantum programs. This paper proposes a black-box testing framework designed for general oracle quantum programs. We define these programs formally, establish the foundational theory for their testing, and propose a detailed testing framework. We develop a prototype tool and conduct extensive experimental evaluations to evaluate the framework's effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly aids developers in testing oracle quantum programs, providing insights to enhance the reliability of quantum software.

Title: Single-atom imaging of ${}^{173}$Yb in optical tweezers loaded by a five-beam magneto-optical trap
Authors: Omar Abdel Karim, Alessandro Muzi Falconi, Riccardo Panza, Wenliang Liu, Francesco Scazza
Abstract: We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom imaging fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition. The demonstrated capabilities will play a key role in future quantum simulations and computing applications with ${}^{173}$Yb arrays.

Title: Thermoelectric processes of quantum normal-superconductor interfaces
Authors: L. Arrachea, A. Braggio, P. Burset, E. J. H. Lee, A. Levy Yeyati, R. Sánchez
Abstract: Superconducting interfaces have recently been demonstrated to contain a rich variety of effects that give rise to sizable thermoelectric responses and unexpected thermal properties, despite traditionally being considered poor thermoelectrics due to their intrinsic electron-hole symmetry. We review different mechanisms driving this response in hybrid normal-superconducting junctions, depending on the dimensionality of the mesoscopic interface. In addition to discussing heat to power conversion, cooling and heat transport, special emphasis is put on physical properties of hybrid devices that can be revealed by the thermoelectric effect.

Title: Interaction Effects on the Electronic Floquet Spectra: Excitonic Effects
Authors: Teng Xiao, Tsan Huang, Changhua Bao, Zhiyuan Sun
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) and ultrafast optical experiments.

Title: Multiqubit coherence of mixed states near event horizon
Authors: Wen-Mei Li, Jianbo Lu, Shu-Min Wu
Abstract: We study physically accessible and inaccessible N-qubit coherence of the mixed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states for bosonic and fermionic fields when any $n$ ($n<N$) qubits hover over the Schwarzschild black hole. We derive a comprehensive analytical expression for the coherence of mixed N-qubit systems, taking into account both accessible and inaccessible components in the curved spacetime background. Notably, as the number of qubits increases in the mixed W state, its coherence becomes more robust against the degrading effects of Hawking radiation, even as entanglement becomes more fragile. Moreover, with increasing Hawking temperature, W-state coherence surpasses that of the GHZ state, while the entanglement of the W state remains consistently weaker than that of the GHZ state. Interestingly, in Schwarzschild spacetime, fermionic fields exhibit stronger multiqubit entanglement, while bosonic fields show greater multiqubit coherence, revealing a fundamental contrast in their behavior under strong gravity. Our study reveals how Schwarzschild spacetime reshapes quantum resource trade-offs across states, statistics, and correlations, guiding relativistic quantum information tasks.

Title: Decoherence of quantum superpositions in near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes with quantum gravity corrections
Authors: Ran Li, Zhong-Xiao Man, Jin Wang
Abstract: We study the quantum gravity corrected decoherence of quantum superpositions in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes. By employing the effective field theory approach, we model the black hole as a quantum system coupled to an external source via a scalar field, and derive the relation between the decoherence rate and the two-point correlation function of the operators acting on the black quantum system. By utilizing the low-energy Schwarzian effective theory, which captures the boundary dynamics of the $AdS_2$ near-horizon geometry of the near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes, we compute the decoherence rate both in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. We find that in the microcanonical ensemble, where the black hole energy is fixed, quantum gravity corrections do not modify the decoherence rate compared to the semiclassical prediction. However, in the canonical ensemble, where the black hole is in a thermal equilibrium state, quantum gravitational effects significantly enhance the decoherence rate at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that even in the near-extremal limit where Hawking radiation is suppressed, quantum gravitational fluctuations can strongly influence the coherence of nearby quantum systems.

Title: Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions
Authors: Antony Valentini, Mira Varma
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, could be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which are to be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.

Title: Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in Metric Variables: The $\barμ$ Scheme
Authors: L. Boldorini, G. Montani
Abstract: We study, using the metric variables, how an effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.

Title: Explosive growth of bistability in a cavity magnonic system
Authors: Meng-Xia Bi, Huawei Fan, Wenting Wu, Jing-Jing He, Ming-Liang Hu, Xiao-Hong Yan
Abstract: We conduct a theoretical investigation into explosive growth of bistability in a cavity magnonic system incorporating magnetic nonlinearity. In this system, the coupling between the magnon and photon generates the cavity magnon polaritons. When driving the photon-like polariton mode, the bistability can undergo a sudden transition with the increase of the driving power, resulting in an explosive growth of the bistable region by several times. Conversely, driving the magnon-like polariton mode only gives rise to normal bistability. This depends on whether the minimum driving power required to generate the bistability is non-monotonic with respect to the driving frequency. In addition, despite driving only the photon-like polariton mode, the photon- and magnon-like polariton modes can show simultaneous explosive growth of the bistability in microwave transmission, owing to the light-matter interaction. Our research sheds light on the hidden side of the nonlinear cavity magnonic system and provides a potential application for cavity spintronic devices founded on this novel feature.

Title: Circuit Partitioning Using Large Language Models for Quantum Compilation and Simulations
Authors: Pranav Sinha, Sumit Kumar Jha, Sunny Raj
Abstract: We are in the midst of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where quantum computers are limited by noisy gates, some of which are more error-prone than others and can render the final computation incomprehensible. Quantum circuit compilation algorithms attempt to minimize these noisy gates when mapping quantum algorithms onto quantum hardware but face computational challenges that restrict their application to circuits with no more than 5-6 qubits, necessitating the need to partition large circuits before the application of noisy quantum gate minimization algorithms. The existing generation of these algorithms is heuristic in nature and does not account for downstream gate minimization tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to change this and help improve quantum circuit partitions. This paper investigates the use of LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral, for partitioning quantum circuits by capitalizing on their abilities to understand and generate code, including QASM. Specifically, we teach LLMs to partition circuits using the quick partition approach of the Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. Through experimental evaluations, we show that careful fine-tuning of open source LLMs enables us to obtain an accuracy of 53.4% for the partition task while over-the-shelf LLMs are unable to correctly partition circuits, using standard 1-shot and few-shot training approaches.

Title: Interplay of localization and topology in disordered dimerized array of Rydberg atoms
Authors: Maksym Prodius, Adith Sai Aramthottil, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunnelings decaying according to power-law with the distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for the continuous tuning of dimerization patterns and disorder strength. We identify different distinct ergodicity-breaking regimes within the parameter space constrained by our geometry. Notably, one of these regimes exhibits a unique feature in which non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) properties of the ground state extend to a noticeable fraction of states across the entire spectrum. This interplay between localization and SPT makes the system particularly interesting, as localization should help with stabilization of topological excitations, while SPT states contribute to an additional delocalization. Other regions of parameters correspond to more standard nonergodic dynamics resembling many-body localization.

Title: Naturalistic Metaphysics and the Parity Thesis: Why Scientific Realism Doesn't Lead to Realism about Metaphysics
Authors: Raoni Arroyo, Matteo Morganti
Abstract: In recent work, Nina Emery has defended the view that, in the context of naturalistic metaphysics, one should maintain the same epistemic attitude towards science and metaphysics. That is, naturalists who are scientific realists ought to be realists about metaphysics as well; and naturalists who are antirealists about science should also be antirealists about metaphysics. We call this the `parity thesis'. This paper suggests that the parity thesis is widely, albeit often implicitly, accepted among naturalistically inclined philosophers, and essentially for reasons similar to Emery's. Then, reasons are provided for resisting Emery's specific inference from scientific realism to realism about metaphysics. The resulting picture is a more nuanced view of the relationship between science and metaphysics within the naturalistic setting than the one which is currently most popular.

Title: Emerging (2+1)D electrodynamics and topological instanton in pseudo-Hermitian two-level systems
Authors: Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng
Abstract: We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.

Authors: Eric Brunner, Lukas Pausch, Edoardo G. Carnio, Gabriel Dufour, Alberto Rodríguez, Andreas Buchleitner
Abstract: We unveil the signature of many-body interference across dynamical regimes of the Bose-Hubbard model. Increasing the particles' indistinguishability enhances the temporal fluctuations of few-body observables, with a dramatic amplification at the onset of quantum chaos. By resolving the exchange symmetries of partially distinguishable particles, we explain this amplification as the fingerprint of the initial state's coherences in the eigenbasis.

Title: New protocols for quantum key distribution with explicit upper and lower bound on secret key rate
Authors: Arindam Dutta, Anirban Pathak
Abstract: We present two new schemes for quantum key distribution (QKD) that neither require entanglement nor an ideal single-photon source, making them implementable with commercially available single-photon sources. These protocols are shown to be secure against multiple attacks, including intercept-resend and a class of collective attacks. We derive bounds on the key rate and demonstrate that a specific type of classical pre-processing can increase the tolerable error limit. A trade-off between quantum resources and information revealed to an eavesdropper (Eve) is observed, with higher efficiency achievable through the use of additional quantum resources. Specifically, our proposed protocols outperform the SARG04 protocol in terms of efficiency at the cost of more quantum resources.

Title: Self-testing composite measurements and bound entangled state in a single quantum network
Authors: Shubhayan Sarkar, Chandan Datta, Saronath Halder, Remigiusz Augusiak
Abstract: Within the quantum networks scenario we introduce a single scheme allowing to certify three different types of composite projective measurements acting on a three-qubit Hilbert space: one constructed from genuinely entangled GHZ-like states, one constructed from fully product vectors that exhibit the phenomenon of nonlocality without entanglement (NLWE), and a hybrid measurement obtained from an unextendible product basis (UPB). Noticeably, we certify a basis exhibiting NLWE in the smallest dimension capable of supporting this phenomenon. On the other hand, the possibility of certification of a measurement obtained from a UPB has an interesting implication that one can also self-test a bound entangled state in the considered quantum network. Such a possibility does not seem to exist in the standard Bell scenario. Furthermore, we also analyse the robustness of our scheme towards experimental errors.

Title: Concrete Quantum Channels and Algebraic Structure of Abstract Quantum Channels
Authors: M. N. N. Namboodiri
Abstract: This article analyzes the algebraic structure of the set of all quantum channels and its subset consisting of quantum channels that have Holevo representation. The regularity of these semigroups under composition of mappings is analyzed. It is also known that these sets are compact convex sets and, therefore, rich in geometry. An attempt is made to identify generalized invertible channels and also the idempotent channels. When channels are of the Holevo type, these two problems are fully studied in this article. The motivation behind this study is its applicability to the reversibility of channel transformations and recent developments in resource-destroying channels, which are idempotents. This is related to the coding-encoding problem in quantum information theory. Several examples are provided, with the main examples coming from pre-conditioner maps which assign preconditioners to matrices in numerical linear algebra. Thus, the known pre-conditioner maps are viewed as quantum channels in finite dimensions. In addition, the infinite-dimensional analogue of preconditioners is introduced and certain limit theorems are discussed; this is with an aim to analyze asymptotic methods in quantum channels analogous to problems in asymptotic linear algebra.

Title: Advances in Bosonic Quantum Error Correction with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Codes: Theory, Engineering and Applications
Authors: Anthony J. Brady, Alec Eickbusch, Shraddha Singh, Jing Wu, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: Encoding quantum information into a set of harmonic oscillators is considered a hardware efficient approach to mitigate noise for reliable quantum information processing. Various codes have been proposed to encode a qubit into an oscillator -- including cat codes, binomial codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes -- and are among the first to reach a break-even point for quantum error correction. Though GKP codes are widely recognized for their promise in quantum computation, they also facilitate near-optimal quantum communication rates in bosonic channels and offer the ability to safeguard arbitrary quantum states of oscillators. This review focuses on the basic working mechanism, performance characterization, and the many applications of GKP codes -- emphasizing recent experimental progress in superconducting circuit architectures and theoretical advancements in multimode GKP qubit codes and oscillators-to-oscillators (O2O) codes. We begin with a preliminary continuous-variable formalism needed for bosonic codes. We then proceed to the quantum engineering involved to physically realize GKP states. We take a deep dive into GKP stabilization and preparation in superconducting architectures and examine proposals for realizing GKP states in the optical domain (along with a concise review of GKP realization in trapped-ion platforms). Finally, we present multimode GKP qubits and GKP-O2O codes, examine code performance and discuss applications of GKP codes in quantum information processing tasks such as computing, communication, and sensing.

Title: Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons
Authors: Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.

Title: Resource-efficient Generalized Quantum Subspace Expansion
Authors: Bo Yang, Nobuyuki Yoshioka, Hiroyuki Harada, Shigeo Hakkaku, Yuuki Tokunaga, Hideaki Hakoshima, Kaoru Yamamoto, Suguru Endo
Abstract: Realizing practical quantum computing requires overcoming a number of computation errors and the limitation of device size, which have intensively been tackled by quantum error mitigation (QEM) these days. As a unified approach of noise-agnostic QEM, generalized quantum subspace expansion (GSE) has lately been proposed to be remarkably robust against stochastic and coherent errors, integrating quantum subspace expansion and virtual state purification. However, the requirement in GSE to perform entangled measurements between copies of the quantum states remains a significant drawback under the current situation of quantum devices with a restricted number of qubits and their connectivity. In this work, we propose ``Dual-GSE'', a resource-efficient implementation of GSE to circumvent this overhead by constructing an ansatz of error-mitigated quantum states via dual-state purification without state copies. Remarkably, the proposed method can further simulate larger quantum systems beyond the size of available quantum hardware, achieved by a suitable ansatz construction inspired by the divide-and-conquer strategy that classically reintroduces the effect of entanglement. While classically forging the entanglement comes with additional cost, the total sampling overhead can be notably reduced by reusing the same Pauli expectation values among divided-and-conquered subsystems. We comprehensively analyze the advantages and overhead of Dual-GSE and perform numerical simulations of the eight-qubit transverse-field Ising model under various setups. Our results demonstrate that Dual-GSE estimates the ground state energy with high accuracy under gate noise with low mitigation overhead and practical sampling cost.

Title: Using Quantum Switches to Mitigate Noise in Grover's Search Algorithm
Authors: Suryansh Srivastava, Arun K. Pati, Samyadeb Bhattacharya, Indranil Chakrabarty
Abstract: Grover's quantum search algorithm promises a quadratic speedup for unstructured search over its classical counterpart. But this advantage is affected by noise acting on the search space. Here, we show that a quantum switch can act as a resource to mitigate the effects of noise. In this scenario, the noise is modeled by a depolarizing channel, which coherently acts on the entire quantum register. We show that a quantum switch can significantly reduce the error in Grover's search algorithm. We consider the success probability of finding the marked item as the sole quantifier of diminishing the effect of noise in the search space in the presence of quantum switch. We propose two frameworks for the application of quantum switches. In the first framework, we apply the superposition of channel's orders in the form of a switch and do a post-selection at every iteration of the applications of the Grover operator. In the second framework, we delay this measurement and post-selection until the very end. The number of post selections is minimal in the second scenario, and hence the noise reduction can be attributed more to the presence of quantum switch. We illustrate with an example of significant advantage in the success probability of Grover's algorithm using quantum switch.

Title: Experimental demonstration of scalable cross-entropy benchmarking to detect measurement-induced phase transitions on a superconducting quantum processor
Authors: Hirsh Kamakari, Jiace Sun, Yaodong Li, Jonathan J. Thio, Tanvi P. Gujarati, Matthew P. A. Fisher, Mario Motta, Austin J. Minnich
Abstract: Quantum systems subject to random unitary evolution and measurements at random points in spacetime exhibit entanglement phase transitions which depend on the frequency of these measurements. Past work has experimentally observed entanglement phase transitions on near-term quantum computers, but the characterization approach using entanglement entropy is not scalable due to exponential overhead of quantum state tomography and postselection. Recently, an alternative protocol to detect entanglement phase transitions using linear cross entropy was proposed, attempting to eliminate both bottlenecks. Here, we report demonstrations of this protocol in systems with one-dimensional and all-to-all connectivities on IBM's quantum hardware on up to 22 qubits, a regime which is presently inaccessible if postselection is required. We demonstrate data collapses onto scaling functions with critical exponents in semiquantitative agreement with theory. Our demonstration of the cross entropy benchmark (XEB) protocol paves the way for studies of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and associated critical phenomena on larger near-term quantum systems.

Title: Realizing non-trivial doublon formation using a quantum computer
Authors: Biswajit Paul, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work, we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computer by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

Abstract: We adopt a method of the quantum gate teleportation for converting circuit-based quantum computation primitives into fusion networks. By using the presented scheme for the CNOT gate we construct translation of the circuit for the foliated surface code into a fault tolerant fusion network. Finally, we construct two new fusion based quantum computation models and study their fault tolerance properties.

Title: Gibbs-preserving operations requiring infinite amount of quantum coherence
Authors: Hiroyasu Tajima, Ryuji Takagi
Abstract: Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.

Title: Adaptive sampling-based optimization of quantics tensor trains for noisy functions: applications to quantum simulations
Authors: Kohtaroh Sakaue, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Rihito Sakurai
Abstract: Tensor cross interpolation (TCI) is a powerful technique for learning a tensor train (TT) by adaptively sampling a target tensor based on an interpolation formula. However, when the tensor evaluations contain random noise, optimizing the TT is more advantageous than interpolating the noise. Here, we propose a new method that starts with an initial guess of TT and optimizes it using non-linear least-squares by fitting it to measured points obtained from TCI. We use quantics TCI (QTCI) in this method and demonstrate its effectiveness on sine and two-time correlation functions, with each evaluated with random noise. The resulting QTT exhibits increased robustness against noise compared to the QTCI method. Furthermore, we employ this optimized QTT of the correlation function in quantum simulation based on pseudo-imaginary-time evolution, resulting in ground-state energy with higher accuracy than the QTCI or Monte Carlo methods.

Title: Reducing the Resources Required by ADAPT-VQE Using Coupled Exchange Operators and Improved Subroutines
Authors: Mafalda Ramôa, Panagiotis G. Anastasiou, Luis Paulo Santos, Nicholas J. Mayhall, Edwin Barnes, Sophia E. Economou
Abstract: Adaptive variational quantum algorithms arguably offer the best prospects for quantum advantage in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era. Since the inception of the first such algorithm, the Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE), many improvements have appeared in the literature. We combine the key improvements along with a novel operator pool -- which we term Coupled Exchange Operator (CEO) pool -- to assess the cost of running state-of-the-art ADAPT-VQE on hardware in terms of measurement counts and circuit depth. We show a dramatic reduction of these quantum computational resources compared to the early versions of the algorithm: CNOT count, CNOT depth and measurement costs are reduced by up to 88%, 96% and 99.6%, respectively, for molecules represented by 12 to 14 qubits (LiH, H6 and BeH2). We also find that our state-of-the-art CEO-ADAPT-VQE outperforms the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles ansatz, the most widely used static VQE ansatz, in all relevant metrics, and offers a five order of magnitude decrease in measurement costs as compared to other static ansätze with competitive CNOT counts.

Title: Third-Order Perturbative OTOC of the Harmonic Oscillator with Quartic Interaction and Quantum Chaos
Authors: Wung-Hong Huang
Abstract: We calculate the third-order out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) of a simple harmonic oscillator with an additional quartic interaction using the second quantization method. We obtain analytic relations for the spectrum, Fock space states, and matrix elements of the coordinate, which are then used to numerically evaluate the OTOC. We observe that after the scrambling, the OTOC becomes a fluctuation around a saturation point at later times, which is associated with quantum chaotic behavior in systems that exhibit chaos. We analyze the early-time properties of the OTOC and find that in systems with sufficiently strong quartic interactions, an exponential growth curve fitting over a long time window clearly emerges in the third-order perturbation

Title: Classical communication cost of a bipartite quantum channel assisted by non-signalling correlations
Authors: Chengkai Zhu, Xuanqiang Zhao, Xin Wang
Abstract: Understanding the classical communication cost of simulating a quantum channel is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory, which becomes even more intriguing when considering the role of non-locality in quantum information processing. This paper investigates the bidirectional classical communication cost of simulating a bipartite quantum channel assisted by non-signalling correlations, which are permitted across the spatial dimension between the two parties. By introducing non-signalling superchannels, we present lower and upper bounds on the one-shot $\epsilon$-error one-way classical communication cost of a bipartite channel via its smooth max-relative entropy of one-way classical communication, and establish that the asymptotic exact cost is given by its max-relative entropy of one-way classical communication. For the bidirectional scenario, we derive semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations for the one-shot exact bidirectional classical communication cost via non-signalling bipartite superchannels. We further introduce a channel's bipartite conditional min-entropy as an efficiently computable lower bound on the asymptotic cost of bidirectional classical communication. Our results in both one-shot and asymptotic settings provide lower bounds on the entanglement-assisted simulation cost in scenarios where entanglement is available to the two parties. Moreover, we propose a seesaw-based algorithm to compute an upper bound on the minimum simulation error via local operations and shared entanglement, which provides valuable insights into the relationship between non-signalling bipartite superchannels and more physically realizable protocols. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in estimating communication costs for various quantum channels, showing that our bounds can be tight in different scenarios.

Title: Beam splitter for dark and bright states of light
Authors: Luiz O. R. Solak, Celso J. Villas-Boas, Daniel Z. Rossatto
Abstract: Beam splitters are indispensable elements in optical and photonic systems, and are therefore employed in both classical and quantum technologies. Depending on the intended application, these devices can divide incident light according to its power, polarization state, or wavelength. In this work, we theoretically present a novel type of beam splitter capable of separating a light beam into its two-mode bright and dark components. We propose a prototype based on an optical cross-cavity system resonantly coupled to a $\Lambda$-type three-level atom. The dark component of the incoming light is transmitted because the antisymmetric collective mode of the cavity setup is decoupled from the atom. Meanwhile, in a high-cooperativity regime, the bright component is reflected due to Autler-Townes splitting, which arises from the strong coupling between the atom and the symmetric collective mode of the cavity setup. Although the device requires only a two-level atom to operate, using a three-level atom allows the device to be turned on or off by controlling the atomic ground state. Our results pave the way for new applications of beam splitters that leverage the collective properties of light. Manipulating and exploiting this additional degree of freedom can advance the field of quantum optics and contribute to the development of quantum technologies.

Title: Super-bunching light with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events

Abstract: Non-classical light sources emitting bundles of N-photons with strong correlation represent versatile resources of interdisciplinary importance with applications ranging from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to quantum information processing. Yet, high-order correlations, gN(0),quantifying photon correlation, are still limited to hundreds. Here, we report the generation of a super-bunching light source in photonic crystal fiber with g2(0) reaching 5.86*104 and g5(0) up to 2.72*108, through measuring its photon number probability distributions. under giant g2(0) values, the super-bunching light source presents upturned-tail photon distributions and ubiquitous extreme multi-photon events, where 31 photons from a single light pulse at a mean of 1.99*10-4 photons per pulse have been determined. The probability of this extreme event has been enhanced by 10139 folds compared to a coherent laser with Poissonian distribution. By varying the power of the pumping laser, both photon number distributions and corresponding high-order correlations of this light source can be substantially tailored from Poissonian to super-bunching distributions. These phenomena are attributed to the synchronized nonlinear interactions in photonic crystal fibers pumping by bright squeezed light, and the theoretical simulations agree well with the experimental results. Our research showcases the ability to achieve non-classical light sources with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events, paving the way for high-order correlation imaging, extreme nonlinear optical effects, quantum information processing, and exploring light-matter interactions with multi-photon physics.

Title: Vibrationally coupled Rydberg atom-ion molecules
Authors: Ilango Maran, Liam J. Bond, Jeremy T. Young, Arghavan Safavi-Naini, Rene Gerritsma
Abstract: We study the occurrence of Rydberg atom-ion molecules (RAIMs) in a hybrid atom-ion system with an ion crystal trapped in a Paul trap coupled to Rydberg atoms on its either ends. To assess the feasibility of such a system, we perform a detailed Floquet analysis of the effect of the Paul trap's rf potential on the RAIMs and provide a qualitative analysis of the survival probability based on scaling laws. We conclude that the RAIM survives for sufficiently weak and low frequency traps. We then use this hybrid system and propose a scheme to utilise the common motional modes of the ion crystal to suppress (blockade) or enhance (anti-blockade) the probability of forming two RAIMs at the ends of the chain, replacing the typical blockade radius by the length of the ion crystal.

Title: Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits
Authors: Zhiyuan Wang
Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.

Title: Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions
Authors: Aleksei Khindanov, Igor L. Aleiner, Lara Faoro, Lev B. Ioffe
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.

Title: Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation
Authors: D. Karlovets, A. Chaikovskaia, D. Grosman, D. Kargina, A. Shchepkin, G. Sizykh
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative and necessitates going beyond the far-field approximation. The calculated time scales lie in the attosecond range for the relevant parameters, thus linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.

Title: Quantum detailed balance via elementary transitions
Authors: Rocco Duvenhage, Kyle Oerder, Keagan van den Heuvel
Abstract: Quantum detailed balance is formulated in terms of elementary transitions, in close analogy to detailed balance in a classical Markov chain on a finite set of points. An elementary transition is taken to be a pure state of two copies of the quantum system, as a quantum analogue of an ordered pair of classical points representing a classical transition from the first to the second point. This form of quantum detailed balance is shown to be equivalent to standard quantum detailed balance with respect to a reversing operation, thus providing a new conceptual foundation for the latter. Aspects of parity in quantum detailed balance are clarified in the process. The connection with the Accardi-Cecchini dual and the KMS dual (or Petz recovery map) is also elucidated.

Abstract: We study the problem of tolerant testing of stabilizer states. In particular, we give the first such algorithm that accepts mixed state inputs. Formally, given a mixed state $\rho$ that either has fidelity at least $\varepsilon_1$ with some stabilizer pure state or fidelity at most $\varepsilon_2$ with all such states, where $\varepsilon_2 \leq \varepsilon_1^{O(1)}$, our algorithm distinguishes the two cases with sample complexity $\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$ and time complexity $O(n \cdot \text{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1))$.

Title: Inhomogeneous SU(2) symmetries in homogeneous integrable U(1) circuits and transport
Authors: Marko Znidaric
Abstract: Symmetries are important for understanding equilibrium as well as nonequilibrium properties like transport. In translationally invariant extended systems one might expect symmetry generators to also be homogeneous. Studying qubit circuits with nearest-neighbor U(1) gates we show that this needs not be the case. We find new inhomogeneous screw SU(2) and ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$ symmetries whose generators exhibit a spatial quasi-momentum modulation. They can be viewed as a parameter-dependent generalization of the standard rotational symmetry of the Heisenberg model and can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a momentum-resolved propagator. Rich integrability structure is reflected also in transport: picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition through different phases, including fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold that also contains helix states, diffusion, and localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.

Title: Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells
Authors: Róbert Németh, Vatsal K. Bandaru, Pedro Alves, Merritt P. Losert, Emma Brann, Owen M. Eskandari, Hudaiba Soomro, Avani Vivrekar, M. A. Eriksson, Mark Friesen
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a full qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.

Title: Enhancement of non-Gaussianity and nonclassicality of pair coherent states with postselected von Neumann measurement
Authors: Yi-Fang Ren, Janarbek Yuanbek, Yusuf Turek
Abstract: We investigate the effects of postselected von Neumann measurements on the nonclassical properties of pair coherent states (PCS). We calculated key quantum characteristics, such as squeezing, photon statistics, and entanglement between the two PCS modes. Our results demonstrate that postselected von Neumann measurements enhance both the non-Gaussianity and nonclassicality of PCS. These findings are validated by analyzing the scaled joint Wigner function across various system parameters. The theoretical optimization scheme offers an alternative approach for improving PCS-based quantum information efficiency and facilitates practical implementations in quantum technologies.

Title: Reduction-induced the Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy
Authors: Jing-Min Zhu
Abstract: The organization and structure of bipartite mixed-state quantum entanglement (QE) is more complicated and less well understood than that of bipartite pure-state QE. Bipartite mixed-state QEs and their measures play a crucial role in both theory and practical applications. Existing measures comprise two classes: one class involves quantifying the minimum QE and reflect the inherently complex nature of their computation, while the other is only applicable to highly limited-dimensional quantum systems. In this context, we propose a method termed Reduction-induced Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy (RIVPVNE) to quantify QE in any bipartite states especially for any bipartite mixed-states, which is essentially an extension of Partial Von Neumann Entropy for measuring QE from bipartite pure states to any bipartite states. This method exhibits minimal computational complexity and broad applicability. Its intuitive and clear physical representation, combined with easy computation and wide applicability, facilitates exploring its potential applications. Furthermore, we present examples to demonstrate the superiorities of this method in identifying bipartite QE by comparing with other existing bipartite mixed-state QE measures through both their physical implications and mathematical structures.

Title: Port-based telecloning of an unknown quantum state
Authors: Reiji Okada, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi
Abstract: Telecloning is a protocol introduced by Murao et al. [Phys. Rev. A 59, 156 (1999)] to distribute copies of an unknown quantum state to many receivers in a way that beats the trivial ``clone-and-teleport'' protocol. In the last decade, a new type of teleportation called port-based teleportation, in which the receiver can recover the state without having to actively perform correction operations, but simply by looking at the correct port, has been widely studied. In this paper, we consider the analog of telecloning, where conventional teleportation is replaced by the port-based variant. To achieve this, we generalize the optimal measurement used in port-based teleportation and develop a new one that achieves port-based telecloning. Numerical results show that, in certain cases, the proposed protocol is strictly better than the trivial clone-and-teleport approach.

Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor oscillations are of primary importance in understanding the dynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae and subsequent terrestrial detection, but also among the most challenging aspects of numerical simulations. This situation is complicated by the quantum many-body nature of the problem due to neutrino-neutrino interactions which demands a quantum treatment. An additional complication is the presence of three flavors, which often is approximated by the electron flavor and a heavy lepton flavor. In this work, we provide both qubit and qutrit encodings for all three flavors, and develop optimized quantum circuits for the time evolution and analyze the Trotter error. We conclude our study with a hardware experiment of a system of two neutrinos with superconducting hardware: the IBM Torino device for qubits and AQT device for qutrits. We find that error mitigation greatly helps in obtaining a signal consistent with simulations. While hardware results are comparable at this stage, we expect the qutrit setup to be more convenient for large-scale simulations since it does not suffer from probability leakage into nonphsycial qubit space, unlike the qubit setup.

Specifically, we summarize the application of tensor networks in various domains of quantum computing, including simulation of quantum computation, quantum circuit synthesis, quantum error correction and mitigation, and quantum machine learning. Finally, we provide an outlook on the opportunities and the challenges of the tensor-network techniques.

Title: Single-photon-added coherent state based postselected weak measurement
Authors: Yi-Fang Ren, Yusuf Turek
Abstract: We investigated precision measurements in a two-level system coupled to a single-photon-added coherent state (SPACS) under postselection measurement. We analyzed strategies for improving measurement precision, including parameter estimation and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in postselected weak measurements using the photon statistics of SPACS as the meter. Our results demonstrate that SPACS-based postselected weak measurements can outperform conventional measurement schemes in terms of precision. Additionally, we explicitly introduced an alternative weak measurement method commonly applied in dispersive light-atom interactions. Our work offers a new way for addressing fundamental issues in quantum precision measurement based on photon statistics, and it provides a method for extracting the phase and phase shifts of radiation fields through the weak values of system observables.

Abstract: This article reviews the current state of the field of quantum repeaters (QRs) based on Quantum Dots (QDs). First, we provide a short introduction to QRs. Then, we give an overview of the state of the art of non-classical photon sources based on III-V QDs. We discuss their performance and benchmark them according to critical parameters such as their low multiphoton emission probability and indistinguishability. Then, we discuss quantum repeaters focusing firstly on all-photonic QRs. Secondly, we discuss memory based QRs with QDs as photon sources and alkali vapors as memories. We review storage protocols and their compatibility with NIR and telecom QDs. Finally, we review enabling technologies that facilitate deploying these systems in commercial fiber networks.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. PHOENIX employs the binary symplectic form (BSF) to formally describe Pauli strings and reformulates IR synthesis as reducing the column weights of BSF by appropriate Clifford transformations. It comes with a heuristic BSF simplification algorithm that searches for the most appropriate 2Q Clifford operators in sequence to maximally simplify the BSF at each step, until the BSF can be directly synthesized by basic 1Q and 2Q gates. PHOENIX further performs a global ordering strategy in a Tetris-like fashion for these simplified IR groups, carefully balancing optimization opportunities for gate cancellation, minimizing circuit depth, and managing qubit routing overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.

Title: Non-Markovian N-spin chain quantum battery in thermal charging process
Authors: Shun-Cai Zhao, Zi-Ran Zhao, Ni-Ya Zhuang
Abstract: Ergotropy serves as a key indicator for assessing the performance of quantum batteries(QBs). Using the Redfield master equation, we investigate ergotropy dynamics in a non-Markovian QB composed of an N-spin chain embedded in a microcavity. Distinct from Markovian charging process, the thermal charging process exhibits a distinct oscillatory behavior in the extracted ergotropy. We show these oscillations are suppressible via synergistic control of coherent driving, cavity parameters, and spin-spin couplings. In addition, we analyze the influence of various system and environmental parameters on the time evolution of ergotropy, revealing rich dynamical features. Our results offer new insights into the control of energy extraction in QBs and may inform future designs of practical battery architectures.

Title: Elementary atoms in spaces of constant curvature by the Nikiforov-Uvarov method
Authors: Abdaljalel E. Alizzi, Alina E. Sagaydak, Zurab K. Silagadze
Abstract: The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is a simple, yet elegant and powerful method for solving second-order differential equations of generalized hypergeometric type. In the past, it has been used to solve many problems in quantum mechanics and elsewhere. We apply this method to the classical problem of hydrogen-like atoms in spaces of constant curvature. Both the spectra of these atoms and their wave functions, including normalization, are easily obtained.

Title: Magic state distillation without measurements and post-selection
Authors: Sascha Heußen
Abstract: Magic state distillation (MSD) is a quantum algorithm that enables performing logical non-Clifford gates with in principle arbitrarily low noise level. It is herein typically assumed that logical Clifford gates can be executed without noise. Therefore, MSD is a standard subroutine to obtain a fault-tolerant universal set of quantum gate operations on error-corrected logical qubits. Well-known schemes conventionally rely on performing operator measurements and post-selection on the measurement result, which makes distillation protocols non-deterministic in the presence of noise. In this work, we adapt the 15-to-1 MSD protocol such that it deterministically suppresses noise by using a coherent feedback network on the output states without the need to perform individual qubit measurements. These advantages over textbook MSD come at the price of reducing the noise suppression per round from $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$. Our technique can be applied to any MSD protocol with an acceptance rate of 1 in the absence of noise. It may be desirable to use our scheme if the coherent feedback network can be executed faster and more reliably than the measurements and/or if logical clock cycles in the quantum processor should be kept synchronous at all times. Our result broadens the path of potential experimental realizations of MSD in near-term devices and advances the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers with practical use.

Title: Position-correlated biphoton wavefront sensing for quantum adaptive imaging
Authors: Yi Zheng, Zhao-Di Liu, Jian-Shun Tang, Jin-Shi Xu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo
Abstract: Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counter-intuitive phenomena. In quantum adaptive optics, biphoton spatial aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons when the source is unreachable. Here, a new method named position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing is introduced, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the back focal plane of a microlens array. Experimentally, biphoton phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film are demonstrated. This single-shot method is a more direct and efficient approach to biphoton phase measurement, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy, remote imaging, and communication.

Title: Unveiling hidden features of the Kitaev model through a complex-network analysis
Authors: Guillem Llodrà, Roberta Zambrini, Gian Luca Giorgi
Abstract: We introduce a density matrix-based network analysis to explore the ground state of the Kitaev chain, uncovering previously hidden structural and entanglement features. This approach successfully identifies the critical point associated with the topological phase transition and reveals a singular point where the ground state exhibits uniform, nonzero entanglement between all fermion pairs, corresponding to a fully connected network structure. We provide an analytical explanation for this singular behavior and establish a connection to the concept of ground state factorization observed in spin chains. Moreover, we analyze the open chain scenario and observe characteristic symmetry changes in the ground state corresponding to Majorana zero modes. While complex network theory has been employed in the study of quantum systems before, we demonstrate that it can uncover fundamentally new physical insights.

Title: Comparing classical and quantum conditional disclosure of secrets
Authors: Uma Girish, Alex May, Leo Orshansky, Chris Waddell
Abstract: The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) setting is among the most basic primitives studied in information-theoretic cryptography. Motivated by a connection to non-local quantum computation and position-based cryptography, CDS with quantum resources has recently been considered. Here, we study the differences between quantum and classical CDS, with the aims of clarifying the power of quantum resources in information-theoretic cryptography. We establish the following results: 1) For perfectly correct CDS, we give a separation for a promise version of the not-equals function, showing a quantum upper bound of $O(\log n)$ and classical lower bound of $\Omega(n)$. 2) We prove a $\Omega(\log \mathsf{R}_{0,A\rightarrow B}(f)+\log \mathsf{R}_{0,B\rightarrow A}(f))$ lower bound on quantum CDS where $\mathsf{R}_{0,A\rightarrow B}(f)$ is the classical one-way communication complexity with perfect correctness. 3) We prove a lower bound on quantum CDS in terms of two round, public coin, two-prover interactive proofs. 4) We give a logarithmic upper bound for quantum CDS on forrelation, while the best known classical algorithm is linear. We interpret this as preliminary evidence that classical and quantum CDS are separated even with correctness and security error allowed. We also give a separation for classical and quantum private simultaneous message passing for a partial function, improving on an earlier relational separation. Our results use novel combinations of techniques from non-local quantum computation and communication complexity.

Title: Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization
Authors: Nana Liu, Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.

Title: A review of applications of Quantum Energy Teleportation: from experimental tests to thermodynamics and spacetime engineering
Authors: Boris Ragula, Eduardo Martín-Martínez
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) exploits the existence of correlations to enable remote energy transfer without the need for physical energy carriers between emitter and receiver. This paper presents a review of the thermodynamic foundations of QET and reviews its first experimental demonstration (performed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), along with its implementation on publicly available superconducting quantum hardware. Additionally, we review an application of QET in the field of quantum thermodynamics as an efficient algorithmic cooling technique to cool down individual parts of interacting systems. Finally, we will review how QET can be employed to optimally generate exotic quantum states characterized by negative average stress-energy densities, offering a new operational approach to engineering such states which are promising in the context of semiclassical gravity.

Title: Quantum-Inspired Optimization Process for Data Imputation
Authors: Nishikanta Mohanty, Bikash K. Behera, Badshah Mukherjee, Christopher Ferrie
Abstract: Data imputation is a critical step in data pre-processing, particularly for datasets with missing or unreliable values. This study introduces a novel quantum-inspired imputation framework evaluated on the UCI Diabetes dataset, which contains biologically implausible missing values across several clinical features. The method integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with quantum-assisted rotations, optimized through gradient-free classical optimizers -COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution to reconstruct missing values while preserving statistical fidelity. Reconstructed values are constrained within +/-2 standard deviations of original feature distributions, avoiding unrealistic clustering around central tendencies. This approach achieves a substantial and statistically significant improvement, including an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values between 0.18 and 0.22, compared to p-values > 0.99 in classical methods such as Mean, KNN, and MICE. The method also eliminates zero-value artifacts and enhances the realism and variability of imputed data. By combining quantum-inspired transformations with a scalable classical framework, this methodology provides a robust solution for imputation tasks in domains such as healthcare and AI pipelines, where data quality and integrity are crucial.

Title: Non-Hermitian sensing from the perspective of post-selected measurements
Authors: Neng Zeng, Tao Liu, Keyu Xia, Yu-Ran Zhang, Franco Nori
Abstract: By employing the Naimark dilation, we establish a fundamental connection between non-Hermitian quantum sensing and post-selected measurements. The sensitivity of non-Hermitian quantum sensors is determined by the effective quantum Fisher information (QFI), which incorporates the success probability of post-selection. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian sensors cannot outperform their Hermitian counterpart when all information is harnessed, since the total QFI for the extended system constrains the effective QFI of the non-Hermitian subsystem. Moreover, we quantify the efficiency of non-Hermitian sensors with the ratio of the effective QFI to the total QFI, which can be optimized within the framework of post-selected measurements with minimal experimental trials. Our work provides a distinctive theoretical framework for investigating non-Hermitian quantum sensing and designing noise-resilient quantum metrological protocols.

Title: Bridging Classical and Quantum Information Scrambling with the Operator Entanglement Spectrum
Authors: Ben T. McDonough, Claudio Chamon, Justin H. Wilson, Thomas Iadecola
Abstract: Universal features of chaotic quantum dynamics underlie our understanding of thermalization in closed quantum systems and the complexity of quantum computations. Reversible automaton circuits, comprised of classical logic gates, have emerged as a tractable means to study such dynamics. Despite generating no entanglement in the computational basis, these circuits nevertheless capture many features expected from fully quantum evolutions. In this work, we demonstrate that the differences between automaton dynamics and fully quantum dynamics are revealed by the operator entanglement spectrum, much like the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state distinguishes between the dynamics of states under Clifford and Haar random circuits. While the operator entanglement spectrum under random unitary dynamics is governed by the eigenvalue statistics of random Gaussian matrices, we show evidence that under random automaton dynamics it is described by the statistics of Bernoulli random matrices, whose entries are random variables taking values $0$ or $1$. We study the crossover between automaton and generic unitary operator dynamics as the automaton circuit is doped with gates that introduce superpositions, namely Hadamard or $R_x = e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}X}$ gates. We find that a constant number of superposition-generating gates is sufficient to drive the operator dynamics to the random-circuit universality class, similar to earlier results on Clifford circuits doped with $T$ gates. This establishes the operator entanglement spectrum as a useful tool for probing the chaoticity and universality class of quantum dynamics.

Title: Rabi spectra -- a simple tool for analyzing the limitations of RWA in modelling of the selective population transfer in many-level quantum systems
Authors: Duje Bonacci
Abstract: The controlled manipulation of quantum systems is becoming an important technological tool. Rabi oscillations are one of the simplest, yet quite useful mechanisms for achieving such manipulation. However, the validity of simple Rabi theory is limited and its upgrades are usually both technically involved, as well as limited to the simple two-level systems. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a simple method for analyzing the applicability of the RWA Rabi solutions to the controlled population transfer in complex many-level quantum systems.

Title: Observation of Nagaoka Polarons in a Fermi-Hubbard Quantum Simulator
Authors: Martin Lebrat, Muqing Xu, Lev Haldar Kendrick, Anant Kale, Youqi Gang, Pranav Seetharaman, Ivan Morera, Ehsan Khatami, Eugene Demler, Markus Greiner
Abstract: Quantum interference can deeply alter the nature of many-body phases of matter. In the paradigmatic case of the Hubbard model, Nagaoka famously proved that introducing a single itinerant charge can transform a paramagnetic insulator into a ferromagnet through path interference. However, a microscopic observation of such kinetic magnetism induced by individually imaged dopants has been so far elusive. Here we demonstrate the emergence of Nagaoka polarons in a Hubbard system realized with strongly interacting fermions in a triangular optical lattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we reveal these polarons as extended ferromagnetic bubbles around particle dopants arising from the local interplay of coherent dopant motion and spin exchange. In contrast, kinetic frustration due to the triangular geometry promotes antiferromagnetic polarons around hole dopants, as proposed by Haerter and Shastry. Our work augurs the exploration of exotic quantum phases driven by charge motion in strongly correlated systems and over sizes that are challenging for numerical simulation.

Title: Using nanokelvin quantum thermometry to detect timelike Unruh effect in a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Zehua Tian, Jiliang Jing
Abstract: It is found that the Unruh effect can not only arise out of the entanglement between two sets of modes spanning the left and right Rindler wedges, but also between modes spanning the future and past light cones. Furthermore, an inertial Unruh-DeWitt detector along a spacetime trajectory in one of these cones may exhibit the same thermal response to the vacuum as that of an accelerated detector confined in the Rindler wedge. This feature thus could be an alternative candidate to verify the ``Unruh effect", termed as the timelike Unruh effect correspondingly. In this paper we propose to detect the timelike Unruh effect by using an impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The impurity acts as the detector which interacts with the density fluctuations in the condensate, working as an effective quantum field. Following the paradigm of the emerging field of quantum thermometry, we combine quantum parameter estimation theory with the theory of open quantum systems to realize a nondemolition Unruh temperature measurement in the nanokelvin (nK) regime. Our results demonstrate that the timelike Unruh effect can be probed using a stationary two-level impurity with time-dependent energy gap immersed in a BEC within current technologies.

Title: Prospects for the determination of fundamental constants with beyond-state-of-the-art uncertainty using molecular hydrogen ion spectroscopy
Authors: Stephan Schiller, Jean-Philippe Karr
Abstract: The proton, deuteron and triton masses can be determined relative to the electron mass via rovibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen ions. This has to occur via comparison of the experimentally measured transition frequencies and the ab initio calculated frequencies, whose dependence on the mass ratios can be calculated precisely. In precision experiments to date (on HD$^+$ and H$_2^+$), the transitions have involved the ground vibrational level $v=0$ and excited vibrational levels with quantum numbers up to $v'=9$. For these transitions, the sensitivity of the ab initio frequency on the high-order-QED contributions is correlated with that on the mass ratios. This prevents an efficient simultaneous determination of these quantities from experimental data, so that the accuracy of the mass ratios is essentially limited by the theoretical uncertainty. Here we analyze how the accuracy of mass ratios may be improved by providing experimental transition frequencies between levels with larger quantum numbers, whose sensitivity on the mass ratio is positive rather than negative, or close to zero. This allows the unknown QED contributions and involved fundamental constants to be much more efficiently determined from a joint analysis of several measurements. We also consider scenarios where transitions of D$_2^+$ are included. We find these to be powerful approaches, allowing in principle to reach uncertainties for the mass ratios approximately three orders smaller than CODATA 2018. Improvements by a factor of 3.5 for the Rydberg constant, and 11 (14) for the proton (deuteron) charge radius, are also projected.

Title: Normal weak eigenstate thermalization
Authors: Patrycja Łydżba, Rafał Świętek, Marcin Mierzejewski, Marcos Rigol, Lev Vidmar
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has been numerically shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable models. For intensive sums of few-body observables, a weaker version of eigenstate thermalization known as weak eigenstate thermalization has been proved to occur in general. Here, we unveil a stricter weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models exhibiting quantum chaos in the single-particle sector (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we argue that few-body observables that have a properly defined system-size independent norm are guaranteed to exhibit at least a polynomially vanishing variance (over the entire many-body energy spectrum) of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. We prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the three-dimensional Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-1/2 XYZ and XXZ models.

Title: Ferrimagnetism of ultracold fermions in a multi-band Hubbard system
Authors: Martin Lebrat, Anant Kale, Lev Haldar Kendrick, Muqing Xu, Youqi Gang, Alexander Nikolaenko, Pietro M. Bonetti, Subir Sachdev, Markus Greiner
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials feature multiple electronic orbitals which are crucial to accurately understand their many-body properties, from cuprate materials to twisted bilayer graphene. In such multi-band models, quantum interference can lead to dispersionless bands whose large degeneracy gives rise to itinerant magnetism even with weak interactions. Here, we report on signatures of a ferrimagnetic state realized in a Lieb lattice at half-filling, characterized by antialigned magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic correlations, concomitant with a finite spin polarization. We demonstrate their robustness when increasing repulsive interactions from the non-interacting to the Heisenberg regime, and study their emergence when continuously tuning the lattice unit cell from a square to a Lieb geometry. Our work paves the way towards exploring exotic phases in related multi-orbital models such as quantum spin liquids in kagome lattices and heavy fermion behavior in Kondo models.

Title: Timescales and necessary conditions for hydrodynamization in one-dimensional Bose gases
Authors: Yicheng Zhang, Yuan Le, David S. Weiss, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of one-dimensional Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both theoretically and experimentally. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behaviors of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. We show that the hydrodynamization epoch is itself characterized by two independent timescales, an oscillation period and an observable-dependent damping time. We also show how the existence of a hydrodynamization epoch depends on the exact nature of the high-energy quench. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.

Title: Near-quantum-limited axion dark matter search with the ORGAN experiment around 26 $μ$eV
Authors: Aaron P. Quiskamp, Graeme Flower, Steven Samuels, Ben T. McAllister, Paul Altin, Eugene N. Ivanov, Maxim Goryachev, Michael E. Tobar
Abstract: The latest result from the ORGAN experiment, an axion haloscope is presented. This iteration of the experiment operated at millikelvin temperatures using a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier for reduced noise, along with various other improvements over previous iterations. Covering the $25.45 - 26.27\,\mu\text{eV}$ ($6.15-6.35$ GHz) mass (frequency) range, this near-quantum limited phase of ORGAN employs a conducting rod resonator and a 7-T solenoidal magnet to place the most sensitive exclusion limits on axion-photon coupling in the range to date, with $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}| \gtrsim 2.8\times10^{-13}$ at a 95\% confidence level.

Title: Light interactions with polar quantum systems
Authors: Piotr Gładysz, Karolina Słowik
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of polar systems coupled to classical external beams in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The permanent dipole moments (PDMs) sustained by polar systems can couple to the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a variety of processes such as difference-frequency and harmonic generation, reflected in complicated dynamics of the atomic system. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics can be described simply in a dynamic reference frame. We derive a Jaynes-Cummings-like framework with effective parameters describing frequency shift, coupling strength with the driving field, and a rescaled relaxation rate. The familiar linear scaling of the interaction strength with the field amplitude is replaced with a nonlinear dependence, suggesting potential applications for improving the coherence of quantum system ensembles with permanent dipoles.

Title: A note on the deformation of 1D ferromagnetic domain walls due to double exchange interaction with a free electron gas
Authors: K. Seremetas, X. Zotos
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the thermodynamic potential and conductance of a Bloch or Néel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron gas via a double exchange interaction. The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and Néel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.

Title: Using matrix-product states for time-series machine learning
Authors: Joshua B. Moore, Hugo P. Stackhouse, Ben D. Fulcher, Sahand Mahmoodian
Abstract: Matrix-product states (MPS) have proven to be a versatile ansatz for modeling quantum many-body physics. For many applications, and particularly in one-dimension, they capture relevant quantum correlations in many-body wavefunctions while remaining tractable to store and manipulate on a classical computer. This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to machine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets is also a key requirement. Here, we develop and apply an MPS-based algorithm, MPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying an observed time-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important time-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can efficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly from data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension $\chi_{\rm max}$, with values for our applications ranging between $\chi_{\rm max} = 20-160$, and can be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single logarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy, we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but with the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution learned from the data, which is useful for analyzing and interpreting its underlying structure. This manuscript is supplemented with the release of a publicly available code package MPSTime that implements our approach. The effectiveness of the MPS-based ansatz for capturing complex correlation structures in time-series data makes it a powerful foundation for tackling challenging time-series analysis problems across science, industry, and medicine.

Title: Josephson Field Effect Transistors with InAs on Insulator and High Permittivity Gate Dielectrics
Authors: Alessandro Paghi, Laura Borgongino, Sebastiano Battisti, Simone Tortorella, Giacomo Trupiano, Giorgio De Simoni, Elia Strambini, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has been recently demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting Josephson Junctions (JJs) and Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs). The InAsOI consists of an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic-electrically-insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer, which allows the electrical decoupling of surface-exposed adjacent devices together with a high critical current density integration. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, allowing an increased gate coupling with the transistor channel with consequent reduced gate operating voltages and leakages. As well as for Si-based FETs, integrating high-k gate insulators with JoFETs promises similar advantages in superconducting electronics. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. We found that both the ungated and gate-tunable electrical properties of the JoFETs are strongly dependent on the insulator chosen. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, from which an edge-peaked supercurrent density distribution was calculated.

Title: The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter
Authors: Romuald A. Janik
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.

Title: Tunable Topological Phases in Multilayer Graphene Coupled to a Chiral Cavity
Authors: Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Jennifer Cano, Ceren B. Dag
Abstract: Coupling photonic cavity fields to electronic degrees of freedom in 2D materials introduces an additional control knob to the toolbox of solid-state engineering. Here we demonstrate a subtle competition between cavity frequency and interlayer tunneling in graphene stacks that is responsible for topological phase transitions in light-matter Hilbert space and that cannot be captured by mean-field theory in vacuum. A systematic exploration of multilayer graphene heterostructures and stacking configurations in a chiral tHz cavity reveals that linear dispersion enhances the low-energy cavity-induced topological gap. Furthermore, in bilayer graphene, a displacement field drives the low-energy vacuum band from valley-Chern to Chern insulator, comprising a gate-tunable topological phase transition. Our findings pave the way for future control and engineering of graphene heterostructures with chiral cavity fields.

Title: Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$\textbf{$c$}$ CFT Ensemble
Authors: Ning Bao, Hao Geng, Yikun Jiang
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.

Title: A Matrix Product State Representation of Boolean Functions
Authors: Umut Eren Usturali, Claudio Chamon, Andrei E. Ruckenstein, Eduardo R. Mucciolo
Abstract: We introduce a novel normal form representation of Boolean functions in terms of products of binary matrices, hereafter referred to as the Binary Matrix Product (BMP) representation. BMPs are analogous to the Tensor-Trains (TT) and Matrix Product States (MPS) used, respectively, in applied mathematics and in quantum many-body physics to accelerate computations that are usually inaccessible by more traditional approaches. BMPs turn out to be closely related to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a powerful compressed representation of Boolean functions invented in the late 80s by Bryant that has found a broad range of applications in many areas of computer science and engineering. We present a direct and natural translation of BMPs into Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), and derive an elementary set of operations used to manipulate and combine BMPs that are analogous to those introduced by Bryant for BDDs. Both BDDs and BMPs are practical tools when the complexity of these representations, as measured by the maximum bond dimension of a BMP (or the accumulated bond dimension across the BMP matrix train) and the number of nodes of a BDD, remains polynomial in the number of bits, $n$. In both cases, controlling the complexity hinges on optimizing the order of the Boolean variables. BMPs offer the advantage that their construction and manipulation rely on simple linear algebra -- a compelling feature that can facilitate the development of open-source libraries that are both more flexible and easier to use than those currently available for BDDs. An initial implementation of a BMP library is available on GitHub, with the expectation that the close conceptual connection to TT and MPS techniques will motivate further development of BMP methods by researchers in these fields, potentially enabling novel applications to classical and quantum computing.

Title: General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions
Authors: Yu-Bo Shi, Roderich Moessner, Ricard Alert, Marin Bukov
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.
