Title: Tensor-Programmable Quantum Circuits for Solving Differential Equations
Authors: Pia Siegl, Greta Sophie Reese, Tomohiro Hashizume, Nis-Luca van Hülst, Dieter Jaksch
Abstract: We present a quantum solver for partial differential equations based on a flexible matrix product operator representation. Utilizing mid-circuit measurements and a state-dependent norm correction, this scheme overcomes the restriction of unitary operators. Hence, it allows for the direct implementation of a broad class of differential equations governing the dynamics of classical and quantum systems. The capabilities of the framework are demonstrated for an example system governed by Euler equations with absorbing boundaries.

Title: Tripartite Haar random state has no bipartite entanglement
Authors: Takato Mori, Beni Yoshida
Abstract: We show that no EPR-like bipartite entanglement can be distilled from a tripartite Haar random state $|\Psi\rangle_{ABC}$ by local unitary rotations when each subsystem has fewer than half of the total qubits. Specifically, we derive an upper bound on the probability of sampling a state with EPR-like entanglement for a given EPR fidelity tolerance, showing a doubly-exponential suppression in the number of qubits. Our proof relies on a simple volume argument supplemented by an $\epsilon$-net construction. We also discuss a physical interpretation in the AdS/CFT correspondence, indicating that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply bipartite entanglement as opposed to a previous belief.

Title: Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy
Authors: Eric D. Schultz, Keiichiro Furuya, Laimei Nie
Abstract: We investigate the relation between the Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) quantum dynamical entropy and quantum symmetries. We show that, while the cumulative AFL entropy generally saturates to the dimensional bound at late times for chaotic dynamics, this saturation value is distinctively lower when the partitions (measurements) respect the symmetries. We provide rigorous analysis to this lowered value in three cases: Abelian symmetries, anticommuting unitaries, and non-Abelian symmetries. We further support our analytical results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between the cumulative AFL entropy and symmetries, and suggest that caution is needed when interpreting it as an indicator of quantum chaos.

Title: Merging-Based Quantum Repeater
Authors: Maria Flors Mor-Ruiz, Jorge Miguel-Ramiro, Julius Wallnöfer, Tim Coopmans, Wolfgang Dür
Abstract: We introduce an alternative approach for the design of quantum repeaters based on generating entangled states of growing size. The scheme utilizes quantum merging operations, also known as fusion type-I operations, that allow the reintegration and reuse of entanglement. Unlike conventional swapping-based protocols, our method preserves entanglement after failed operations, thereby reducing waiting times, enabling higher rates, and introducing enhanced flexibility in the communication requests. Through proof-of-principle analysis, we demonstrate the advantages of this approach over standard repeater protocols, highlighting its potential for practical quantum communication scenarios.

Title: Out-of-distribution generalisation for learning quantum channels with low-energy coherent states
Authors: Jason L. Pereira, Quntao Zhuang, Leonardo Banchi
Abstract: When experimentally learning the action of a continuous variable quantum process by probing it with inputs, there will often be some restriction on the input states used. One experimentally simple way to probe the channel is using low-energy coherent states. Learning a quantum channel in this way presents difficulties, due to the fact that two channels may act similarly on low energy inputs but very differently for high energy inputs. They may also act similarly on coherent state inputs but differently on non-classical inputs. Extrapolating the behaviour of a channel for more general input states from its action on the far more limited set of low energy coherent states is a case of out-of-distribution generalisation. To be sure that such generalisation gives meaningful results, one needs to relate error bounds for the training set to bounds that are valid for all inputs. We show that for any pair of channels that act sufficiently similarly on low energy coherent state inputs, one can bound how different the input-output relations are for any (high energy or highly non-classical) input. This proves out-of-distribution generalisation is always possible for learning quantum channels using low energy coherent states.

Title: Upgrading Quantum Metrology by Combined Sensitivity Resources in Mixed Linear-Nonlinear Light-Matter Interactions with Bias Field
Authors: Zu-Jian Ying
Abstract: The major goal of quantum metrology (QM) is to exploit the quantum resources to raise the measurement precision (MP) as high as possible. When the quantum resources such as squeezing has been widely explored, light-mater interaction systems set up a highly controllable platform applicable for QM in novel pursuit of high MP. However, critical QM by the conventional linear interaction is confronted with the restriction of low-frequency-limit condition and the detrimental problem of diverging preparation time of the probe state (PTPS). This work shows that mixed interactions by linear and nonlinear light-matter couplings in the presence of bias field can provide various quantum resources, including squeezing, degeneracy lifting, displacement and quantum phase transition. These resources manifest high sensitivity for QM as demonstrated by analytically obtained critical components or exponential behavior of quantum Fisher information. We find that these sensitivity resources can be combined to upgrade the upper bound of MP by many orders over the widely-applied squeezing resource. As further advantages, such an upgraded metrology protocol not only breaks the frequency-limit restrictions but also avoids the detrimental problem of diverging PTPS which were both encountered in linear interaction. Our work paves a way to exploit and combine all the resources in momentum, position and spin spaces to maximize the MP and expand the applicable conditions simultaneously.

Title: Lattice stitching by eigenvector continuation for Holstein polaron
Authors: Elham Torabian, Roman V. Krems
Abstract: Simulations of lattice particle - phonon systems are fundamentally restricted by the exponential growth of the number of quantum states with the lattice size. Here, we demonstrate an algorithm that constructs the lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector for the Holstein model in extended lattices from eigenvalue problems for small, independent lattice segments. This leads to exponential reduction of the computational Hilbert space and allows applications of variational quantum algorithms to particle - phonon interactions in large lattices. We illustrate that the ground state of the Holstein polaron in the entire range of electron - phonon coupling, from weak to strong, and the lowest phonon frequency ($\omega/t = 0.1$) considered by numerical calculations to date can be obtained from a sequence of up to four-site problems. When combined with quantum algorithms, the present approach leads to a dramatic reduction of required quantum resources. We show that the ground state of the Holstein polaron in a lattice with 100 sites and 32 site phonons can be computed by a variational quantum eigensolver with 11 qubits.

Title: Towards Accurate Mixed Quantum Classical Simulations of Vibrational Polaritonic Chemistry
Authors: Muhammad R. Hasyim, Arkajit Mandal, David R. Reichman
Abstract: Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical kinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in recent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified reactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the collective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the phenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable alternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements even in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first introducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the limitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum treatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often employed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of vibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce different long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether the cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We address this problem proposing the $\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids hopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable and accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.

Title: Arbitrary state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators using neural networks
Authors: Nicolas Parra-A., Vladimir Vargas-Calderón, Herbert Vinck-Posada
Abstract: Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.

Title: Blinking optical tweezers for atom rearrangements
Authors: Kangjin Kim, Kangheun Kim, Jaewook Ahn
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an energy-efficient approach for holding and rearranging an N x M atom array using only N optical tweezers. This is achieved through the sequential release and recapture of M single atoms by a single optical tweezer. By employing a stroboscopic harmonic potential, the phase-space quadrature of the atom's probability distribution can be maintained under this "blinking" potential, provided the trap frequency meets the appropriate conditions. Proof-of-principle experiments confirm that a blinking tweezer can trap M atoms while requiring only 1 / M of the power per atom, and it can even facilitate rearrangement, demonstrated with arrays of up to M = 9 atoms. This method offers a scalable and reconfigurable platform for optical tweezer arrays, crucial for the preparation and manipulation of large-scale qubit systems.

Title: Robust Quantum Control for Bragg Pulse Design in Atom Interferometry
Authors: Luke S. Baker, Andre Luiz P. de Lima, Andrew Harter, Ceren Uzun, Jr-Shin Li, Anatoly Zlotnik, Michael J. Martin, Malcolm G. Boshier
Abstract: We formulate a robust optimal control algorithm to synthesize minimum energy pulses that can transfer a cold atom system into various momentum states. The algorithm uses adaptive linearization of the evolution operator and sequential quadratic programming to iterate the control towards a minimum energy signal that achieves optimal target state fidelity. Robustness to parameter variation is achieved using Legendre polynomial approximation over the domain of variation. The method is applied to optimize the Bragg beamsplitting operation in ultra-cold atom interferometry. Even in the presence of 10-40% variability in the initial momentum dispersion of the atomic cloud and the intensity of the optical pulse, the algorithm reliably converges to a control protocol that robustly achieves unprecedented momentum levels with high fidelity for a single-frequency multi-photon Bragg diffraction scheme (e.g. $|\pm 40\hbar k\rangle$). Advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparison to stochastic optimization using sampled parameter values.

Title: Fast-forwardability of Jordan-Wigner-transformed Fermion models based on Cartan decomposition
Authors: Yuichiro Hidaka, Shoichiro Tsutsui, Shota Kanasugi, Norifumi Matsumoto, Kazunori Maruyama, Hirotaka Oshima
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian algebra of Jordan-Wigner-transformed interacting fermion models and its fast-forwardability. We prove that the dimension of the Hamiltonian algebra of the fermion model with single-site Coulomb interaction is bounded from below by the exponential function of the number of sites, and the circuit depth of the Cartan-based fast-forwarding method for such model also exhibits the same scaling. We apply this proposition to the Anderson impurity model and the Hubbard model and show that the dimension of the Hamiltonian algebra of these models scales exponentially with the number of sites. These behaviors of the Hamiltonian algebras imply that the qubit models obtained by the Jordan-Wigner transformation of these fermion models cannot be efficiently simulated using the Cartan-based fast-forwarding method.

Title: Application of $\alpha$-order Information Metrics for Secure Communication in Quantum Physical Layer Design
Authors: Masahito Hayashi, Angeles Vázquez-Castro
Abstract: Quantum physical layer security protocols offer significant advantages, particularly in space communications, but their achievable secrecy rates are often limited to the asymptotic regime. Realistic communication systems, however, demand non-asymptotic solutions. Recently, the $\alpha$-order information-theoretic metrics based on Rényi entropy has been proposed. We study their practical applicability to engineering secure quantum communication systems. By deriving a composable security bound using sandwiched Rényi entropy, we apply our framework to a practical scenario involving BPSK modulation over a lossy bosonic channel, consistent with DVB-S2X standards. We highlight a critical trade-off between reliability and security, by showing that current coding rates may fall short of supporting positive secure coding rates under physical layer security considerations. This emphasizes the need for higher coding rates or additional frame lengths to balance reliability-security trade-offs effectively. Through this application, we demonstrate the utility of $\alpha$-order measures for advancing secure communication in quantum physical layer designs.

Title: Exceptional-Point-Induced Nonequilibrium Entanglement Dynamics in Bosonic Networks
Authors: Chenghe Yu, Mingsheng Tian, Ningxin Kong, Matteo Fadel, Xinyao Huang, Qiongyi He
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), arising in non-Hermitian systems, have garnered significant attention in recent years, enabling advancements in sensing, wave manipulation, and mode selectivity. However, their role in quantum systems, particularly in influencing quantum correlations, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate how EPs control multimode entanglement in bosonic chains. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework to describe the Heisenberg equations, we identify EPs of varying orders and uncover spectral transitions between purely real, purely imaginary, and mixed eigenvalue spectra. These spectral regions, divided by EPs, correspond to three distinct entanglement dynamics: oscillatory, exponential, and hybrid. Remarkably, we demonstrate that higher-order EPs, realized by non-integer-pi hopping phases or nonuniform interaction strengths, significantly enhance the degree of multimode entanglement compared to second-order EPs. Our findings provide a pathway to leveraging EPs for entanglement control and exhibit the potential of non-Hermitian physics in advancing quantum technologies.

Title: Geometric origin of self-intersection points in non-Hermitian energy spectra
Authors: Jinghui Pi, Chenyang Wang, Yong-Chun Liu, Yangqian Yan
Abstract: Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian energy spectra under periodic boundary conditions can form closed loops in the complex energy plane, a phenomenon known as point gap topology. In this paper, we investigate the self-intersection points of such non-Hermitian energy spectra and reveal their geometric origins. We rigorously demonstrate that these self-intersection points result from the intersection of the auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone and the Brillouin zone in one-band systems, as confirmed by an extended Hatano-Nelson model. This finding is further generalized to multi-band systems, illustrated through a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Moreover, we address multiple self-intersection points and derive the geometric conditions for general n-fold self-intersection points. Our results enhance the fundamental understanding of generic non-Hermitian quantum systems and provide theoretical support for further experimental investigations of energy self-intersection points.

Title: Differential Privacy of Quantum and Quantum-Inspired-Classical Recommendation Algorithms
Authors: Chenjian Li, Mingsheng Ying
Abstract: We analyze the DP (differential privacy) properties of the quantum recommendation algorithm and the quantum-inspired-classical recommendation algorithm. We discover that the quantum recommendation algorithm is a privacy curating mechanism on its own, requiring no external noise, which is different from traditional differential privacy mechanisms. In our analysis, a novel perturbation method tailored for SVD (singular value decomposition) and low-rank matrix approximation problems is introduced. Using the perturbation method and random matrix theory, we are able to derive that both the quantum and quantum-inspired-classical algorithms are $\big(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\frac 1n\big),\,\, \tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\frac{1}{\min\{m,n\}}\big)\big)$-DP under some reasonable restrictions, where $m$ and $n$ are numbers of users and products in the input preference database respectively. Nevertheless, a comparison shows that the quantum algorithm has better privacy preserving potential than the classical one.

Title: Real-Field Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference of Indistinguishable Coherent Photons via Long Optical Injection-Locking over 50 km Fiber
Authors: Seoyeon Yang, Danbi Kim, Hansol Jeong, Han Seb Moon
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has garnered significant attention for its potential to enable security-loophole-free quantum communication. Successful MDI-QKD protocols rely on performing a two-photon Bell-state measurement at an intermediate node, with a high-visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference pattern between two independent coherent photons being crucial. In this study, we present a novel approach for developing indistinguishable coherent photon sources over 50 km of optical fiber in a real-world setting. We introduce the long optical injection-locking (long-OIL) technique, which enables frequency locking between two long-distance coherent photons beyond the coherence length of the master laser. Using the long-OIL technique, we achieved time-resolved HOM interference with a visibility of 48(2)%, approaching the theoretical 50% limit for two independent continuous-wave coherent photons. Our results demonstrate that the long-OIL platform is a promising solution for MDI-QKD with repeaterless secret key capacity.

Title: Why ETH? On thermalization and locality
Authors: Stefan Eccles
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is foundational to modern discussions of thermalization in closed quantum systems. In this work, we expand on traditional explanations for the prevalence of ETH by emphasizing the role of operator locality. We introduce an operator-specific perturbation problem that can be thought of as a means of understanding the onset or breakdown of ETH for specific classes of operators in a given system. We derive explicit functional forms for the off-diagonal variances of operator matrix elements for typical local operators under various `scrambling ansatzes', expressed in terms of system parameters and parameters of the corresponding perturbation problem. We provide simple tests and illustrations of these ideas in chaotic spin chain systems.

Title: Semi-classical modelling of second-order spontaneous down-conversion measured over 10 decades of pump intensity in a type II phase-matched KTP crystal
Authors: Julien Bertrand, Véronique Boutou, Benoît Boulanger
Abstract: We performed a second-order spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) experiment in a Type II phase-matched KTiOPO4 crystal pumped at 532 nm giving birth to a signal beam at 1037 nm and an idler one at 1092 nm along the x-axis of the crystal. Three pump sources have been used: in the continuous-wave, nanosecond (200 ns, 1 kHz) and picosecond (15 ps, 10 Hz) regimes. That allowed us to cover a pump intensity range from 2.4 this http URL-2 to 3.7 this http URL-2 which led to the generation of twin photons with a flux from 1.1x104 Hz to 1.2x1021 Hz, respectively, the corresponding quantum efficiencies being of 1.8x10-11 and 9.2x10-4. We identified two SPDC regimes regarding the pump intensity: one below 30 this http URL-2 for which the flux increases linearly, and the other one above 30 this http URL-2 for which the flux behaves exponentially. We proposed a semi-classical model under the undepleted pump approximation based on both the quantum fluctuations of vacuum for the seeding of the process and a propagation step ensured by classical fields, which allowed a satisfying description of these two regimes, with a much better agreement at high intensity than the quantum models based on the nonlinear momentum or the nonlinear Hamiltonian operators.

Title: Quantum Supremacy in Tomographic Imaging: Advances in Quantum Tomography Algorithms
Authors: Hyunju Lee, Kyungtaek Jun
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a transformative paradigm, capable of tackling complex computational problems that are infeasible for classical methods within a practical timeframe. At the core of this advancement lies the concept of quantum supremacy, which signifies the ability of quantum processors to surpass classical systems in specific tasks. In the context of tomographic image reconstruction, quantum optimization algorithms enable faster processing and clearer imaging than conventional methods. This study further substantiates quantum supremacy by reducing the required projection angles for tomographic reconstruction while enhancing robustness against image artifacts. Notably, our experiments demonstrated that the proposed algorithm accurately reconstructed tomographic images without artifacts, even when up to 50% error was introduced into the sinogram to induce ring artifacts. Furthermore, it achieved precise reconstructions using only 50% of the projection angles from the original sinogram spanning 0° to 180°. These findings highlight the potential of quantum algorithms to revolutionize tomographic imaging by enabling efficient and accurate reconstructions under challenging conditions, paving the way for broader applications in medical imaging, material science, and advanced tomography systems as quantum computing technologies continue to advance.

Abstract: The quantum nonlinear Maxwell-Bloch equations for the two-level active medium single-mode laser are solved without adiabatic elimination of the medium polarization in the LED regime, when the population fluctuation spectrum is much narrower than the radiation field and polarization spectra. It is shown that population fluctuations can significantly increase the output power and the collective Rabi splitting of a superradiant LED.

Title: Probabilistic pulse-position modulation for classical communication on quantum channels
Authors: Farzad Kianvash, Matteo Rosati
Abstract: Classical communication over lossy quantum channels is an essential topic in quantum information theory, with practical implications for optical-fiber and free-space communications. Multi-phase Hadamard codes, based on coherent-state Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation and decoded using vacuum-or-pulse (VP) detectors, offer a promising approach for achieving high communication rates while relying only on linear optics and single-photon detectors (SPDs). However, their performance does not reach the ultimate Holevo limit. In this work, we propose a generalization of Hadamard codes that distributes the signal across multiple modes with optimized probabilities, rather than concentrating it in a single mode, dubbed probabilistic pulse-position modulation (PPPM). We derive an achievable communication rate, demonstrating that our PPPM can outperform traditional Hadamard codes in certain intermediate energy regimes.

Title: Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases
Authors: M. A. Rajabpour, M. A. Seifi Mirjafarlou
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In particular, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a Pfaffian of a matrix based on qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that links the amplitudes of systems with different qubit counts, enabling scalable calculations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for applications in global entanglement, Shannon-Rényi entropy, formation probabilities, and quantum tomography, significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems.

Title: Quantum stochastic communication via high-dimensional entanglement
Authors: Chao Zhang, Jia-Le Miao, Xiao-Min Hu, Jef Pauwels, Yu Guo, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo, Armin Tavakoli, Bi-Heng Liu
Abstract: Entanglement has the ability to enhance the transmission of classical information over a quantum channel. However, fully harvesting this advantage typically requires complex entangling measurements, which are challenging to implement and scale with the system's size. In this work, we consider a natural quantum information primitive in which the message to be communicated is selected stochastically. We introduce a protocol that leverages high-dimensional entanglement to perform this task perfectly, without requiring quantum interference between particles at the measurement station. We experimentally demonstrate the protocol's scalability in an optical setup using 8-dimensional entanglement and multi-outcome detection, providing a practical solution for stochastic communication and a robust method for certifying the dimensionality of entanglement in communication experiments.

Title: Benchmarking Quantum Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Georg Kruse, Rodrigo Coelho, Andreas Rosskopf, Robert Wille, Jeanette-Miriam Lorenz
Abstract: Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising research field, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, despite its growing interest, QRL still faces significant challenges. It is still uncertain if QRL can show any advantage over classical RL beyond artificial problem formulations. Additionally, it is not yet clear which streams of QRL research show the greatest potential. The lack of a unified benchmark and the need to evaluate the reliance on quantum principles of QRL approaches are pressing questions. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive comparison of three major QRL classes: Parameterized Quantum Circuit based QRL (PQC-QRL) (with one policy gradient (QPG) and one Q-Learning (QDQN) algorithm), Free Energy based QRL (FE-QRL), and Amplitude Amplification based QRL (AA-QRL). We introduce a set of metrics to evaluate the QRL algorithms on the widely applicable benchmark of gridworld games. Our results provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the QRL classes, shedding light on the role of quantum principles in QRL and paving the way for future research in this field.

Title: Proposal to measure the Casimir Effect Across the Superconducting Transition
Authors: Giuseppe Bimonte
Abstract: The influence of the superconducting transition on the Casimir effect remains experimentally elusive. We propose a novel approach to address this challenge, exploiting the first-order superconducting transition induced in a thick film by a parallel magnetic field. Our calculations for a Au sphere opposite a Pb film, based on the Mattis-Bardeen theory, predict a jump in the Casimir force across the transition. By periodically modulating the magnetic field, we induce a corresponding modulation of the Casimir force that should be readily detectable with existing micro-torsional oscillator technology, opening a promising pathway to finally observe the long-sought Casimir-superconductivity coupling. A successful measurement of this effect would provide crucial insights into the fundamental nature of the Casimir force and its interaction with macroscopic quantum phenomena.

Title: Unlocking thermodynamic multitasking: Exploring the functioning of two-qubit engines through coherence and entanglement
Authors: Hachem Tarif, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara
Abstract: Recent studies have investigated the role of entanglement in the operation of a two-qubit system as a heat engine, showing that work can be extracted from a single heat bath without direct heat dissipation between the two-qubit system and the cold bath (2021 Phys. Rev. Lett, 126, 120605). In this work, we explore the impact of operating the same two-qubit system model with two heat baths and direct dissipation to the environment by applying both a local and a global Markovian master equation. The addition of a second heat bath enables the system to operate in different modes depending on the initial quantum state. We examine the temporal behavior of concurrence entanglement and quantum coherence, analyzing their observable roles in transitions between various operational regimes. Additionally, we investigate the evolution of information flow throughout the working cycle of the two-qubit system, focusing on the influence of individual and collective decoherence on the system's efficiency and operational modes. We identify the optimal parameter regions for the engine and refrigerator modes to achieve maximum performance. Finally, we investigate the effect of coherence outside the system on its thermodynamic quantities.

Title: A Variant of the Bravyi-Terhal Bound for Arbitrary Boundary Conditions
Authors: François Arnault, Philippe Gaborit, Wouter Rozendaal, Nicolas Saussay, Gilles Zémor
Abstract: We present a modified version of the Bravyi-Terhal bound that applies to quantum codes defined by local parity-check constraints on a $D$-dimensional lattice quotient. Specifically, we consider a quotient $\mathbb{Z}^D/\Lambda$ of $\mathbb{Z}^D$ of cardinality $n$, where $\Lambda$ is some $D$-dimensional sublattice of $\mathbb{Z}^D$: we suppose that every vertex of this quotient indexes $m$ qubits of a stabilizer code $C$, which therefore has length $nm$. We prove that if all stabilizer generators act on qubits whose indices lie within a ball of radius $\rho$, then the minimum distance $d$ of the code satisfies $d \leq m\sqrt{\gamma_D}(\sqrt{D} + 4\rho)n^\frac{D-1}{D}$ whenever $n^{1/D} \geq 8\rho\sqrt{\gamma_D}$, where $\gamma_D$ is the $D$-dimensional Hermite constant. We apply this bound to derive an upper bound on the minimum distance of Abelian Two-Block Group Algebra (2BGA) codes whose parity-check matrices have the form $[\mathbf{A} \, \vert \, \mathbf{B}]$ with each submatrix representing an element of a group algebra over a finite abelian group.

Title: Newtonian Gravity from a Poissonian Spontaneous Collapse Model
Authors: Nicolò Piccione, Angelo Bassi
Abstract: The Tilloy-Diósi (TD) prescription allows to turn any Markovian spontaneous collapse model that can be formally regarded as a continuous measurement process of the mass density into a hybrid classical-quantum theory in which the gravitational Newtonian field enters as a classical field. We study the application of a similar idea to the Poissonian Spontaneous Localization (PSL) model. As in the TD case, the Newtonian classical field is again recovered upon averaging, and additional decoherence appears due to the gravitational back-reaction. We study general features of this model and investigate the dynamics of a single particle and a rigid spherical body. With respect to the TD models, the PSL model presents some notable differences such as the absence of long-range decoherence due to the gravitational back-reaction noise and the absence of negative mass measurements.

Title: Non-Markovianity vs athermality: perturbation-enhanced information backflow
Authors: Anindita Sarkar, Debarupa Saha, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: Non-Markovianity and athermality are useful resources in quantum technologies, and it is therefore important to understand the relations between the two, for general quantum dynamics. We propose three measures of non-Markovianity, first within the ambit of thermal operations, and then beyond it, that result from unavoidable perturbations in system's Hamiltonian and that leads to violations of conservation of total energy characterizing any thermal operation. The proposed measures are based respectively on system-environment entanglement, total correlation in the system-environment partition, and on a concept of distance defined on the sets of usual and approximate thermal operations. We investigate the response of non-Markovianity to the athermality-inducing perturbations, using all the three measures. For the entanglement and distance-based measures, we derive upper bounds on the response by a quantity that depends on the perturbative Hamiltonian. For the total correlation-based measure, we are able to compute the exact response. We present examples of qubit-qubit and qubit-qutrit systems for which perturbation leads to enhancement of non-Markovianity, as quantified by the entanglement and total correlation-based measures.

Title: Incoherent behavior of partially distinguishable photons
Authors: Emilio Annoni, Stephen C. Wein
Abstract: Photon distinguishability serves as a fundamental metric for assessing the quality of quantum interference in photocounting experiments. In the context of Boson Sampling, it plays a crucial role in determining classical simulability and the potential for quantum advantage. We develop a basis-independent framework for multi-photon interference, deriving a necessary and sufficient condition under which distinguishability manifests as stochastic errors. Additionally, we introduce an experimentally relevant operation, analogous to Pauli twirling, that enforces this condition. When satisfied, the condition allows any multi-photon state to be uniquely decomposed into a classical mixture of partition states -- discrete configurations representing different patterns of photon distinguishability. The resulting probability distribution over partition states defines the system's incoherent distinguishability spectrum, directly linking it to the complexity of classical simulation. This framework clarifies key challenges in defining genuine multi-photon indistinguishability, links previous perspectives on partial distinguishability, and provides a rigorous foundation for error mitigation and robust photonic operations.

Title: Programming optical-lattice Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators
Authors: Cristian Tabares, Christian Kokail, Peter Zoller, Daniel González-Cuadra, Alejandro González-Tudela
Abstract: Fermionic atoms in optical lattices provide a native implementation of Fermi-Hubbard (FH) models that can be used as analog quantum simulators of many-body fermionic systems. Recent experimental advances include the time-dependent local control of chemical potentials and tunnelings, and thus enable to operate this platform digitally as a programmable quantum simulator. Here, we explore these opportunities and develop ground-state preparation algorithms for different fermionic models, based on the ability to implement both single-particle and many-body, high-fidelity fermionic gates, as provided by the native FH Hamiltonian. In particular, we first design variational, pre-compiled quantum circuits to prepare the ground state of the natively implemented FH model, with significant speedups relative to competing adiabatic protocols. Besides, the versatility of this variational approach enables to target extended FH models, i.e., including terms that are not natively realized on the platform. As an illustration, we include next-nearest-neighbor tunnelings at finite dopings, relevant in the context of $d$-wave superconductivity. Furthermore, we discuss how to approximate the imaginary-time evolution using variational fermionic circuits, both as an alternative state-preparation strategy, and as a subroutine for the Quantum Lanczos algorithm to further improve the energy estimation. We benchmark our protocols for ladder geometries, though they can be readily applied to 2D experimental setups to address regimes beyond the capabilities of current classical methods. These results pave the way for more efficient and comprehensive explorations of relevant many-body phases with existing programmable fermionic quantum simulators.

Title: Deterministic quantum teleportation of a path-encoded state using entangled photons
Authors: Akshai T. Krishnan, Kanad Sengupta, S. P. Dinesh, C. M. Chandrashekar
Abstract: Quantum teleportation enables a way to transmit an arbitrary qubit state from one place to an other. A standard scheme for teleportation in optical setup involve three photons, an entangled photon pair and a photon carrying quantum state to be teleported. The interaction between the photons in the scheme makes quantum teleportation probabilistic. Here we demonstrate a deterministic teleportation of an arbitrary qubit state using only a polarization entangled photon pair in a linear optical setup. By introducing the path degree of freedom to one of the entangled photon and encoding the arbitrary qubit state into it, we demonstrate 100\% Bell State Measurement (BSM) outcome. This enables a deterministic teleportation of a qubit state in an optical scheme with high fidelity. We report an average teleportation fidelity of 88.00%. The dependency of fidelity on the visibility of single-photon interferometer used for path qubit state shows the possibility of further improving the fidelity of quantum teleportation.

Authors: Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: Kramers escape from a metastable state in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations under strong damping is treated as a thermally activated process in a quantum modified semiclassical potential. Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassical potential.

Title: Experimental validation of boson sampling using detector binning
Authors: Malaquias Correa Anguita, Anita Camillini, Sara Marzban, Marco Robbio, Benoit Seron, Leonardo Novo, Jelmer J. Renema
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a testing strategy for boson samplers that is based on efficiently computable expressions for the output photon counting distributions binned over multiple optical modes. We apply this method to validate boson sampling experiments with three photons on a reconfigurable photonic chip, which implements a four-mode interferometer, analyzing 50 Haar-random unitary transformations while tuning photon distinguishability via controlled delays. We show that for high values of indistinguishability, the experiment accurately reproduces the ideal boson sampling binned-mode distributions, which exhibit variations that depend both on the specific interferometer implemented as well as the choice of bin, confirming the usefulness of the method to diagnose imperfections such as partial distinguishability or imperfect chip control. Finally, we analyze the behavior of Haar-averaged binned-mode distributions with partial distinguishability and demonstrate analytically that its variance is proportional to the average of the square of the photons' indistinguishability parameter. These findings highlight the central role of binning in boson sampling validation, offering a scalable and efficient framework for assessing multiphoton interference and experimental performance.

Title: Non-linear Quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Jose Blanchet, Yassine Hamoudi, Mario Szegedy, Guanyang Wang
Abstract: The mean of a random variable can be understood as a $\textit{linear}$ functional on the space of probability distributions. Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating $\textit{non-linear}$ functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al.. The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors. A key innovation of our approach is a new sequence of multilevel Monte Carlo approximations specifically designed for quantum computing, which is central to the algorithm's improved performance.

Title: Multiphoton, multimode state classification for nonlinear optical circuits
Authors: Denis A. Kopylov, Christian Offen, Laura Ares, Boris Wembe Moafo, Sina Ober-Blöbaum, Torsten Meier, Polina R. Sharapova, Jan Sperling
Abstract: We introduce a new classification of multimode states with a fixed number of photons. This classification is based on the factorizability of homogeneous multivariate polynomials and is invariant under unitary transformations. The classes physically correspond to field excitations in terms of single and multiple photons, each of which being in an arbitrary irreducible superposition of quantized modes. We further show how the transitions between classes are rendered possible by photon addition, photon subtraction, and photon-projection nonlinearities. We explicitly put forward a design for a multilayer interferometer in which the states for different classes can be generated with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Limitations of the proposed designs are analyzed using the introduced classification, providing a benchmark for the robustness of certain states and classes.

Title: Quantum Perfect Matchings
Authors: David Cui, Laura Mančinska, Seyed Sajjad Nezhadi, David E. Roberson
Abstract: We investigate quantum and nonsignaling generalizations of perfect matchings in graphs using nonlocal games. Specifically, we introduce nonlocal games that test for $L$-perfect matchings in bipartite graphs, perfect matchings in general graphs and hypergraphs, and fractional perfect matchings. Our definitions come from the fact that these games are classical property tests for the corresponding matching conditions. We use the existence of perfect quantum and nonsignaling strategies for these games to define quantum and nonsignaling versions of perfect matchings. Finally, we provide characterizations of when graphs exhibit these extended properties: - For nonsignaling matchings, we give a complete combinatorial characterizations. In particular, a graph has a nonsignaling perfect matching if and only if it admits a fractional perfect matching that has bounded value on triangles. \item In bipartite graphs, the nonsignaling $L$-perfect matching property is achieved exactly when the left component of the graph can be split into two disjoint subgraphs: one with a classical $L$-perfect matching and another with left-degree 2. - In the quantum setting, we show that complete graphs $K_n$ with odd $n \geq 7$ have quantum perfect matchings. We prove that a graph has a quantum perfect matching if and only if the quantum independence number of its line graph is maximal, extending a classical relationship between perfect matchings and line graph independence numbers. - For bipartite graphs, we establish that the $L$-perfect matching game does not exhibit quantum pseudotelepathy, but we characterize the quantum advantage for complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,2}$. - Additionally, we prove that deciding quantum perfect matchings in hypergraphs is undecidable and leave open the question of its complexity in graphs.

Title: Impulse measurements enhanced with squeezed readout light
Authors: Tsai-Chen Lee, Jacob L. Beckey, Giacomo Marocco, Daniel Carney
Abstract: We quantify how squeezed light can reduce quantum measurement noise to levels below the standard quantum limit in impulse measurements with mechanical detectors. The broadband nature of the signal implies that frequency-dependent squeezing performs better than frequency-independent squeezing. We calculate the optimal scaling of the impulse sensitivity with the squeezing strength, and quantify degradations due to photodetection losses. Even for lossless measurement, we find there exists a fundamental limit to the benefit of squeezing that depends only on the system's mechanical properties.

Title: Vibrationally Assisted Exciton Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Diego Fallas Padilla, Visal So, Abhishek Menon, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Guido Pagano
Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.

Title: Stability of dipolar bosons in a quasiperiodic potential
Authors: Paolo Molignini, Barnali Chakrabarti
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials and dipolar interactions each impose long-range order in quantum systems, but their interplay unlocks a rich landscape of unexplored quantum phases. In this work, we investigate how dipolar bosonic crystals respond to correlated disorder in the form of quasiperiodic potentials. Using exact numerical simulations and a suite of observables - including order parameters, energy, density distributions, and two-body coherence measures - we explore one-dimensional dipolar bosons in quasiperiodic lattices at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings. Our results reveal a complex competition between superfluid, Mott insulator, density-wave, and crystalline phases, governed by the intricate balance of dipolar interactions, kinetic energy, and disorder strength. Crucially, we identify mechanisms that influence dipolar crystals, showing their surprising robustness even in the presence of strong quasiperiodic disorder. Strikingly, we challenge previous claims by demonstrating that a kinetic crystal phase - expected to precede full crystallization - does not emerge in the ground state. Instead, its traits appear only under moderate disorder, but never fully develop, giving way to a direct transition from a charge density wave to a crystal state. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of many-body quantum phases in complex environments and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum states in ultracold atomic systems.

Title: Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting critical dynamics and vortex fluctuations in a high-temperature cuprate

Abstract: Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.

Title: Observations of Holographic Quantum-Foam Blurring
Authors: Eric Steinbring
Abstract: The "foamy" nature of spacetime at the Planck scale was an idea first introduced by John Wheeler in the 1950s. And for the last twenty years or so it has been debated whether those inherent uncertainties in time and path-length might also accumulate in transiting electromagnetic wavefronts, resulting in measurable blurring for images of distant galaxies and quasars. A confusing aspect is that "pointlike" objects will always be blurred out somewhat by the optics of a telescope, especially in the optical. But it turns out that Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are more useful to test this, and have been observed by a host of ground-based and space-based telescopes, including by the Fermi observatory for well over a decade. And a recent one was unprecedented: GRB221009A was extremely bright, allowing follow-up from the infrared through the ultraviolet to X-rays and gamma-rays, including a first association with photons at high TeV energies. I will discuss how that observation is in direct tension with the calculus of how spacetime "foaminess" can add up in an image of a pointsource at cosmological distances, which at high-enough energy could spread these out over the whole sky without resulting in photon loss. A simple multiwavelength average of foam-induced blurring consistent with holographic quantum gravity is described, analogous to atmospheric seeing from the ground. This fits with measured instrumental point-spread functions and with the highest-energy localization of GRB221009A, resolving the observational issues and pointing to a key physical implication: spacetime does not look smooth.

Title: Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Kai Lieta
Abstract: By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be respected even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators and the anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. We then generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstate can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Thus, eta-pairing may represent a new mechanism for skin effects in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in higher dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry. To realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena, we construct a general two-sublattice model defined on an arbitrary lattice, which can exhibit anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates; besides, this model can reveal the eta-pairing structure [e.g., the $SO(4)$ symmetry] in systems with Hermitian hoppings.

Title: Open system dynamics in linear-time beyond the wide-band limit
Authors: Yaroslav Pavlyukh, Riku Tuovinen
Abstract: Nonequilibrium heat transport in quantum systems coupled to wide-band embeddings provides a striking example of the limitations of the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA), while solving the full two-time Kadanoff-Baym equations remains computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, we propose an iterated solution to the reconstruction problem, resulting in a time-linear evolution scheme involving 14 correlators for systems with narrow-band embeddings. This approach eliminates GKBA-related artifacts and resolves convergence issues associated with the wide-band limit. Furthermore, it enables the calculation of energy- and time-resolved currents, facilitating the modeling of heat flows in quantum systems and energy- and time-resolved photoemission experiments, all at significantly reduced computational cost.

Title: The non-Abelian geometry, topology, and dynamics of a nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ladder
Authors: Ziyu Zhou, Zhi-Cong Xu, Li-Jun Lang
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity breaks down the adiabaticity and naturally leads to the non-Abelian behaviors in multi-band systems. Here we consider a multi-band, non-Hermitian ladder model with the two legs being the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. We thoroughly study how the non-Abelian geometry, topology, and dynamics emerge in this model at the onset of inter-leg coupling. Under periodic boundary conditions, by defining a gauge-invariant winding number for chiral symmetric systems, we analytically give the exact topological phase diagram. With the aid of underlying symmetries generalized for non-Hermitian systems, we further refine the phase diagram by the geometry of band structure. In the pseudo-Hermitian symmetric regime, we find that the stable non-Abelian dynamics of a Bloch state under an external constant force can be well described in some conditions of the force by the Wilson line constructed for non-Hermitian systems. Under open boundary conditions, we also find that the bulk-boundary correspondence survives in the thermodynamic limit but breaks down for finite-size systems with the leg-dependent non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), demonstrating the so-called critical NHSE, of which the decaying length of the bulk skin modes $\xi$ varies with the system size $L$ and is numerically verified to satisfy the scale-free power law $\xi\propto L$. Our work may stimulate more focuses on the non-Abelian properties of the non-Hermitian/open quantum systems.

Title: Generative-enhanced optimization for knapsack problems: an industry-relevant study
Authors: Yelyzaveta Vodovozova, Abhishek Awasthi, Caitlin Jones, Joseph Doetsch, Karen Wintersperger, Florian Krellner, Carlos A. Riofrío
Abstract: Optimization is a crucial task in various industries such as logistics, aviation, manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and insurance, where finding the best solution to a problem can result in significant cost savings and increased efficiency. Tensor networks (TNs) have gained prominence in recent years in modeling classical systems with quantum-inspired approaches. More recently, TN generative-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) has been proposed as a strategy which uses generative modeling to efficiently sample valid solutions with respect to certain constraints of optimization problems. Moreover, it has been shown that symmetric TNs (STNs) can encode certain constraints of optimization problems, thus aiding in their solution process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of TN- and STN-GEO to an industry relevant problem class, a multi-knapsack problem, in which each object must be assigned to an available knapsack. We detail a prescription for practitioners to use the TN-and STN-GEO methodology and study its scaling behavior and dependence on its hyper-parameters. We benchmark 60 different problem instances and find that TN-GEO and STN-GEO produce results of similar quality to simulated annealing.

Title: Quantum anomalous Hall domains in a Quenched Topological Mott Insulator
Authors: Lara Ulčakar, Gal Lemut, Tomaž Rejec, Jernej Mravlje
Abstract: We study an interacting spinless quadratic band touching model that realizes a topological Mott insulating state. We quench the interaction from a value corresponding to the nematic insulator to that of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) ordered phase. We perform time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulations and show that after the quench the system realizes an excited Dirac semimetal state, which is however unstable and spontaneously evolves to a state with inhomogeneous nematic and QAH order parameters. The modulations form a stripe pattern that grows exponentially with time until the local Chern marker reaches unity. The alternating QAH order defines a domain structure with boundaries that host chiral sublattice currents.

Title: Energy dynamics in a class of local random matrix Hamiltonians
Authors: Klée Pollock, Jonathan D. Kroth, Nathan Pagliaroli, Thomas Iadecola, Jonathan Riddell
Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.

Title: Metaplectic operators with quasi-diagonal kernels
Authors: Gianluca Giacchi, Luigi Rodino
Abstract: Metaplectic operators form a relevant class of operators appearing in different applications, in the present work we study their Schwartz kernels. Namely, diagonality of a kernel is defined by imposing rapid off-diagonal decay conditions, and quasi-diagonality by imposing the same conditions on the smoothing of the kernel through convolution with the Gaussian. Kernels of metaplectic operators are not diagonal. Nevertheless, as we shall prove, they are quasi-diagonal under suitable conditions. Motivation for our study comes from problems in time-frequency analysis, that we discuss in the last section.

Title: Fluctuation thermometry of an atom-resolved quantum gas: Beyond the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
Authors: Maxime Dixmerias, Joris Verstraten, Cyprien Daix, Bruno Peaudecerf, Tim de Jongh, Tarik Yefsah
Abstract: Thermometry is essential for studying many-body physics with ultracold atoms. Accurately measuring low temperatures in these systems, however, remains a significant challenge due to the absence of a universal thermometer. Most widely applicable methods, such as fitting of in-situ density profiles or standard fluctuation thermometry, are limited by the requirement of global thermal equilibrium and inapplicability to homogeneous systems. In this work, we introduce a novel in-situ thermometry for quantum gases, leveraging single-atom resolved measurements via quantum gas microscopy, and demonstrate it on an ideal Fermi gas. By analyzing number fluctuations in probe volumes with approximately one atom on average, we extract both global and local temperatures over a broad dynamic range. Unlike traditional fluctuation thermometry, our method does not rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and is based instead on the exact relationship between number fluctuations and density-density correlations. In the low-temperature regime, it allows us to observe significant deviations from fluctuation-dissipation predictions, uncovering sub-extensive fluctuations. Our method is applicable to systems with arbitrary trapping potentials, requiring neither precise trap calibration nor global thermal equilibrium. This nearly universal thermometer for quantum gases overcomes key limitations of existing techniques, paving the way for more accurate and versatile temperature measurements in ultracold quantum systems.

Title: Tight Bounds on the Spooky Pebble Game: Recycling Qubits with Measurements
Authors: Niels Kornerup, Jonathan Sadun, David Soloveichik
Abstract: Pebble games are popular models for analyzing time-space trade-offs. In particular, the reversible pebble game is often applied in quantum algorithms like Grover's search to efficiently simulate classical computation on inputs in superposition. However, the reversible pebble game cannot harness the additional computational power granted by irreversible intermediate measurements. The spooky pebble game, which models interleaved measurements and adaptive phase corrections, reduces the number of qubits beyond what reversible approaches can achieve. While the spooky pebble game does not reduce the total space (bits plus qubits) complexity of the simulation, it reduces the amount of space that must be stored in qubits. We prove asymptotically tight trade-offs for the spooky pebble game on a line with any pebble bound, giving a tight time-qubit tradeoff for simulating arbitrary classical sequential computation with the spooky pebble game. For example, for all $\epsilon \in (0,1]$, any classical computation requiring time $T$ and space $S$ can be implemented on a quantum computer using only $O(T/ \epsilon)$ gates and $O(T^{\epsilon}S^{1-\epsilon})$ qubits. This improves on the best known bound for the reversible pebble game with that number of qubits, which uses $O(2^{1/\epsilon} T)$ gates. We also consider the spooky pebble game on more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), capturing fine-grained data dependency in computation. We show that for an arbitrary DAG even approximating the number of required pebbles in the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-hard. Despite this, we are able to construct a time-efficient strategy for pebbling binary trees that uses the minimum number of pebbles.

Title: Implementing Clifford Gates on Stabilizer Codes via Measurement
Authors: Darren Banfield, Heather Leitch, Alastair Kay
Abstract: We describe a method to use measurements and correction operations in order to implement the Clifford group in a stabilizer code, generalising a result from [Bombin,2011] for topological subsystem colour codes. In subsystem stabilizer codes of distance at least $3$ the process can be implemented fault-tolerantly. In particular this provides a method to implement a logical Hadamard-type gate within the 15-qubit Reed-Muller quantum code by measuring and correcting only three observables. This is an alternative to the method proposed by [Paetznick and Reichardt, 2013] to generate a set of gates which is universal for quantum computing for this code. The construction is inspired by the description of code rewiring from [Colladay and Mueller, 2018]. Inspired by the code rewiring strategy of [Colladay and Mueller, 2018], we describe a method to use measurements and correction operations in order to implement the Clifford group in the code space of any stabilizer code, and we specify a sufficient set of conditions under which the distance of the code is preserved throughout. In particular this provides a method to implement a logical Hadamard-type gate within the 15-qubit Reed-Muller quantum code by measuring and correcting only two observables, providing the only non-transversal gate required for universality. Furthermore this approach is applicable to the toric code and quantum LDPC code

Title: Average Mixing in Quantum Walks of Reversible Markov Chains
Authors: Julien Sorci
Abstract: The Szegedy quantum walk is a discrete time quantum walk model which defines a quantum analogue of any Markov chain. The long-term behavior of the quantum walk can be encoded in a matrix called the average mixing matrix, whose columns give the limiting probability distribution of the walk given an initial state. We define a version of the average mixing matrix of the Szegedy quantum walk which allows us to more readily compare the limiting behavior to that of the chain it quantizes. We prove a formula for our mixing matrix in terms of the spectral decomposition of the Markov chain and show a relationship with the mixing matrix of a continuous quantum walk on the chain. In particular, we prove that average uniform mixing in the continuous walk implies average uniform mixing in the Szegedy walk. We conclude by giving examples of Markov chains of arbitrarily large size which admit average uniform mixing in both the continuous and Szegedy quantum walk.

Title: Quantum error-correcting codes with a covariant encoding
Authors: Aurélie Denys, Anthony Leverrier
Abstract: Given some group $G$ of logical gates, for instance the Clifford group, what are the quantum encodings for which these logical gates can be implemented by simple physical operations, described by some physical representation of $G$? We study this question by constructing a general form of such encoding maps. For instance, we recover that the $[[5,1,3]]$ and Steane codes admit transversal implementations of the binary tetrahedral and binary octahedral groups, respectively. For bosonic encodings, we show how to obtain the GKP and cat qudit encodings by considering the appropriate groups, and essentially the simplest physical implementations. We further illustrate this approach by introducing a 2-mode bosonic code defined from a constellation of 48 coherent states, for which all single-qubit Clifford gates correspond to passive Gaussian unitaries.

Title: Bures geodesics and quantum metrology
Authors: Dominique Spehner
Abstract: We study the geodesics on the manifold of mixed quantum states for the Bures metric. It is shown that these geodesics correspond to physical non-Markovian evolutions of the system coupled to an ancilla. Furthermore, we argue that geodesics lead to optimal precision in single-parameter estimation in quantum metrology. More precisely, if the unknown parameter $x$ is a phase shift proportional to the time parametrizing the geodesic, the estimation error obtained by processing the data of measurements on the system is equal to the smallest error that can be achieved from joint detections on the system and ancilla, meaning that the ancilla does not carry any information on this parameter. This error can saturate the Heisenberg bound. Reciprocally, assuming that the system-ancilla output and input states are related by a unitary $e^{-i x H}$ with $H$ a $x$-independent Hamiltonian, we show that if the error obtained from measurements on the system is equal to the minimal error obtained from joint measurements on the system and ancilla then the system evolution is given by a geodesic. In such a case, the measurement on the system bringing most information on $x$ is $x$-independent and can be determined in terms of the intersections of the geodesic with the boundary of quantum states. These results show that geodesic evolutions are of interest for high-precision detections in systems coupled to an ancilla in the absence of measurements on the ancilla.

Title: Trade-off between Noise and Banding in a Quantum Adder with Qudits
Authors: Gaurang Agrawal, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Quantum addition based on the quantum Fourier transform can be an integral part of a quantum circuit and proved to be more efficient than the existing classical ripple carry adder. Our study includes identifying the quantum resource required in a quantum adder in any arbitrary dimension and its relationship with the performance indicator in the presence of local noise acting on the circuit and when a limited number of controlled rotation operations is permitted, a procedure known as banding. We analytically prove an upper bound on the number of the controlled rotation gates required to accomplish the quantum addition up to an arbitrary defect in the fidelity between the desired and imperfect output. When the environment interacts with individual qudits, we establish a connection between quantum coherence and fidelity of the output. Interestingly, we demonstrate that when banding is employed in the presence of noise, approximate circuits of constant depth outperform circuits with a higher number of controlled rotations, establishing a complementary relationship between the approximate quantum adder and the strength of the noise. We exhibit that utilizing magnetic fields to prepare an initial state that evolves according to a one-dimensional spin chain for a specific amount of time can be a potential technique to implement quantum addition circuits in many-body systems.

Title: Magic Resource Can Enhance the Quantum Capacity of Channels
Authors: Kaifeng Bu, Arthur Jaffe
Abstract: We investigate the role of magic resource in the quantum capacity of channels. We consider the quantum channel of the recently proposed discrete beam splitter with the fixed environmental state. We find that if the fixed environmental state is a stabilizer state, then the quantum capacity is zero. Moreover, we find that the quantum capacity is nonzero for some magic states, and the quantum capacity increases linearly with respect to the number of single-qudit magic states in the environment. We also bound the maximal quantum capacity of the discrete beam splitter in terms of the amount of magic resource in the environmental states. These results suggest that magic resource can increase the quantum capacity of channels; it sheds new insight into the role of stabilizer and magic states in quantum communication.

Title: Quantum Ruzsa Divergence to Quantify Magic
Authors: Kaifeng Bu, Weichen Gu, Arthur Jaffe
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of quantum entropy under quantum convolution and its application in quantifying magic. We first establish an entropic, quantum central limit theorem (q-CLT), where the rate of convergence is bounded by the magic gap. We also introduce a new quantum divergence based on quantum convolution, called the quantum Ruzsa divergence, to study the stabilizer structure of quantum states. We conjecture a ``convolutional strong subadditivity'' inequality, which leads to the triangle inequality for the quantum Ruzsa divergence. In addition, we propose two new magic measures, the quantum Ruzsa divergence of magic and quantum-doubling constant, to quantify the amount of magic in quantum states. Finally, by using the quantum convolution, we extend the classical, inverse sumset theory to the quantum case. These results shed new insight into the study of the stabilizer and magic states in quantum information theory.

Title: Remote Cooling of Spin-ensembles through a Spin-mechanical Hybrid Interface
Authors: Yang Wang, Durga Bhaktavatsala Rao Dasari, Jörg Wrachtrup
Abstract: We present a protocol for the ground-state cooling of a tripartite hybrid quantum system, in which a macroscopic oscillator acts as a mediator between a single probe spin and a remote spin ensemble. In the presence of weak dispersive coupling between the spins and the oscillator, cooling of the oscillator and the ensemble spins can be achieved by exploiting the feedback from frequent measurements of the single probe spin. We explore the parameter regimes necessary to cool the ensemble, the oscillator, or both to their thermal ground states. This novel cooling protocol shows that, even with only weak dispersive coupling, energy transfer-like effects can be obtained by simply manipulating the probe spin. These results not only contribute to the development of a practical solution for cooling/polarizing large spin ensembles, but also provide a relatively simple means of tuning the dynamics of a hybrid system. The proposed cooling protocol thus has broader implications for advancing various quantum technology applications, such as macroscopic quantum state generation and remote sensing.

The present work derives the theoretical limit of single-photon purity for general parametric heralded single-photon sources, and subsequently demonstrates a bright, gigahertz-pulsed heralded source with the purity saturating the limit. By stimulating spontaneous four-wave mixing effect in the silicon spiral waveguide, this on-chip source is measured to have a coincidence rate exceeding 1.5~MHz at a coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) of 16.77 in the photon pair correlation experiment. The single-photon purity of this source, quantified by the heralded auto-correlation function $g^{(2)}_\text{h}(0)$, is measured by a heralded Hanbury Brown--Twiss setup to reach the theoretical limit with the lowest value of $0.00094 \pm 0.00002$ obtained at a coincidence rate of 0.8~kHz and a CAR of 2220. The performance improvements are attributed to effective spectral filtering suppressing the noise as well as the coherent pump condition helped by optical injection locking. The reported results provide a reliable standard for benchmarking heralded single-photon sources and present a state-of-the-art heralded source for quantum information processing.

Title: Geometric properties of qudit systems
Authors: J.A. López-Saldívar, O. Castaños, S. Cordero, E. Nahmad-Achar, R. López-Peña
Abstract: We discuss in general how to geometrically visualize a qudit system, with a particular interest in thermal states. The principle of maximum entropy is used to study the geometric properties of an ensemble of finite dimensional Hamiltonian systems with known average energy. These geometric characterizations are given in terms of the generalized diagonal Bloch vectors and the invariants of the special unitary group in $n$ dimensions. As examples, Hamiltonians written in terms of linear and quadratic generators of the angular momentum algebra are considered with $J= 1$ and $J=3/2$. For these cases, paths as functions of the temperature are established in the corresponding simplex representations, which show first- and second-order quantum phase transitions, as well as the adiabatic evolution of the interaction strengths (control parameters) of the Hamiltonian models. For the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonian the quantum phase diagram is explicitly shown for different temperature values in parameter space.

Title: Lower Bounds for Quantum Secure Function Evaluation Reductions
Authors: Esther Hänggi, Severin Winkler
Abstract: One-sided output secure function evaluation is a cryptographic primitive where the two mutually distrustful players, Alice and Bob, both have a private input to a bivariate function. Bob obtains the value of the function for the given inputs, while Alice receives no output. It is known that this primitive cannot be securely implemented if the two players only have access to noiseless classical and quantum communication. In this work, we first show that Bob can extract the function values for all his possible inputs from any implementation of a non-trivial function that is correct and preserves the privacy of Bob's input. Our result holds in the non-asymptotic setting where the players have finite resources and the error is a constant. Then we consider protocols for secure function evaluation in a setup where the two players have access to trusted distributed randomness as a resource. Building upon the first result, we prove a bound on the efficiency of such cryptographic reductions for any non-trivial function in terms of the conditional entropies of the trusted randomness. From this result, we can derive lower bounds on the number of instances of different variants of OT needed to securely implement a given function.

Title: Enhancing phase sensitivity in Mach-Zehnder interferometer with various detection schemes using SU(1,1) coherent states
Authors: Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, El Hassan Saidi, Rachid Ahl Laamara, Hanane El Hadfi
Abstract: Improving interferometric phase sensitivity is crucial for high-precision measurements in rapidly developing quantum technologies. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is a versatile tool for analyzing this phenomenon. By splitting and recombining a light beam using beam splitters, MZIs allow for precise phase sensitivity analysis using tools like the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). This paper analyzes the phase sensitivity of a MZI in various scenarios using different detection schemes and input states. We compare the single- and two-parameter quantum estimation and their associated QCRB for three phase-shift situations: in both arms, only in the upper arm (asymmetric), and in both arms symmetrically. We then investigate the phase sensitivity under three detection schemes: intensity difference, single-mode intensity, and balanced homodyne. Additionally, we explore the use of Perelomov and Barut-Girardello coherent states, two types of SU(1,1) coherent states, in all scenarios. Notably, we demonstrate that under optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(1,1) coherent states as input states.

Title: Continuous time crystals as a PT symmetric state and the emergence of critical exceptional points
Authors: Yuma Nakanishi, Ryo Hanai, Tomohiro Sasamoto
Abstract: Continuous time-translation symmetry is often spontaneously broken in open quantum systems, and the condition for their emergence has been actively investigated. However, there are only a few cases in which its condition for appearance has been fully elucidated. In this Letter, we show that a Lindbladian parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry can generically produce persistent periodic oscillations in a wide class of systems. This includes one-collective spin models, which have been studied thoroughly in the context of dissipative continuous time crystals, and spatially extended bipartite bosonic systems with conserved particle number. Interestingly, the periodic orbits in the PT-symmetric phase are found to be center-type, implying an initial state dependence. These results are established by proving that the Lindbladian $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry at the microscopic level implies a nonlinear PT symmetry, and by performing a linear stability analysis near the transition point. This research will further our understanding of novel non-equilibrium phases of matter and phase transitions with spontaneous anti-unitary symmetry breaking.

Title: Magic spreading in random quantum circuits
Authors: Xhek Turkeshi, Emanuele Tirrito, Piotr Sierant
Abstract: Magic is the resource that quantifies the amount of beyond-Clifford operations necessary for universal quantum computing. It bounds the cost of classically simulating quantum systems via stabilizer circuits central to quantum error correction and computation. How rapidly do generic many-body dynamics generate magic resources under the constraints of locality and unitarity? We address this central question by exploring magic spreading in brick-wall random unitary circuits. We explore scalable magic measures intimately connected to the algebraic structure of the Clifford group. These metrics enable the investigation of the spreading of magic for system sizes of up to $N=1024$ qudits, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art, which was restricted to about a dozen qudits. We demonstrate that magic resources equilibrate on timescales logarithmic in the system size, akin to anti-concentration and Hilbert space delocalization phenomena, but qualitatively different from the spreading of entanglement entropy. As random circuits are minimal models for chaotic dynamics, we conjecture that our findings describe the phenomenology of magic resources growth in a broad class of chaotic many-body systems.

Title: Operational simultaneous correlations in complementary bases of bipartite states via one-sided semi-device-independent steering
Authors: Chellasamy Jebarathinam, Debarshi Das, Huan-Yu Ku, Debasis Sarkar, Hsi-Sheng Goan
Abstract: Recently, a different form of quantum steering, i.e., certification of quantum steering in a one-sided semi-device-independent way, has been formulated [Jebarathinam \etal Phys. Rev. A 108, 042211 (2023)]. In this work, we use this phenomenon to provide operational simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases as quantified by the measures in [Wu \etal Scientific Reports 4, 4036 (2014)]. First, we show that for any bipartite state, such measure of simultaneous correlations in two mutually unbiased bases can be operationally identified as exhibiting one-sided semi-device-independent steering in a two-setting scenario. Next, we demonstrate that for two-qubit Bell-diagonal states, quantifying one-sided semi-device-independent steerability provides an operational quantification of information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases. Then, we provide a different classification of two-qubit separable states with the above-mentioned information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases and the quantification of one-sided semi-device-independent steerability. Finally, we invoke quantum steering ellipsoid formalism to shed intuitions on the operational characterization of simultaneous correlations in complementary bases of two-qubit states via one-sided semi-device-independent steerability. This provides us with a geometric visualization of the results.

Title: Chiral-cat-state generation via the Sagnac-Fizeau effect
Authors: Yu-Hong Liu, Xian-Li Yin, Hui Jing, Le-Man Kuang, Jie-Qiao Liao
Abstract: Chiral quantum state generation is an interesting topic in quantum physics and quantum information science. Here we propose an approach for generating chiral cat states in a spinning resonator supporting both the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) traveling modes, which are dispersively coupled to a two-level atom. The physical mechanism for the chiral-cat-state generation is based on the Sagnac-Fizeau effect. Concretely, when the resonator is rotating, the CW and CCW modes have different frequency detuning with respect to the atomic transition frequency and hence the atomic-state-dependent rotating angular velocities for the CW and CCW modes in phase space are different. This mode-dependent evolution leads to a chirality mechanism in the state generation. Based on the mode-dependent conditional rotation evolution and atomic projection measurement at proper time, we achieve the separate generation of cat states in the CW mode and coherent states in the CCW mode. We also investigate quantum coherence properties of the generated states by examining their Wigner functions. In addition, the influence of the system dissipations on the state generation in the open-system case is investigated. Our work will provide some insights into the development of chiral optical devices and nonreciprocal photonics.

Title: Suppression of motional dephasing using state mapping
Authors: Yuechun Jiao, Changcheng Li, XiaoFeng Shi, Jiabei Fan, Jingxu Bai, Suotang Jia, Jianming Zhao, C. Stuart Adams
Abstract: Rydberg-mediated quantum optics is a useful route toward deterministic quantum information processing based on single photons and quantum networks, but is bottlenecked by the fast motional dephasing of Rydberg atoms. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate suppressing the motional dephasing by creating an {\it a priori} unknown but correct phase to each Rydberg atom in an atomic ensemble. The phase created is exactly proportional to the unknown velocity of the thermal motion, resulting in a condition as if no thermal motion occurs to the Rydberg atom upon the retrieval of the signal photon. Our experiments, though hampered by the noise of lasers and the environment, demonstrate more than one order of magnitude enhancement of the coherence time. The feasibility of realizing long-lived storage of single photons in strongly interacting Rydberg media sheds new light on Rydberg-mediated quantum nonlinear optics.

Title: Accelerating Dissipative State Preparation with Adaptive Open Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Andrew Pocklington, Aashish A. Clerk
Abstract: A wide variety of dissipative state preparation schemes suffer from a basic time-entanglement tradeoff: the more entangled the steady state, the slower the relaxation to the steady state. Here, we show how a minimal kind of adaptive dynamics can be used to completely circumvent this tradeoff, and allow the dissipative stabilization of maximally entangled states with a finite time-scale. Our approach takes inspiration from simple fermionic stabilization schemes, which surprisingly are immune to entanglement-induced slowdown. We describe schemes for accelerated stabilization of many-body entangled qubit states (including spin squeezed states), both in the form of discretized Floquet circuits, as well as continuous time dissipative dynamics. Our ideas are compatible with a number of experimental platforms.

Title: Exotic localization for the bound states in the non-reciprocal two-particle Hubbard model
Authors: Huan-Yu Wang, Ji Li, Wu-Ming Liu, Lin Wen, Xiao-Fei Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the localization behavior of two-particle Hubbard model in the presence of non-reciprocal tunneling and non-Hermitian bound states can be obtained with strong repulsive interaction. Remarkably, the interaction induced bound state localization (BSL) can compete with non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and give rise to diverse density profiles. Via the quantum scattering methods in the center of mass frame, the system can be mapped to an effective two dimensional (2D) lattice with the two-particle interaction contributing to a defective line. For the bound states of the largest eigen-energy, in contrast to the Hermitian cases, where the maximal localization center is pinned around the center of lattice, NHSE can lead to a faded diagonal line localization. For the unbound scattering states, unlike the single corner localization in the 2D Hatano-Nelson model, interaction can force the total localization to split into multiple centers. To make the system topological nontrivial, we further include terms taking the form of two-photon tunneling and the non-Hermitian photon bound pairs are also observed, which demonstrates a competition among NHSE, BSL and edge localization. Finally, we propose the experimental simulations via the platforms of electrical circuits. Our works shed light on the crossover study of quantum optics and non-Hermitian many body physics.

Title: Trotter error time scaling separation via commutant decomposition
Authors: Yi-Hsiang Chen
Abstract: Suppressing the Trotter error in dynamical quantum simulation typically requires running deeper circuits, posing a great challenge for noisy near-term quantum devices. Studies have shown that the empirical error is usually much smaller than the one suggested by existing bounds, implying the actual circuit cost required is much less than the ones based on those bounds. Here, we improve the estimate of the Trotter error over existing bounds, by introducing a general framework of commutant decomposition that separates disjoint error components that have fundamentally different scaling with time. In particular we identify two error components that each scale as $O(\tau^pt)$ and $O(\tau^p)$ for a $p$th-order product formula evolving to time $t$ using a fixed step size $\tau$, it implies one would scale linearly with time $t$ and the other would be constant of $t$. We show that this formalism not only straightforwardly reproduces previous results but also provides a better error estimate for higher-order product formulas. We demonstrate the improvement both analytically and numerically. We also apply the analysis to observable error relating to the heating in Floquet dynamics and thermalization, which is of independent interest.

Title: Strong symmetries in collision models and physical dilations of covariant quantum maps
Authors: Marco Cattaneo
Abstract: Quantum maps are fundamental to quantum information theory and open quantum systems. Covariant or weakly symmetric quantum maps, in particular, play a key role in defining quantum evolutions that respect thermodynamics, establish free operations in resource theories, and are consistent with transformations of quantum reference frames. To implement quantum maps in the lab, one typically engineers a physical dilation, which corresponds to a unitary evolution entangling the system with an environment. This work systematically explores how weak symmetries of quantum maps manifest in their dilations. We demonstrate that for various classes of physical dilations, including Hamiltonian-driven dilations and short-time collision models that simulate Markovian open quantum dynamics, weak symmetries always lead to strong symmetries in the dilated evolution, resulting in conserved quantities in the system-environment space. We also characterize the subspace where these symmetries arise using Krylov subspaces. Moreover, we show that some different types of physical dilations have no constraints on the dilated evolution, requiring no strong symmetry. Finally, we complement our findings with a variety of illustrative and pedagogical examples. Our results provide essential guidelines for constructing physical dilations of quantum maps, offering a comprehensive understanding of how symmetries shape their implementations in a laboratory or on a quantum computer.

Title: Quantifying imaginarity in terms of pure-state imaginarity
Authors: Shuanping Du, Zhaofang Bai
Abstract: Complex numbers are widely used in quantum physics and are indispensable components for describing quantum systems and their dynamical behavior. The resource theory of imaginarity has been built recently, enabling a systematic research of complex numbers in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop two theoretical methods for quantifying imaginarity, motivated by recent progress within resource theories of entanglement and coherence. We provide quantifiers of imaginarity by the convex roof construction and quantifiers of the imaginarity by the least imaginarity of the input pure states under real operations. We also apply these tools to study the state conversion problem in resource theory of imaginarity.

Title: Constructing Multipartite Planar Maximally Entangled States from Phase States and Quantum Secret Sharing Protocol
Authors: Lahoucine Bouhouch, Yassine Dakir, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the construction of Planar Maximally Entangled (PME) states from phase states. PME states form a class of $n$-partite states in which any subset of adjacent particles whose size is less than or equal to half the total number of particles is in a fully entangled state. This property is essential to ensuring the robustness and stability of PME states in various quantum information applications. We introduce phase states for a set of so-called noninteracting $n$ particles and describe their corresponding separable density matrices. These phase states, although individually separable, serve as a starting point for the generation of entangled states when subjected to unitary dynamics. Using this method, we suggest a way to make complex multi-qubit states by watching how unconnected phase states change over time with a certain unitary interaction operator. In addition, we show how to derive PME states from these intricate phase states for two-, three-, four-, and K-qubit systems. This construction method for PME states represents a significant advance over absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states, as it provides a more accessible and versatile resource for quantum information processing. Not only does it enable the creation of a broader class of multipartite entangled states, overcoming the limitations of AME states, notably their restricted availability in low-dimensional systems; for example, the absence of a four-qubit AME state, but it also offers a systematic construction method for any even number of qudits, paving the way for practical applications in key quantum technologies such as teleportation, secret sharing and error correction, where multipartite entanglement plays a central role in protocol efficiency.

Title: Scalable Parameter Design for Superconducting Quantum Circuits with Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Hao Ai, Yu-xi Liu
Abstract: To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec. Overall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing parameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which initially demonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.

Title: Transverse orbital angular momentum and polarization entangled spatiotemporal structured light
Authors: Hsiao-Chih Huang, Kefu Mu, Hui Min Leung, Chen-Ting Liao
Abstract: Intra-system entanglement occurs between non-separable modes within the same system. For optical systems, the various degrees of freedom of light represent different modes, and the potential use of light to create higher dimensional classical entangle states offers a promising potential to drive new technological developments. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating the orthogonality between transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM) of different spatiotemporal topological charges, a previously unverified property of t-OAM. Based on those results, we developed methods to create and characterize a novel family of t-OAM and polarization entangled spatiotemporal structured light. We further provide theoretical analysis to support our study of the entanglement between those modes. By demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging t-OAM as a new family of modes for classical entanglement, our work represents a new advancement towards higher dimensional classical entanglement strategies.

Title: Entangling gates from cabling of knots
Authors: Sergey Mironov, Andrey Morozov
Abstract: While there is a general consensus about the structure of one qubit operations in topological quantum computer, two qubits are as usual a more difficult and complex story of different attempts with varying approaches, problems and effectiveness. In this paper we discuss how to construct an efficient realization of a two qubit gate in topological quantum computer, by using principle of cabling from the knot theory. This allows to construct a braiding of cables dependent on the parameters of the theory where there is a low probability of moving out of computational space (high fidelity of operation) while there is a non-trivial entangling two-qubit operation. We also present some examples of these operations for different parameters of the theory.

Title: Hamiltonian dynamics simulation using linear combination of unitaries on an ion trap quantum computer
Authors: Michelle Wynne Sze, Yao Tang, Silas Dilkes, David Muñoz Ramo, Ross Duncan, Nathan Fitzpatrick
Abstract: The linear combination of unitaries (LCU) method has proven to scale better than existing product formulas in simulating long time Hamiltonian dynamics. However, given the number of multi-control gate operations in the standard prepare-select-unprepare architecture of LCU, it is still resource-intensive to implement on the current quantum computers. In this work, we demonstrate LCU implementations on an ion trap quantum computer for calculating squared overlaps $|\langle \psi(t=0)|\psi(t>0)\rangle|^2$ of time-evolved states. This is achieved by an optimized LCU method, based on pre-selecting relevant unitaries, coupled with a compilation strategy which makes use of quantum multiplexor gates, leading to a significant reduction in the depth and number of two-qubit gates in circuits. For $L$ Pauli strings in a Taylor series expanded $n$-qubit-mapped time evolution operator, we find a two-qubit gate count of $2^{\lceil log_2(L)\rceil}(2n+1)-n-2$. We test this approach by simulating a Rabi-Hubbard Hamiltonian.

Title: Singlet-only Always-on Gapless Exchange Qubits with Baseband Control
Authors: Nathan L. Foulk, Silas Hoffman, Katharina Laubscher, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We propose a singlet-only always-on gapless exchange (SAGE) spin qubit that encodes a single qubit in the spins of four electrons while allowing universal baseband control. While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors, for instance due to local nuclear environments and variations in the $g$-factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always-on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.

Title: Cyclic quantum causal modelling with a graph separation theorem
Authors: Carla Ferradini, Victor Gitton, V. Vilasini
Abstract: Causal modelling frameworks link observable correlations to causal explanations, which is a crucial aspect of science. These models represent causal relationships through directed graphs, with vertices and edges denoting systems and transformations within a theory. Most studies focus on acyclic causal graphs, where well-defined probability rules and powerful graph-theoretic properties like the d-separation theorem apply. However, understanding complex feedback processes and exotic fundamental scenarios with causal loops requires cyclic causal models, where such results do not generally hold. While progress has been made in classical cyclic causal models, challenges remain in uniquely fixing probability distributions and identifying graph-separation properties applicable in general cyclic models. In cyclic quantum scenarios, existing frameworks have focussed on a subset of possible cyclic causal scenarios, with graph-separation properties yet unexplored. This work proposes a framework applicable to all consistent quantum and classical cyclic causal models on finite-dimensional systems. We address these challenges by introducing a robust probability rule and a novel graph-separation property, p-separation, which we prove to be sound and complete for all such models. Our approach maps cyclic causal models to acyclic ones with post-selection, leveraging the post-selected quantum teleportation protocol. We characterize these protocols and their success probabilities along the way. We also establish connections between this formalism and other classical and quantum frameworks to inform a more unified perspective on causality. This provides a foundation for more general cyclic causal discovery algorithms and to systematically extend open problems and techniques from acyclic informational networks (e.g., certification of non-classicality) to cyclic causal structures and networks.

Title: Probing Celestial Energy and Charge Correlations through Real-Time Quantum Simulations: Insights from the Schwinger Model
Authors: João Barata, Swagato Mukherjee
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.

Hohmann, Alexander Kavner, Christian Koos, Artem Kuzmin, Benjamin V. Lehmann, Severin Nägeli, Titus Neupert, Bjoern Penning, Diego Ramírez García, Andreas Schilling
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.

Title: Superdiffusive transport in chaotic quantum systems with nodal interactions
Authors: Yu-Peng Wang, Jie Ren, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We introduce a class of interacting fermionic quantum models in $d$ dimensions with nodal interactions that exhibit superdiffusive transport. We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.

Title: Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network methods
Authors: Zhong-Bo Kang, Noah Moran, Peter Nguyen, Wenyang Qian
Abstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.

Title: Cyclic functional causal models beyond unique solvability with a graph separation theorem
Authors: Carla Ferradini, Victor Gitton, V. Vilasini
Abstract: Functional causal models (fCMs) specify functional dependencies between random variables associated to the vertices of a graph. In directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), fCMs are well-understood: a unique probability distribution on the random variables can be easily specified, and a crucial graph-separation result called the d-separation theorem allows one to characterize conditional independences between the variables. However, fCMs on cyclic graphs pose challenges due to the absence of a systematic way to assign a unique probability distribution to the fCM's variables, the failure of the d-separation theorem, and lack of a generalization of this theorem that is applicable to all consistent cyclic fCMs. In this work, we develop a causal modeling framework applicable to all cyclic fCMs involving finite-cardinality variables, except inconsistent ones admitting no solutions. Our probability rule assigns a unique distribution even to non-uniquely solvable cyclic fCMs and reduces to the known rule for uniquely solvable fCMs. We identify a class of fCMs, called averagely uniquely solvable, that we show to be the largest class where the probabilities admit a Markov factorization. Furthermore, we introduce a new graph-separation property, p-separation, and prove this to be sound and complete for all consistent finite-cardinality cyclic fCMs while recovering the d-separation theorem for DAGs. These results are obtained by considering classical post-selected teleportation protocols inspired by analogous protocols in quantum information theory. We discuss further avenues for exploration, linking in particular problems in cyclic fCMs and in quantum causality.
