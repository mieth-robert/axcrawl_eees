Title: QEGS: A Mathematica Package for the Analysis of Quantum Extended Games
Authors: Krzysztof Grzanka, Anna Gorczyca-Goraj, Piotr Frąckiewicz, Marek Szopa
Abstract: Quantum games have attracted much attention in recent years due to their ability to solve decision-making dilemmas. The aim of this study is to extend previous work on quantum games by introducing a Mathematica package QEGS (Quantum Extension Game Solver) dedicated to the study of quantum extensions of classical $2\times2$ games based on the EWL scheme. The package generates all possible game extensions with one or two unitary strategies, which are invariant with respect to isomorphic transformations of the initial games. The package includes a number of functions to study these extensions, such as determining their Nash equilibria in pure strategies, eliminating dominated strategies, or computing maximin strategies. Independently of quantum extensions, these functions can also be used to analyze classical games. Reporting to a pdf is available. The discussion includes an outline of future research directions, such as the exploration of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria and potential real-world applications in fields like quantum computing and secure communications.

Title: Physical origins and limitations of canonical quantum measurement behavior
Authors: Jonathan F. Schonfeld
Abstract: I review and augment my work of the last few years on the physical origins and limitations of canonical quantum measurement behavior. Central to this work is a detailed analysis of the microstructure of real measurement devices. Particular attention is paid to the Mott problem, which addresses a simpler version of canonical quantum measurement behavior: It asks why an alpha particle emitted in a nuclear decay produces one and only one track in a cloud chamber. My analysis - entirely consistent with unitarity - leads to an emergent, approximate Born rule supported by experiment, with possible breakdown at very small probability density. I argue that a similar picture applies to other measurement scenarios, including Geiger counters, the Stern-Gerlach experiment and superconducting qubits.

Title: Productive Quantum Programming Needs Better Abstract Machines
Authors: Santiago Núñez-Corrales, Olivia Di Matteo, John Dumbell, Marcus Edwards, Edoardo Giusto, Scott Pakin, Vlad Stirbu
Abstract: An effective, accessible abstraction hierarchy has made using and programming computers possible for people across all disciplines. Establishing such a hierarchy for quantum programming is an outstanding challenge, especially due to a proliferation of different conventions and the rapid pace of innovation. One critical portion of the hierarchy is the abstract machine, the layer that separates a programmer's mental model of the hardware from its physical realization. Drawing on historical parallels in classical computing, we explain why having the "right" quantum abstract machine (QAM) is essential for making progress in the field and propose a novel framework for evaluating QAMs based on a set of desirable criteria. These criteria capture aspects of a QAM such as universality, compactness, expressiveness, and composability, which aid in the representation of quantum programs. By defining this framework we take steps toward defining an optimal QAM. We further apply our framework to survey the landscape of existing proposals, draw comparisons, and assess them based on our criteria. While these proposals share many common strengths, we find that each falls short of our ideal. Our framework and our findings set a direction for subsequent efforts to define a future QAM that is both straightforward to map to a variety of quantum computers, and provides a stable abstraction for quantum software development.

Title: Risk-minimizing states for the quantum-phase-estimation algorithm
Authors: Joseph G. Smith, Crispin H. W. Barnes, David R. M. Arvidsson-Shukur
Abstract: The quantum-phase-estimation algorithm (QPEA) is widely used to find estimates of unknown phases. The original algorithm relied on an input state in a uniform superposition of all possible bit strings. However, it is known that other input states can reduce certain Bayesian risks of the final estimate. Here, we derive a method to find the risk-minimizing input state for any risk. These states are represented by an eigenvector of a Toeplitz matrix with elements given by the Fourier coefficients of the loss function of interest. We show that, while the true optimal state does not have a closed form for a general loss function, it is well approximated by a state with a cosine form. When the cosine frequency is chosen appropriately, these states outperform the original QPEA and achieve the optimal theoretical quantum-advantage scaling for three common risks. Furthermore, we prove that the uniform input state is suboptimal for any reasonable loss function. Finally, we design methods to mitigate the impact of depolarizing noise on the performance of QPEA.

Title: Optomechanical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing
Authors: Margaret Pavlovich, Peter Rakich, Shruti Puri
Abstract: Fusion-based quantum computing with dual-rail qubits is a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing using linear optics. This paradigm requires single photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed into a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and for small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a single reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic sources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic outputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of resources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the all-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of quantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled states, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical quantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically long lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and insensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be prepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still probabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic modes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the states. The quantum states may be deterministically transferred from acoustic modes to optical modes, on demand, with another optical drive.

Title: Quasiparticle-induced decoherence of a driven superconducting qubit
Authors: Mykola Kishmar, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Andrey Klots, Thomas Connolly, Igor L. Aleiner, Vladislav D. Kurilovich
Abstract: We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.

Title: Theory of Quasiparticle Generation by Microwave Drives in Superconducting Qubits
Authors: Shoumik Chowdhury, Max Hays, Shantanu R. Jha, Kyle Serniak, Terry P. Orlando, Jeffrey A. Grover, William D. Oliver
Abstract: Microwave drives are commonly employed to control superconducting quantum circuits, enabling qubit gates, readout, and parametric interactions. As the drive frequencies are typically an order of magnitude smaller than (twice) the superconducting gap, it is generally assumed that such drives do not disturb the BCS ground state. However, sufficiently strong drives can activate multi-photon pair-breaking processes that generate quasiparticles and result in qubit errors. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for calculating the rates of multi-photon-assisted pair-breaking transitions induced by both charge- and flux-coupled microwave drives. Through illustrative examples, we show that drive-induced QP generation may impact novel high-frequency dispersive readout architectures, as well as Floquet-engineered superconducting circuits operating under strong driving conditions.

Title: Optimizing the qudit dimensions of position-momentum entangled photons for QKD
Authors: Vikas S Bhat, Rounak Chatterjee, Kiran Bajar, Sushil Mujumdar
Abstract: We propose an optimization scheme to maximize the secure key rate of a high-dimensional variant of BBM92. We use the position-momentum conjugate bases to encode the higher dimensional qudits, realised in a fully passive optical setup. The setup employs a single lens for the basis measurements and no lossy or slow elements. We optimize the qudit dimension for the protocol by maximizing the number of equiprobable sections (macropixels) of the detected beam while minimizing their overlap error. We show the enhanced key rate by discarding events from the ambiguous border pixels. Our strategy maximizes the overlap between the discarded regions from neighbouring macropixels, thereby globally minimizing the overall loss and error. We calculate the optimal dimension and the secure key rate for certain beam parameters. We experimentally show the feasibility of our scheme. This work paves the way for realistic implementations of high-dimensional device-independent quantum key distribution with enhanced bitrates.

Title: Enhancing Microwave-Optical Bell Pairs Generation for Quantum Transduction Using Kerr Nonlinearity
Authors: Fangxin Li, Ming Yuan, Zhaoyou Wang, Changchun Zhong, Liang Jiang
Abstract: Microwave-optical quantum transduction can be achieved via quantum teleportation using microwave-optical photon Bell pairs. The standard spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has to trade off between generation fidelity and probability due to unwanted higher-excitation pairs in the output. In this work, we propose a pulsed SPDC scheme that employs strong Kerr nonlinearity in the microwave mode. This nonlinearity causes significant detuning of higher excitations due to the anharmonicity of energy levels, and the system can be pulse-driven to produce single-photon pairs in the output. Our pulsed nonlinear approach can generate high-fidelity Bell pairs with high probability, alleviating the trade-off between fidelity and probability inherent in traditional SPDC schemes. We optimize both the pulse width and driving strength, demonstrating that our protocol outperforms the SPDC scheme in a realistic setting of finite nonlinearity and intrinsic photon loss.

Title: Paving the Path-Integral toward Quantum Acoustics
Authors: Joost V. de Nijs, Anton M. Graf, Eric J. Heller, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen
Abstract: A path-integral approach to quantum acoustics is developed here. In contrast to the commonly utilized particle perspective, this emerging field brings forth a long neglected but essential wave paradigm for lattice vibrations. Within the coherent state picture, we formulate a non-Markovian, stochastic master equation that captures the exact dynamics of any system linearly coupled to a harmonic lattice. We further demonstrate the capability of the presented master equation by applying the corresponding procedure to the eminent Fröhlich model. In general, we establish a solid foundation for quantum acoustics as a kindred framework to quantum optics, while paving the way for deeper first-principle explorations of non-perturbative system dynamics driven by lattice vibrations.

Title: Hardware-Efficient Large-Scale Universal Linear Transformations for Optical Modes in the Synthetic Time Dimension
Authors: Jasvith Raj Basani, Chaohan Cui, Jack Postlewaite, Edo Waks, Saikat Guha
Abstract: Recent progress in photonic information processing has generated strong interest in scalable and dynamically reconfigurable photonic circuitry. Conventional approaches based on spatial interferometer meshes face a fundamental scaling bottleneck, requiring a number of components that grows quadratically with system size. Here, we introduce a hardware-efficient time-domain photonic processor that achieves at least an exponential reduction in component count for implementing arbitrary linear transformations. Our design leverages the favorable scaling properties of the synthetic time dimension by encoding information in time-binned modes and processing them in parallel using recursive switchable short and long-range coupling. The dynamic connectivity of our processor enables systematic pruning of circuit depth, which minimizes optical loss while maintaining all-to-all connectivity. We benchmark our platform on the task of boosted Bell state measurements - a critical component in linear optical quantum computing, and demonstrate that the architecture surpasses the thresholds required for universal cluster-state quantum computation under realistic hardware parameters. We link the performance of our device to the geometric nature of multi-photon transport and show that, contrary to the expectation that redundant faulty hardware degrades performance, localization effects may contribute to improved robustness against coherent errors. Our results establish a practical pathway toward near-term, scalable, and reconfigurable photonic processors for quantum computation and simulation in the synthetic time dimension.

Title: Field emission tunnelling as a window onto fundamental issues in quantum mechanics
Authors: Richard G. Forbes
Abstract: Field electron emission (FE) and electrostatic field ionization (ESFI) are quantum-mechanical tunnelling processes that provide basic theory for important technologies. However, the basic theories of FE and ESF1 are not yet completely understood. This paper attempts to identify related fundamental quantum mechanical issues, problems and relevances. The following topics have been identified as deserving closer investigation or discussion. (a) The implication that if a "real electron" cannot have negative kinetic energy, then this necessarily implies that a "real electron" is a distributed object rather than a point object. (b) The implication that the language we use to discuss quantum mechanics needs to be changed in order to avoid referring to the "position of a (point) electron". (c) The idea that "quantum mathematics" (i.e., the mathematics of quantum mechanics) has different utilisations, namely the "matter distribution" and "pathway choice" utilisations, with "measurement" being observed pathway choice. (d) Difficulties with the present formulations of the uncertainty principle and wave-particle duality. (e) Fundamental difficulties in the exact calculation of exchange-and-correlation effects in both FE and ESFI theory. (f) Conceptual problems associated with "seeing electrons" in the field electron (emission) microscope. (g) Field emission tunnelling and the arrow of time. (h) The choice between tunnelling-integral and overlap-integral formulations of tunnelling theory, and the apparent incompleteness of both types of formulation.

Title: The Alicki-Fannes-Winter technique in the quasi-classical settings: advanced version and its applications
Authors: M.E.Shirokov
Abstract: We describe an advanced version of the AFW-technique proposed in [Lett. Math. Phys., 113, 121 (2023)],[Lobachevskii J. Math., 44(6), 2169 (2023)] which allows us to obtain lower semicontinuity bounds, continuity bounds and local lower bounds for characteristics of quantum systems and discrete random variables. We consider applications of the new version of the AFW-technique to several basic characteristics of quantum systems (the von Neumann entropy, the energy-type functionals, the quantum relative entropy, the conditional entropy and the entanglement of formation).

Title: Exact closed-form expression for unitary spin-adapted fermionic singlet double excitation operators
Authors: Erik Rosendahl Kjellgren, Karl Michael Ziems, Peter Reinholdt, Stephan P. A. Sauer, Sonia Coriani, Jacob Kongsted
Abstract: We derive exact closed-form expressions for the matrix exponential of the anti-Hermitian spin-adapted singlet double excitation fermionic operators. These expressions enable the efficient implementation of such operators within unitary product state frameworks targeting conventional hardware, and allow for the implementation of ansatze that guarantee convergence to specific spin symmetries. Moreover, these exact closed-form expressions might also lay the groundwork for constructing spin-adapted circuits for quantum devices.

Title: Experimental Proposal on Non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm Caging Effect with a Single Trapped Ion
Authors: Zhiyuan Liu, Wanchao Yao, Sai Li, Yi Li, Yue Li, Zheng-Yuan Xue, Yiheng Lin
Abstract: In the lattice system, when the synthetic flux reaches a $\pi$ phase along a closed loop under the synthetic gauge field, destructive interference occurs and gives rise to the localization phenomenon. This is known as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) caging effect. It provides a powerful tool for the study of quantum transportation and dynamical effects. In the system where lattice sites possess internal structure and the underlying gauge field is non-Abelian, localization can also occur, forming the non-Abelian AB caging. Here, we propose an experimental scheme to synthesize non-Abelian gauge fields with a single trapped ion by coupling multiple internal levels and Fock states in its motion via laser fields. In contrast to the Abelian AB caging, we numerically observe that the non-Abelian AB caging occurs either when the interference matrix is nilpotent, or when the initial state is specifically set. Our experimental scheme broadens the study of localization phenomena and provides a novel tool for the study of non-Abelian physics.

Title: Symmetry-adapted sample-based quantum diagonalization: Application to lattice model
Authors: Kosuke Nogaki, Steffen Backes, Tomonori Shirakawa, Seiji Yunoki, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: We present a symmetry-adapted extension of sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) that rigorously embeds space-group symmetry into the many-body subspace sampled by quantum hardware. The method is benchmarked on the two-leg ladder Hubbard model using both molecular orbital and momentum bases. Energy convergence is shown to be improved in the momentum basis compared to the molecular orbital basis for both the spin-quintet ground state and the spin-singlet excited state. We clarify the relationship between the compactness of the many-body wave function and the sparsity of the representation matrices of symmetry operations. Furthermore, the enhancement of the superconducting correlation function due to the Coulomb interaction is demonstrated. Our method highlights the importance of symmetry structure in random-sampling quantum simulation of correlated systems

Title: Generation of entanglement between bright light fields via incoherent spontaneous emission
Authors: Xihua Yang, Mingfei Cheng, Xiaodong Zeng, Zhenghong Li, Min Xiao
Abstract: In contrast to the general argument that the spontaneous decay is intrinsically incoherent in nature and detrimental to quantum entanglement, here, we show that nearly perfect entanglement between two bright pump fields can be realized via spontaneous decay-induced destructive quantum interference in a closed double Lambda-type four-level atomic system with the energy separation of the excited doublet comparable to their decay rates. The high degree of bipartite entanglement results from the cancellation of spontaneous emission and subsequent elimination of the associated noise due to the destructive quantum interference between the two spontaneous emission pathways from the upper doublet to each of the two lower levels when the two strong pump fields are tuned to the particular frequencies where quantum interference takes place. This scheme is particularly suitable for the generation of entanglement between two bright light fields, and may find potential applications in realistic quantum information processing.

Title: Large speed-up of quantum emitter detection via extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference
Authors: Warwick P. Bowen
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key resource in quantum technologies, microscopy, and other applications. The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for quality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of naturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the performance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and persists for incoherent emission. Our work offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for emitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems.

Title: A Troubleshooting Framework for Trapping Ions
Authors: Monet Tokuyama Friedrich, Alto Osada, Rodney Van Meter, Shota Nagayama
Abstract: Practical knowledge about troubleshooting and error handling in trapped-ion systems remains largely undocumented and held within individual labs, creating a barrier to cross-disciplinary collaboration towards engineering scalable systems. This paper presents a structured troubleshooting framework for trapping ions, developed through hands-on experience in the lab. The framework categorizes standard failure modes across subsystems -- vacuum, electronics, optics, and imaging -- and organizes them into a modular decision-tree structure. Each troubleshooting action is annotated with estimates of cost and operational risk inspired by the principles of Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). By categorizing failure modes and their associated costs, this work bridges the gap between physicists and engineers, enabling collaborative system design and setting the stage for turning experimental setups into robust, reproducible products. This framework provides a structured basis for future error-handled ion-trap systems, designed with diagnostics and maintainability in mind -- for use in distributed quantum computing and networks.

Title: Dual-channel Transfer and Modulation of Optical Vortices in a Ladder-Type System
Authors: Yazhi Shan, Yan Zhang
Abstract: We propose a dual-channel closed-loop structure within a symmetry-broken ladder-type three-level quantum system, where each channel incorporates three-wave mixing (TWM) processes. This system enables the transfer of optical vortices from either the strong control field or the weak input probe field to the TWM-generated fields in the channel. As a result, the two resultant output optical fields exhibit unique spatial distributions, such as crescent and petal shapes, which can be non-synchronously modulated via adjusting the intensity and frequency of the control field. The orbital angular momentum transfer dynamics and multi-angle spatial distribution modulation of the output fields show periodic and non-synchronous characteristics via adjusting the control field due to the optical interference. Thus, this quantum system has great potential as a tunable optical modulator, which holds promise for applications in information technologies involving multi-channel processing and asymmetric tasks, especially in advanced optical modulation and quantum state manipulation in quantum information processing.

Title: Quantum Support Vector Regression for Robust Anomaly Detection
Authors: Kilian Tscharke, Maximilian Wendlinger, Sebastian Issel, Pascal Debus
Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) is critical in data analysis, particularly within the domain of IT security. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for AD in large-scale data. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum ML approaches, specifically quantum kernel methods, for the application to robust AD. We build upon previous work on Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) for semisupervised AD by conducting a comprehensive benchmark on IBM quantum hardware using eleven datasets. Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning and demonstrate that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that noise does not improve the adversarial robustness of the model.

Title: Quantum Back Action Evasion with Reservoir Engineering
Authors: Yohei Nishino, James W. Gardner, Yanbei Chen, Kentaro Somiya
Abstract: We propose a back-action evading scheme for a free mass that combines reservoir engineering with velocity measurement. The underlying principle follows the double-pass-type speed meter, which measures the mirror's velocity using a nonreciprocal interaction. In our method, the nonreciprocal coupling is realized through reservoir engineering, following the recipe proposed in [Phys. Rev. X 5, 021025]. We show that reservoir engineering can reproduce the double-pass speed meter with optimal feedforward, using only reciprocal interactions. The resulting force sensitivity surpasses the standard quantum limit, providing an alternative route to quantum back-action evasion in cavity optomechanical systems.

Title: Violation of Svetlichny's inequality in a system of spins $j$
Authors: Yang Xiang, Yuan Tao
Abstract: Quantum multi-particle correlations are one of the most intriguing properties of quantum entanglement, arising from collective entangled states of multiple particles. Svetlichny's inequality (SI) was the first method proposed to test the existence of such correlations. Previous studies have primarily focused on $1/2$-spin particle systems. In this paper, we present a unified scheme that enables the violation of SI in arbitrary non-zero spin particle systems. Specifically, for all fermion systems, our scheme achieves the maximal quantum violation of SI for any number of particles. For boson systems, when the particle spin $j\geq2$, our scheme consistently realizes the violation of SI for any number of particles. When the particle spin $j=1$, our scheme can yield SI violation for up to $7$ particles. Furthermore, as the particle spin $j$ approaches infinity, our scheme achieves the maximal quantum violation of SI. To obtain these results, we also prove that the upper bound of Svetlichny's operator within the framework of local hidden variable theory is $\sqrt{2^{N+1}}$. These findings not only enhance our understanding of quantum correlations across various particle systems but also provide valuable insights for the development of quantum communication protocols that utilize entanglement and non-locality in multi-particle configurations.

Title: Quantum Simulations Based on Parameterized Circuit of an Antisymmetric Matrix
Authors: Ammar Daskin
Abstract: Given an antisymmetric matrix $A$ or the unitary matrix $U_A = e^A$-or an oracle whose answers can be used to infer information about $A$-in this paper we present a parameterized circuit framework that can be used to approximate a quantum circuit for $e^A$. We design the circuit based on a uniform antisymmetric matrix with $\{\pm 1\}$ elements, which has an eigenbasis that is a phase-shifted version of the quantum Fourier transform, and its eigenspectrum can be constructed by using rotation $Z$ gates. Therefore, we show that it can be used to directly estimate $e^A$ and its quantum circuit representation. Since the circuit is based on $O(n^2)$ quantum gates, which form the eigendecomposition of $e^A$ with separate building blocks, it can also be used to approximate the eigenvalues of $A$.

Title: A swap-based mixer for the TSP: theoretical considerations, implementation and experiments
Authors: E. Bourreau, G. Fleury, P. Lacomme
Abstract: This paper explores quantum heuristics based on Mixer Hamiltonians, which enable the restriction of investigations to a specific subspace. Approaches utilizing Mixer Hamiltonians can be incorporated into the QAOA algorithm, and we can define Mixer Hamiltonians as mapping functions that transform qubit strings into solution sets. Our objective is to define a swap based mixer for the TSP to investigate only during QAOA, the qubit-strings that modelize TSP solution. The experiment carried on a 5-customers TSP instances proves the mixer efficiency.

Title: Qracle: A Graph-Neural-Network-based Parameter Initializer for Variational Quantum Eigensolvers
Authors: Chi Zhang, Lei Jiang, Fan Chen
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms with broad applications in quantum physics and quantum chemistry. However, as system size increases, VQE optimization is increasingly hindered by the barren plateau phenomenon, where gradients vanish and the loss function becomes trapped in local minima. While machine learning-based parameter initialization methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they often show limited effectiveness in complex VQE problems. This is primarily due to their inadequate ability to model the intricate correlations embedded in the Hamiltonian structure and the associated ansatz circuits. In this paper, we propose \textit{Qracle}, a graph neural network (GNN)-based parameter initializer for VQEs. \textit{Qracle} systematically encodes both the Hamiltonian and the associated ansatz circuit into a unified graph representation and leverages a GNN to learn a mapping from VQE problem graphs to optimized ansatz parameters. Compared to state-of-the-art initialization techniques, \textit{Qracle} achieves a reduction in initial loss of up to $10.86$, accelerates convergence by decreasing optimization steps by up to $64.42\%$, and improves final performance with up to a $26.43\%$ reduction in Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).

Title: Optical properties of a diamond NV color center from capped embedded multiconfigurational correlated wavefunction theory
Authors: John Mark P. Martirez
Abstract: Diamond defects are among the most promising qubits. Modelling their properties through accurate quantum mechanical simulations can further their development into robust units of information. We use the recently developed capped density functional embedding theory (capped-DFET) with the multiconfigurational n-electron valence second-order perturbation theory to characterize the electronic excitation energies for different spin manifolds of the well-characterized negatively charged substitutional N defect adjacent to a vacancy (V$_C$) in diamond (N$_C$V$_C^-$). We successfully reproduce vertical excitation energies for both triplet and singlet states of N$_C$V$_C^-$ with errors < 0.1 eV. Unlike other embedding methods, capped-DFET exhibits robust predictions that are approximately independent of the embedded cluster size: it only requires a cluster to contain the defect atoms and their nearest neighbors (as small as a 40-atom capped cluster). Furthermore, our method is free from slowly converging Coulomb interactions between charged defects, and thus also only weakly dependent on supercell size.

Title: Improved Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method for Advection-Diffusion Equations with a Linear Collision Model
Authors: Li Xu, Ming Li, Lei Zhang, Hai Sun, Jun Yao
Abstract: Quantum computing has made tremendous progress in recent years, providing potentialities for breaking the bottleneck of computing power in the field of scientific computing, like computational fluid dynamics. To reduce computational costs and achieve an acceleration, we propose an ancilla free quantum lattice Boltzmann method for advection-diffusion equations that fully leverages the parallelism of quantum computing. More significantly, there is no need to perform quantum state tomography in each previous loop, if the macroscopic variables for a certain loop is needed. The non-unitary collision operators are replaced by the unique local unitary operations, and the removal of ancilla qubit greatly diminishes the complexity of the quantum circuit. The numerical simulations of the $D_1Q_3$ and $D_2Q_5$ models have confirmed the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

Title: The Dance of the Sheared Eigenfunctions
Authors: J. Oliveira-Cony, Reinaldo de Melo e Souza, F. S. S. Rosa, C. Farina
Abstract: In this work, we delve into the theory of sheared potentials in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. After defining what we mean by a family of sheared potentials, we consider these families in two particular but emblematic cases, the harmonic oscillator and the symmetric potential well proportional to $|x|$. In both cases, besides determining the spectra, we analyse the impact of the shearing process on the respective eigenfunctions. The latter analysis is typically left aside in the literature, but here we show that the sheared eigenfunctions yield insights that allow for a deeper understanding of the main features exhibited by the spectra. Finally, we make a few comments about the connection between the change in the spectra of a given sheared family and the necessary work that must be made by an external agent to implement such a change.

Title: S-SYNC: Shuttle and Swap Co-Optimization in Quantum Charge-Coupled Devices
Authors: Chenghong Zhu, Xian Wu, Jingbo Wang, Xin Wang
Abstract: The Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture is a modular design to expand trapped-ion quantum computer that relies on the coherent shuttling of qubits across an array of segmented electrodes. Leveraging trapped ions for their long coherence times and high-fidelity quantum operations, QCCD technology represents a significant advancement toward practical, large-scale quantum processors. However, shuttling increases thermal motion and consistently necessitates qubit swaps, significantly extend execution time and negatively affect application success rates. In this paper, we introduce S-SYNC -- a compiler designed to co-optimize the number of shuttling and swapping operations. S-SYNC exploits the unique properties of QCCD and incorporates generic SWAP operations to efficiently manage shuttle and SWAP counts simultaneously. Building on the static topology formulation of QCCD, we develop scheduling heuristics to enhance overall performance. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach reduces the shuttling number by 3.69x on average and improves the success rate of quantum applications by 1.73x on average. Moreover, we apply S-SYNC to gain insights into executing applications across various QCCD topologies and to compare the trade-offs between different initial mapping methods.

Title: Efimov-like Quasi-Bound States in a 1D Self-Similar Delta-Barrier Array
Authors: Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Yan He, Hao Guo
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional quantum system with a self-similar arrangement of delta-function potential barriers, exhibiting discrete scale invariance. Unlike typical scale-invariant systems with smooth potentials, our model features singular potentials with barriers positioned at geometrically scaled locations, $x_n = x_0 \lambda^n$. We show that the system supports a unique zero-energy wavefunction that is not square-integrable but decays to zero at infinity, acting as a quasi-bound state. This wavefunction displays self-similarity under discrete scaling transformations, similar to the scaling symmetry in Efimov physics, though it represents a single state rather than a series of bound states. We analyze the wavefunction's asymptotic power-law decay and explore the spectral properties of the system, which lacks a discrete spectrum. These results highlight the role of singular potentials in generating scale-invariant quantum phenomena and provide a simple framework for studying discrete scale symmetry in quantum mechanics.

Title: Engineering CSS surgery: a fault-tolerant CNOT for any CSS codes
Authors: Clément Poirson, Joschka Roffe, Robert I. Booth
Abstract: We introduce a framework for implementing logic in CSS-style quantum error correction codes, building on the surgery methods of Cowtan and Burton [CB24]. Our approach offers a systematic methodology for designing and analysing surgery protocols. At the physical level, we introduce the concept of subcodes, which encapsulate all the necessary data for performing surgery. At the logical level, leveraging homological algebra, subcodes enable us to track the logical operations induced by any surgery protocol, regardless of the choice of logical operator basis. In particular, we make no assumptions on the structure of the logical operators of the codes, eschew the irreducibility assumption that has been necessary in other formulations of surgery for CSS codes [Coh+22; Cro+24; ZL24]. As a proof of concept, we develop a surgery protocol inspired by lattice surgery that implements a logical CNOT gate between any two logical qubits. Applicable to any CSS code, this protocol is highly versatile and we argue the fault-tolerance.

Title: Observation of Full Hierarchy of Temporal Quantum Correlations with a Superconducting Qubit
Authors: Hao-Cheng Weng, Chen-Yeh Wei, Huan-Yu Ku, Shin-Liang Chen, Yueh-Nan Chen, Chih-Sung Chuu
Abstract: Temporal quantum correlations provide an intriguing way of testing quantumness at the macroscopic level, with a logical hierarchy present among the quantum correlations associated with nonmacrorealism, temporal steering, and temporal inseparability. By manipulating the dynamics of a superconducting qubit, we observe the full hierarchy of temporal quantum correlations. Moreover, we show that the rich dynamics of the temporal quantum correlations, such as sudden death or revival of temporal steering, provides a useful and unique measure for benchmarking qubits on a realistic circuit. Our work finds applications in identifying the casual structure in a quantum network, the non-Markovianity of open quantum systems, and the security bounds of quantum key distribution. As an example, we demonstrate the non-Markovianity of a single superconducting qubit on the quantum circuit.

Title: Quantifying entanglement from the geometric perspective
Authors: Lisa T. Weinbrenner, Otfried Gühne
Abstract: Quantum entanglement between several particles is essential for applications like quantum metrology or quantum cryptography, but it is also central for foundational phenomena like quantum non-locality. This leads to the problem of quantifying the amount of entanglement in a quantum state. We present a review on the geometric measure of entanglement, being a quantifier based on the distance of a state to the nearest separable state. We explain basic properties, existing methods to compute it, its operational interpretations, as well as scaling and complexity issues. We point out intimate relations to fundamental problems in mathematics concerning eigenvalues and norms of tensors. Consequently, the geometric measure of entanglement provides a playground where physical intuition and mathematical concepts meet and stimulate each other.

Title: Collection of fluorescence from an ion using trap-integrated photonics

Abstract: Spontaneously emitted photons are entangled with the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom of the emitting atom, so interference and measurement of these photons can entangle separate matter-based quantum systems as a resource for quantum information processing. However, the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission hinders the single-mode photonic operations required to generate entanglement. Current demonstrations rely on bulk photon-collection and manipulation optics that suffer from environment-induced phase instability, mode matching challenges, and system-to-system variability, factors that impede scaling to the large numbers of entangled pairs needed for quantum information processing. To address these limitations, we demonstrate a collection method that enables passive phase stability, straightforward photonic manipulation, and intrinsic reproducibility. Specifically, we engineer a waveguide-integrated grating to couple photons emitted from a trapped ion into a single optical mode within a microfabricated ion-trap chip. Using the integrated collection optic, we characterize the collection efficiency, image the ion, and detect the ion's quantum state. This proof-of-principle demonstration lays the foundation for leveraging the inherent stability and reproducibility of integrated photonics to efficiently create, manipulate, and measure multipartite quantum states in arrays of quantum emitters.

Title: Quantum Measurement, Entanglement and the Warping Mechanism of Human Perception
Authors: Diederik Aerts, Jonito Aerts Arguëlles, Sandro Sozzo
Abstract: We prove that the quantum measurement process contains the same warping mechanism that occurs in categorical perception, a phenomenon ubiquitous in human perception. This warping causes stimuli belonging to the same category to be perceived as more similar, while stimuli belonging to different categories are perceived as more different. As a result of a detailed study of the quantum measurement using the Bloch representation, we identify the natural metric for pure states, namely the Fubini Study metric, and the natural metric for density states, namely the trace class metric. The warping mechanism of categorical perception is then manifested, when the distances between pure states, playing the role of stimuli for the quantum measurement, are warped into the distances between density states, playing the role of percepts for quantum measurement. We work out the example of a two-dimensional quantum model, a qubit, with 'light' and 'dark' as the two eigenstates, and show how the typical contraction and dilation warping of human perception manifest themselves in this example of the quantum measurement model of light and dark.

Title: Mutual compatibility/incompatibility of quasi-Hermitian quantum observables
Authors: Miloslav Znojil
Abstract: In the framework of quasi-Hermitian quantum mechanics the eligible operators of observables may be non-Hermitian, $A_j\neq A_j^\dagger$, $j=1,2, \ldots,K$. In principle, the standard probabilistic interpretation of the theory can be re-established via a reconstruction of physical inner-product metric $\Theta\neq I$ guaranteeing the quasi-Hermiticity $A_j^\dagger \,\Theta=\Theta\,A_j$. The task is easy at $K=1$ because there are many eligible metrics $\Theta=\Theta(A_1)$. In our paper the next case with $K=2$ is analyzed. The criteria of the existence of a shared metric $\Theta=\Theta(A_1,A_2)$ are presented and discussed.

Title: Entanglement Maximization and Mirror Symmetry in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models
Authors: Marcela Carena, Guglielmo Coloretti, Wanqiang Liu, Mira Littmann, Ian Low, Carlos E. M. Wagner
Abstract: We consider 2-to-2 scatterings of Higgs bosons in a CP-conserving two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) and study the implication of maximizing the entanglement in the flavor space, where the two doublets $\Phi_a$, $a=1,2$, can be viewed as a qubit: $\Phi_1=|0\rangle$ and $\Phi_2=|1\rangle$. More specifically, we compute the scattering amplitudes for $\Phi_a \Phi_b \to \Phi_c \Phi_d$ and require the outgoing flavor entanglement to be maximal for a full product basis such as the computational basis, which consists of $\{|00\rangle,|01\rangle,|10\rangle,|11\rangle\}$. In the unbroken phase and turning off the gauge interactions, entanglement maximization results in the appearance of an $U(2)\times U(2)$ global symmetry among the quartic couplings, which in general is broken softly by the mass terms. Interestingly, once the Higgs bosons acquire vacuum expectation values, maximal entanglement enforces an exact $U(2) \times U(2)$ symmetry, which is spontaneously broken to $U(1)\times U(1)$. As a byproduct, this gives rise to Higgs alignment as well as to the existence of 6 massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The $U(2)\times U(2)$ symmetry can be gauged to lift the massless Goldstones, while maintaining maximal entanglement demands the presence of a discrete $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry interchanging the two gauge sectors. The model is custodially invariant in the scalar sector, and the inclusion of fermions requires a mirror dark sector, related to the standard one by the $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry.

Title: A sub-volt near-IR lithium tantalate electro-optic modulator
Authors: Keith Powell, Dylan Renaud, Xudong Li, Daniel Assumpcao, C. J. Xin, Neil Sinclair, Marko Lončar
Abstract: We demonstrate a low-loss integrated electro-optic Mach-Zehnder modulator in thin-film lithium tantalate at 737 nm, featuring a low half-wave voltage-length product of 0.65 V$\cdot$cm, an extinction ratio of 30 dB, low optical loss of 5.3 dB, and a detector-limited bandwidth of 20 GHz. A small $<2$ dB DC bias drift relative to quadrature bias is measured over 16 minutes using 4.3 dBm of on-chip power in ambient conditions, which outperforms the 8 dB measured using a counterpart thin-film lithium niobate modulator. Finally, an optical loss coefficient of 0.5 dB/cm for a thin-film lithium tantalate waveguide is estimated at 638 nm using a fabricated ring resonator.

Title: TunnElQNN: A Hybrid Quantum-classical Neural Network for Efficient Learning
Authors: A. H. Abbas
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) represent a promising frontier in machine learning, leveraging the complementary strengths of both models. In this work, we propose the development of TunnElQNN, a non-sequential architecture composed of alternating classical and quantum layers. Within the classical component, we employ the Tunnelling Diode Activation Function (TDAF), inspired by the I-V characteristics of quantum tunnelling. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid model on a synthetic dataset of interleaving half-circle for multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of class overlap. The model is compared against a baseline hybrid architecture that uses the conventional ReLU activation function (ReLUQNN). Our results show that the TunnElQNN model consistently outperforms the ReLUQNN counterpart. Furthermore, we analyse the decision boundaries generated by TunnElQNN under different levels of class overlap and compare them to those produced by a neural network implementing TDAF within a fully classical architecture. These findings highlight the potential of integrating physics-inspired activation functions with quantum components to enhance the expressiveness and robustness of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning architectures.

Title: Quasi-local Frustration-Free Free Fermions
Authors: Shunsuke Sengoku, Hoi Chun Po, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that frustration-free models, expressed as sums of finite-range interactions or hoppings, exhibit several properties markedly different from those of frustrated models. In this work, we demonstrate that, by relaxing the finite-range condition to allow for exponentially decaying hoppings, one can build gapped frustration-free systems that realize Chern insulators as well as quasi-degenerate ground states with finite-size splittings. Moreover, by permitting power-law decaying hoppings, we also construct a gapless band metal whose finite-size gap scales inversely with the system size $L$. These findings serve as an important step toward clarifying the general properties of frustration-free systems and those represented by tensor network states.

Title: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation of a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system
Authors: Kwang Hyun Cho, Hyukjoon Kwon, Changbong Hyeon
Abstract: The minimal bound of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is modulated from that of the classical counterpart ($\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}=2$) when a quantumness is present in the dynamical process far from equilibrium. A recent study on a dissipative two-level system (TLS) subject to an external field indicates that quantum coherences can suppress the fluctuations of the irreversible current and loosens the TUR bound to $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$. Here, we extend on the field-driven single TLS to a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system (TQS), and explore, in addition to the single qubit coherence, how the quantum coupling between the two qubits affects the photon current, fluctuations, and the TUR bound. We find that the TUR bound of TQS depends on the strength of coupling, such that $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}=\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$ when the two qubits are effectively decoupled under weak coupling, whereas another loose bound $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}\approx 1.36$ is identified for two strongly coupled qubits under strong fields. By contrasting the TQS against two coupled noisy oscillators, we illuminate the quantumness unique to the TQS and its effect on the TUR.

Title: Distributed Quantum Circuit Cutting for Hybrid Quantum-Classical High-Performance Computing
Authors: Mar Tejedor, Berta Casas, Javier Conejero, Alba Cervera-Lierta, Rosa M. Badia
Abstract: Most quantum computers today are constrained by hardware limitations, particularly the number of available qubits, causing significant challenges for executing large-scale quantum algorithms. Circuit cutting has emerged as a key technique to overcome these limitations by decomposing large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits that can be executed independently and later reconstructed. In this work, we introduce Qdislib, a distributed and flexible library for quantum circuit cutting, designed to seamlessly integrate with hybrid quantum-classical high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Qdislib employs a graph-based representation of quantum circuits to enable efficient partitioning, manipulation and execution, supporting both wire cutting and gate cutting techniques. The library is compatible with multiple quantum computing libraries, including Qiskit and Qibo, and leverages distributed computing frameworks to execute subcircuits across CPUs, GPUs, and quantum processing units (QPUs) in a fully parallelized manner. We present a proof of concept demonstrating how Qdislib enables the distributed execution of quantum circuits across heterogeneous computing resources, showcasing its potential for scalable quantum-classical workflows.

Title: Higher-Order Spectra and their Unbiased Estimation in the GPU-accelerated SignalSnap Library
Authors: Markus Sifft, Armin Ghorbanietemad, Fabian Wagner, Daniel Hägele
Abstract: The analysis of time-dependent data poses a fundamental challenge in many fields of science and engineering. While concepts for higher-order spectral analysis like Brillinger's polyspectra for stationary processes have long been introduced, their applications have been limited probably due to high computational cost and complexity of implementation. Here we discuss the theoretical background of estimating polyspectra with our open-source GPU-accelerated SignaSnap library and highlight its advantages over previous implementations: (i) The calculation of spectra is unprecedentedly based on unbiased and consistent estimators that suppress the appearance of false structures in fourth-order spectra. (ii) SignalSnap implements cross-correlation spectra for up to four channels. (iii) The spectral estimates of SignalSnap have a clear relation to Brillinger's definition of ideal spectra of continuous stochastic processes in terms of amplitude and spectral resolution. (iv) SignalSnap estimates the variance of each spectral value. We show how polyspectra reveal, e.g., the correlations between different channels or the breaking of time-inversion symmetry and discuss how quasi-polyspectra uncover the non-stationarity of signals.

Title: $η$ regularisation and the functional measure
Authors: Robert G. C. Smith, Murdock Grewar
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.

Title: QCMaquis 4.0: Multi-Purpose Electronic, Vibrational, and Vibronic Structure and Dynamics Calculations with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group
Authors: Kalman Szenes, Nina Glaser, Mihael Erakovic, Valentin Barandun, Maximilian Mörchen, Robin Feldmann, Stefano Battaglia, Alberto Baiardi, Markus Reiher
Abstract: QCMaquis is a quantum chemistry software package for general molecular structure calculations in a matrix product state/matrix product operator formalism of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). It supports a wide range of features for electronic structure, multi-component (pre-Born-Oppenheimer), anharmonic vibrational structure, and vibronic calculations. In addition to the ground and excited state solvers, QCMaquis allows for time propagation of matrix product states based on the tangent-space formulation of time-dependent DMRG. The latest developments include transcorrelated electronic structure calculations, very recent vibrational and vibronic models, and a convenient Python wrapper, facilitating the interface with external libraries. This paper reviews all the new features of QCMaquis and demonstrates them with new results.

Title: Bright and Dark States of Light: The quantum Origin of Classical Interference
Authors: Celso J. Villas-Boas, Carlos E. Máximo, Paulo J. Paulino, Romain P. Bachelard, Gerhard Rempe
Abstract: Classical theory asserts that several electromagnetic waves cannot interact with matter if they interfere destructively to zero, whereas quantum mechanics predicts a nontrivial light-matter dynamics even when the average electric field vanishes. Here we show that in quantum optics classical interference emerges from collective bright and dark states of light, \textit{i.e.}, entangled superpositions of multi-mode photon-number states. This makes it possible to explain wave interference using the particle description of light and the superposition principle for linear systems.

Title: A Quadratic Speedup in Finding Nash Equilibria of Quantum Zero-Sum Games
Authors: Francisca Vasconcelos, Emmanouil-Vasileios Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis, Panayotis Mertikopoulos, Georgios Piliouras, Michael I. Jordan
Abstract: Recent developments in domains such as non-local games, quantum interactive proofs, and quantum generative adversarial networks have renewed interest in quantum game theory and, specifically, quantum zero-sum games. Central to classical game theory is the efficient algorithmic computation of Nash equilibria, which represent optimal strategies for both players. In 2008, Jain and Watrous proposed the first classical algorithm for computing equilibria in quantum zero-sum games using the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Updates (MMWU) method to achieve a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon^2)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in the $4^d$-dimensional spectraplex. In this work, we propose a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that generalize MMWU via an extra-gradient mechanism. Notably, within this proposed hierarchy, we introduce the Optimistic Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update (OMMWU) algorithm and establish its average-iterate convergence complexity as $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. This quadratic speed-up relative to Jain and Watrous' original algorithm sets a new benchmark for computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in quantum zero-sum games.

Title: Confinement-Induced Resonances in Spherical Shell Traps
Authors: C. Moritz Carmesin, Maxim A. Efremov
Abstract: The energy spectrum and corresponding wave functions of two bosonic particles confined in a spherically symmetric shell trap and interacting via a three-dimensional zero-range potential are computed. Confinement-induced resonances, originating entirely from the strong coupling of the relative and center-of-mass motions of the two particles, are identified as avoided crossings for certain values of the shell radius. By working close to the found resonances, these results offer a new way to control the atom-atom interaction in an atomic gas by tuning only the geometrical parameters of the shell.

Title: Memory attacks in network nonlocality and self-testing
Authors: Mirjam Weilenmann, Costantino Budroni, Miguel Navascues
Abstract: We study what can or cannot be certified in communication scenarios where the assumption of independence and identical distribution (iid) between experimental rounds fails. In this respect, we prove that membership tests for non-convex sets of correlations cannot be formulated in the non-iid regime. Similarly, it is impossible to self-test non-extreme quantum operations, such as mixed states, or noisy quantum measurements, unless one allows more than a single use thereof within the same experimental round. One consequence of our results is that non-classicality in causal networks without inputs cannot be experimentally demonstrated. By analyzing optimal non-iid strategies in the triangle scenario, we raise the need to take into account the prior communication required to set up a causal network.

Title: An Effective Way to Determine the Separability of Quantum State
Authors: Ma-Cheng Yang, Cong-Feng Qiao
Abstract: We propose in this work a practical approach to address the longstanding and challenging problem of quantum separability, leveraging the correlation matrices of generic observables. General separability conditions are obtained by dint of constructing the measurement-induced Bloch space, which in essence come from the intrinsic constraints in the space of quantum state. The novel approach can not only reproduce various established entanglement criteria, it may as well brings about some new results, possessing obvious advantages for certain bound entangled states and the high dimensional Werner states. Moreover, it is found that criteria obtained in our approach can be directly transformed into entanglement witness operators.

Title: Bounding the rotating wave approximation for coupled harmonic oscillators
Authors: Tim Heib, Paul Lageyre, Alessandro Ferreri, Frank K. Wilhelm, G.S. Paraoanu, Daniel Burgarth, Andreas Wolfgang Schell, David Edward Bruschi
Abstract: In this work we study the validity of the rotating wave approximation of an ideal system composed of two harmonic oscillators evolving with a quadratic Hamiltonian and arbitrarily strong interaction. We prove its validity for arbitrary states by bounding the error introduced. We then restrict ourselves to the dynamics of Gaussian states and are able to fully quantify the deviation of arbitrary pure Gaussian states that evolve through different dynamics from a common quantum state. We show that this distance is fully determined by the first and second moments of the statistical distribution of the number of excitations created from the vacuum during an appropriate effective time-evolution. We use these results to completely control the dynamics for this class of states, therefore providing a toolbox to be used in quantum optics and quantum information. Applications and potential physical implementations are also discussed.

Title: Unveiling quantum phase transitions from traps in variational quantum algorithms
Authors: Chenfeng Cao, Filippo Maria Gambetta, Ashley Montanaro, Raul A. Santos
Abstract: Understanding quantum phase transitions in physical systems is fundamental to characterize their behavior at low temperatures. Achieving this requires both accessing good approximations to the ground state and identifying order parameters to distinguish different phases. Addressing these challenges, our work introduces a hybrid algorithm that combines quantum optimization with classical machine learning. This approach leverages the capability of near-term quantum computers to prepare locally trapped states through finite optimization. Specifically, we apply LASSO for identifying conventional phase transitions and the Transformer model for topological transitions, utilizing these with a sliding window scan of Hamiltonian parameters to learn appropriate order parameters and locate critical points. We validated the method with numerical simulations and real-hardware experiments on Rigetti's Ankaa 9Q-1 quantum computer. This protocol provides a framework for investigating quantum phase transitions with shallow circuits, offering enhanced efficiency and, in some settings, higher precision-thus contributing to the broader effort to integrate near-term quantum computing and machine learning.

Title: Exponential Quantum Advantage for Pathfinding in Regular Sunflower Graphs
Authors: Jianqiang Li, Yu Tong
Abstract: Finding problems that allow for superpolynomial quantum speedup is one of the most important tasks in quantum computation. A key challenge is identifying problem structures that can only be exploited by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we find a class of graphs that allows for exponential quantum-classical separation for the pathfinding problem with the adjacency list oracle, and this class of graphs is named regular sunflower graphs. We prove that, with high probability, a regular sunflower graph of degree at least $7$ is a mild expander graph, that is, the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian is at least inverse polylogarithmic in the graph size. We provide an efficient quantum algorithm to find an $s$-$t$ path in the regular sunflower graph while any classical algorithm takes exponential time. This quantum advantage is achieved by efficiently preparing a $0$-eigenstate of the adjacency matrix of the regular sunflower graph as a quantum superposition state over the vertices, and this quantum state contains enough information to help us efficiently find an $s$-$t$ path in the regular sunflower graph. Because the security of an isogeny-based cryptosystem depends on the hardness of finding an $s$-$t$ path in an expander graph \cite{Charles2009}, a quantum speedup of the pathfinding problem on an expander graph is of significance. Our result represents a step towards this goal as the first provable exponential speedup for pathfinding in a mild expander graph.

Title: Effects of retardation on many-body superradiance in chiral waveguide QED
Authors: Bennet Windt, Miguel Bello, Daniel Malz, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: We study the superradiant decay of a chain of atoms coupled to a chiral waveguide, focusing on the regime of non-negligible photon propagation time. Using an exact master equation description which accounts for delay effects, we obtain evidence to suggest that competition between collective decay and retardation leads to the emergence of an effective maximum number of atoms able to contribute to the superradiant dynamics, resulting in a plateau of the peak emission rate. To develop this analysis further, we investigate the inter-atomic correlations to find features consistent with the formation of individual superradiant domains. Moreover, we find that retardation can also result in persistent oscillatory atomic dynamics accompanied by a periodic sequence of emission bursts.

Title: Anomalous radiation reaction in a circularly polarized field
Authors: O. V. Kibis
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics in a circularly polarized electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron rotating under the field leads to the quantum recoil force acting on the electron perpendicularly to the velocity of its forward movement, which differs crucially from the known classical recoil force directed oppositely to the velocity. Physically, such an anomalous radiation reaction arises from the one-loop QED correction to the photon emission and has no analog within the classical electrodynamics. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for electrons in strong laser fields.

Title: Quantifying nonclassical correlation via the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information
Authors: Yan Hong, Xinlan Hao, Limin Gao
Abstract: Nonclassical correlation is an important concept in quantum information theory, referring to a special type of correlation that exists between quantum systems, which surpasses the scope of classical physics. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a family of information with important properties, namely the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information, of which the famous quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information are special cases. We classify the local observables into two categories (i.e., orthonormal bases and Hermitian operators with a fixed nondegenerate spectrum), and based on this, we propose several indicators to quantify nonclassical correlation of bipartite quantum states. We have not only investigated some important properties of these indicators but also illustrated through specific examples that they can indeed capture nonclassical correlation. Furthermore, we find that these indicators reduce to entanglement measure for bipartite pure states. Specifically, we also derive the relationship between these indicators and the entanglement measure known as $I$-concurrence.

Title: Estimates of loss function concentration in noisy parametrized quantum circuits
Authors: Giulio Crognaletti, Michele Grossi, Angelo Bassi
Abstract: Variational quantum computing offers a powerful framework with applications across diverse fields such as quantum chemistry, machine learning, and optimization. However, its scalability is hindered by the exponential concentration of the loss function, known as the barren plateau problem. While significant progress has been made and prior work has separately analyzed barren plateaus in unitary and noisy settings, their combined impact remains poorly understood, largely due to limitations in conventional Lie-algebraic approaches. In this work, we introduce a novel analytical framework based on non-negative matrix theory that enables the description of the variance in layered noisy quantum circuits with arbitrary noise channels. This approach enables the derivation of exact expressions in the deep-circuit regime, uncovering the complex interplay between unitary layers and noise. Notably, we identify a noise-induced absorption mechanism-a phenomenon absent in purely unitary dynamics-which provides new insight into how noise shapes circuit behavior. We further present a controlled convergence analysis, establishing general lower bounds on the variance of both deep and shallow circuits. This leads to a principled connection between noise resilience and the expressive capacity of parameterized quantum circuits, particularly under smart initialization strategies. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations and illustrative applications.

Title: Substantial precision enhancements via adaptive symmetry-informed Bayesian metrology
Authors: Matt Overton, Jesús Rubio, Nathan Cooper, Daniele Baldolini, David Johnson, Janet Anders, Lucia Hackermüller
Abstract: Precision measurements are essential for addressing major challenges, ranging from gravitational wave detection to healthcare diagnostics. While quantum sensing experiments are constantly improving to deliver greater precision, the in-depth optimisation of measurement procedures beyond phase estimation has been overlooked. Here we present a systematic strategy for parameter estimation that can be applied across a wide range of experimental platforms operating in the low data limit. Its strength is the inclusion of experimental control parameters, which allows optimisation within a Bayesian procedure and adaptive repetition. We provide general expressions for the optimal estimator and error for any parameter amenable to symmetry-informed strategies. We demonstrate the power of this strategy by applying it to atom number estimation in a quantum technology experiment. Our protocol results in a five-fold reduction in the fractional variance of the atom number estimate compared to a standard, unoptimized protocol. Equivalently, it achieves the target precision with a third of the data points previously required. The enhanced device performance and accelerated data collection achieved with this Bayesian optimised strategy will be essential for applications in quantum computing, communication, metrology, and the wider quantum technology sector.

Title: Machine Learning approach to reconstruct Density Matrices from Quantum Marginals
Authors: Daniel Uzcategui-Contreras, Antonio Guerra, Sebastian Niklitschek, Aldo Delgado
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Machine Learning-based approach to address a specific aspect of the Quantum Marginal problem: finding a global density matrix that is compatible with a given set of quantum marginals. Our method combines a quantum marginal imposition technique with convolutional denoising autoencoders. The loss function is carefully designed to ensure that the output density matrix satisfies key properties such as hermiticity, positivity, and normalization. Through extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a high success rate and accuracy. Additionally, our model can serve as an initial guess generator for solving semidefinite programs related to the Quantum Marginal problem, potentially accelerating convergence and improving accuracy. This work underscores the potential of Machine Learning techniques in tackling complex problems in quantum mechanics.

Title: Subsystem Evolution Speed as Indicator of Relaxation
Authors: Jiaju Zhang, M. A. Rajabpour, Markus Heyl, Reyhaneh Khasseh
Abstract: In studying the time evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems, a key focus is determining whether the system undergoes relaxation and reaches a steady state at a given point in time. Traditional approaches often rely on specific local operators or a detailed understanding of the stationary state. In this letter, we introduce an alternative method that assesses relaxation directly from the time-dependent state by focusing on the evolution speed of the subsystem. The proposed indicator evaluates the rate of change in the reduced density matrix of the subsystem over time. We demonstrate that in systems reaching relaxation, as the overall system size increases, the evolution speed of sufficiently small yet still finite-sized subsystems notably diminishes. This leads to small fluctuations in the expectation values of operators, which is also consistent with the predictions made by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We apply this approach across various models, including the chaotic Ising chain, XXZ chains with and without many-body localization, and the transverse field Ising chain. Our results confirm the robustness and accuracy of subsystem evolution speed as a reliable indicator for relaxation.

Title: Reinforcement learning with learned gadgets to tackle hard quantum problems on real hardware
Authors: Akash Kundu, Leopoldo Sarra
Abstract: Designing quantum circuits for specific tasks is challenging due to the exponential growth of the state space. We introduce gadget reinforcement learning (GRL), which integrates reinforcement learning with program synthesis to automatically generate and incorporate composite gates (gadgets) into the action space. This enhances the exploration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for complex tasks like approximating ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, an NP-hard problem. We evaluate GRL using the transverse field Ising model under typical computational budgets (e.g., 2- 3 days of GPU runtime). Our results show improved accuracy, hardware compatibility and scalability. GRL exhibits robust performance as the size and complexity of the problem increases, even with constrained computational resources. By integrating gadget extraction, GRL facilitates the discovery of reusable circuit components tailored for specific hardware, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and practical implementation. This makes GRL a versatile framework for optimizing quantum circuits with applications in hardware-specific optimizations and variational quantum algorithms. The code is available at: this https URL

Title: Bayesian and frequentist estimators for the transition frequency of a driven two-level quantum system
Authors: Chun Kit Dennis Law, József Zsolt Bernád
Abstract: The formalism of quantum estimation theory with a specific focus on classical data postprocessing is applied to a two-level system driven by an external gyrating magnetic field. We employed both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to estimate the unknown transition frequency. In the frequentist approach, we have shown that only reducing the distance between the classical and the quantum Fisher information does not necessarily mean that the estimators as functions of the data deliver an estimate with desirable accuracy, as the classical Fisher information takes small values. We have proposed and investigated a cost function to account for the maximization of the classical Fisher information and the minimization of the aforementioned distance. Due to the nonlinearity of the probability mass function of the data on the transition frequency, the minimum variance unbiased estimator may not exist. The maximum likelihood and the maximum a posteriori estimators often result in ambiguous estimates, which in certain cases can be made unambiguous upon changing the parameters of the external field. It is demonstrated that the minimum mean-square error estimator of the Bayesian statistics provides unambiguous estimates. In the Bayesian approach, we have also investigated the effects of noninformative and informative priors on the Bayesian estimates, including a uniform prior, Jeffrey's prior, and a Gaussian prior.

Title: Efficient Protein Ground State Energy Computation via Fragmentation and Reassembly
Authors: Laia Coronas Sala (1), Parfait Atchade-Adelemou (1 and 2) ((1) Lighthouse Disruptive Innovation Group S.L., (2) MIT Media Lab)
Abstract: Protein characterization is one of the key components for understanding the human body and advancing drug discovery processes. While the future of quantum hardware holds the potential to accurately characterize these molecules, current efforts focus on developing strategies to fragment larger molecules into computationally manageable subsystems. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to enable quantum simulation using existing quantum algorithms. Our approach involves fragmenting proteins into their corresponding amino acids, simulating them independently, and then reassembling them post-simulation while applying chemical corrections. This methodology demonstrates its accuracy by calculating the ground state energy of relatively small peptides through reassembling, achieving a mean relative error of only $0.00469 \pm 0.01071\%$. Future directions include investigating, with larger quantum computers, whether this approach remains valid for larger proteins.

Title: Operator Spreading in Random Unitary Circuits with Unitary-invariant Gate Distributions
Authors: Zhiyang Tan, Piet W. Brouwer
Abstract: Random unitary circuits have become a model system to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. In the literature, mostly random circuits with Haar-distributed gate operations have been considered. In this work, we investigate operator spreading in random unitary circuits in which the elementary gate operations are drawn from general unitary-invariant ensembles, which include the well-studied Haar-distributed random unitary circuits as a special case. Similar to the Haar-distributed case, the long-time behavior of operator spreading with the more general unitary-invariant gate distribution is governed by drift-diffusion equations characterized by the butterfly velocity $v_{\rm B}$ and a diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}$. Differences with the Haar-random case are (i) that it takes a finite time $\tau_{\rm b}$ until ensemble-averaged Pauli-string weights take a ``binary'' form, in which they depend only on whether Pauli operators inside the support of the Pauli strong are equal to the identity matrix, and (ii) that the operator spreading is characterized by a finite ``domain-wall width'' $n_{\rm DW}$ separating regions with a random-matrix-like Pauli-string distribution. To illustrate these findings, we perform explicit calculations for random unitary circuits distributed according to the Poisson kernel, which interpolates between the trivial and Haar-distributed circuits.

Title: Repeated Interaction Scheme for the Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Electron Transfer Dynamics
Authors: Lea K. Northcote, Matthew S. Teynor, Gemma C. Solomon
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of open quantum systems in chemistry. In this work, we demonstrate that a repeated interaction model, which could serve as the foundation for a digital quantum algorithm, can effectively reproduce non-Markovian electron transfer dynamics under four different donor-acceptor parameter regimes and for a donor-bridge-acceptor system. We systematically explore how the model scales for the regimes. Notably, our approach exhibits favorable scaling in the required repeated interaction duration as the electronic coupling, temperature, damping rate, and system size increase. Furthermore, a single Trotter step per repeated interaction leads to an acceptably small error, and high-fidelity initial states can be prepared with a short time evolution. This efficiency highlights the potential of the model for tackling increasingly complex systems. When fault-tolerant quantum hardware becomes available, algorithms based on this model could be extended to incorporate structured baths, additional energy levels, or more intricate coupling schemes, enabling the simulation of real-world open quantum systems that remain beyond the reach of classical computation.

Title: Quantum Electrodynamics from Quantum Cellular Automata, and the Tension Between Symmetry, Locality and Positive Energy
Authors: Todd A. Brun, Leonard Mlodinow
Abstract: We show that free QED is equivalent to the continuous-space-and-time limit of Fermi and Bose lattice quantum cellular automata theories derived from quantum random walks satisfying simple symmetry and unitarity conditions. In doing so we define the Fermi and Bose theories in a unified manner using the usual fermion internal space but a boson internal space that is six-dimensional. We show that the reduction to a two-dimensional boson internal space (two helicity states arising from spin-1 plus the photon transversality condition) comes from restricting the quantum cellular automaton theory to positive energies. We briefly examine common symmetries of quantum cellular automata, and how time-reversal symmetry demands the existence of negative-energy solutions. These solutions produce a tension in coupling the Fermi and Bose theories, in which the strong locality of quantum cellular automata seems to require a nonzero amplitude to produce negative-energy states, leading to an unphysical cascade of negative-energy particles. However, we show in a 1D model that by extending interactions over a larger (but finite) range it is possible to exponentially suppress the production of negative-energy particles to the point where they can be neglected.

Title: Bridging wire and gate cutting with ZX-calculus
Authors: Marco Schumann, Tobias Stollenwerk, Alessandro Ciani
Abstract: Quantum circuit cutting refers to a series of techniques that allow one to partition a quantum computation on a large quantum computer into several quantum computations on smaller devices. This usually comes at the price of a sampling overhead, that is quantified by the $1$-norm of the associated decomposition. The applicability of these techniques relies on the possibility of finding decompositions of the ideal, global unitaries into quantum operations that can be simulated onto each sub-register, which should ideally minimize the $1$-norm. In this work, we show how these decompositions can be obtained diagrammatically using ZX-calculus expanding on the work of Ufrecht et al. [arXiv:2302.00387]. The central idea of our work is that since in ZX-calculus only connectivity matters, it should be possible to cut wires in ZX-diagrams by inserting known decompositions of the identity in standard quantum circuits. We show how, using this basic idea, many of the gate decompositions known in the literature can be re-interpreted as an instance of wire cuts in ZX-diagrams. Furthermore, we obtain improved decompositions for multi-qubit controlled-Z (MCZ) gates with $1$-norm equal to $3$ for any number of qubits and any partition, which we argue to be optimal. Our work gives new ways of thinking about circuit cutting that can be particularly valuable for finding decompositions of large unitary gates. Besides, it sheds light on the question of why exploiting classical communication decreases the 1-norm of a wire cut but does not do so for certain gate decompositions. In particular, using wire cuts with classical communication, we obtain gate decompositions that do not require classical communication.

Title: Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations
Authors: Angel Ballesteros, Diego Fernandez-Silvestre, Flaminia Giacomini, Giulia Gubitosi
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.

Title: Cavity-enhanced spectroscopy of individual nuclear spins in a dense bath
Authors: Alexander Ulanowski, Olivier Kuijpers, Benjamin Merkel, Adrian Holzäpfel, Andreas Reiserer
Abstract: Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids.

Title: Quantum State Design and Emergent Confinement Mechanism in Measured Tensor Network States
Authors: Guglielmo Lami, Andrea De Luca, Xhek Turkeshi, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: Randomness is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, arising from the measurement process that collapses superpositions into definite outcomes according to Born's rule. Generating large-scale random quantum states is crucial for quantum computing and many-body physics, yet remains a key challenge. We present a practical method based on local measurements of random Tensor Networks, focusing on random Matrix Product States (MPS) generated by two distinct quantum circuit architectures, both feasible on near-term devices. We certify the emergent quantum randomness using the frame potential and establish a mapping between its behavior and the statistical mechanics of a domain wall particle model. In both architectures, the effect of quantum measurements induces a nontrivial confinement mechanism, where domain walls are either trapped by an external potential or bound in pairs to form meson-like excitations. Our results, supported by both exact analytical calculations and numerical simulations, suggest that confinement is a general mechanism underlying random state generation in broader settings with local measurements, including quantum circuits and chaotic dynamics.

Title: Controlled quantum secure remote sensing
Authors: Muhammad Talha Rahim, Saif Al-Kuwari, Mahmood Irtiza Hussain, Asad Ali
Abstract: Quantum resources enable secure quantum sensing (SQS) of remote systems, offering significant advantages in precision and security. However, decoherence in the quantum communication channel and during the evolution of quantum states can erode these advantages. In this work, we first propose a general $N-$particle scheme that achieves Heisenberg-limited (HL) scaling for single-parameter estimation in the presence of an ideal quantum communication channel and encoding scenario. For non-ideal dynamics, we introduce a modified protocol incorporating local quantum optimal control (QOC) operations to address noise in SQS under generalized Pauli dephasing and parallel dephasing noise. We analyze two distinct scenarios: a noiseless communication channel with noisy evolution, and a noisy communication channel with noisy evolution. For the noisy channel, we model the link between the communicating parties as a depolarizing channel. The protocol leverages QOC operations to actively mitigate noise, enhancing the achievable quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the classical Fisher information (CFI) based on the chosen measurement strategy.

Title: Provably faster randomized and quantum algorithms for $k$-means clustering via uniform sampling
Authors: Tyler Chen, Archan Ray, Akshay Seshadri, Dylan Herman, Bao Bach, Pranav Deshpande, Abhishek Som, Niraj Kumar, Marco Pistoia
Abstract: The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [$q$-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning; Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We prove worse-case guarantees that significantly improve upon the bounds for previous algorithms. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.

Title: Faster Quantum Algorithm for Multiple Observables Estimation in Fermionic Problems
Authors: Yuki Koizumi, Kaito Wada, Wataru Mizukami, Nobuyuki Yoshioka
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in efficiently estimating collective properties of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental goal in quantum computing. While the quantum gradient estimation (QGE) algorithm has been shown to achieve doubly quantum enhancement in the precision and the number of observables, it remains unclear whether one benefits in practical applications. In this work, we present a generalized framework of adaptive QGE algorithm, and further propose two variants which enable us to estimate the collective properties of fermionic systems using the smallest cost among existing quantum algorithms. The first method utilizes the symmetry inherent in the target state, and the second method enables estimation in a single-shot manner using the parallel scheme. We show that our proposal offers a quadratic speedup compared with prior QGE algorithms in the task of fermionic partial tomography for systems with limited particle numbers. Furthermore, we provide the numerical demonstration that, for a problem of estimating fermionic 2-RDMs, our proposals improve the number of queries to the target state preparation oracle by a factor of 100 for the nitrogenase FeMo cofactor and by a factor of 500 for Fermi-Hubbard model of 100 sites.

Title: Comprehensive Study on Heisenberg-limited Quantum Algorithms for Multiple Observables Estimation
Authors: Yuki Koizumi, Kaito Wada, Wataru Mizukami, Nobuyuki Yoshioka
Abstract: In the accompanying paper of arXiv:2505.00697, we have presented a generalized scheme of adaptive quantum gradient estimation (QGE) algorithm, and further proposed two practical variants which not only achieve doubly quantum enhancement in query complexity regarding estimation precision and number of observables, but also enable minimal cost to estimate $k$-RDMs in fermionic systems among existing quantum algorithms. Here, we provide full descriptions on the algorithm, and provide theoretical guarantee for the estimation precision in terms of the root mean squared error. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, another variant of the Heisenberg-limited scaling algorithm, and show how the estimation error is minimized under the circuit structure that resembles the phase estimation algorithm. We finally describe the details for the numerical evaluation of the query complexity of the Heisenberg-limited algorithms and sampling-based methods to make a thorough comparison in the task of estimating fermionic $k$-RDMs.

Title: Topology-induced symmetry breaking demonstrated in antiferromagnetic magnons on a Möbius strip
Authors: Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is explicitly broken in the eigenmodes of excitation due to nontrivial real-space topology. We demonstrate this phenomenon by studying magnonic excitations on a Möbius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even with a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and all local curvature effects ignored, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the Néel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be globally decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons. Correspondingly, one branch undergoes a spectral shift and only admits standing waves of half-integer wavelength, whereas the other only affords standing waves of integer wavelength. Under the Möbius boundary condition, we further identify an exotic phase hosting spontaneous antiferromagnetic order whilst all exchange couplings are ferromagnetic. The suppression of chirality in the order parameter dynamics, hence the pattern of standing waves, can be generalized to other elementary excitations on non-orientable surfaces. Our findings showcase the profound influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of not just the ground state but also the quasiparticles.

Title: On Reducing the Execution Latency of Superconducting Quantum Processors via Quantum Job Scheduling
Authors: Wenjie Wu, Yiquan Wang, Ge Yan, Yuming Zhao, Bo Zhang, Junchi Yan
Abstract: Quantum computing has gained considerable attention, especially after the arrival of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Quantum processors and cloud services have been made world-wide increasingly available. Unfortunately, jobs on existing quantum processors are often executed in series, and the workload could be heavy to the processor. Typically, one has to wait for hours or even longer to obtain the result of a single quantum job on public quantum cloud due to long queue time. In fact, as the scale grows, the qubit utilization rate of the serial execution mode will further diminish, causing the waste of quantum resources. In this paper, to our best knowledge for the first time, the Quantum Job Scheduling Problem (QJSP) is formulated and introduced, and we accordingly aim to improve the utility efficiency of quantum resources. Specifically, a noise-aware quantum job scheduler (NAQJS) concerning the circuit width, number of measurement shots, and submission time of quantum jobs is proposed to reduce the execution latency. We conduct extensive experiments on a simulated Qiskit noise model, as well as on the Xiaohong (from QuantumCTek) superconducting quantum processor. Numerical results show the effectiveness in both the QPU time and turnaround time.

Title: Truncated Gaussian basis approach for simulating many-body dynamics
Authors: Nico Albert, Yueshui Zhang, Hong-Hao Tu
Abstract: We propose a Truncated Gaussian Basis Approach (TGBA) for simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. The approach constructs an effective Hamiltonian within a reduced subspace, spanned by fermionic Gaussian states, and diagonalizes it to obtain approximate eigenstates and eigenenergies. Symmetries can be exploited to perform parallel computation, enabling to simulate systems with much larger sizes. As an example, we compute the dynamic structure factor and study quench dynamics in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain, known as ``$E_8$ magnet''. The mass ratios calculated through the dynamic structure factor show excellent agreement with Zamolodchikov's analytical predictions. For quench dynamics we observe that time-evolving wave functions in the truncated subspace facilitates the simulation of long-time dynamics.

Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.

Title: Bright and Purcell-enhanced single photon emission from a silicon G center
Authors: Kyu-Young Kim, Chang-Min Lee, Amirehsan Boreiri, Purbita Purkayastha, Fariba Islam, Samuel Harper, Je-Hyung Kim, Edo Waks
Abstract: Silicon G centers show significant promise as single photon sources in a scalable silicon platform. But these color centers have large non-radiative decay and a low Debye-Waller factor, limiting their usability in quantum applications. In this work, we demonstrate bright Purcell-enhanced emission from a silicon G center by coupling it to a nanophotonic cavity. The nanobeam cavity enhances the spontaneous emission rate of a single G center by a factor of 6, corresponding to a Purcell factor greater than 31 when accounting for decay into the phonon sideband. We obtain a spontaneous emission rate of 0.97 ns, which is the fastest single photon emission rate reported in silicon. With this radiative enhancement, we achieve an order of magnitude improvement in emitter brightness compared to previously reported values. These results pave the way for scalable quantum light sources on a silicon photonic chip.

Title: Manifestations of chaos in billiards: the role of mixed curvature
Authors: Pranaya Pratik Das, Tanmayee Patra, Biplab Ganguli
Abstract: The boundary of a billiard system plays a crucial role in shaping its dynamics, which may be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. When a boundary has varying curvature, it offers a unique setting to study the relation between classical chaos and quantum behaviour. In this study, we introduce two geometrically distinct billiards: a bean-shaped boundary and a peanut-shaped variant of Cassini ovals. These systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing walls with no neutral segments. Our study reveals a strong correlation between classical and quantum dynamics. Our analysis of billiard flow diagrams confirms sensitivity to initial conditions(ICs)- a defining feature of chaos. Poincaré maps further show the phase space intricately woven with regions of chaotic motion and stability islands. Moving to the quantum domain, we employ nearest-neighbour spacing distribution and level spacing ratio as statistical measures to characterise chaos. Early time saturation in spectral complexity also supports an ergodic hierarchy in these systems. We observe a striking quantum phenomenon, i.e. eigenfunction scarring. This work bridges geometric boundary effects, classical hyperbolicity, and quantum ergodicity, offering a framework to engineer chaos in confined systems.

Title: Generation of photon pairs through spontaneous four-wave mixing in subwavelength nonlinear films
Authors: Changjin Son, Samuel Peana, Owen Matthiessen, Artem Kryvobok, Alexander Senichev, Alexandra Boltasseva, Vladimir M. Shalaev, Maria Chekhova
Abstract: Pairs of entangled photons are crucial for photonic quantum technologies. The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs. Despite the success in the demonstration of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, there are almost no works on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) - an alternative process to generate photon pairs. Meanwhile, SFWM can be implemented in any nanostructures, including ones made of isotropic materials, which are easier to fabricate than crystalline SPDC sources. Here, we investigate photon pair generation through SFWM in subwavelength films of amorphous silicon nitride (SiN) with varying nitrogen content. For all samples, we demonstrate two-photon quantum correlations, indicated by the normalized second-order correlation function g(2)(0): it exceeds 2 and decays as the pump power increases. By observing two-photon interference between SFWM from the SiN films and the fused silica substrate, we find the third-order susceptibilities of films with different nitrogen content.

Title: Accurate Modeling of Directional Couplers with Oxide Cladding: Bridging Simulation and Experiment
Authors: Yuval Warshavsky, Yehonathan Drori, Jonatan Piasetzky, Amit Rotem, Ofer Shapiro, Yaron Oz, Haim Suchowski
Abstract: Directional couplers are a fundamental building block in integrated photonics, particularly in quantum applications and optimization-based design where precision is critical. Accurate functionality is crucial to ensure reliable operation within classical and quantum circuits. However, discrepancies between simulations and measurements are frequently observed. These inaccuracies can compromise the performance and scalability of integrated photonic systems, underscoring the critical need for advanced, precise simulation methods that bridge the gap between design and implementation. In this work, we show that this discrepancy can be mainly attributed to density changes in the oxide cladding. We conduct a systematic study involving experimental optical measurements, numerical simulations, and direct electron microscopy imaging to investigate this discrepancy in directional couplers. We find that the impact of cladding density variations on performance increases as feature gaps shrink. By incorporating these effects into our simulations using a novel and physically motivated Effective Trench Medium Model (ETMM), we achieve highly accurate reproduction of experimental measurements. We quantify the effects of cladding density variations on the SU(2) symmetry parameters that govern light propagation in directional couplers. This insight is crucial for advancing the precision of compact device fabrication, enabling reliable simulation of photonic integrated devices.

Title: Precise Quantum Chemistry calculations with few Slater Determinants
Authors: Clemens Giuliani, Jannes Nys, Rocco Martinazzo, Giuseppe Carleo, Riccardo Rossi
Abstract: Slater determinants have underpinned quantum chemistry for nearly a century, yet their full potential has remained challenging to exploit. In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to the state of the art. This is obtained by introducing an optimization method that leverages the quadratic dependence of the variational energy on the orbitals of each determinant, enabling an exact iterative optimization, and uses an efficient tensor-contraction algorithm to evaluate the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost that scales as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis.

Title: Max-Cut graph-driven quantum circuit design for planar spin glasses
Authors: Seyed Ehsan Ghasempouri, Gerhard W. Dueck, Stijn De Baerdemacker
Abstract: Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems, can be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in addressing complex optimization problems.

Title: Acoustic phonons, spin-phonon coupling and spin relaxation via the lattice reorientation mechanism in hexagonal germanium nanowires
Authors: Baksa Kolok, György Frank, András Pályi
Abstract: Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.
