Title: Optimizing quantum violation for multipartite facet Bell inequalities
Authors: Jin-Fu Chen, Mengyao Hu, Jordi Tura
Abstract: Nonlocality shapes quantum correlations, revealed through the violation of Bell inequalities. The intersection of all valid Bell inequalities is the so-called local polytope. In multipartite systems, characterizing the local polytope quickly becomes an intractable task as the system size increases. Optimizing Bell inequalities to maximize the ratio between their quantum value and classical bound is key to understanding multipartite nonlocality. We propose a gradient-based method for this optimization. Numerical results indicate that local maxima of this ratio typically correspond to facet Bell inequalities of the local polytope. This enables an iterative search for tight and robust Bell inequalities. Applied to permutation-invariant scenarios, the method provides tight Bell inequalities with large quantum violations and facilitates experimental certification of Bell correlations without full knowledge of the local polytope.

Title: Measuring multipartite entanglement efficiently by testing symmetries
Authors: Xiaoyu Liu, Jordi Tura, Albert Rico
Abstract: Recently, a technique known as quantum symmetry test has gained increasing attention for detecting bipartite entanglement in pure quantum states. In this work we show that, beyond qualitative detection, a family of well-defined measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement can be obtained with symmetry tests. We propose and benchmark several efficient methods to estimate these measures, and derive near-optimal sampling strategies for each. Despite the nonlinearity of the methods, we demonstrate that the sampling error scales no worse than $O(N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/2})$ with the total number of copies $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$, which suggests experimental feasibility. By exploiting symmetries we compute our measures for large number of copies, and derive the asymptotic decay exponents for relevant states in many-body systems. Using these results we identify tradeoffs between estimation complexity and sensitivity of the presented entanglement measures, oriented to practical implementations.

Title: Nonclassical State Generation and Quantum Metrology in the Double-Morse Potential
Authors: Firoz Chogle, Berihu Teklu, Jorge Zubelli, Ernesto Damiani
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear properties of the double-Morse potential as a possible resource for single-mode quantum states because of its double-well structure and anharmonicity. We derive the ground state wave function and the associated energy spectrum analytically, using the asymmetry (width parameter) $\alpha$ as the primary control parameter. These results show a systematic and evident influence on $\alpha$. We assess the non-Gaussianity and non-classicality measures, quantifying their nonlinearity and quantum behavior. In particular, we discover that both metrics rise monotonically with $\alpha$. Furthermore, we examine the metrological performance for estimating $\alpha$. By calculating the pertinent Fisher information and building workable estimators, we show that optimal strategies can saturate the Cramér-Rao bound, with straightforward position measurements on shallow wells already producing high precision. These results collectively demonstrate that the double-Morse potential is a genuine, controllable source of non-Gaussianity, whose non-classicality and metrological applications increase with $\alpha$. We highlight the potential applications of this model in real-world quantum technologies and discuss the implications for continuous-variable quantum information processing and computation.

Title: The three kinds of three-qubit entanglement
Authors: Szilárd Szalay
Abstract: We construct an important missing piece in the entanglement theory of pure three-qubit states, which is a polynomial measure of W entanglement, working in parallel to the three-tangle, which is a polynomial measure of GHZ entanglement, and to the bipartite concurrence, which is a polynomial measure of bipartite entanglement. We also show that these entanglement measures are ordered, the bipartite measure is larger than the W measure, which is larger than the GHZ measure. It is meaningful then to consider these three types of three-qubit entanglement, which are also ordered, bipartite is weaker than W, which is weaker than GHZ, in parallel to the order of the three equivalence classes of entangled three-qubit states.

Title: Quantum Approximate Walk Algorithm
Authors: Ziqing Guo, Jan Balewski, Wenshuo Hu, Alex Khan, Ziwen Pan
Abstract: The encoding of classical to quantum data mapping through trigonometric functions within arithmetic-based quantum computation algorithms leads to the exploitation of multivariate distributions. The studied variational quantum gate learning mechanism, which relies on agnostic gradient optimization, does not offer algorithmic guarantees for the correlation of results beyond the measured bitstring outputs. Consequently, existing methodologies are inapplicable to this problem. In this study, we present a classical data-traceable quantum oracle characterized by a circuit depth that increases linearly with the number of qubits. This configuration facilitates the learning of approximate result patterns through a shallow quantum circuit (SQC) layout. Moreover, our approach demonstrates that the classical preprocessing of mid-quantum measurement data enhances the interpretability of quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) outputs without requiring full quantum state tomography. By establishing an inferable mapping between the classical input and quantum circuit outcomes, we obtained experimental results on the state-of-the-art IBM Pittsburgh hardware, which yielded polynomial-time verification of the solution quality. This hybrid framework bridges the gap between near-term quantum capabilities and practical optimization requirements, offering a pathway toward reliable quantum-classical algorithms for industrial applications.

Title: Multipartite steering verification with imprecise measurements
Authors: Zeyang Lu, Chan Li, Gang Wang, Zhu Cao
Abstract: Quantum steering is a fundamental quantum correlation that plays a pivotal role in quantum technologies, but its verification crucially relies on precise measurements -- an assumption often undermined by practical imperfections. Here, we investigate multipartite steering verification under imprecise measurements and develop a quantitative method that effectively eliminates false positives induced by measurement imprecision. A comparison with a device-independent approach demonstrates that our method accurately delineates the scope of valid verification. In a special case, our method also enables the verification of multipartite entanglement under nonideal conditions. These results substantially enhance the robustness of multipartite steering and entanglement verification against measurement imprecision, thereby promoting their applicability in realistic quantum technologies.

Title: Optical spectroscopy of single- and two-ion transitions in an antiferromagnetic stoichiometric rare-earth crystal
Authors: Masaya Hiraishi, Gabrielle A. Hunter-Smith, Gavin G. G. King, Alexandra A. Turrini, J.-R. Soh, Henrik M. Rønnow, Luke S. Trainor, Jevon J. Longdell
Abstract: We characterise optical transitions of neodymium ions (Nd3+) in antiferromagnetic neodymium gallate (NdGaO3) with applied fields up to 3 T. The magnetic phase of this material has not previously been studied with the field along its magnetisation axis. The measured optical spectra indicate three magnetic phases -- antiferromagnetic, intermediate, and paramagnetic -- where the intermediate phase likely forms a different magnetic structure from typical spin-flop phases. The observed absorptions were classified into two distinct families of optical transitions: single-Nd and two-Nd absorptions. We demonstrate that the optical transitions in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases can be modelled using a standard single-ion crystal-field Hamiltonian that interacts with a mean magnetisation from the rest of the lattice, and we expand that model to encompass pairs of ions, explaining the origins of the two-Nd transitions. This study offers a deeper understanding of the optical transitions in rare-earth antiferromagnetic crystals, which have been recently attracting significant interest for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction, despite being relatively unexplored to date.

Title: Quantum Semantic Communication Beyond the Shannon-Wyner Channel Capacity
Authors: Min Wang, Gui-Fa Zhu, Guo-Fei Long, Jianxing Guo, Yu-Chen Liu, Dong Pan, Li-Ping Nong, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC), a paradigm-shifting breakthrough in quantum communication, exploits quantum states for unmediated information transmission. Rooted in the inviolable fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, QSDC enables ultrasensitive detection of even the faintest eavesdropping attempts, guaranteeing true communication security solely when no interference exists. If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber. However, its practical scalability remains constrained by insufficient transmission rates, a critical bottleneck. Semantic communication, which drastically boosts transmission efficiency by extracting core information features, nevertheless stays vulnerable to malicious intrusions. Integrating these paradigms promises to simultaneously enhance equivalent data rate and security. Herein, we propose and experimentally validate a quantum semantic communication scheme, applying it to 3D point clouds. It achieves a 46.30-fold efficiency gain over direct transmission, surpassing both Wyner and Shannon capacity limits. This breakthrough not only clears the path for large-scale QSDC deployment but also marks a pivotal milestone in quantum information science.

Title: Local spreading of stabilizer Rényi entropy in a brickwork random Clifford circuit
Authors: Somnath Maity, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.

Title: On the role of induced electric field in the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect
Authors: Masashi Wakamatsu
Abstract: Whether the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect even exists or not has been the subject of long-standing debate. There are two factors complicating the problem. First, in the closed spacetime line integral of the vector potential that is thought to give the AB-phase shift, how to treat the time-varying vector potential is highly nontrivial. Second, the time-varying magnetic flux generates induced electric field even outside the solenoid. In the present paper, motivated by a recent work by Gao, we re-investigate the role of the induced electric field with the utmost care. This analysis reveals a highly nontrivial effect of the induced electric field, which turns out to be useful for verifying the very existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.

Title: Emergent Decoherence Dynamics in Doubly Disordered Spin Networks
Authors: Cooper M. Selco, Christian Bengs, Chaitali Shah, Zhuorui Zhang, Ashok Ajoy
Abstract: Elucidating the emergence of irreversible macroscopic laws from reversible quantum many-body dynamics is a question of broad importance across all quantum science. Many-body decoherence plays a key role in this transition, yet connecting microscopic dynamics to emergent macroscopic behavior remains challenging. Here, in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network, we uncover an emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, $e^{-\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$, that is robust across broad parameter regimes. We trace its microscopic origins to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting anomalous, sub-diffusive dynamics. We demonstrate the capacity to control--and even eliminate--either channel individually through a combination of Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation. We find that disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, here proves protective, generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes. These findings establish a microscopic framework for manipulating decoherence pathways and suggests engineered disorder as a new design principle for realizing long-lived quantum memories and sensors.

Title: Secure and Efficient n-Qubit Entangled State Teleportation Using Partially Entangled GHZ Channels and Optimal POVM
Authors: Animesh Banik, Md. Shihab Khan, Rafid Masrur Khan, Syed Emad Uddin Shubha, Mahdy Rahman Chowdhury
Abstract: We introduce an efficient and versatile quantum teleportation protocol for specific types of n-qubit entangled states. By employing a partially entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as the quantum channel and an optimal Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) based on an improved reciprocal state formulation, we achieve unambiguous state discrimination. The scheme has been generalized to support various entangled state configurations and demonstrates a notable reduction in classical communication costs for these states compared to standard Bell-basis teleportation. Its capacity for integration with conventional protocols is pivotal, enhancing quantum hop-by-hop communication security by allowing strategic choices in quantum channel and teleportation strategy

Title: Sufficient conditions for hardness of lossy Gaussian boson sampling
Authors: Byeongseon Go, Changhun Oh, Hyunseok Jeong
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a prominent candidate for the experimental demonstration of quantum advantage. However, while the current implementations of GBS are unavoidably subject to noise, the robustness of the classical intractability of GBS against noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we establish the complexity-theoretic foundations for the classical intractability of noisy GBS under photon loss, which is a dominant source of imperfection in current implementations. We identify the loss threshold below which lossy GBS maintains the same complexity-theoretic level as ideal GBS, and show that this holds when at most a logarithmic fraction of photons is lost. We additionally derive an intractability criterion for the loss rate through a direct quantification of the statistical distance between ideal and lossy GBS. This work presents the first rigorous characterization of classically intractable regimes of lossy GBS, thereby serving as a crucial step toward demonstrating quantum advantage with near-term implementations.

Title: Enhancing Remote Magnon-Magnon Entanglement with Quantum Interference
Authors: Yuan Gong, Yan-Xue Cheng, Wei Xiong, Jiaojiao Chen
Abstract: Cavity magnonics, owing to its strong magnon-photon coupling and excellent tunability, has attracted significant interest in quantum information science. However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results open a promising route toward controllable and thermally resilient macroscopic entanglement in cavity magnonics. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions.

Title: Collective Vibronic Cascade in Cavity-Coupled Jahn-Teller Active Molecules
Authors: Suraj Kumar Pandit, Abhinay Pandey, Athreya Shankar, Krishna R. Nandipati
Abstract: We study the polaritonic states and dynamics of multiple Jahn-Teller (JT) active molecules coupled to the modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity. We find that collective effects dramatically alter the interplay of electronic, vibrational and cavity angular momenta, giving rise to markedly different polaritonic spectra and dynamics even when going from one to two JT molecules. Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system. Our results uncover new pathways for vibronic angular momentum transfer unique to collective molecular polaritonics with potential implications for cavity-assisted photo-physics and photo-chemistry.

Title: Mutual Mana: Converting Local Magic into Correlations via Discrete Beamsplitters
Authors: Linshuai Zhang, Huihui Li
Abstract: Magic (non-stabilizerness) is a key resource for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computation beyond classical computation. While previous studies have primarily focused on magic in single systems, its interactions and distribution in multipartite settings remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce mutual mana as a measure of magic correlations defined in close analogy with quantum mutual information. Our definition builds upon mana, which is the established quantifier of magic based on discrete Wigner function negativity. We characterize magic correlations generated by discrete beamsplitters, whose Gaussian counterparts are fundamental components in quantum optics and quantum technologies. We show that coupling a magic state with a stabilizer vacuum state via a discrete beamsplitter will induce a full conversion of local magic into mutual mana, thereby establishing a mechanism for redistributing magic resources as magic correlations. We reveal the fundamental properties of mutual mana and derive its explicit expressions for several prototypical qutrit states subject to a discrete beamsplitter. We make a comparative study of mutual mana with several established quantifiers of correlations generated by the qutrit beamsplitter, including quantum mutual information, mutual $L^1$-norm magic, and mutual stabilizer 2-Rényi entropy.

Title: Realization of an all-optical effective negative-mass oscillator for coherent quantum noise cancellation
Authors: Nived Johny, Jonas Junker, Bernd Schulte, Dennis Wilken, Klemens Hammerer, Michèle Heurs
Abstract: We report the realization of an all-optical, tabletop effective-negative-mass oscillator (ENMO) scheme capable of canceling quantum noise when cascaded with an opto-mechanical sensor susceptible to (quantum) radiation pressure noise. Our coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) scheme offers a broadband cancellation capability with a tunable, wavelength-flexible, and compact system. This is achieved through the implementation of an optical equivalent of an opto-mechanical interaction, facilitated by a down-conversion and a beam-splitting process. The intricate nature of the system and its multiple interacting components made characterizing the interdependent parameters with conventional methods ineffective, leading to the development of an in-situ characterization scheme. The obtained parameters meet the targets for CQNC set in previous studies. With our current realization, we project a broadband quantum noise reduction of 3.6 dB, corresponding to a 77% reduction in quantum back-action noise at the optimal frequency of maximum reduction, indicating the readiness of the ENMO for application. We discuss the prospects for new applications in quantum information and communication using the same platform.

Title: Coherence in the Leak and Storage Kurtosis control Ergotropy in Quantum Batteries
Authors: Bitap Raj Thakuria, Trishna Kalita, Manash Jyoti Sarmah, Himangshu Prabal Goswami
Abstract: We introduce a cavity-coupled finite quantum system which can act as a quantum battery by harnessing noise induced coherences. We apply the methodology of full counting statistics to capture higher-order fluctuations of quanta exchange in the storage station. Together with the thermodynamic parameters, the fluctuations constitute a training platform for unsupervised as well as supervised learning models in predicting ergotropy. We identify a minimal predictive feature set from the battery's operating parameters that can classify the ergotropy into different regimes with great this http URL results show that the usual quantum and thermodynamic variables are inadequate for the purpose of identifying high ergotropy regimes in isolation. Rather, it is the kurtosis of quanta exchange in the storage and the noise-induced coherence in the leakage mode that become the dominant quantities in controlling the magnitude of ergotropy.

Title: Repulsive Inverse-Distance Interatomic Interaction from Many-Body Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Loris Di Cairano, Matteo Gori, Reza Karimpour, Alexandre Tkatchenko
Abstract: Interactions between objects can be classified as fundamental or emergent. Fundamental interactions are either extremely short-range or decay inversely with the separation distance, such as the Coulomb potential between charges or the gravitational attraction between masses. In contrast, emergent quantum van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions decay considerably faster ($R^{-6}$ or $R^{-7}$) with distance $R$. Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales.

Title: Mixed-state phase structure of gauge-Higgs subsystem codes under logical-preserving decoherence
Authors: Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Some of lattice-gauge-theory models, in particular gauge-Higgs model (GHM), can be regarded and work as a subsystem code. This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits.

Title: Gate Sequence Optimization for Parameterized Quantum Circuits using Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Tom R. Rieckmann, Stefan Scheel, A. Douglas K. Plato
Abstract: Current experimental quantum computing devices are limited by noise, mainly originating from entangling gates. If an efficient gate sequence for an operation is unknown, one often employs layered parameterized quantum circuits, especially hardware-efficient ansätze, with fixed entangling layer structures. We demonstrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve on these by optimizing the entangling gate sequence in the task of quantum state preparation. This allows us to restrict the required number of CNOT gates while taking the qubit connectivity architecture into account. Recent advancements using reinforcement learning have already demonstrated the power of this technique when optimizing the circuit for a sequence of non-parameterized gates. We extend this approach to parameterized gate sets by incorporating general single-qubit unitaries, thus allowing us to consistently reach higher state preparation fidelities at the same number of CNOT gates compared to a hardware-efficient ansatz.

Title: Enhanced quantum correlations from joint pump and photon pair scattering
Authors: Mamoon Safadi, Nir Kuchuk, Ohad Lib, Yaron Bromberg, Arthur Goetschy
Abstract: Scattering of non-classical light is enabling new ways to study and control photon transport. However, advances in this field often rely on simplifying assumptions regarding the quantum light's generation and its source. In this work, we relax some of these assumptions and probe the behavior of entangled photon pairs passing through a disordered layer after being generated by a randomly scattered pump via spontaneous parametric down conversion. We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium. These findings represent a crucial step toward understanding quantum light generation in complex media, and potentially exploiting it for quantum technologies.

Title: Quantum Markov Chains: Hub-Pruned Estimation for Fashion Recommenders
Authors: Or Peretz, Tai Dinh, Michal Koren
Abstract: We investigate whether shallow quantum circuits can accurately reproduce the short-horizon dynamics of discrete-time Markov chains derived from fashion electronic-commerce recommendation links. Transition operators are compiled into block-encoded circuits and iterated using fixed-point oblivious amplitude amplification, and amplitude-encoded marginals are used to estimate the classical push-forward. Empirically, colour categories such as black and, to a lesser extent, white function as high-degree hubs that dominate probability flow. Consequently, we assess three chain variants: the full network including all colours, a network without black, and a network without black and white, to quantify the effect of hub pruning under realistic circuit depths and measurement budgets. Across networks aggregated from multiple retailers, hub pruning consistently improves quantum and classical agreement at shallow depth; total-variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence typically decrease by approximately a factor of two relative to the full network, while state fidelities remain close to unity. A bias-and-contraction analysis explains these gains through reduced cross-terms and an effectively widened spectral gap. The results identify hub-pruned block-encodings as a practical heuristic for near-term experiments on recommendation dynamics using small quantum registers, and they provide a reproducible benchmarking protocol that reports total-variation distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and state fidelity as functions of circuit depth and prediction horizon.

Title: From Classical to Hybrid: A Practical Framework for Quantum-Enhanced Learning
Authors: Silvie Illésová, Tomáš Bezděk, Vojtěch Novák, Ivan Zelinka, Stefano Cacciatore, Martin Beseda
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of enabling practitioners without quantum expertise to transition from classical to hybrid quantum-classical machine learning workflows. We propose a three-stage framework: starting with a classical self-training model, then introducing a minimal hybrid quantum variant, and finally applying diagnostic feedback via QMetric to refine the hybrid architecture. In experiments on the Iris dataset, the refined hybrid model improved accuracy from 0.31 in the classical approach to 0.87 in the quantum approach. These results suggest that even modest quantum components, when guided by proper diagnostics, can enhance class separation and representation capacity in hybrid learning, offering a practical pathway for classical machine learning practitioners to leverage quantum-enhanced methods.

Title: Fidelity sweet spot in transmon qubit rings under strong connectivity noise
Authors: Quan Fu, Xin Wang, Rui Xiong
Abstract: We investigate the fidelity of quantum operations in transmon qubit systems, focusing on both SWAP and general gate operations. Our results reveal a distinct fidelity sweet spot that emerges even under strong noise, indicating that optimal circuit depth can enhance gate performance. We further demonstrate that specific initial states, particularly those with favorable symmetry or entanglement structure, yield higher fidelity, reaching levels compatible with quantum error-correction thresholds. Finally, we introduce a supervised machine-learning framework capable of predicting the positions of fidelity sweet spots, enabling efficient optimization of circuit durations across different device configurations.

Title: Exact-factorization framework for electron-nuclear dynamics in electromagnetic fields
Authors: Vladimir U. Nazarov, E. K. U. Gross
Abstract: The Exact Factorization (EF) theory aims at the separation of the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in the many-body (MB) quantum mechanical problem. Being formally equivalent to the solution of the MB Schrödinger equation, EF sets up a strategy for the construction of efficient approximations in the theory of the correlated electronic-nuclear motion. Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\citet{Yin-92}). From an intuitive argument that the atom must not be deflected by the Lorentz force from a straight line trajectory, it has been conjectured that the same compensation should occur within the EF theory as well. We give a rigorous proof of this property.

Title: Nonexistence of maximally entangled mixed states for a fixed spectrum
Authors: Gonzalo Camacho, Julio I. de Vicente
Abstract: The existence of a maximally entangled pure state is a cornerstone result of entanglement theory that has paramount consequences in quantum information theory. A natural generalization of this property is to consider whether a notion of maximal entanglement is possible among all states with the same spectrum (where the aforementioned case of pure states corresponds to the particular choice in which the spectrum is a delta distribution, i.e., rank-1 states). Despite positive evidence in the past that such a notion might exist at least in the case of two-qubit states, it was recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 050202 (2024)] that the answer to the above question is negative. This reference proved this for particular choices of the spectrum in the case of rank-2 two-qubit density matrices. While this settles the problem in general, it still leaves open whether there are other choices of the spectrum outside the case of pure states where a maximally entangled state for a fixed spectrum might exist. In this work we extend this impossibility result to all rank-2 and rank-3 two-qubit states as well as for a large class of eigenvalue distributions in the case where the rank equals four.

Title: Reliable Optimization Under Noise in Quantum Variational Algorithms
Authors: Vojtěch Novák, Silvie Illésová, Tomáš Bezděk, Ivan Zelinka, Martin Beseda
Abstract: The optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolver is severely challenged by finite-shot sampling noise, which distorts the cost landscape, creates false variational minima, and induces statistical bias called winner's curse. We investigate this phenomenon by benchmarking eight classical optimizers spanning gradient-based, gradient-free, and metaheuristic methods on quantum chemistry Hamiltonians H$_2$, H$_4$ chain, LiH (in both full and active spaces) using the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. We analyze difficulties of gradient-based methods (e.g., SLSQP, BFGS) in noisy regimes, where they diverge or stagnate. We show that the bias of estimator can be corrected by tracking the \textit{population mean}, rather than the biased best individual when using population based optimizer. Our findings, which are shown to generalize to hardware-efficient circuits and condensed matter models, identify adaptive metaheuristics (specifically CMA-ES and iL-SHADE) as the most effective and resilient strategies. We conclude by presenting a set of practical guidelines for reliable VQE optimization under noise, centering on the co-design of physically motivated ansatz and the use of adaptive optimizers.

Title: Quantum-driven sampling of the quasi-uniform distribution via quantum walks
Authors: Marco Radaelli, Claudia Benedetti, Stefano Olivares
Abstract: We investigate the use of discrete-time quantum walks to sample from an almost-uniform distribution, in the absence of any external source of randomness. Integers are encoded on the vertices of a cycle graph, and a quantum walker evolves for a fixed number of steps before its position is measured and recorded. The walker is then reset to the measured site, and the procedure is iterated to produce the sequence of random numbers. We show that when the quantum walk parameters, such as the coin operator and initial state, satisfy the conditions of the ergodic theorem for random walks on finite groups, the resulting sequence converges asymptotically to the uniform distribution. Although correlations between successive outcomes are unavoidable, they can be significantly reduced by a suitable choice of the evolution time. By analyzing the iterated convolution of the quantum walk transition probability and exploiting the ergodic theorem, we demonstrate convergence of the marginal distributions toward the uniform distribution in the asymptotic limit.

Abstract: Geometric Phase in Quantum Mechanics is generally formulated entirely in terms of geometric structure of the Complex Hilbert Space. We will exploit this fact in case of mixed states for three level open systems undergoing depolarization using the eight dimensional Poincare sphere in the SU(2) Polarisation picture and non unit vector rays in H3 within the limit of pure state approach may be found to be in agreement with the Pancharatnam Phase, Berry Phase and Aharonov-Anandan Phase.

Title: Quantum annealing for lattice models with competing long-range interactions
Authors: Jan Alexander Koziol, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: We use superconducting qubit quantum annealing devices to determine the ground state of Ising models with algebraically decaying competing long-range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. This is enabled by a unit-cell-based optimization scheme, in which the finite optimizations on each unit cell are performed using commercial quantum annealing hardware. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we choose three exemplary problems relevant for other quantum simulation platforms and material science: (i) the calculation of devil's staircases of magnetization plateaux of the long-range Ising model in a longitudinal field on the triangular lattice, motivated by atomic and molecular quantum simulators; (ii) the evaluation of the ground state of the same model on the Kagome lattice in the absence of a field, motivated by artificial spin ice metamaterials; (iii) the study of models with additional few-nearest-neighbor interactions relevant for frustrated Ising compounds with potential long-range interactions. The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Selective State Space Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Amin Ebrahimi, Farzan Haddadi
Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Classical (HQC) algorithms constitute one of the most effective paradigms for exploiting the computational advantages of quantum systems in large-scale numerical tasks. By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization. In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning. We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced gating mechanisms as a path toward scalable, resource-efficient NLP models, in a limited simulation step. Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding

Title: An Information-Minimal Geometry for Qubit-Efficient Optimization
Authors: Gordon Ma, Dimitris G. Angelakis
Abstract: Qubit-efficient optimization seeks to represent an $N$-variable combinatorial problem within a Hilbert space smaller than $2^N$, using only as much quantum structure as the objective itself requires. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\lceil\log_2 N\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary.

Title: Exploring the performance of superposition of product states: from 1D to 3D quantum spin systems
Authors: Apimuk Sornsaeng, Itai Arad, Dario Poletti
Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) are one of the best available tools to study many-body quantum systems. TNs are particularly suitable for one-dimensional local Hamiltonians, while their performance for generic geometries is mainly limited by two aspects: the limitation in expressive power and the approximate extraction of information. Here we investigate the performance of superposition-of-product-states (SPS) ansatz, a variational framework structurally related to canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. The ansatz does not compress information as effectively as tensor networks, but it has the advantages (i) of allowing accurate extraction of information, (ii) of being structurally independent of the geometry of the system, (iii) of being readily parallelizable, and (iv) of allowing analytical shortcuts. We first study the typical properties of the SPS ansatz for spin-$1/2$ systems, including its entanglement entropy, and its trainability. We then use this ansatz for ground state search in tilted Ising models--including one-dimensional and three-dimensional with short- and long-range interaction, and a random network--demonstrating that SPS can attain high accuracy.

Title: Surprising applications of Newton's hyperbolism transform of curves in Fourier-transform spectroscopy
Authors: Dennis Huber, Steffen J. Glaser
Abstract: The Fourier transform (FT) represents a key tool in modern spectroscopy which drastically reduces measurement times and helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in spectra. Fourier transforming exponentially decaying time domain signals gives Lorentzian line shapes which can be manipulated by apodization methods. The underlying transitions of spectral lines can be visualized by a Bloch vector or equivalent phase-space representations. Here, we study and generalize a surprisingly elegant geometric transform, the hyperbolism of curves originally found by Isaac Newton, which allows to transform ellipses into Lorentzian lines, and vice versa. With this, we show that the Bloch picture and especially corresponding phase-space representations are directly geometrically related to the Lorentzian line shape. We also introduce a novel continuous parametrization of Newton's transform which results in further interesting line shapes. In particular, we find that truncated parabolic lines with finite support can be obtained by the half transform and introduce a new apodization approach to replicate this line shape in experimental spectra. We discuss concrete applications in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Title: Comparison of Two Optimization Methods for a Rydberg Quantum Gate
Authors: Luis S. Yagüe Bosch, Sandro Wimberger
Abstract: A shortcut-to-adiabaticity is compared with a numerically optimized protocol for implementing a high-fidelity quantum gate on Rydberg atoms. The counterdiabatic method offers an analytical framework for accelerating high-fidelity gates by mimicking the time evolution of a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian using fast-oscillating fields. This approach is contrasted with a numerically optimized gate designed using the Boulder Opal platform. The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities while demonstrating robustness against errors similar to that of the effective counterdiabatic gate. The study serves as an example of the performance of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols compared to brute-force numerical optimization techniques for state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms. It stresses the important role played by constraints on the optimized pulses in time and in amplitude that are crucial in determining the quality of the optimization method.

Title: Comment on "Role of Matter Interactions in Superradiant Phenomena"
Authors: Max Hörmann, Anja Langheld, Jonas Leibig, Andreas Schellenberger, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: Recently, Mendonça et al. [arXiv:2503.04961] investigated the Dicke-XXZ model and the Dicke-Ising model. For the latter model, their calculated quantum phase diagram contradicts claims about the existence of an intermediate phase with superradiant and antiferromagnetic order and the change in order of some phase transition lines, observed in other studies. In this comment we demonstrate that both features are indeed present in the Dicke-Ising model for the investigated parameter range in [arXiv:2503.04961].

Title: A Quantum Non-Gaussianity Criterion Based on Photon Correlations $g^{(2)}$ and $g^{(3)}$
Authors: Christoph Hotter, Clara Henke, Cornelis Jacobus van Diepen, Peter Lodahl, Anders Søndberg Sørensen
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian states, which cannot be written as mixtures of Gaussian states, are necessary to achieve a quantum advantage in continuous variable systems. They represent an important benchmark for the realization of an advanced quantum light source, as they cannot be made by simple means such as displacement and squeezing. We introduce an attenuation-resistant sufficient criterion for quantum non-Gaussian states based on the second- and third-order correlation functions, $g^{(2)}$ and $g^{(3)}$. The general non-linear bound for classical mixtures of Gaussian states is $\sqrt{g^{(3)}} + 3 \sqrt{g^{(2)}} \geq 2$. Any mixture of Gaussian states must fulfill this inequality, thus, the violation of it represents a direct confirmation of quantum non-Gaussianity. We experimentally show the non-Gaussianity of the state produced by a quantum dot single-photon source, where we obtain $\sqrt{g^{(3)}} + 3 \sqrt{g^{(2)}} = 0.174 (13)$, which represents a statistical significance of more than $100$ standard deviations.

Abstract: The promise of fault-tolerant quantum computing is challenged by environmental drift that relentlessly degrades the quality of quantum operations. The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size. This work thus enables a new paradigm: a quantum computer that learns to self-improve directly from its errors and never stops computing.

Title: Dynamical Chaos in a Dissipative Driven Quantum Soft Impact Oscillator
Authors: Titir Mukherjee, Arnab Acharya, Soumitro Banerjee, Deb Shankar Ray
Abstract: Dynamical chaos in a periodically driven, dissipative soft impact oscillator is investigated in the quantum regime using the complex-number quantum Langevin equation (c-number QLE). The averaged system dynamics are analyzed through a comprehensive suite of time-series diagnostics, including bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, Fourier spectra, and the 0-1 test. Systematic variation of the wall position reveals a rich sequence of dynamical transitions and grazing bifurcations, progressing from periodic to multiperiodic motion and culminating in chaotic behavior. These results demonstrate the persistence of impact-induced chaos under quantum dissipation and elucidate how environmental fluctuations influence non-linear dynamics in open quantum systems.

Title: The FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model for early fault-tolerant quantum algorithms
Authors: William J. Huggins, Tanuj Khattar, Amanda Xu, Matthew Harrigan, Christopher Kang, Guang Hao Low, Austin Fowler, Nicholas C. Rubin, Ryan Babbush
Abstract: Holistic resource estimates are essential for guiding the development of fault-tolerant quantum algorithms and the computers they will run on. This is particularly true when we focus on highly-constrained early fault-tolerant devices. Many attempts to optimize algorithms for early fault-tolerance focus on simple metrics, such as the circuit depth or T-count. These metrics fail to capture critical overheads, such as the spacetime cost of Clifford operations and routing, or miss they key optimizations. We propose the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, tailored for architectures that use a two-dimensional lattice of qubits to implement the two-dimensional surface code. FLASQ abstracts away the complexity of routing by assuming that ancilla space and time can be fluidly rearranged, allowing for the tractable estimation of spacetime volume while still capturing important details neglected by simpler approaches. At the same time, it enforces constraints imposed by the circuit's measurement depth and the processor's reaction time. We apply FLASQ to analyze the cost of a standard two-dimensional lattice model simulation, finding that modern advances (such as magic state cultivation and the combination of quantum error correction and mitigation) reduce both the time and space required for this task by an order of magnitude compared with previous estimates. We also analyze the Hamming weight phasing approach to synthesizing parallel rotations, revealing that despite its low T-count, the overhead from imposing a 2D layout and from its use of additional ancilla qubits will make it challenging to benefit from in early fault-tolerance. We hope that the FLASQ cost model will help to better align early fault-tolerant algorithmic design with actual hardware realization costs without demanding excessive knowledge of quantum error correction from quantum algorithmists.

Title: Design boosters: from constant-time quantum chaos to $\infty$-designs and beyond
Authors: Soumik Ghosh, Arjun Mirani, Yihui Quek, Michelle Xu
Abstract: We study a counterintuitive property of 'conditioning' on the result of measuring a subsystem of a quantum state: such conditioning can boost design quality, at the cost of increased system size. We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs.

Title: Beyond critical coupling: optimal design considerations for spontaneous four-wave mixing in microring resonators
Authors: Joseph M. Lukens, Karthik V. Myilswamy, Alexander Miloshevsky, Hsuan-Hao Lu
Abstract: We present a self-contained analytical model for biphoton generation in microring resonators. Encompassing both all-pass and add-drop geometries, identical and distinct pump and biphoton coupling coefficients, and continuous-wave and pulsed pumping, our interaction-picture-based approach reveals time-frequency biphoton correlations while also predicting absolute generation rates. Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings. As a whole, our formalism should prove valuable for the practical design of integrated photon sources, merging a flexible and intuitive biphoton-centric depiction with quantitative predictions closely tied to experimental parameters.

Title: Fluctuation amplification engineering in multimode Raman-cavity systems
Authors: H. P. Ojeda Collado, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: Parametric amplification is a key ingredient of a wide range of phenomena, from the classical to the quantum domain. Although such phenomena have been demonstrated in non-equilibrium settings, their use for fluctuation engineering has been put forth in Raman-cavity hybrids only recently. In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions, as demonstrated here, could be leveraged for the design of novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime.

Title: Towards Personalized Quantum Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection
Authors: Ratun Rahman, Sina Shaham, Dinh C. Nguyen
Abstract: Anomaly detection has a significant impact on applications such as video surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial monitoring, where anomalies frequently depend on context and anomaly-labeled data are limited. Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings.

Title: A Four-Level Ontological Framework for Quantum Field Theory: From Quantum Vacuum to Phenomenal Reality
Authors: Ali Reza Mirzaee (Mirza)
Abstract: One of the foundational challenges in both Quantum Field Theory and the philosophy of physics lies in the traditional binary classification of entities as either real or unreal. The classical view posits that material entities are real, while mental constructs or theoretical entities are unreal. However, quantum phenomena such as virtual particles challenge this simplistic dichotomy. These unobservable entities, by influencing measurable phenomena, raise profound questions about the nature and modes of existence. To address this, we propose a four-level ontological hierarchy that spans from the quantum vacuum and the virtual level to the quantum level and phenomenal reality, providing a coherent continuum from potentiality to actualization. This framework not only clarifies the interpretation of quantum theory but also offers a unified perspective linking the unobservable with the observable. In QFT, virtual particles play a crucial role in mediating forces and in correcting the measurable properties of real particles. They arise within the mathematical structure of Feynman diagrams and, despite being unobservable, produce real, measurable effects such as the Lamb shift and the Casimir effect. Philosophically, this raises deep ontological questions: if unobservable entities affect measurable phenomena, can they truly be dismissed as unreal? Conversely, if they are real, what mode of existence do they possess? The traditional dichotomy of real versus unreal is thus insufficient for interpreting the ontological implications of quantum processes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a four-level ontological hierarchy.

Title: From Heisenberg and Schrödinger to the P vs. NP Problem
Authors: Galina Weinstein
Abstract: This essay offers an epistemological reinterpretation of the foundational divide between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics. Though formally equivalent, the two theories embody distinct modes of knowing: procedural construction and recognitional verification. These epistemic architectures anticipate, in philosophical form, the logical asymmetry expressed by the P versus NP problem in computational complexity. Here, the contrast between efficient generation and efficient recognition is treated not as a mathematical taxonomy but as a framework for understanding how knowledge is produced and validated across physics, computation, and cognition. The essay reconstructs the mathematical history of quantum mechanics through the original derivations of Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Paul Dirac, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Ehrenfest, and Wolfgang Pauli, culminating in John von Neumann's unification of both approaches within the formalism of Hilbert space. By juxtaposing Heisenberg's algorithmic formalism with Schrödinger's representational one, it argues that their divergence reveals a structural feature of scientific reasoning itself-the enduring tension between what can be procedurally constructed and what can only be recognized.

Title: Quantum Calculations of the Cavity Shift in Electron Magnetic Moment Measurements
Authors: Hannah Day, Roni Harnik, Yonatan Kahn, Shashin Pavaskar, Kevin Zhou
Abstract: The measurement of the anomalous electron magnetic moment $g-2$ through quantum transitions of a single trapped electron is the most stringent test of quantum field theory. These experiments are now so precise that they must account for the effects of the cavity containing the electron. Classical calculations of this "cavity shift" must subtract the electron's divergent self-field, and thus require knowledge of the exact Green's function for the cavity's electromagnetic field. We perform the first fully quantum calculation of the cavity shift in a closed cavity, which instead involves subtracting linearly divergent cavity mode sums and integrals. Using contour integration methods, we find perfect agreement with existing classical results for both spherical and cylindrical cavities, justifying their current use. Moreover, our mode-based results can be naturally generalized to account for systematic effects, necessary to push future measurements to the next order of magnitude in precision.

Title: A ballistic upper bound on the accumulation of bosonic on-site energies
Authors: Tomotaka Kuwahara, Marius Lemm, Carla Rubiliani
Abstract: In this note, we study transport properties of the dynamics generated by translation-invariant and possibly long-ranged Hamiltonians of Bose-Hubbard type. For translation-invariant initial states with controlled boson density, we improve the known bound on the local repulsive energy at time $t$ from $\langle n^2_x\rangle_t\lesssim t^{2d}$ to $\langle n^2_x\rangle_t\lesssim t^d$. This shows that bosonic on-site energies accumulate at most ballistically. Extending the result to higher moments would have powerful implications for bosonic Lieb-Robinson bounds. While previous approaches focused on controlling particle transport, our proof develops novel ASTLOs (adiabatic space-time localization observables) that are able to track the growth of local boson-boson correlations.

Title: Chiral Quantum Optics with Scalable Quantum Dot Dimers
Authors: L. Hallacy, D. Hallett, A. Fenzl, N.J. Martin, R. Dost, A.Verma, J. Fletcher, I. Farrer, L. Antwis, M.S. Skolnick, L.R. Wilson
Abstract: We present a scalable method for electrically tuning multiple spatially separated quantum dots embedded in photonic crystal waveguides. Ion implantation into the top p-doped layer of a p-i-n diode creates high-resistivity tracks, providing electrical isolation between adjacent regions. Unlike physical etching, this method preserves the guided-mode profile of the photonic crystal without introducing significant scattering, limiting refractive index perturbations to below 0.001 with 0.01% additional loss. In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model. Our results mark an important step towards scalable, multi-emitter architectures for chiral quantum networks.

Title: Dual Magnetic and Electric Dipole Symmetry: Pseudo Angular Momentum in Parity Space and the Electric Landé $g$-Factor
Authors: Michael E. Tobar
Abstract: EDMs probe fundamental symmetries and underpin BSM searches. We give a symmetry-based description, analogous to the Zeeman effect, that puts magnetic and electric dipoles on equal footing under EM duality. In hydrogen, $\vec B$ (pseudovector) couples to $\hat{\vec J}$ and reduces $SO(4)$ to $SO(2)$ generated by $\hat J_z$. A static $\vec E$ (polar) couples within a fixed $n$ to a scaled Runge-Lenz operator $\hat{\vec A}_{\rm sc}$, mixes parities, and preserves $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ generated by $\hat J_z$ and $\hat A_{{\rm sc},z}$. This motivates a pseudo-angular momentum $\hat{\vec J}_p$ built from $\hat{\vec A}_{\rm sc}$ and a Landé factor $g_E$, so the orbital dipole is $\hat{\vec d}_{\rm orb}=g_E d_B \hat{\vec J}_p/\hbar$, with $d_B=ea_0=2\mu_B/(c\alpha)$. Stark mixing of $2s$ and $2p_{m=0}$ gives $|\langle d_{\rm orb}\rangle|=3d_B$ ($g_E=3$). Following Ohanian's magnetisation formalism, we construct its electric dual: the microscopic polarisation $\vec P$ has nonzero curl, defining a magnetic probability current $\vec J_m=-\epsilon_0^{-1}\nabla\times\vec P$, and the EDM expectation is $\langle \hat{\vec d}_{\rm tot}\rangle=-\frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\int \vec r\times \vec J_m\, d^3r=d_B\big[g_E\langle \hat{\vec J}_p\rangle/\hbar+g_E^{e}\langle \hat{\vec S}\rangle/\hbar\big]$, with $g_E^{e}=2d_{\rm int}/d_B$. Here $\hat{\vec S}$ encodes any intrinsic EDM $d_{\rm int}$, while $\hat{\vec J}_p$ captures the Stark-induced pseudo-angular momentum from Runge-Lenz symmetry. The dual framework shows that induced EDMs arise from circulating magnetic probability currents, mirroring magnetic dipoles from circulating electric probability currents.

Title: Quantum-centric machine learning for molecular dynamics
Authors: Yanxian Tao, Lingyun Wan, Xiongzhi Zeng, Yingdi Jin, Jie Liu, Zhenyu Li, Jinlong Yang
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of electronic wavefunctions is central to ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and electronic structure theory. However, conventional ab initio methods require self-consistent optimization of electronic states at every nuclear configuration, leading to prohibitive computational costs, especially for large or strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce a quantum-centric machine learning (QCML) model-a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with Transformer-based machine learning to directly predict molecular wavefunctions and quantum observables. By pretraining the Transformer on a diverse dataset of molecules and ansatz types and subsequently fine-tuning it for specific systems, QCML learns transferable mappings between molecular descriptors and PQC parameters, eliminating the need for iterative variational optimization. The pretrained model achieves chemical accuracy in potential energy surfaces, atomic forces, and dipole moments across multiple molecules and ansatzes, and enables efficient AIMD simulations with infrared spectra prediction. This work establishes a scalable and transferable quantum-centric machine learning paradigm, bridging variational quantum algorithms and modern deep learning for next-generation molecular simulation and quantum chemistry applications.

Title: Stabilization of Time-Varying Perturbed Quantum Systems via Reduced Filters
Authors: Weichao Liang, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: In practical applications, quantum systems are inevitably subject to significant uncertainties, including unknown initial states, imprecise physical parameters, and unmodeled environmental noise, all of which pose major challenges to robust quantum feedback control. This paper proposes a feedback stabilization strategy based on a reduced quantum filter that achieves robustness against time-varying Hamiltonian perturbations and additional dissipative effects, without requiring prior knowledge of the initial state or exact system parameters. The proposed filter estimates only O(N) real variables corresponding to the diagonal elements of the system density matrix in a quantum non-demolition basis in contrast to the O(N^2) variables required by a full stochastic master equation, where N is the Hilbert space dimension. This dimensionality reduction substantially simplifies real-time computation and feedback implementation while preserving both convergence and robustness guarantees. Rigorous analysis further establishes global exponential stability of the target subspace. The results provide a scalable framework for robust and efficient measurement-based feedback control applicable to high-dimensional perturbed open quantum systems.

Title: A Compact Dual-Beam Zeeman Slower for High-Flux Cold Atoms
Authors: Chen Chen, Kejun Liu, Dezhou Deng, Shuchang Ma, Peng Zhu, Zhichang He, J. F. Che, Xiaoxiao Wu, Peng Chen
Abstract: We present a compact design of dual-beam Zeeman slower optimized for efficient production of cold atom applications. Traditional single-beam configurations face challenges from substantial residual atomic flux impacting downstream optical windows, resulting in increased system size, atomic deposition contamination, and a reduced operational lifetime. Our approach employs two oblique laser beams and a capillary-array collimation system to address these challenges while maintaining efficient deceleration. For rubidium ($^{87}$Rb), simulations demonstrate a significant increase in the fraction of atoms captured by a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D-MOT) and nearly eliminate atom-induced contamination probability at optical windows, all within a compact Zeeman slower length of 44 cm. Experimental validation with Rb and Yb demonstrates highly efficient atomic loading within the same compact design. This advancement represents a substantial improvement for high-flux cold atom applications, providing reliable performance for high-precision metrology, quantum computation and simulation.

Title: Excited $Σ$ states of the hydrogen-antihydrogen molecule
Authors: L. Brumm, J. Schürmann, A. Saenz
Abstract: Adopting explicitly correlated Kolos-Wolniewicz-type basis functions, the Born-Oppenheimer potential curves of a number of excited $\Sigma$ states of the hydrogen-antihydrogen system ($\bar{\rm H}$) were calculated for both, even and odd, Q symmetries, including also free positronium states. It is demonstrated that the excited leptonic states support ro-vibrational states with energies close to the ground-state dissociation threshold. As a consequence, the excited leptonic states need to be considered in theoretical treatments of ground-state H-$\bar{\mathrm{H}}$ collisions.

Title: Cryogenic source of atomic tritium for precision spectroscopy and neutrino-mass measurements
Authors: Aleksei Semakin, Janne Ahokas, Tom Kiilerich, Sergey Vasiliev, Francois Nez, Pauline Yzombard, Valery Nesvizhevsky, Eberhard Widmann, Paolo Crivelli, Caroline Rodenbeck, Marco Röllig, Magnus Schlösser
Abstract: We propose a concept for a cryogenic source of atomic tritium at sub-kelvin temperatures and energies suitable for magnetic trapping. The source is based on the dissociation of solid molecular tritium films below 1 K by electrons from a pulsed RF discharge, a technique recently demonstrated for atomic hydrogen, combined with buffer-gas cooling and magnetic confinement. We analyze the key processes limiting the source performance, adsorption, spin exchange and recombination, and show that atomic tritium fluxes exceeding 1e15 per second at kinetic energies of 100 mK can be achieved at the entrance of a magnetic trap. Such a source would enable Doppler-free two-photon 1S-2S spectroscopy in atomic tritium for high-precision measurements of the triton charge radius, provid- ing a crucial benchmark for bound-state QED and improving the comparison between electronic, muonic, and scattering determinations of nuclear sizes in light systems. Beyond spectroscopy, an atomic tritium source avoids molecular final-state broadening in beta-decay and is therefore neces- sary for next-generation neutrino-mass measurements; combined with detector technologies such as sub-eV resolution quantum sensors or cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, it enables order-of- magnitude improvement compared to the current KATRIN sensitivity, reaching sensitivities below the inverted ordering regime. Additionally, the source can be used to generate a beam of low- field-seeking deuterium atoms for loading magnetic traps, an important benchmark before trapping tritium atoms and useful for precision spectroscopy.

Title: Stacking and the triviality of invertible phases
Authors: Sven Bachmann, Alan Getz, Pieter Naaijkens, Naomi Wray
Abstract: We study the superselection sectors of two quantum lattice systems stacked onto each other in the operator algebraic framework. We show in particular that all irreducible sectors of a stacked system are unitarily equivalent to a product of irreducible sectors of the factors. This naturally leads to a faithful functor between the categories for each system and the category of the stacked system. We construct an intermediate `product' category which we then show is equivalent to the stacked system category. As a consequence, the sectors associated with an invertible state are trivial, namely, invertible states support no anyonic quasi-particles.

Title: Bootstrapping Euclidean Two-point Correlators
Authors: Minjae Cho, Barak Gabai, Henry W. Lin, Jessica Yeh, Zechuan Zheng
Abstract: We develop a bootstrap approach to Euclidean two-point correlators, in the thermal or ground state of quantum mechanical systems. We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become "inequalities of motion" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap.

Title: Detecting the purely imaginary Fisher zeros of an Ising spin system on a quantum computer
Authors: A. R. Kuzmak, V. M. Tkachuk
Abstract: We propose a protocol for studying the purely imaginary Fisher zeros of the Ising model on a quantum computer. Our protocol is based on the direct relation between the partition function for purely imaginary temperature and the evolution operator of the Ising model. In this case, the inverse temperature is equal to the time of evolution. This protocol allows one to measure the zeros only those localized on the imaginary axes. We test this protocol on the ibm-lagos quantum computer in the cases of a 3-spin chain and a triangle cluster in a purely imaginary magnetic field, as well as a 7-spin cluster in which the interaction between spins reproduces the architecture of the quantum computer.

Title: Trapped-ion toolbox to simulate quantum Otto heat engines
Authors: Rogério Jorge de Assis, Ciro Micheletti Diniz, Norton Gomes de Almeida, Celso Jorge Villas-Bôas
Abstract: We present a scheme that utilizes an ion confined within a bi-dimensional trap to simulate a quantum Otto heat engine whose working substance is a two-level system. In this scheme, the electronic component of the ion (the two-level system) can interact with effective heat reservoirs of different types. We specifically focus on effective thermal reservoirs (those with positive temperatures), effective heat reservoirs with apparent negative temperatures, and effective squeezed thermal reservoirs. We show how to generate these effective reservoirs and provide numerical results to illustrate the applicability of the presented scheme. Finally, considering the same types of effective heat reservoirs, we briefly discuss the simulation of a quantum Otto heat engine where a quantum harmonic oscillator serves as the working substance.

Title: Natural gradient and parameter estimation for quantum Boltzmann machines
Authors: Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semi-definite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we establish formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.

Title: Experimental observation of non-Markovian quantum exceptional points
Authors: Hao-Long Zhang, Pei-Rong Han, Fan Wu, Wen Ning, Zhen-Biao Yang, Shi-Biao Zheng
Abstract: One of the most remarkable features that distinguish open systems from closed ones is the presence of exceptional points (EPs), where two or more eigenvectors of a non-Hermitian operator coalesce, accompanying the convergence of the correcponding eigenvalues. So far, EPs have been demonstrated on a number of platforms, ranging from classical optical systems to fully quantum-mechanical spin-boson models. In these demonstrations, the reservoir that induced the non-Hermiticity was treated as a Markovian one, without considering its memory effect. We here present the first experimental demonstration of non-Markovian quantum EPs, engineered by coupling a Josephson-junction-based qubit to a leaky electromagnetic resonator, which acts as a non-Markovian reservoir. We map out the spectrum of the extended Liouvillian superoperator by observing the quantum state evolution of the qubit and the pseudomode, in which the memory of the reservoir is encoded. We identify a two-fold second-order EP and a third-order EP in the Liouvillian spectrum, which cannot be realized with a Markovian reservoir. Our results pave the way for experimental exploration of exotic phenomena associated with non-Markovian quantum EPs.

Title: Rydberg atomic polarimetry of radio-frequency fields
Authors: Matthew Cloutman, Matthew Chilcott, Alexander Elliott, J. Susanne Otto, Amita B. Deb, Niels Kjærgaard
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization. In particular, it calls into question prevailing interpretations of SI-traceable Rydberg atom electrometers.

Title: Logical channel for heralded and pure loss with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code
Authors: Tom B. Harris, Takaya Matsuura, Ben Q. Baragiola, Nicolas C. Menicucci
Abstract: Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for "heralded loss," when the light scattered out of the signal mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production.

Title: Broadband Kinetic-Inductance Parametric Amplifiers with Impedance Engineering
Authors: Chih-Chiao Hung, Hiroki Kutsuma, Chung Wai Sandbo Chang, Arjan Ferdinand van Loo, Yasunobu Nakamura
Abstract: Broadband quantum-limited parametric amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in quantum information science and technology. Impedance-engineered resonator-based PAs and traveling-wave PAs are the primary approaches to overcome the gain-bandwidth constraint. While the former PAs are simpler to fabricate, the target characteristic impedance Z_\text{NR} of the nonlinear resonator has been restricted to be below 10 \Omega, requiring large capacitance. Moreover, these PAs have only been implemented with aluminum-based Josephson junctions (JJs), hindering their operation at high temperatures or strong magnetic fields. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage impedance-transformer scheme, showcased with a 20-nm-thick, 250-nm-wide high-kinetic-inductance niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN) film. Our scheme enables Z_\text{NR} up to several tens of ohms--a tenfold improvement over conventional designs, achieved through an additional quarter-wavelength transmission line with the characteristic impedance of 180 \Omega. Our kinetic-inductance impedance-engineered parametric amplifiers (KIMPA), featuring a 330-fF shunt capacitor, demonstrate a phase-preserving amplification with a 450-MHz bandwidth at 17-dB gain, and an added noise ranging from 0.5-1.3 quanta near the center frequency of 8.4 GHz. Due to the high critical current of the NbTiN nanowire, the KIMPA also achieves a saturation power of up to -68\pm3 dBm, approximately 30-dB higher than that of JJ-based PAs. This scheme also opens new possibilities for other three-wave-mixing building blocks.

Title: Barren-plateau free variational quantum simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theories
Authors: Fariha Azad, Matteo Inajetovic, Stefan Kühn, Anna Pappa
Abstract: In this work, we design a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) suitable for investigating ground states and static string breaking in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT). We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore, strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.

Title: Strong Confinement of a Nanodiamond in a Needle Paul Trap: Towards Matter-Wave Interferometry with Massive Objects
Authors: Peter Skakunenko, Daniel Folman, Yaniv Bar-Haim, Ron Folman
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the nanodiamond together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work, we achieve strong confinement of a levitated particle, which is crucial for angular confinement, precise positioning, and perhaps also advantageous for deep cooling. We designed a needle Paul trap with a controllable distance between the electrodes, giving rise to a strong electric gradient. By combining it with an effective charging method - electrospray - we reach a trap frequency of up to 40 kHz, which is more than twice the state of the art. We believe that the designed trap could become a significant tool in the hands of the community working towards massive matter-wave interferometry. We would be happy to make more details available upon request.

Title: Free expansion of a charged nanoparticle via electrostatic compensation
Authors: David Steiner, Yaakov Y. Fein, Gregor Meier, Stefan Lindner, Paul Juschitz, Mario A. Ciampini, Markus Aspelmeyer, Nikolai Kiesel
Abstract: Coherent wavepacket expansion is a key component of recent proposals aiming to create non-classical states of a levitated dielectric nanoparticle. Free evolution, i.e., releasing the particle from its harmonic trapping potential and allowing its position variance to grow, is a simple but effective expansion scheme, but requires accurate force compensation to avoid significant mean displacements of the wavepacket during the free evolution. Here, using an optical trap-release-recapture sequence, we demonstrate an electrostatic compensation technique that enables free evolution without significant mean displacement in 3D, successfully compensating both gravity and stray electric fields. To achieve 100 microsecond free evolution times with charged particles, we developed methods to map and correct for force cross-talk, as well as to control the environmental charge state. Combined with a low decoherence environment, our approach enables the preparation of largely delocalized states without the need for long freefall trajectories or a low-gravity environment.

Title: Re-uploading quantum data: A universal function approximator for quantum inputs
Authors: Hyunho Cha, Daniel K. Park, Jungwoo Lee
Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.

Title: Scrambling-Enhanced Quantum Battery Charging in Black Hole Analogues
Authors: Zhilong Liu, Ying Li, Zehua Tian, Jieci Wang
Abstract: Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, we explore how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches of preset scrambling parameters. Our analysis reveals that the intentionally engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters could significantly enhance both maximum stored energy $E_{\max}$ and peak charging power $P_{\max}$ in the quench charging protocol. Furthermore, the peaks of extractable work and stored energy coincide. This is because the system's evolution under a weak perturbation remains close to the ground state, resulting in a passive state energy nearly identical to the ground state energy. The optimal charging time $\tau_*$ exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon parameter $x_{h0}$, while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench horizon parameter $x_{ht}$. This temporal compression confines high-power operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling $x_{ht} > x_{h0}$, demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling dynamics.

Title: Beyond the Carnot limit: work extraction via an entropy battery
Authors: Liam Judd McClelland
Abstract: Heat is a physical manifestation of entropy, where the removal of entropy from a thermal energy reservoir permits the conversion of heat into work. This entropy transfer is facilitated by the cold thermal energy reservoir in typical heat engines. Recent developments in quantum heat engines that operate between thermal energy and spin angular momentum reservoirs show that it is possible to transfer entropy out of energy and into a different conserved quantity. The implications of this type of entropy transfer have not been fully explored, especially on the work extractable using an ensemble with multiple conserved quantities. Using the aforementioned heat engines, we show that such an ensemble will transform heat into work beyond the Carnot efficiency limit while operating at maximum power. This result is obtained without induced quantum coherence, a technique commonly used in the field of quantum heat engines to achieve the same outcome. Without loss of generality, we also show that thermal spin reservoirs behave as thermodynamic baths with well-defined temperatures, heat capacities, and fluctuation-dissipation relations. Finally, our analysis of entropy capacity suggests that particle indistinguishability is necessary for inter-particle interactions, and for entropy to transfer between canonical ensembles. These results establish a foundation for entropy-based quantum devices that extract work from a hot thermal energy reservoir more efficiently than possible with a cold thermal energy reservoir. These devices also act as high energy-density batteries and efficient heat storage systems. Our results will have implications for quantum heat engines, spinor condenstates, spintronics, and quantum batteries.

Title: High-Fidelity Scalable Quantum State Preparation via the Fusion Method
Authors: Matthew Patkowski, Onat Ayyildiz, Matjaž Kebrič, Katharine L. C. Hunt, Dean Lee
Abstract: Robust and efficient eigenstate preparation is a central challenge in quantum simulation. The Rodeo Algorithm (RA) offers exponential convergence to a target eigenstate but suffers from poor performance when the initial state has low overlap with the desired eigenstate, hindering the applicability of the original algorithm to larger systems. In this work, we introduce a fusion method that preconditions the RA state by an adiabatic ramp to overcome this limitation. By incrementally building up large systems from exactly solvable subsystems and using adiabatic preconditioning to enhance intermediate state overlaps, we ensure that the RA retains its exponential convergence even in large-scale systems. We demonstrate this hybrid approach using numerical simulations of the spin- 1/2 XX model and find that the Rodeo Algorithm exhibits robust exponential convergence across system sizes. We benchmark against using only an adiabatic ramp as well as using the unmodified RA, finding that for state preparation precision at the level of $10^{-3}$ infidelity or better there a decisive computational cost advantage to the fusion method. These results together demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the fusion method for practical quantum simulations.

Title: Dirac Equation and Representation Dependent Scattering Phenomena
Authors: Muhammad Adeel Ajaib
Abstract: We show that spin-flip probabilities emerge in the relativistic regime for scalar potentials, absent in the standard Dirac representation. We examine 1D scattering for the Dirac equation employing an alternate matrix representation introduced by the Author in an earlier study. We demonstrate that the transmission (T) and reflection (R) coefficients can depend on the chosen representation of the Clifford algebra despite the two representations being related by a unitary or non-unitary transformation. We also show that for the non-unitary case quantum interference may arise in scattering phenomena, a testable experimental signature. This representation dependence hints at hidden physics in how spinor components couple to external steps/barriers, even when the relativistic dispersion relation (E^2=p^2+m^2) is the same.

Title: On the origin of exponential operator growth in Hilbert space
Authors: Vijay Ganesh Sadhasivam, Jan M. Rost, Stuart C. Althorpe
Abstract: The question of thermalization in quantum many-body systems has long been studied through the properties of matrix elements of operators corresponding to local observables. More recently, the focus has shifted to the dynamics of operators, which lead to seminal works proposing universal bounds on the rate of operator growth. In this work, we unify these two approaches: we show that exponential operator growth in Hilbert space, as measured by Krylov complexity, is governed by an exponential off-diagonal decay of the operator matrix elements in the system eigenbasis. When this decay is algebraic or slower, the growth rate saturates the universal bound, thereby establishing a microscopic origin of operator growth which is independent of chaos, dimensionality or the presence of many-body interactions.

Title: Quantum-elevated Chiral Discrimination for Bio-molecules
Authors: Yiquan Yang, Xiaolong Hu, Wei Du, Shuhe Wu, Peiyu Yang, Guzhi Bao, Weiping Zhang
Abstract: Chiral discrimination of enantiomeric biomolecules is vital in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical chiral probes remain fundamentally bounded by the shot-noise limit due to quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate-photon-flux, high-sensitivity, quantum-noise-squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5 dB improvement beyond the SNL in distinguishing L- and D-amino acids in liquid phase. This non-destructive, biocompatible protocol enables high-sensitivity chiral analysis, with broad implications for drug development, biochemical research, environmental monitoring, and asymmetric synthesis.

Title: Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation
Authors: Amir Yona, Yaron Oz
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.

Title: Symmetry and Topology of Monitored Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Zhenyu Xiao, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces diverse phenomena in open quantum systems with no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.

Title: From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings
Authors: Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath, Simon B. Jäger
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.

Title: Can the latent signatures of quantum superposition be detected through correlation harvesting?
Authors: Yu Tang, Wentao Liu, Zhilong Liu, Jieci Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we explore correlation harvesting in quantum superposition, specifically focusing on the entanglement and mutual information extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in a mass-superposed BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that the superposed nature of spacetime induces constructive interference between the field modes that can significantly enhance the entanglement harvesting relative to a single spacetime background. In contrast to entanglement, the mutual information obtained in spacetime superposition is influenced by the proper distance between the two detectors. While the mutual information harvested in a superposed spacetime remains lower than that in a single spacetime when the proper distance between detectors is small, it exceeds that in a single spacetime for specific mass ratios as the distance increases. Notably, we find that both entanglement and mutual information harvesting reach their maxima when the final spacetime superposition state is conditioned to align with the initial spacetime state.

Title: Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter
Authors: M. Dey Chowdhury, J. P. Manley, C. A. Condos, A. R. Agrawal, D. J. Wilson
Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems have recently been proposed as detectors for ultralight dark matter, leveraging their ability to cool and probe mechanical oscillators at the quantum limit. Here we present a resonant search for ultralight dark matter using a cavity optomechanical accelerometer. The detector consists of a cryogenic Si$_3$N$_4$-membrane cavity mounted to a 4 K copper plate, with photothermal tuning used to scan its 39 kHz mechanical resonance. Shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation-pressure feedback cooling yield an acceleration sensitivity of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over 30 Hz near resonance. The detector's material inhomogeneity gives access to direct vector coupling to the dark-matter field. We conduct a Bayesian search based on matched-filter statistics, yielding upper bounds consistent with thermal noise and above those set by equivalence principle tests. No signal is observed, but the experiment demonstrates stable, quantum-limited operation and validates a scalable approach to resonant detection. With optimized test masses, lower temperature, and multiplexed arrays, the platform offers a path toward competitive constraints on vector-mediated dark-matter interactions.

Title: From Quantum Relative Entropy to the Semiclassical Einstein Equations
Authors: Philipp Dorau, Albert Much
Abstract: We provide arguments indicating that the semiclassical Einstein equations follow from quantum relative entropy and its proportionality to an area variation. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of the Einstein equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a central role in what is often seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.

Title: Controlled generation of 3D vortices in driven atomic Josephson junctions
Authors: Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Herwig Ott, Luigi Amico
Abstract: We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.
