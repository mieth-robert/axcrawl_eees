Title: Two-photon coupling via Josephson element II: Interaction renormalizations and cross-Kerr coupling
Authors: Eugene V. Stolyarov, V. L. Andriichuk, Andrii M. Sokolov
Abstract: We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.

Title: Free Fermion Dynamics with Measurements: Topological Classification and Adaptive Preparation of Topological States
Authors: Asadullah Bhuiyan, Haining Pan, Chao-Ming Jian
Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and (2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime \textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in \textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit protocol to coherent noise.

Title: Bipartite and tripartite entanglement in pure dephasing relativistic spin-boson model
Authors: Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura, Erickson Tjoa
Abstract: We study non-perturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model, equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) unlike the bipartite case where it is possible to generate close to maximally entangled states via the spin-boson interactions, the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement is non-perturbatively hard even at sufficiently long times. Result (iii), in particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a relativistic quantum field non-perturbatively requires either different probe-based techniques or variants of the UDW model. Along the way we provide the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground states in the Fock space.

Title: Emergent cavity-QED dynamics along the edge of a photonic lattice
Authors: Enrico Di Benedetto, Xuejian Sun, Marcel A. Pinto, Luca Leonforte, Chih-Ying Chang, Vincent Jouanny, Léo Peyruchat, Pasquale Scarlino, Francesco Ciccarello
Abstract: We investigate qubits coupled to the boundary of a two dimensional photonic lattice that supports dispersionless edge modes, unlike conventional edge modes that sustain propagating photons. As a case study, we consider a honeycomb lattice (photonic graphene) of coupled resonators with a zigzag edge, where the edge modes form a flat band defined only over a restricted region of momentum space. We show that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a dissipative cavity QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a fictitious cavity mode emerging as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has support on only one sublattice and, most notably, displays an unconventional power law localization around the qubit, yet remaining normalizable in the thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that can be tuned by introducing lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and efficient state transfer between distant emitters. An experimental demonstration using superconducting circuits is proposed.

Title: Scalable suppression of heating errors in large trapped-ion quantum processors
Authors: Zixuan Huo, Yangchao Shen, Xiao Yuan, Xiao-Ming Zhang
Abstract: Trapped-ion processors are leading candidates for scalable quantum computation. However, motional heating remains a key obstacle to fault-tolerant operation, especially when system size increases. Heating error is particularly challenging to suppress due to is incoherence nature, and no general methods currently exist for mitigating their impact even in systems with more than two ions. In this work, based on a careful analysis about the dependence of heating-induced infidelity on phase-space trajectories, we present a simple yet comprehensive framework for suppressing heating errors in large trapped-ion quantum processors. Our approach is flexible, allowing various control pulse bases, ion numbers, and noise levels. Our approach is also compatible with existing error-mitigation techniques, including those targeting laser phase and frequency noise. Crucially, it relies on an efficiently computable cost function that avoids the exponential overhead of full fidelity estimation. We perform numerical simulations for systems with up to 55 qubits, demonstrating up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in infidelities. These results offer a practical route toward robust, large-scale quantum computation with trapped ions.

Title: Growing Sparse Quantum Codes from a Seed
Authors: ChunJun Cao, Brad Lackey
Abstract: It is generally unclear whether smaller codes can be "concatenated" to systematically create quantum LDPC codes or their sparse subsystem code cousins where the degree of the Tanner graph remains bounded while increasing the code distance. In this work, we use a slight generalization of concatenation called conjoining introduced by the quantum lego formalism. We show that by conjoining only quantum repetition codes, one can construct quantum LDPC codes. More generally, we provide an efficient iterative algorithm for constructing sparse subsystem codes with a distance guarantee that asymptotically saturates $kd^2=O(n)$ in the worst case. Furthermore, we show that the conjoining of even just two-qubit quantum bit-flip and phase-flip repetition codes is quite powerful as they can create any CSS code. Therefore, more creative combinations of these basic code blocks will be sufficient for generating good quantum codes, including good quantum LDPC codes.

Title: Cryogenic Performance Evaluation of Commercial SP4T Microelectromechanical Switch for Quantum Computing Applications
Authors: Yong-Bok Lee, Connor Devitt, Xu Zhu, Nicholas Yost, Yabei Gu, Sunil A. Bhave
Abstract: Superconducting quantum computers have emerged as a leading platform for next-generation computing, offering exceptional scalability and unprecedented computational speeds. However, scaling these systems to millions of qubits for practical applications poses substantial challenges, particularly due to interconnect bottlenecks. To address this challenge, extensive research has focused on developing cryogenic multiplexers that enable minimal wiring between room-temperature electronics and quantum processors. This paper investigates the viability of commercial microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches for cryogenic multiplexers in large-scale quantum computing systems. DC and RF characteristics of the MEMS switches are evaluated at cryogenic temperatures (< 10 K) through finite element simulations and experimental measurements. Our results demonstrate that MEMS switches exhibit improved on-resistance, lower operating voltage, and superior RF performance at cryogenic temperatures, with reliable operation over 100 million cycles. Furthermore, stable single-pole four-throw (SP4T) switching and logical operations, including NAND and NOR gates, are demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures, validating their potential for quantum computing. These results underscore the promise of MEMS switches in realizing large-scale quantum computing systems.

Title: Enhanced image classification via hybridizing quantum dynamics with classical neural networks
Authors: Ruiyang Zhou, Saubhik Sarkar, Sougato Bose, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: The integration of quantum computing and machine learning has emerged as a promising frontier in computational science. We present a hybrid protocol which combines classical neural networks with non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum many-body system for image classification. This architecture leverages classical neural networks to efficiently process high-dimensional data and encode it effectively on a quantum many-body system, overcoming a challenging task towards scaled up quantum computation. The quantum module further capitalizes on the discriminative properties of many-body quantum dynamics to enhance classification accuracy. By mapping images from distinct classes to nearly-orthogonal quantum states, the system maximizes separability in the Hilbert space, enabling robust classification. We evaluate the performance of our model on several benchmark datasets with various number of features and classes. Moreover, we demonstrate the key role of the quantum module in achieving high classification accuracy which cannot be accomplished by the classical neural network alone. This showcases the potential of our hybrid protocol for achieving practical quantum advantage and paves the way for future advancements in quantum-enhanced computational techniques.

Title: Forward-Time Equivalent of a "Retrocausal" Diffusion Hidden Variable Model for Quantum Mechanics
Authors: William S. DeWitt, Benjamin H. Feintzeig
Abstract: A recently proposed stochastic hidden variable model for quantum mechanics has been claimed to involve "retrocausality" due to the appearance of equations of motion with future-time boundary conditions. We formulate an equivalent system of forward-time equations of motion that gives rise to the same trajectories as solutions, but involves only initial-time boundary conditions. The forward-time dynamics involves a guidance term for the dynamical variables, determined by the phase-space distribution corresponding to a quantum wavefunction. We show, however, that this particular guidance term can be recovered as the mean-field limit of averaged pairwise interactions among an ensemble of finitely many particles.

Title: SAQR-QC: A Logic for Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning about Quantum Circuits
Authors: Nengkun Yu, Jens Palsberg, Thomas Reps
Abstract: Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient--even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning about Quantum Circuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, all reasoning steps are local--i.e., they each involve just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation--a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.

Title: Fast computational deep thermalization
Authors: Shantanav Chakraborty, Soonwon Choi, Soumik Ghosh, Tudor Giurgică-Tiron
Abstract: Deep thermalization refers to the emergence of Haar-like randomness from quantum systems upon partial measurements. As a generalization of quantum thermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement. Here, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest possible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit dynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth that are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally bounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies of the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the state -- this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum pseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms, these states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these properties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of computational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from structured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of from highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing these states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum computers. Our work also motivates the study of computational quantum pseudorandomness beyond BQP observers.

Title: Solving wave equation problems on D-Wave quantum annealers
Authors: Aigerim Bazarkhanova, Alejandro J. Castro, Antonio A. Valido
Abstract: We solve the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation in several scenarios using the quantum annealer provided by the D-Wave systems within a pseudospectral scheme, where its solution is encoded into certain set of suitable basis functions. We assess the performance of different strategies of encoding based on algebraic arguments and the adiabatic condition, and benchmark these against the classical heuristic simulating annealing algorithm. In particular, we compute the minimum energy gap, the so-called dynamic range and the mean squared error to assess the numerical stability, consistency and accuracy of the solutions returned by each strategy. Our work stresses out the importance of developing custom embedded techniques ensuring well-conditioned algebraic systems. In particular, we find out that encoding strategies retrieving algebraic systems exhibiting full-rank and small dynamic ranges enhance the performance of the quantum annealer even under polychromatic driving and for intricate initial conditions. We further discuss the prospect of developing hybrid quantum-classical schemes enable to meet suitable algebraic and adiabatic conditions simultaneously.

Title: A machine learning based approach to the identification of spectral densities in quantum open systems
Authors: Jessica Barr, Shreyasi Mukherjee, Alessandro Ferraro, Mauro Paternostro, Giorgio Zicari
Abstract: We present a machine learning-based approach for characterising the environment that affects the dynamics of an open quantum system. We focus on the case of an exactly solvable spin-boson model, where the system-environment interaction, whose strength is encoded in the spectral density, induces pure dephasing. By using artificial neural networks trained on the Fourier-transformed time evolution of some observables of the system, we perform both classification -- distinguishing sub-Ohmic, Ohmic, and super-Ohmic spectral densities -- and regression -- thus estimating key parameters of the spectral density function, when the latter is expressed through a power law. Our results demonstrate high classification accuracy and robust parameter estimation, highlighting the potential of machine learning as a powerful tool for probing environmental features in quantum systems and advancing quantum noise spectroscopy.

Title: Error exponents for tripartite-to-bipartite entanglement transformations
Authors: Péter Vrana
Abstract: We consider distillation of ebits between a specified pair of subsystems from pure tripartite states by local operations and classical communication. It is known that, allowing an asymptotically vanishing error, the maximal rate is the minimum of the von Neumann entropies of the two corresponding marginals, and under asymptotic stochastic local operations and classical communication the maximal rate is given by a minimization over a one-parameter family of entanglement measures. In this paper, we determine the direct and strong converse error exponents, and the optimal rate for deterministic transformations.

Title: Chirally Frustrated Superradiant Phases in a Jaynes-Cummings Trimer
Authors: Lin-Lin Jiang, Xuan Xie, Lin Tian, Jin-Feng Huang
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of frustrated quantum phases in a Jaynes-Cummings (JC) trimer with complex hopping amplitudes between the cavities, which represents the smallest frustrated unit in light-matter systems. The complex hopping amplitudes that can be engineered via synthetic gauge fields introduce chiral effects and geometric frustration into the this http URL obtain analytic solutions in the semiclassical limit and map out the phase diagram of this model, featuring one normal and three distinct superradiant phases. Among these phases, a chirally frustrated superradiant phase emerges, characterized by broken chiral and translational symmetries and unidirectional photon flow. These results reveal how frustration and symmetry breaking can arise in JC systems with synthetic gauge fields and ultrastrong coupling.

Title: Quantum Shadows: The Dining Information Brokers
Authors: Theodore Andronikos, Constantinos Bitsakos, Konstantinos Nikas, Georgios I. Goumas, Nectarios Koziris
Abstract: This article introduces the innovative Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem, presenting a novel entanglement-based quantum protocol to address it. The scenario involves $n$ information brokers, all located in distinct geographical regions, engaging in a metaphorical virtual dinner. The objective is for each broker to share a unique piece of information with all others simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, this protocol enables a fully parallel, single-step communication exchange among all brokers, regardless of their physical locations. A key feature of this protocol is its ability to ensure both the anonymity and privacy of all participants are preserved, meaning no broker can discern the identity of the sender behind any received information. At its core, the Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem serves as a conceptual framework for achieving anonymous, untraceable, and massively parallel information exchange in a distributed system. The proposed protocol introduces three significant advancements. First, while quantum protocols for one-to-many simultaneous information transmission have been developed, this is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first quantum protocols to facilitate many-to-many simultaneous information exchange. Second, it guarantees complete anonymity and untraceability for all senders, a critical improvement over sequential applications of one-to-many protocols, which fail to ensure such robust anonymity. Third, leveraging quantum entanglement, the protocol operates in a fully distributed manner, accommodating brokers in diverse spatial locations. This approach marks a substantial advancement in secure, scalable, and anonymous communication, with potential applications in distributed environments where privacy and parallelism are paramount.

Title: Quantum chaos and semiclassical behavior in mushroom billiards I: Spectral statistics
Authors: Matic Orel, Črt Lozej, Marko Robnik, Hua Yan
Abstract: We study the aspects of quantum chaos in mushroom billiards introduced by Bunimovich. This family of billiards classically has the property of mixed phase space with precisely one entirely regular and one fully chaotic (ergodic) component, whose size depends on the width w of the stem, and has two limiting geometries, namely the circle (as the integrable system) and stadium (as the fully chaotic system). Therefore, this one-parameter system is ideal to study the semiclassical behavior of the quantum counterpart. Here, in paper I, we study the spectral statistics as a function of the geometry defined by w, and as a function of the semiclassical parameter k, which in this case is just the wavenumber k. We show that at sufficiently large k the level spacing distribution is excellently described by the Berry-Robnik (BR) distribution (without fitting). At lower k the small deviations from it can be well described by the Berry-Robnik-Brody (BRB) distribution, which captures the effects of weak dynamical localization of Poincaré-Husimi functions. We also employ the analytical theory of the level spacing ratios distribution P(r) for mixed-type systems, recently obtained by Yan (2025), which does not require a spectral unfolding procedure, and show excellent agreement with numerics in the semiclassical limit of large k. In paper II we shall analyze the eigenstates by means of Poincaré-Husimi functions.

Title: Quantifying mixed-state entanglement via partial transpose and realignment moments
Authors: Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Tobias Haug
Abstract: Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science and many-body physics, yet quantifying it in mixed quantum many-body systems has remained a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we introduce families of quantitative entanglement witnesses, constructed from partial transpose and realignment moments, which provide rigorous bounds on entanglement monotones. Our witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell measurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware. Leveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement properties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics. We develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded entropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for pure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank using only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using four-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of quantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has been limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement phase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose negativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result that also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of entanglement in extensive many-body systems. Finally, we make progress on the entanglement required for quantum cryptography, establishing rigorous limits on pseudoentanglement and pseudorandom density matrices with bounded entropy. Our work opens new avenues for quantifying entanglement in large and noisy quantum systems.

Title: Nonequilibrium steady states in multi-bath quantum collision models
Authors: Ronan McElvogue, Andrew K. Mitchell, Gabriel T. Landi, Steve Campbell
Abstract: Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the same thermal steady state for both settings as $\Delta t\to 0$, although even in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents. Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme. Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of non-Markovian interactions.

Title: Role of quantum state texture in probing resource theories and quantum phase transition
Authors: Ayan Patra, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Building on the recently developed quantum state texture resource theory, we exhibit that the difference between maximum and minimum textures is a valid purity monotone in any dimension and provide a lower bound for existing purity measures. We introduce a texture-based resource monotone applicable across general convex resource theories, encompassing quantum coherence, non-stabilizerness, and entanglement. In particular, we propose the notion of non-local texture, which corresponds to the geometric measure of bipartite and multipartite entanglement in pure states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the texture of the entire ground state or its subsystems can effectively signal quantum phase transitions in the Ising chain under both transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields, offering a powerful tool for characterizing quantum criticality.

Title: Robustness of analogue Hawking radiation in cavities with moving boundaries
Authors: Alberto García Martín-Caro, Javier Olmedo, Jose M. Sánchez Velázquez
Abstract: In this work we explore the limitations and robustness of thermal radiation in dynamical Casimir systems serving as analogs for Hawking radiation. Through detailed numerical analysis, we characterize particle production spectra in cavities with moving boundaries under various configurations, including expanding, collapsing, and rigidly accelerating scenarios. We find that thermal signatures emerge in specific expanding cavity configurations but are highly dependent on frequency bands and acceleration parameters. In those configurations of the cavity where there is thermal production, we derive fitting expressions that quantify deviations from idealized thermal spectra through gray-body factors, revealing oscillatory behaviors tied to acceleration duration. Our results identify which experimental setups can reliably simulate gravitationally-induced phenomena and quantify how finite-size effects and transient dynamics modify the expected thermal distributions, providing a comprehensive framework for distinguishing genuine Hawking-like radiation from experimental artifacts.

Title: Exploring critical states of the quantum Rabi model via Hamiltonian variational ansätze
Authors: Mei Peng, Xu-Dan Xie, Dan-Bo Zhang
Abstract: Characterizing quantum critical states towards the thermodynamic limit is essential for understanding phases of matter. The power of quantum simulators for preparing the critical states relies crucially on the structure of quantum circuits and in return provides new insight into the critical states. Here, we explore the critical states of the quantum Rabi model~(QRM) by preparing them variationally with Hamiltonian variational ansätze~(HVA), in which the intricated interplay among different quantum fluctuations can be parameterized at different levels. We find that the required circuit depth scales linearly with the effective system size, suggesting that HVA can efficiently capture the behavior of critical states of QRM towards the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we reveal that HVA gradually squeeze the initial state to the target critical state, with a number of blocks increasing only linearly with the effective system size. Our work suggests variational quantum algorithm as a new probe for the complicated critical states.

Title: Broadband and long-duration optical memory in Yb:YSO
Authors: T. Sanchez Mejia, L. Nicolas, A. Gelmini Rodriguez, M. Afzelius
Abstract: Optical quantum memories are essential components for realizing the full potential of quantum networks. Among these, rare-earth-doped crystal memories stand out due to their large multimode storage capabilities. To maximize the multimode capacity in the time domain, it is key to simultaneously achieve large memory bandwidth and long optical storage time. Here, we demonstrate an atomic frequency comb optical memory in Yb:YSO, with a memory bandwidth of 250~MHz and a storage time of up to 125 $\mu$s. The efficiency reaches 20 \% at short storage times, and 5 \% at 125 $\mu$s. These results were enabled by an optimized optical pumping scheme, guided by numerical modelling. Our approach is specifically designed for future spin-wave storage experiments, with the theoretical bandwidth limit set at 288 MHz by the hyperfine structure of Yb:YSO. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for synthesizing the optical pumping waveforms required for generating combs with tens of thousands of teeth, as well as a simple yet frequency-agile laser setup for optical pumping across a 10 GHz bandwidth.

Title: The Proportional Fair Scheduler in Wavelength-Multiplexed Quantum Networks
Authors: Sanidhay Bhambay, Siddarth Koduru Joshi, Thirupathaiah Vasantam, Neil Walton
Abstract: We address the problem of optimal pumping strategies in quantum networks. These networks enable secure communication by distributing entangled photon pairs to user (or node) pairs. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, like BBM92, generate secret keys from entangled photons. While secure communication and error correction are essential for any quantum communication channel, resource contention, optimization, and fairness issues are critical for networks. In this article, we analyze the performance of quantum networks, proposing simple distributed algorithms for QKD networks generating secret keys. There are significant advantages of pumping entangled photons in QKD networks, but challenges arise in practical implementations. The underlying channels are inherently time-varying, and thus data rates fluctuate between nodes. Moreover, multiple edges (node pairs) can be pumped simultaneously, albeit at the cost of a reduced secret key rate (SKR). These temporal and spatial constraints yield a complex decision-making problem whose solutions may favor a small set of user pairs to the detriment of overall, long-run network performance. We design adaptive pumping strategies that address these challenges in QKD networks. In particular, we find that a proportional fairness pumping strategy (PF-PS) stands out by dynamically prioritizing users with lower average secret key rates and optimally balancing fairness with throughput. The proposed algorithm is a natural extension to quantum networks of the Proportional Fair Scheduler deployed in 4G LTE and 5G mobile networks. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that PF-PS is optimal for entangled state distribution, and thus, when adapted appropriately, proportional fair pumping is a strong candidate for efficient resource allocation in quantum networks.

Title: Definition of Current in Non-Hermitian Quantum Systems
Authors: Hiroto Oka
Abstract: In recent years, non-Hermitian quantum systems (NHQS) have been actively studied. In conventional quantum mechanics, Hermitisity is a fundamental property of Hamiltonians. However, it is known that when a system interacts with its environment, its time evolution can be effectively described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. NHQS are attracting attention because novel physical phenomena not observed in Hermitian systems are predicted due to its non-Hermitisity. In this study, I investigated the definition of current in NHQS. In Hermitian systems, equation of continuity(EOC) holds between the particle density and the current. However, in NHQS, there are cases where the conventional definition of current does not satisfy EOC. Therefore, I considered the definition of current that satisfies EOC in NHQS. As a result, I derived current that satisfies EOC and behaves similarly to the current in Hermitian systems with respect to physical quantities (electromagnetic fields).

Title: Fabrication of oriented NV center arrays in diamond via femtosecond laser writing and reorientation
Authors: Kai Klink, Andrew Raj Kirkpatrick, Yukihiro Tadokoro, Jonas Nils Becker, Shannon Singer Nicley
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely recognized as highly promising solid-state quantum sensors due to their long room temperature coherence times and atomic-scale size, which enable exceptional sensitivity and nanoscale spatial resolution under ambient conditions. Ultrafast laser writing has demonstrated the deterministic spatial control of individual NV$^-$ centers, however, the resulting random orientation of the defect axis limits the magnetic field sensitivity and signal contrast. Here, we present an all-optical approach for reorienting laser-written NV$^-$ centers to lie along a specific crystallographic axis using femtosecond laser annealing. This technique enables the creation of spatially ordered NV$^-$ arrays with uniform orientation, for enhancing performance for quantum magnetometry. We achieve deterministic alignment along the optical axis in both (100)- and (111)-oriented diamond substrates, paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum devices based on orientation-controlled NV$^-$ centers.

Title: Spontaneous emission in dipole approximation -- revisited
Authors: Paul R. Berman, Peter W. Milonni
Abstract: Spontaneous emission in dipole approximation is studied theoretically using both source-field theory and a Schrodinger picture approach. Using source-field theory we obtain formal equations for the Poynting vector and energy density without making the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). The initial condition at t=0 is one in which the atom is in an excited state and the field in the vacuum state. The source-field expressions are evaluated within the the RWA and WWA and are found to satisfy Poynting's theorem. To explore the consequences of not making the RWA and WWA, the Poynting vector and energy density are calculated using perturbation theory. We use a Schrodinger picture approach and essentially reproduce and complement the results of Compagno, Passante, and Persico [J. Mod. Optics 37:8, 1377 (2007)] and those of Power and Thirunamachandran [Phys. Rev. A 45, 54 (1992)] obtained using a Heisenberg picture approach. The theory involves a sum over field mode frequencies and both finite cutoffs and convergence factors are used to carry out the sums. It is shown that the perturbation theory calculation leads to unphysical values for atomic state populations for all times when a sum over all field frequencies is taken, even if a convergence factor is used. It is also proved that the fields calculated using source-field theory always satisfy Poynting's theorem for ct not equal to R, where R is the distance from the atom.

Title: Efficient Variational Dynamics of Open Quantum Bosonic Systems via Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Jacopo Tosca, Francesco Carnazza, Luca Giacomelli, Cristiano Ciuti
Abstract: We introduce a scalable variational method for simulating the dynamics of interacting open quantum bosonic systems deep in the quantum regime. The method is based on a multi-dimensional Wigner phase-space representation and employs a Variational Multi-Gaussian (VMG) ansatz, whose accuracy is systematically controlled by the number of Gaussian components. The variational equations of motion are derived from the Dirac-Frenkel principle and evaluated efficiently by combining the analytical structure of Gaussian functions with automatic differentiation. As a key application, we study a driven-dissipative two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard lattice with two-boson coherent driving and two-body losses. Using our dynamical approach, we compute the finite-size scaling of the Liouvillian spectral gap - extracted from the relaxation dynamics - which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal critical slowing down with dynamical exponents of the 2D quantum Ising universality class, demonstrating the power of our method to capture complex quantum dynamics in large open systems.

Title: Machine Learning-aided Optimal Control of a noisy qubit
Authors: Riccardo Cantone, Shreyasi Mukherjee, Luigi Giannelli, Elisabetta Paladino, Giuseppe Falci
Abstract: We apply a graybox machine-learning framework to model and control a qubit undergoing Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics from environmental noise. The approach combines physics-informed equations with a lightweight transformer neural network based on the self-attention mechanism. The model is trained on simulated data and learns an effective operator that predicts observables accurately, even in the presence of memory effects. We benchmark both non-Gaussian random-telegraph noise and Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise and achieve low prediction errors even in challenging noise coupling regimes. Using the model as a dynamics emulator, we perform gradient-based optimal control to identify pulse sequences implementing a universal set of single-qubit gates, achieving fidelities above 99% for the lowest considered value of the coupling and remaining above 90% for the highest.

Title: Quantum Boltzmann Machines using Parallel Annealing for Medical Image Classification
Authors: Daniëlle Schuman, Mark V. Seebode, Tobias Rohe, Maximilian Balthasar Mansky, Michael Schroedl-Baumann, Jonas Stein, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien, Florian Krellner
Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea of Noè et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM executions.

Title: Quantum and classical algorithms for SOCP based on the multiplicative weights update method
Authors: M. Isabel Franco Garrido, Alexander M. Dalzell, Sam McArdle
Abstract: We give classical and quantum algorithms for approximately solving second-order cone programs (SOCPs) based on the multiplicative weights (MW) update method. Our approach follows the MW framework previously applied to semidefinite programs (SDPs), of which SOCP is a special case. We show that the additional structure of SOCPs can be exploited to give better runtime with SOCP-specific algorithms. For an SOCP with $m$ linear constraints over $n$ variables partitioned into $r \leq n$ second-order cones, our quantum algorithm requires $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{r}\gamma^5 + \sqrt{m}\gamma^4)$ (coherent) queries to the underlying data defining the instance, where $\gamma$ is a scale-invariant parameter proportional to the inverse precision. This nearly matches the complexity of solving linear programs (LPs), which are a less expressive subset of SOCP. It also outperforms (especially if $n \gg r$) the naive approach that applies existing SDP algorithms onto SOCPs, which has complexity $\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{4}(n + \gamma \sqrt{n} + \sqrt{m}))$. Our classical algorithm for SOCP has complexity $\widetilde{O}(n\gamma^4 + m \gamma^6)$ in the sample-and-query model.

Title: Exploring near critical lattice gauge simulators with Rydberg atoms facilities
Authors: Avi Kaufman, James Corona, Zane Ozzello, Blake Senseman, Muhammad Asaduzzaman, Yannick Meurice
Abstract: We motivate the use of a ladder of Rydberg atoms as an analog simulator for a lattice gauge theory version of scalar electrodynamics also called the compact Abelian Higgs model. We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there appears to be some large enough size for which any given state is seen at most once with high probability. We show that the results presented can be extended to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the near future.

Title: On the relation between perspective-neutral, algebraic, and effective quantum reference frames
Authors: Philipp A. Hoehn, Julian De Vuyst, Artur Tsobanjan
Abstract: The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.

Title: Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?
Authors: Alan Sherry, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: The notion of $deep$ $thermalisation$, where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles constrained only by conservation laws, represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.

Title: An Adversarial Quantum Key Distribution Project
Authors: Brian R. La Cour, Noah A. Davis
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a popular introduction to quantum technologies used in education and public outreach, as very little background in quantum theory is needed and the practical applications are easily understood. There is considerably less exposure to the many real-world considerations of practical QKD, as access to the necessary hardware is quite limited. Here we describe a simple, simulation-based QKD project that can be implemented with only a minimal background in quantum concepts and programming. Students are assembled in small groups to develop an ``Alice and Bob'' protocol for securely distributing symmetric keys in a simulated noisy channel. Their protocol is then shared anonymously with another group who plays the role of Eve and attempts to steal as much secret key as possible. The adversarial aspect is popular with students, and the project itself provides a deeper understanding and appreciation for practical QKD.

Title: Information-Assisted Carnot Engine Surpasses Standard Thermodynamic Bounds
Authors: Yang Xiao, Qian Zeng, Jin Wang
Abstract: Information can improve heat engine performance, but the underlying principles are still not so clear. Here we introduce a Carnot information machine (CIE) and obtain a quantitative relationship between the engine performance and information. We demonstrate that the presence of information changes allows the CIE to operate as a heat engine in the regime where the standard Carnot cycle is prohibited, ensures that the efficiency of the CIE is greater than or equal to the standard Carnot efficiency, and significantly enables it to achieve 100\% efficiency with positive work extraction for arbitrary two-level systems. We explicitly demonstrate these features using a spin-1/2 system and propose an experimental implementation scheme based on a trapped $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion.

Title: Historical origins of quantum entanglement in particle physics
Authors: Yu Shi
Abstract: In this paper, the historical origins of quantum entanglement in particle physics are systematically and thoroughly investigated. 1957, Bohm and Aharonov noted that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation had been experimentally realised in the 1949 experiment of Chien-Shiung Wu and Shaknov. This was the first time in history that spatially separated quantum entanglement was explicitly realised in a controlled experiment. Wheeler first proposed such an experiment as a test of quantum electrodynamics, but his calculation was in error; the correct theoretical calculations came from Ward and Price, as well as from Snyder, Pasternack and Hornbostel, and the result was in accordance with Yang's 1949 selection rule. After the publication of Bell's inequality in 1964, it was considered whether it could be tested by using the Wu-Shaknov experiment. This gave an impetus to the field, and a new experiment was done by Wu's group, though it was not successful as a test of Bell inequality violation. In 1957, Tsung-Dao Lee, Reinhard Oehme and Chen Ning Yang established the quantum mechanical description of the kaons and found that the neutral kaon is a two-state system. In 1958, based on an approach similar to Yang's 1949 selection rule, Goldhaber, Lee and Yang were the first to write down the entangled states of kaon pairs, in which a single kaon can be charged or neutral. This gave, for the first time, quantum entanglement of internal degrees of freedom of high-energy particles other than photons. In 1960, as unpublished work, Lee and Yang discussed the consequences of quantum entanglement of neutral kaon pairs. We also describe several physicists in the past, especially Ward. A Chinese version of this paper was published in early 2023.

Title: Splitting of the three-body Förster resonance in Rb Rydberg atoms as a measure of dipole-dipole interaction strength
Authors: I.I.Ryabtsev, I.N.Ashkarin, I.I.Beterov, D.B.Tretyakov, E.A.Yakshina, V.M.Entin, P.Cheinet
Abstract: Three-body Förster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14 (2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body Förster resonance $3\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe the behavior of split structure of the Förster resonance depending on $R$. It is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.

Title: Spin-Electric Control of Individual Molecules on Surfaces
Authors: Paul Greule, Wantong Huang, Máté Stark, Kwan Ho Au-Yeung, Johannes Schwenk, Jose Reina-Gálvez, Christoph Sürgers, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer, Christoph Wolf, Philip Willke
Abstract: Individual magnetic molecules are promising building blocks for quantum technologies because of their chemical tunability, nanoscale dimensions, and ability to self-assemble into ordered arrays. However, harnessing their properties in quantum information processing requires precise local control of their spin properties. In this work, we present spin-electric coupling (SEC) for two molecular spin systems, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and Fe-FePc complexes, adsorbed on a surface. We use electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunnelling microscopy (ESR-STM) to locally address them with the STM tip and electrically tune them using the applied bias voltage. These measurements reveal a pronounced nonlinear voltage dependence of the resonance frequency, linked to the energic onset of other molecular orbitals. We attribute this effect to a transport-mediated exchange field from the magnetic tip, providing a large, highly localized, and broadly applicable SEC mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that the SEC enables all-electrical coherent spin control: In Rabi oscillation measurements of both single and coupled Fe-FePc complexes we show that the spin dynamics can be tuned, demonstrating a pathway towards electrically controlled quantum operation.

Title: Enhancing Coherence with a Clock Transition and Dynamical Decoupling in the Cr$_7$Mn Molecular Nanomagnet

Friedman (1,2) ((1) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Amherst College, Amherst, USA (2) Department of Physics, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, USA (3) Department of Chemistry, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK)
Abstract: Molecular magnets are attractive as spin qubits due to their chemical tunability, addressability through electron-spin resonance techniques, and long coherence times. Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the effect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to enhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that are not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn, a spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at temperatures $\le$2 K, $T_2\sim1$ $\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse sequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) oscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as high as $1.35$ $\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence preservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields $T_2\sim\!2.8$ $\mu$s at the CT and up to $\sim\!3.6$ $\mu$s in the ESEEM regime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental values of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the molecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much of the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules themselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not only field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency itself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a combination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise in the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$. Such information about the microscopic origins of decoherence can aid the rational design of molecular-based spin qubits.

Authors: Ziyang Chen, Yufei Zhang, Bin Luo, Hong Guo
Abstract: Optical time-frequency transfer establishes the metrological linkage in large-scale clock networks, which facilitates various applications. Fiber-based transfer benefits from the abundant deployment of fiber infrastructures to achieve this advantage. In this Review, we provide an overview of the advances in optical two-way time-frequency transfer, which began with characterizing the time-frequency transfer stability. Then, we discuss the system configuration, key modules, main challenges, and mainstream transfer methods. Finally, the Review concludes with an outlook on further applications toward global-scale high-precision clock networks.

Title: Robust Surface-Induced Enhancement of Exciton Transport in Magic-Angle-Oriented Molecular Aggregates
Authors: Siwei Wang, Liang-Yan Hsu, Hsing-Ta Chen
Abstract: Exciton transport in molecular aggregates with magic-angle orientation is expected to be strongly suppressed due to their negligible dipole-dipole interactions. However, recent reports show that light-matter interactions can significantly enhance exciton transport attributed to the effective long-range coupling mediated by the photonic fields. To elucidate their interplay, we employ the macroscopic quantum electrodynamics framework to simulate exciton transport within a chromophore array arranged in a magic-angle configuration in proximity to a silver surface. Our results show a significant enhancement of the exciton diffusion coefficient that is robust across variations in chromophore-surface separation, intermolecular distance, and molecular transition frequency. Furthermore, based on the image-dipole method, we derive analytical expressions that agree well with numerical simulations, revealing the enhancement's origin in the near-field coupling term as induced by the radiative scattering at the metallic surface. More importantly, we observe non-trivial differences in the diffusion coefficient's scaling near metallic surfaces compared to free space. Our findings highlight the potential to control exciton transport by designing coupled exciton-photon systems and engineering the dielectric environments.

Title: Resonant two-qubit gates for fermionic simulations with spin qubits
Authors: Konstantinos Tsoukalas, Alexei Orekhov, Bence Hetényi, Uwe von Lüpke, Jeth Arunseangroj, Inga Seidler, Lisa Sommer, Eoin G. Kelly, Leonardo Massai, Michele Aldeghi, Marta Pita-Vidal, Stephen W. Bedell, Stephan Paredes, Felix J. Schupp, Matthias Mergenthaler, Gian Salis, Andreas Fuhrer, Patrick Harvey-Collard
Abstract: In gate-defined semiconductor spin qubits, the highly tunable Heisenberg exchange interaction is leveraged to implement fermionic two-qubit gates such as CZ and SWAP. However, the broader family of fermionic simulation (fSim) gates remains unexplored, and has the potential to enhance the performance of near-term quantum simulation algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a method to implement the fSim gate set in spin qubits using a single pulse combining baseband and resonant exchange drives. This approach minimizes gate duration and drive amplitude, mitigating decoherence and crosstalk. We validate its effectiveness by realizing a resonant iSWAP gate between two hole spins in germanium, achieving a fidelity of 93.8(5)% extracted with interleaved randomized benchmarking. Quantum process tomography confirms accurate gate calibration and identifies qubit decoherence as the dominant error source. Our results establish a practical route toward a versatile and efficient two-qubit gate set for spin-based quantum processors.

Title: Intraband circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals
Authors: L. E. Golub, E. L. Ivchenko
Abstract: We apply the semiclassical theory including the Berry curvature dipole, side jumps and skew scattering for a quantitative description of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals at intraband absorption. In contrast to gapped systems where they completely exhaust all contributions to the CPGE current, all previously known semiclassical mechanisms give a result different from that obtained using a complete quantum-mechanical approach. We show that this difference in the existing quasiclassical and full quantum-mechanical approaches persists at all spatial ranges of the disorder potential. Apparently, the implementation of another microscopic mechanism into the quasiclassical description of the CPGE is required.

Title: Comparison of variational quantum eigensolvers in light nuclei
Authors: Miquel Carrasco-Codina, Emanuele Costa, Antonio Márquez Romero, Javier Menéndez, Arnau Rios
Abstract: Quantum computing is one of the most promising technologies of the near future, and the simulation of quantum many-body systems is a natural application. In this work, we present classical simulations of the ground states of light atomic nuclei within the $p$ shell, from $^{6}$He to $^{10}$B, calculated within the nuclear shell model. We compare the performance of two leading variational quantum eigensolver algorithms: the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) and the Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter (ADAPT) methods, introducing a new metric to quantify the use of quantum resources in each simulation. We find that Slater determinants are the most useful reference states for both approaches. Our analysis suggests that ADAPT is more efficient for nuclei close to magic numbers, while UCC tends to require fewer resources toward the mid shell. This work lays the groundwork for robust benchmarking of quantum algorithms in nuclear structure studies.

Title: Anomalous-magnetic-moment-enhanced Casimir effect
Authors: Daisuke Fujii, Katsumasa Nakayama, Kei Suzuki
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the impact of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of Dirac fermions on the fermionic Casimir effect under magnetic fields. We formulate it as an extension of the well-known Lifshitz formula. From our formula, we find that the AMM increases the fermionic Casimir energy. In particular, when the AMM is large enough, the Casimir energy is significantly enhanced by the gapless behavior of the lowest Landau level. We also quantitatively estimate the Casimir energy from electron, muon, and constituent quark fields under magnetic fields and propose possible phenomena at finite temperature and fermion density.

Title: Phenomenological characterization of the isomerization transition state of carbonyl sulfide
Authors: Amine Rafik, Jamil Khalouf-Rivera, F. Pérez-Bernal, Khadija Marakchi, Miguel Carvajal
Abstract: Signatures of excited-state quantum phase transitions in the bending degree of freedom of triatomic systems that undergo an isomerization reaction have been recently evinced. In this work, we study the carbonyl sulfide bending motion using an effective Hamiltonian within the two-dimensional limit of the vibron model framework, which has been shown to accurately describe critical phenomena in molecular bending spectra within experimental precision. To estimate the transition state energy barrier, we propose an improvement to a phenomenological formula proposed by Baraban et al.[1] , introducing a new term to capture the anharmonicity change that characterizes quasilinear molecules

Title: Transportable strontium lattice clock with $4 \times 10^{-19}$ blackbody radiation shift uncertainty
Authors: I. Nosske, C. Vishwakarma, T. Lücke, J. Rahm, N. Poudel, S. Weyers, E. Benkler, S. Dörscher, C. Lisdat
Abstract: We describe a transportable optical lattice clock based on the $^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow {^3\mathrm{P}_0}$ transition of lattice-trapped $^{87}$Sr atoms with a total systematic uncertainty of $2.1 \times 10^{-18}$. The blackbody radiation shift, which is the leading systematic effect in many strontium lattice clocks, is controlled at the level of $4.0 \times 10^{-19}$, as the atoms are interrogated inside a well-characterised, cold thermal shield. Using a transportable clock laser, the clock reaches a frequency instability of about $5 \times 10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, which enables fast reevaluations of systematic effects. By comparing this clock to the primary caesium fountain clocks CSF1 and CSF2 at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, we measure the clock transition frequency with a fractional uncertainty of $1.9\times 10^{-16}$, in agreement with previous results. The clock was successfully transported and operated at different locations. It holds the potential to be used for geodetic measurements with centimetre-level or better height resolution and for accurate inter-institute frequency comparisons.

Title: Fast charge noise sensing using a spectator valley state in a singlet-triplet qubit
Authors: David W. Kanaar, Yasuo Oda, Mark F. Gyure, J. P. Kestner
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits are a promising platform for quantum computing but remain vulnerable to charge noise. Accurate, in situ measurement of charge noise could enable closed-loop control and improve qubit performance. Here, we propose a method for real-time detection of charge noise using a silicon singlet-triplet qubit with one electron initialized in an excited valley state. This valley excitation acts as a spectator degree of freedom, coupled to a high-quality resonator via the exchange interaction, which is sensitive to charge-noise-induced voltage fluctuations. Dispersive readout of the resonator enables a continuous, classical measurement of exchange fluctuations during qubit operation. Signal-to-noise analysis shows that, under realistic device parameters, sub-microsecond measurement times are possible using a quantum-limited amplifier. Even without such an amplifier, sub-millisecond performance is achievable with appropriately engineered resonator parameters. This approach allows the probe to monitor slow drift in exchange in real time, opening the door to feedback and feedforward strategies for maintaining high-fidelity quantum operations. Importantly, the protocol preserves spin coherence and can be run concurrently with qubit logic gates.

Title: Learning the non-Markovian features of subsystem dynamics
Authors: Michele Coppola, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Zala Lenarčič
Abstract: The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.

Title: Exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric Heisenberg spin chain
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We construct the exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with integrable boundary fields. We find that the system exhibits two types of phases we refer to as $A$ and $B$ phases. In the $B$ type phase, the $\mathscr{PT}$- symmetry remains unbroken and it consists of eigenstates with only real energies, whereas the $A$ type phase contains a $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector comprised of eigenstates with only complex energies and a sector of unbroken $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry with eigenstates of real energies. The $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector consists of pairs of eigenstates whose energies are complex conjugates of each other. The existence of two sectors in the $A$ type phase is associated with the exponentially localized bound states at the edges with complex energies which are described by boundary strings. We find that both $A$ and $B$ type phases can be further divided into sub-phases which exhibit different ground states. We also compute the bound state wavefunction in one magnon sector and find that as the imaginary value of the boundary parameter is increased, the exponentially localized wavefunction broadens thereby protruding more into the bulk, which indicates that exponentially localized bound states may not be stabilized for large imaginary values of the boundary parameter.

Title: Bounding Entanglement Entropy with Clifford Double Cosets
Authors: Cynthia Keeler, William Munizzi, Jason Pollack
Abstract: Following on our previous work arXiv:2204.07593 and arXiv:2306.01043 studying the orbits of quantum states under Clifford circuits via `reachability graphs', we introduce `contracted graphs' whose vertices represent classes of quantum states with the same entropy vector. These contracted graphs represent the double cosets of the Clifford group, where the left cosets are built from the stabilizer subgroup of the starting state and the right cosets are built from the entropy-preserving operators. We study contracted graphs for stabilizer states, as well as W states and Dicke states, discussing how the diameter of a state's contracted graph constrains the `entropic diversity' of its $2$-qubit Clifford orbit. We derive an upper bound on the number of entropy vectors that can be generated using any $n$-qubit Clifford circuit, for any quantum state. We speculate on the holographic implications for the relative proximity of gravitational duals of states within the same Clifford orbit. Although we concentrate on how entropy evolves under the Clifford group, our double-coset formalism, and thus the contracted graph picture, is extendable to generic gate sets and generic state properties.

Title: Towards Fault-Tolerant Quantum Deep Learning: Designing and Analyzing Quantum ResNet and Transformer with Quantum Arithmetic and Linear Algebra Primitives
Authors: Xiao-Fan Xu, Cheng Xue, Xi-Ning Zhuang, Yun-Jie Wang, Tai-Ping Sun, Yu Fang, Jun-Chao Wang, Huan-Yu Liu, Yu-Chun Wu, Zhao-Yun Chen, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: Achieving a practical quantum speedup for deep neural networks (DNNs) remains a central yet elusive goal, hindered by the dual challenges of constructing deep architectures and the prohibitive overhead of data loading and measurement. We introduce a framework to overcome these barriers, specifically targeting an asymptotic speedup with respect to the large input dimensions of modern DNNs (e.g., sequence length or image size). Our framework enables the design of multi-layer Quantum ResNet and Quantum Transformer models by strategically decomposing tasks: computationally intensive operations on the large input dimension are assigned to quantum linear algebra subroutines, while operations on the smaller, fixed feature dimension are handled by efficient quantum arithmetic. A cornerstone of our approach is a novel data transfer protocol, Discrete Chebyshev Decomposition (DCD), which facilitates this modularity. Numerical validation reveals a pivotal insight: the measurement cost required to maintain a target accuracy scales sublinearly with the input dimension. This sublinear scaling is the key to preserving the quantum advantage, ensuring that I/O overhead does not nullify the computational gains. A rigorous resource analysis further corroborates the superiority of our models in both efficiency and flexibility. Powered by this targeted acceleration strategy and the efficiency of DCD, our framework establishes a viable path toward scalable quantum deep learning.

Abstract: Indistinguishability between photons is a key requirement for scalable photonic quantum technologies. We experimentally demonstrate that partly distinguishable single photons can be purified to reach near-unity indistinguishability by the process of quantum interference with ancillary photons followed by heralded detection of a subset of them. We report on the indistinguishability of the purified photons by interfering two purified photons and show improvements in the photon indistinguishability of $2.774(3)$\% in the low-noise regime, and as high as $10.2(5)$ \% in the high-noise regime.

Title: Unique entanglement time evolution of two-qubit product separable and extended Werner-like states in a discrete qubit environment
Authors: Renzo P. Alporha, Lemuel John F. Sese, Rayda P. Gammag
Abstract: This study investigates the parameters affecting the entanglement time evolution of product separable (PS) and extended Werner-like (EWL) states in homogeneous, white noise, and mixed environments. In a pure homogeneous environment, both states demonstrate complete entanglement revivals, where an increase in the number of environments leads to an attenuation of concurrence. The PS state exhibits gaps and never reaches a maximum entanglement, whereas maximum purity EWL states (Bell states) maintain or periodically reach maximum entanglement. Hence, the PS and EWL states have a disjoint entanglement time evolution subspaces. Interestingly, the environment interaction and subsystem coupling interaction that influence entanglement have an inverse time relationship under a constant value of concurrence. Placing the system of interest in a white noise environment induces entanglement dissipation, with the dissipation time dependent on the width of random distribution of interaction strengths rather than the magnitude of interaction strength. In a distinct qubit environment, the entanglement time evolution of the PS state depends on the distribution of the number of environments. Moreover, combining homogeneous and white noise environments results in entanglement dynamics that exhibit characteristics of both homogeneous and white noise.

Title: Dark-state engineering in Fock-state lattices
Authors: Xuan Zhao, Yi Xu, Le-Man Kuang, Jie-Qiao Liao
Abstract: Fock-state lattices (FSLs) are becoming an emerging research hotspot in quantum physics, not only because the FSLs provide a new perspective for studying atom-field interactions, but also because they build the connection between quantum optics and condensed matter physics. Owing to the multiple transition paths in the lattices, inherent quantum interference effect exists in these systems, and hence how to find new quantum coherent phenomena and exploit their applications becomes a significant and desired task in this field. In this work, we study the dark-state effect in the FSLs generated by the multimode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) models. By considering the FSLs in certain-excitation-number subspaces, we study the dark states with respect to the states associated with the atomic excited state using the arrowhead-matrix method. We find that there exist dark-state subspaces with the dimensions determined by the number of orthogonal dark states. When the dimension is larger than one, the forms of these dark-state bases are not unique. Further, we obtain the number and form of the orthogonal dark states in the two-, three-, and four-mode JC models. In addition, we find that for a general $N$-mode JC model, there are $C_{N+n-2}^{N-2}$ orthogonal dark states in the $n$-excitation subspace. We also build the relationship between the dark modes and dark states. Our work will pave the way for exploring quantum optical effects and quantum information processing based on the FSLs.

Title: High-dimensional counterdiabatic quantum computing
Authors: Diego Tancara, Francisco Albarrán-Arriagada
Abstract: The digital version of adiabatic quantum computing enhanced by counterdiabatic driving, known as digitized counterdiabatic quantum computing, has emerged as a paradigm that opens the door to fast and low-depth algorithms. In this work, we explore the extension of this paradigm to high-dimensional systems. Specifically, we consider qutrits in the context of quadratic problems, obtaining the qutrit Hamiltonian codifications and the counterdiabatic drivings. Our findings show that qutrits can improve the solution quality up to 90 times compared to the qubit counterpart. We tested our proposal on 1000 random instances of the multiway number partitioning, max 3-cut, and portfolio optimization problems, demonstrating that, in general, without prior knowledge, it is better to use qutrits and, apparently, high-dimensional systems in general instead of qubits. Finally, considering the state-of-the-art quantum platforms, we show the experimental feasibility of our high-dimensional counterdiabatic quantum algorithms at least in a fully digital form. This work paves the way for the efficient codification of optimization problems in high-dimensional spaces and their efficient implementation using counterdiabatic quantum computing.

Title: Detrimental non-Markovian errors for surface code memory
Authors: John F Kam, Spiro Gicev, Kavan Modi, Angus Southwell, Muhammad Usman
Abstract: The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers hinges on effective quantum error correction protocols, whose performance significantly relies on the nature of the underlying noise. In this work, we directly study the structure of non-Markovian correlated errors and their impact on surface code memory performance. Specifically, we compare surface code performance under non-Markovian noise and independent circuit-level noise, while keeping marginal error rates constant. Our analysis shows that while not all temporally correlated structures are detrimental, certain structures, particularly multi-time "streaky" correlations affecting syndrome qubits and two-qubit gates, can severely degrade logical error rate scaling. Furthermore, we discuss our results in the context of recent quantum error correction experiments on physical devices. These findings underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating non-Markovian noise toward achieving practical, fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: Generalized Liénard systems and isochronous connections
Authors: Bijan Bagchi, A. Ghose-Choudhury, Aritra Ghosh, Partha Guha
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of the nonlinear Liénard equation $\ddot{x} + k x \dot{x} + \omega^2 x + (k^2/9) x^3 = 0$, where $x=x(t)$ is a real variable and $k, \omega \in \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate that such an equation could be derived from an equation of the Levinson-Smith kind which is of the form $\ddot{z} + J(z) \dot{z}^2 + F(z) \dot{z} + G(z) = 0$, where $z=z(t)$ is a real variable and $\{J(z), F(z), G(z)\}$ are suitable functions to be specified. It can further be mapped to the harmonic oscillator by making use of a nonlocal transformation, establishing its isochronicity. Computations employing the Jacobi last multiplier reveal that the system exhibits a bi-Hamiltonian character, i.e., there are two distinct types of Hamiltonians describing the system. For each of these, we perform a canonical quantization in the momentum representation and explore the possibility of bound states. While one of the Hamiltonians is seen to exhibit an equispaced spectrum with an infinite tower of states, the other one exhibits branching but can be solved exactly in closed form for certain choices of the parameters.

Title: Indirect Communication Between Non-Markovian Baths
Authors: Ben S. Humphries, Dale Green, Garth A. Jones
Abstract: In this work we develop a model for an undamped vibration in the presence of an overdamped bath. This two-bath model involves a new derivation of the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) for an overdamped Lorentz-Drude (LD) environment that is summed together with an undamped oscillator (UO) bath, termed LDUO-HEOM. We show that information transfer occurs between the two baths, even in the absence of a direct coupling between the baths. This bath-system-bath, mediated information transfer leads to intricate non-Markovian dynamics. The model is analysed using expectation values of the bath coordinates and generates 2D electronic spectra that are in qualitative agreement with single-bath models. Furthermore, the model eliminates the additional superfluous damping introduced by the finite spectral width of the underdamped bath in our previous two-bath underdamped-overdamped, `bath vibration model' [J. Chem. Phys. 156, 084103 (2022)].

Title: Verifying a stabilizer state with few observables but many shots
Authors: Dirk Oliver Theis
Abstract: We propose a quantum-state-certification protocol for stabilizer states, motivated by application in in-situ testing of NISQ-era quantum computer systems: The number of qubits is bounded, and in terms of cost of running the protocol, identical repetition of quantum circuits contribute negligibly compared to switching the measurement bases. The method builds on Direct Fidelity Estimation and work by Somma et al.~(2006), but replaces linear averages by a minimum over estimates of expectation values. We provide mathematically rigorous analysis of the false-negative and false-positive rates.

Authors: Alasdair I. Fletcher, Cillian Harney, Masoud Ghalaii, Panagiotis Papanastasiou, Alexandros Mountogiannakis, Gaetana Spedalieri, Adnan A. E. Hajomer, Tobias Gehring, Stefano Pirandola
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.

Title: Generalized Entropic Quantum Speed Limits
Authors: Jucelino Ferreira de Sousa, Diego Paiva Pires
Abstract: We present a class of generalized entropic quantum speed limits based on $\alpha$-$z$-Rényi relative entropy, a real-valued, contractive, two-parameter family of distinguishability measures. The quantum speed limit (QSL) falls into the class of Mandelstam-Tamm bounds, and applies to finite-dimensional quantum systems that undergo a general physical process, i.e., their effective dynamics can be modeled by unitary or nonunitary evolutions. The results cover pure or mixed, separable, and entangled probe quantum states. The QSL time depends on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the probe and instantaneous states of the system, and its evaluation requires low computational cost. In addition, it is inversely proportional to the time-average of the Schatten speed of the instantaneous state, which in turn is fully characterized by the considered dynamics. We specialize our results to the case of unitary and nonunitary evolutions. In the former case, the QSL scales with the inverse of the energy fluctuations, while the latter depends on the Schatten $1$-norm of the rate of change of the quantum channel Kraus operators. We illustrate our findings for single-qubit and two-qubit states, and unitary and nonunitary evolutions. Our results may find applications in the study of entropic uncertainty relations, quantum metrology, and also entanglement entropies signaled by generalized entropies.

Title: On the Transfer of Knowledge in Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Esther Villar-Rodriguez, Eneko Osaba, Izaskun Oregi, Sebastián V. Romero, Julián Ferreiro-Vélez
Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to transform computational paradigms across science and industry. As the field evolves, it can benefit from established classical methodologies, including promising paradigms such as Transfer of Knowledge (ToK). This work serves as a brief, self-contained reference for ToK, unifying its core principles under a single formal framework. We introduce a joint notation that consolidates and extends prior work in Transfer Learning and Transfer Optimization, bridging traditionally separate research lines and enabling a common language for knowledge reuse. Building on this foundation, we classify existing ToK strategies and principles into a structured taxonomy that helps researchers position their methods within a broader conceptual map. We then extend key transfer protocols to quantum computing, introducing two novel use cases (reverse annealing and multitasking QAOA) alongside a sequential VQE approach that supports and validates prior findings. These examples highlight ToK's potential to improve performance and generalization in quantum algorithms. Finally, we outline challenges and opportunities for integrating ToK into quantum computing, emphasizing its role in reducing resource demands and accelerating problem-solving. This work lays the groundwork for future synergies between classical and quantum computing through a shared, transferable knowledge framework.

Title: Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics
Authors: Cesare Tronci, David Martínez-Crespo, François Gay-Balmaz
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual Rényi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.

Title: Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information
Authors: Nilachal Chakrabarti, Neha Nirbhan, Arpan Bhattacharyya
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.

Title: STQS: A Unified System Architecture for Spatial Temporal Quantum Sensing
Authors: Anastashia Jebraeilli, Chenxu Liu, Keyi Yin, Erik W Lentz, Yufei Ding, Ang Li
Abstract: Quantum sensing (QS) harnesses quantum phenomena to measure physical observables with extraordinary precision, sensitivity, and resolution. Despite significant advancements in quantum sensing, prevailing efforts have focused predominantly on refining the underlying sensor materials and hardware. Given the growing demands of increasingly complex application domains and the continued evolution of quantum sensing technologies, the present moment is the right time to systematically explore distributed quantum sensing architectures and their corresponding design space. We present STQS, a unified system architecture for spatiotemporal quantum sensing that interlaces four key quantum components: sensing, memory, communication, and computation. By employing a comprehensive gate-based framework, we systemically explore the design space of quantum sensing schemes and probe the influence of noise at each state in a sensing workflow through simulation. We introduce a novel distance-based metric that compares reference states to sensing states and assigns a confidence level. We anticipate that the distance measure will serve as an intermediate step towards more advanced quantum signal processing techniques like quantum machine learning. To our knowledge, STQS is the first system-level framework to integrate quantum sensing within a coherent, unified architectural paradigm. STQS provides seamless avenues for unique state preparation, multi-user sensing requests, and addressing practical implementations. We demonstrate the versatility of STQS through evaluations of quantum radar and qubit-based dark matter detection. To highlight the near-term feasibility of our approach, we present results obtained from IBM's Marrakesh and IonQ's Forte devices, validating key STQS components on present day quantum hardware.

Title: Public-Key Quantum Money and Fast Real Transforms
Authors: Jake Doliskani, Morteza Mirzaei, Ali Mousavi
Abstract: We propose a public-key quantum money scheme based on group actions and the Hartley transform. Our scheme adapts the quantum money scheme of Zhandry (2024), replacing the Fourier transform with the Hartley transform. This substitution ensures the banknotes have real amplitudes rather than complex amplitudes, which could offer both computational and theoretical advantages. To support this new construction, we propose a new verification algorithm that uses group action twists to address verification failures caused by the switch to real amplitudes. We also show how to efficiently compute the serial number associated with a money state using a new algorithm based on continuous-time quantum walks. Finally, we present a recursive algorithm for the quantum Hartley transform, achieving lower gate complexity than prior work and demonstrate how to compute other real quantum transforms, such as the quantum sine transform, using the quantum Hartley transform as a subroutine.

Title: How Likely Are You to Observe Non-locality with Imperfect Detection Efficiency and Random Measurement Settings?
Authors: Paweł Cieśliński, Tamás Vértesi, Mateusz Kowalczyk, Wiesław Laskowski
Abstract: Imperfect detection efficiency remains one of the major obstacles in achieving loophole-free Bell tests over long distances. At the same time, the challenge of establishing a common reference frame for measurements becomes more pronounced as the separation between parties increases. In this work, we tackle both of these issues by examining the impact of limited detection efficiency on the probability of Bell inequality violation with Haar random measurement settings. We derive analytical lower bounds on the violation probability for a two-qubit maximally entangled state, which is tight for correlation inequalities and perfect detection efficiencies. We further investigate it numerically for more qubits and settings using two detection efficiency models and an original method based on linear programming. Beyond that, we show that the so-called typicality of Bell inequality violation, i.e., almost certain violation of local realism with sufficiently many particles or random measurement directions, holds even if the detection efficiency is limited. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of measurement settings can compensate for efficiency losses above the critical threshold. We determine critical detection efficiencies for both two-party and three-party scenarios. For two parties, we recover previously established results, while for three parties, we derive a symmetric critical efficiency of $\eta_{crit} = 2/3$ for the W and GHZ states within the binning model. In cases involving the no-detection outcome, we present a modified inequality using a pair of orthogonal observables for each party with $\eta_{crit} \approx 0.7208$, which is notably less than 0.75 for the GHZ state. These results offer deeper insights into the limitations and possibilities for certifying non-locality in the presence of limited detection efficiency, shedding light on its robustness in practical Bell tests.

Title: Ideal Gas Law for a Quantum Particle
Authors: Alejandro M.F Rivas, Eduardo G. Vergini, Leonardo Ermann, Gabriel G. Carlo
Abstract: The question of how classical thermodynamic laws emerge from the underlying quantum substrate lies at the foundations of physics. Here, we examine the validity of the ideal gas law (IGL) for a single quantum particle confined within a two-dimensional cavity. By interpreting the quantum wave function as a probability density analogous to that of an ideal gas, we employ the energy equipartition principle to define the temperature of the quantum state. For the mean pressure we take two definitions, one straightforwardly based on the radiation pressure concept and the other taking advantage of a quasi-orthogonality relation valid for billiard eigenstates. We analyze systems with regular dynamics-the circular and rectangular billiards-and compare them with the classically chaotic Bunimovich stadium. We find that the IGL for the first definition of pressure holds exactly in isotropic systems (as the circular case), while for anisotropic geometries, quantum eigenfunctions generally conform to the IGL only on average, exhibiting meaningful deviations. These deviations are diminished in the presence of chaotic dynamics and for coherent states. This observation is consistent with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). Notably, the second definition of pressure allows for a good matching with the IGL.

Title: No Scratch Quantum Computing by Reducing Qubit Overhead for Efficient Arithmetics
Authors: Omid Faizy, Norbert Wehn, Paul Lukowicz, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis
Abstract: Quantum arithmetic computation requires a substantial number of scratch qubits to stay reversible. These operations necessitate qubit and gate resources equivalent to those needed for the larger of the input or output registers due to state encoding. Quantum Hamiltonian Computing (QHC) introduces a novel approach by encoding input for logic operations within a single rotating quantum gate. This innovation reduces the required qubit register $ N $ to the size of the output states $ O $, where $ N = \log_2 O $. Leveraging QHC principles, we present reversible half-adder and full-adder circuits that compress the standard Toffoli + CNOT layout [Vedral et al., PRA, 54, 11, (1996)] from three-qubit and four-qubit formats for the Quantum half-adder circuit and five sequential Fredkin gates using five qubits [Moutinho et al., PRX Energy 2, 033002 (2023)] for full-adder circuit; into a two-qubit, 4$\times $4 Hilbert space. This scheme, presented here, is optimized for classical logic evaluated on quantum hardware, which due to unitary evolution can bypass classical CMOS energy limitations to certain degree. Although we avoid superposition of input and output states in this manuscript, this remains feasible in principle. We see the best application for QHC in finding the minimal qubit and gate resources needed to evaluate any truth table, advancing FPGA capabilities using integrated quantum circuits or photonics.

Title: Quantum Framework for Simulating Linear PDEs with Robin Boundary Conditions
Authors: Nikita Guseynov, Xiajie Huang, Nana Liu
Abstract: We propose an explicit, oracle-free quantum framework for numerically simulating general linear partial differential equations (PDEs), extending previous work to incorporate (a) Robin boundary conditions - which include Neumann and Dirichlet conditions as special cases - (b) inhomogeneous terms, and (c) variable coefficients in space and time. Our approach begins with a general finite-difference discretization and applies the Schrodingerisation technique to transform the resulting system into one that admits unitary quantum evolution, enabling quantum simulation. For the Schrodinger equation corresponding to the discretized PDE, we construct an efficient block-encoding of the Hamiltonian $H$ that scales polylogarithmically with the number of grid points $N$. This encoding is compatible with quantum signal processing and allows for the implementation of the evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$. The oracle-free nature of our method permits complexity to be measured in fundamental gate units-namely, CNOT gates and single-qubit rotations-bypassing the inefficiencies of oracle queries. Consequently, the overall algorithm scales polynomially with $N$ and linearly with the spatial dimension $d$, achieving a polynomial speedup in $N$ and an exponential advantage in $d$, thereby mitigating the classical curse of dimensionality. The validity and efficiency of the proposed approach are further substantiated by numerical simulations. By explicitly defining the quantum operations and quantifying their resource requirements, our approach offers a practical alternative for numerically solving PDEs, distinct from others that rely on oracle queries and purely asymptotic scaling methods.

Title: Tensor network algorithm to solve polaron impurity problems
Authors: Ruofan Chen, Lei Gu, Chu Guo
Abstract: The polaron problem is a very old problem in condensed matter physics that dates back to the thirties, but still remain largely unsolved today, especially when electron-electron interaction is taken into consideration. The presence of both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the problem invalidates most existing numerical methods, either computationally too expensive or simply intractable. The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii) measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC. We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future method developments.

Title: Fibonacci Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Florian Bönsel, Flore K. Kunst, Federico Roccati
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.

Title: Preparing spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays via quantum optimal control
Authors: Edison S. Carrera, Harold Erbin, Grégoire Misguich
Abstract: We present a quantum optimal control protocol to generate highly spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays coupled via Ising-type Van der Waals interactions. Using gradient-based optimization techniques we construct time-dependent pulse sequences that steer an initial product state toward highly entangled, spin-squeezed states with predefined magnetization and squeezing axes. We focus on the Wineland parameter $\xi_W^2$ to measure spin squeezing and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in one-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, significantly outperforming conventional quench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse sequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional optimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in systems containing $N=50$ spins. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum optimal control methods for preparing highly spin-squeezed states, opening pathways to enhanced quantum metrology.

Title: A dynamic circuit for the honeycomb Floquet code
Authors: Jahan Claes
Abstract: In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer. Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the number of qubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.

Title: Entanglement and magic on the light-front
Authors: Sam Alterman, Peter J. Love
Abstract: In the light-front (LF) formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), physics is formulated from the perspective of a massless observer necessarily traveling at the speed of light. The LF formulation provides an alternative computational approach to lattice gauge theory, and has recently been investigated as a future application of quantum computers. A natural question is how quantum resources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the laboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D transverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy operator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from the instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF Hamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta in IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF momentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the IF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to prepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point, corresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are stabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while the IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF momentum-space. These results show that quantum resources such as entanglement and magic are utilized differently by quantum simulations formulated in LF and IF, and that the simplicity of the LF ground state results in fewer required quantum resources.

Title: A Modular PyTheus Quantum Network Interpreter: Automated Analysis and Visualization of Optimized Quantum Architectures
Authors: S. K. Rithvik
Abstract: We present a modular interpreter for PyTheus-optimized quantum networks that automatically analyzes and visualizes complex quantum architectures discovered through automated optimization. The interpreter addresses the critical challenge of understanding machine-designed quantum networks by providing robust algorithms for functional role identification, graph-theoretical analysis, and physically meaningful visualization across the major classes of PyTheus-generated networks. Our interpreter accepts both file-based and in-memory network representations, automatically identifies sources, detectors, beam splitters, and ancillas through priority-based classification, and generates coordinated native graph plots and optical table representations. We demonstrate the interpreter's capabilities through two complementary approaches: (1) analysis of a newly developed five-node quantum key distribution network that reveals distributed source architecture and dual-role node functionality, and (2) comprehensive validation using existing PyTheus examples including W4 state generation, heralded Bell state preparation, and GHZ state networks. The interpreter successfully handles complex connectivity patterns across diverse quantum network architectures within the tested classes, avoids visualization artifacts, and provides validation mechanisms for architectural consistency. Our primary contribution is the development of robust modular interpretation algorithms that can analyze the major classes of PyTheus-generated quantum networks, enabling better understanding of automated quantum architecture design.

Title: Shearing approach to gauge-invariant Trotterization
Authors: Jesse R. Stryker
Abstract: Universal quantum simulations of gauge field theories are exposed to the risk of gauge symmetry violations when it is not known how to compile the desired operations exactly using the available gate set. In this article, we show how time evolution can be compiled in an Abelian gauge theory -- if only approximately -- without compromising gauge invariance, by graphically motivating a block-diagonalization procedure. When gauge-invariant interactions are associated with a "spatial network" in the space of discrete quantum numbers, it is seen that cyclically shearing the spatial network converts simultaneous updates to many quantum numbers into conditional updates of a single quantum number; ultimately, this eliminates any need to pass through (and acquire overlap onto) unphysical intermediate configurations. Shearing is explicitly applied to gauge-matter and magnetic interactions of lattice quantum electrodynamics. The features that make shearing successful at preserving Abelian gauge symmetry may also be found in non-Abelian theories, bringing one closer to gauge-invariant simulations of quantum chromodynamics.

Title: Reflections on reflections
Authors: Kuan-Nan Lin, Pisin Chen
Abstract: Analog Hawking radiation emitted by a perfectly reflecting mirror in (1+3)-dimensional flat spacetime is investigated. This is accomplished by studying the reflected frequency and momentum based on Einstein's mirror, instead of the canonical way of solving, if possible, wave equations subjected to a dynamical Dirichlet boundary condition. In the case of a finite-size mirror, diffraction pattern appears in the radiation spectrum. Based on the relevant parameters in the proposed Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers experiment, in which the Hawking temperature $T_{H}\simeq 0.03$ eV and the mirror area $\mathcal{A}\simeq (50\;\mu\mathrm{m})^{2}$, the Hawking photon yield is estimated to be $N\simeq 16$/laser shot.

Title: Thermal cycling -- evidence for a generalized tunneling model and a tool to distinguish noise sources in quantum circuits
Authors: Yigal Reiss, Moshe Schechter
Abstract: Structural two level systems (TLSs) ubiquitous in amorphous solids are dramatically sensitive to thermal cycling to about $20$K and then back to low temperature, a process upon which the excitation energy of most TLSs is significantly changed. Using Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not contained within the standard tunneling model, but is well explained by a model that includes an additional set of TLSs that are pseudo-gapped at low energies, yet possess strong strain interaction through which they generate significant dynamical disorder upon thermal cycling. Our results provide additional support for the broad applicability of the Two-TLS model to amorphous solids at low temperatures, bringing us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the universal behavior of phonon attenuation in these materials. With regard to quantum superconducting circuits, our results suggest thermal cycling as a unique protocol to distinguish TLS noise from other noise sources. Possible relation of the Two-TLS model to ionizing radiation effects on long-time fluctuations in qubit relaxation times and on TLS scrambling is discussed.

Title: Kondo overscreening in the presence of superconductivity
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.

Title: Symmetry-enforced minimal entanglement and correlation in quantum spin chains
Authors: Kangle Li, Liujun Zou
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.

Abstract: We study the impact of thermal effects on gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in a system of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with classical linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Specifically, we model the endpoints of interferometer arms in LIGO-like detectors as two-dimensional oscillators. Following the thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach, our analysis reveals that while thermal effects alone do not generate entanglement between independent oscillator modes, they serve as a catalyst, modifying the dynamical imprint of GWs. Notably, we identify a mixing of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions driven by thermal influences, which affects the statistical behavior of the quantum subsystem. Furthermore, gravitational interactions induce a quantum memory effect, leading to emergent periodic behavior in the reduced subsystem. This suggests a novel gravitationally induced breaking of time-translation symmetry, reminiscent of a prethermal time crystal (PTC). Our findings indicate that such effects could provide new theoretical insights into classical gravitational wave interactions.

Title: Harvesting Fermionic Field Entanglement in Schwarzschild Spacetime
Authors: Nitesh Kumar Dubey, Sanved Kolekar
Abstract: We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider different vacua, including the Boulware, Hartle-Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh vacua, and investigate various configurations of detector trajectories. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian behavior in the HHI state, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a fermionic thermal bath. We demonstrate that the near-horizon entanglement properties for static detectors in the HHI state have similar behaviour to those in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated detectors in Rindler spacetime. We further consider a different interaction Hamiltonian which breaks local Lorentz symmetry and find that the transition rate of the static detector still exhibits Planckian behavior in the HHI state, while in the Unruh state, it leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a bosonic or fermionic thermal bath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein in interaction, respectively. We observe that the anti-Hawking effect enhances the entanglement between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation decrease it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking effect, the mutual information and concurrence near the event horizon can be non-zero even for static detectors with static 2-bein, which is in contrast with the case of the scalar field. Conclusions are discussed.

Title: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation of a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system
Authors: Kwang Hyun Cho, Hyukjoon Kwon, Changbong Hyeon
Abstract: The minimal bound of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is modulated from that of the classical counterpart ($\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}=2$) when a quantumness is present in the dynamical process far from equilibrium. A recent study on a dissipative two-level system (TLS) subject to an external field indicates that quantum coherence can suppress the fluctuations of the irreversible current and loosens the TUR bound to $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$. Here, we extend on the field-driven single TLS % in a photonic bath to a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system (TQS), and explore how the quantum coupling between the two qubits, an additional complexity introduced to the probem of TLS, affects the photon current, fluctuations, and the TUR bound. We find that the TUR bound of TQS depends on the strength of coupling, such that $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}=\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$ when the two qubits are effectively decoupled under weak coupling, whereas another loose bound $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}\approx 1.36$ is identified for two strongly coupled qubits under strong fields. By contrasting the TQS against two coupled noisy oscillators, we illuminate the quantumness unique to the TQS and its effect on the TUR. Our findings from the study of TQS form the basis for understanding the TUR of more general $N$-qubit systems.

Title: MC-PDFT Nuclear Gradients and L-PDFT Energies with Meta and Hybrid Meta On-Top Functionals for Ground- and Excited-State Geometry Optimization and Vertical Excitation Energies
Authors: Matthew R. Hennefarth, Younghwan Kim, Bhavnesh Jangid, Jacob Wardzala, Matthew R. Hermes, Donald G. Truhlar, Laura Gagliardi
Abstract: Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) is a post-MCSCF multireference electronic-structure method that explicitly models strong electron correlation, and linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed multi-state extension that can accurately model conical intersections and locally-avoided crossings. Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on an on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the on-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated meta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the MC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional specifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and implementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using meta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables analytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top functional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the derivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of meta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use the new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state geometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and benzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other meta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies. We find MC23 performs the best of all nine meta and hybrid meta functionals for vertical excitation energies and is comparable in accuracy to tPBE0 and to the NEVPT2 multireference wave function method. Additionally, we directly compare our MC-PDFT vertical excitation results to previously computed TD-DFT values and find that MC-PDFT outperforms even the best performing Kohn-Sham density functional.

Title: Cavity-less Brillouin strong coupling in a solid-state continuous system
Authors: Laura Blázquez Martínez, Changlong Zhu, Birgit Stiller
Abstract: Strongly coupling two systems allows them to exchange coherent information before the systems decohere. This important regime in light-matter interactions has predominantly been reached in optical resonator configurations. In this work, we present the experimental realization of strong coupling between optical and acoustic fields within a continuum of modes in a cavity-less configuration after a single-pass through an optical waveguide. The underlying physical effect of anti-Stokes Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in a highly nonlinear fiber at T = 4 K allows us to experimentally demonstrate strong coupling in a waveguide scenario. We show the splitting of the optoacoustic spectral response and introduce a novel technique to measure the avoided crossing of hybrid optoacoustic modes via forced detuning. This demonstration opens a path towards in-line acoustic-waves-based quantum signal processing in waveguide systems.
