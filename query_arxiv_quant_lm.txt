Title: Programmable digital quantum simulation of 2D Fermi-Hubbard dynamics using 72 superconducting qubits

Abstract: Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.

Title: The Particle in a Box in Koopman--von Neumann Mechanics: A Hilbert Space representation of Classical Mechanics
Authors: Abhijit Sen, Lev Kaplan
Abstract: This paper revisits the textbook 'particle in a box', but from the point of view of Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) mechanics. KvN mechanics is a way to describe \emph{classical} dynamics in a Hilbert space. That simple fact changes the usual expectation: hard walls do \emph{not} force energy quantization here. We show, in a clear and physical way, why a KvN particle confined between two ideal walls still has a continuous range of energies. With the correct wall condition, one that captures ordinary elastic reflection rather than 'vanishing at the boundary,' the KvN description naturally produces spatial confinement without discrete energy levels. Beyond establishing this result, we also clean up common misunderstandings: for example, treating the KvN wavefunction like a quantum probability amplitude in position alone leads to the wrong boundary picture and, with it, the wrong conclusion about quantization.

Title: A Non-Variational Quantum Approach to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem
Authors: Miguel Angel Lopez-Ruiz, Emily L. Tucker, Emma M. Arnold, Evgeny Epifanovsky, Ananth Kaushik, Martin Roetteler
Abstract: Quantum heuristics offer a potential advantage for combinatorial optimization but are constrained by near-term hardware limitations. We introduce Iterative-QAOA, a variant of QAOA designed to mitigate these constraints. The algorithm combines a non-variational, shallow-depth circuit approach using fixed-parameter schedules with an iterative warm-starting process. We benchmark the algorithm on Just-in-Time Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JIT-JSSP) instances on IonQ Forte Generation QPUs, representing some of the largest such problems ever executed on quantum hardware. We compare the performance of the algorithm against both the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQITE) algorithm and the non-variational Linear Ramp (LR) QAOA algorithm. We find that Iterative-QAOA robustly converges to find optimal solutions as well as high-quality, near-optimal solutions for all problem instances evaluated. We evaluate the algorithm on larger problem instances up to 97 qubits using tensor network simulations. The scaling behavior of the algorithm indicates potential for solving industrial-scale problems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Title: Single-Photon-Level Atomic Frequency Comb Storage in Room Temperature Alkali Vapour
Authors: Zakary Schofield, Vanderli Laurindo Jr, Ori Ezrah Mor, Patrick M. Ledingham
Abstract: We have demonstrated the coherent storage and retrieval of single-photon-level light using the atomic frequency comb protocol in a room temperature rubidium vapour. Velocity-selective optical pumping is used to prepare the comb within the $F=2$ hyperfine ground state of rubidium, with the spacing between peaks coinciding with half the $F = 2 - F =3$ hyperfine splitting of the $5^2$P$_{3/2}$ excited state. Weak coherent states of average photon number $\mu_\mathrm{in} = 0.083(5)$ are stored with pre-programmed recall time of $7.5\,$ns with an efficiency of $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} = 6.59(5)\,\%$, while two temporally distinct modes have been stored and recalled with $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} = 2.6(1)\,\%$, allowing for time-bin qubit storage. Finally, the efficiency is observed to be independent of the input pulse polarisation, paving the way for polarisation qubit storage.

Title: Exact and approximate conditions of tabletop reversibility: when is Petz recovery cost-free?
Authors: Minjeong Song, Hyukjoon Kwon, Valerio Scarani
Abstract: Channels $\mathcal{N}$ that describe open quantum dynamics are inherently irreversible: it is impossible to undo their effect completely, but one can study partial recovery of the information. The Petz recovery map $\hat{\mathcal{N}}_{\gamma}^{(\texttt{P})}$ is a systematic construction that depends only on $\mathcal{N}$ and on a reference state $\gamma$, which will be recovered exactly. If the real input state was different from $\gamma$, the recovery is partial, with a guarantee of near-optimality. Generically, an implementation of the Petz recovery map would look very different from the implementation of the channel. It is natural to study under which conditions the two maps require similar or even identical resources. The noisy forward channel $\mathcal{N}$ is called ``tabletop time-reversible'' for a given $\gamma$ when the corresponding Petz recovery map is realizable in such a way. First, we study the exact tabletop reversibility (TTR) conditions. We show in particular that a time-sensitive control of an ancilla system is needed. Second, we present the approximate TTR conditions, which do not require such a time-sensitive control. Third, we derive Lindbladian TTR conditions under a random-time collision model.

Title: Harnessing Floquet dynamics for selective metrology in few-qubit systems
Authors: Asghar Ullah, Hasan Mermer, Melih Özkurt, Igor Lesanovsky, Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can function as highly selective parameter filters. We demonstrate this capability in a finite-size, three-qubit system described by the transverse-field Floquet Ising model. In this system, we identify a period-doubling (PD) dynamical phase that exhibits a stark asymmetry in metrological sensitivity to the magnetic field applied on the qubits and to the coupling strength between the qubits. The PD phase originates from $\pi$-pairing, where the initial state exhibits strong overlap with $\pi$-paired Floquet eigenstates, leading to robust period-doubled dynamics and enhanced metrological sensitivity. The analysis of quantum Fisher information reveals that the PD regime significantly enhances precision for estimating the Ising interaction strength while simultaneously suppressing sensitivity to the transverse magnetic field. Conversely, non-PD regimes are optimal for sensing the transverse field. This filtering effect is robust for larger system sizes and is quantifiable using experimentally accessible observables, such as magnetization and two-qubit correlations, via the classical Fisher information. Our work shows that distinct dynamical regimes in finite-size Floquet systems can be harnessed for targeted quantum sensing.

Title: Sample-Based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization for the Schwinger Model on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Quantum Processors
Authors: Emil Otis Rosanowski, Jurek Eisinger, Lena Funcke, Ulrich Poschinger, Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler
Abstract: We apply the recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method to lattice gauge theories, using the Schwinger model with a $\theta$-term as a benchmark. SKQD approximates the ground state of a Hamiltonian, employing a hybrid quantum-classical approach: (i) constructing a Krylov space from bitstrings sampled from time-evolved quantum states, and (ii) classically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian within this subspace. We study the dependence of the ground-state energy and particle number on the value of the $\theta$-term, accurately capturing the model's phase structure. The algorithm is implemented on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating consistent performance across platforms. We show that SKQD substantially reduces the effective Hilbert space, and although the Krylov space dimension still scales exponentially, the slower growth underscores its promise for simulating lattice gauge theories in larger volumes.

Title: Electron juggling: Approaching the atomic physics limit of the attempt rate in trapped ion photonic interconnects
Authors: I. D. Moore, B. M. White, B. Graner, J. D. Siverns
Abstract: Photonic interconnects are a key technology for scaling up atomic based quantum computers. By facilitating the connection of multiple systems, high-performance modular quantum processing units may be constructed to perform deeper and more useful algorithms. Most previous implementations of photonic interconnects in trapped ions utilize the scheme of preparing a state, exciting it, and collecting single photons from decays of the excited state. State preparation is responsible for the vast majority of the total attempt time, often taking hundreds of nanoseconds to several microseconds. Here, we describe and analyze a novel technique called ``electron juggling" to speed up photonic interconnects by reducing the state preparation step substantially. Using a theoretical framework, we illustrate how this scheme can significantly increase remote entanglement generation rates, approaching the atomic physics limit of the attempt rate in trapped-ion photonic interconnects. Our results indicate that this scheme holds the possibility of achieving remote entanglement generation rates of over 1,000 Bell pairs per second.

Title: Fast Bosonic Control via Multiphoton Qubit-Oscillator Interactions
Authors: Noah Gorgichuk, Mohammad Ayyash, Matteo Mariantoni, Sahel Ashhab
Abstract: We present a protocol for preparing oscillator states with $n$-fold rotational symmetry, which include many logical codewords for bosonic quantum error correction codes. The protocol relies on a multiphoton interaction between the oscillator and an auxiliary qubit. Further, we achieve arbitrary control over the oscillator's Hilbert space by using a combination of different multiphoton interaction orders. We also discuss the preparation of rotationally-symmetric multi-oscillator states using a generalized variant of the protocol. We show that the use of multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions can substantially reduce the state preparation time, in comparison to the linear qubit-oscillator interactions that are usually employed. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations that take into account qubit and oscillator relaxation and dephasing using realistic planar superconducting circuit parameters that validate the robustness of our protocol. Our findings can significantly improve the performance of bosonic codes on planar superconducting hardware, which are an almost inevitable necessity for scalable bosonic fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers.

Title: Characterizing Quantum Internet Using Complex Network Models
Authors: Otávio José R. Silveira, Nycolas B. da Silva, Saulo L. L. da Silva, Angélica S. da Mata
Abstract: Quantum communication is a growing area of research, with quantum internet being one of the most promising applications. Studying the statistical properties of this network is essential to understanding its connectivity and the efficiency of the entanglement distribution. However, the models proposed in the literature often assume homogeneous distributions in the connections of the optical fiber infrastructure, without considering the heterogeneity of the network. In this work, we propose new models for the quantum internet that incorporate this heterogeneity of node connections in the optical fiber network, analyzing how this characteristic influences fundamental metrics such as the degree distribution, the average clustering coefficient, the average shortest path and assortativity. Our results indicate that, compared to homogeneous models, heterogeneous networks efficiently reproduce key structural properties of real optical fiber networks, including degree distribution, assortativity, and hierarchical behavior. These findings highlight the impact of network structure on quantum communication and can contribute to more realistic modeling of quantum internet infrastructure.

Title: Inter-transition interference in spectrum of Kerr parametric oscillators
Authors: Shumpei Masuda
Abstract: We theoretically investigate reflection and transmission measurements of two-photon and four-photon Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), introducing interference effects between inter-level transitions. Due to the level degeneracy of a KPO, a probe field can be resonant with multiple inter-level transitions. We extend the previous theory of reflection measurements by incorporating the interaction between inter-level transitions and off-diagonal elements of the density matrix which had previously been neglected. We demonstrate that interference among these transitions substantially modifies the spectrum. We identify the conditions for the interference, as well as those under which the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix affect the spectrum. The theory is also generalized to transmission measurements, and is applicable to a broad class of systems beyond KPOs.

Title: Quantum, Stochastic, and Classical Dynamics Within A Single Geometric Framework
Authors: Partha Ghose
Abstract: Nelson's stochastic mechanics links quantum mechanics to an underlying Brownian motion with the identification $\hbar = m\sigma$. Ghose's interpolating equation introduces a continuous parameter $\lambda$ that suppresses the quantum potential $Q[\psi]$ and yields a smooth transition between quantum ($\lambda=0$) and classical ($\lambda=1$) regimes. In this short note, we show that the Koopman--von Neumann (KvN) Hilbert-space formulation of classical mechanics emerges naturally as the $\lambda \to 1$ limit of this stochastic $\sigma$--$\lambda$ hierarchy. The KvN phase-space amplitude provides an operator representation of the classical Liouville equation, while the $\lambda$ parameter acts as a projection flow from the complex projective Hilbert manifold $\mathbb{C}P^n$ to its classical quotient $\mathbb{C}P^*/U(1)$, implementing phase superselection. This unified picture links quantum, stochastic, and classical dynamics within a single continuous framework.

Title: Zitterbewegung Effect and Quantum Geometry in Non-Hermitian Exciton-Polariton Systems
Authors: Yow-Ming Robin Hu, Elena A. Ostrovskaya, Eliezer Estrecho
Abstract: In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane effective field.

Title: Maximal extension on converse monogamy of entanglement for tripartite pure states
Authors: Junhyeong An, Soojoon Lee
Abstract: Unlike classical correlations, entanglement cannot be freely shared among multiple parties. This unique feature of quantum systems is known as the monogamy of entanglement. While it holds for all multipartite pure states, its converse -- weak entanglement between two parties enforces strong entanglement with a third party -- occurs only under specific conditions. In particular, Hayashi and Chen [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{84}, 012325 (2011)] demonstrated a qualitative version of the converse monogamy of entanglement (CMoE) for tripartite pure states by employing a hierarchy of bipartite entanglement defined through the relations among various separability criteria, and Singh and Datta [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory \textbf{69}, 6564 (2023)] later extended this notion of the CMoE from the viewpoint of distillability under one-way or two-way classical communication. In this work, we extend their results to the CMoE with broader conditions, and furthermore show that our extensions are maximal with respect to the hierarchies they considered.

Title: Instruction-Directed MAC for Efficient Classical Communication in Scalable Multi-Chip Quantum Systems
Authors: Maurizio Palesi, Enrico Russo, Hamaad Rafique, Giuseppe Ascia, Davide Patti, Abhijit Das, Sergi Abadal
Abstract: Scalable quantum computing requires modular multi-chip architectures integrating multiple quantum cores interconnected through quantum-coherent and classical links. The classical communication subsystem is critical for coordinating distributed control operations and supporting quantum protocols such as teleportation. In this work, we consider a realization based on a wireless network-on-chip for implementing classical communication within cryogenic environments. Traditional token-based medium access control (MAC) protocols, however, incur latency penalties due to inefficient token circulation among inactive nodes. We propose the instruction-directed token MAC (ID-MAC), a protocol that leverages the deterministic nature of quantum circuit execution to predefine transmission schedules at compile time. By embedding instruction-level information into the MAC layer, ID-MAC restricts token circulation to active transmitters, thereby improving channel utilization and reducing communication latency. Simulations show that ID-MAC reduces classical communication time by up to 70% and total execution time by up to 30-70%, while also extending effective system coherence. These results highlight ID-MAC as a scalable and efficient MAC solution for future multi-chip quantum architectures.

Title: Manipulating Excitation Dynamics in Structured Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana, Ya-Tang Yu, Wei-Hsuan Chung, H. H. Jen
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) has become a central platform for studying collective light-matter interactions in low-dimensional photonic environments. While conventional wQED systems rely on uniform chirality or reciprocal emitter-waveguide coupling, we propose a structured wQED framework, where the coupling directionality of each emitter can be engineered locally to control excitation transport in an atom-nanophotonic interface. For different combinations of patterned coupling directionalities of the emitters, we identify four representative configurations that exhibit distinct dynamical behaviors: centering, wave-like, leap-frog, and dispersion excitations. Spectral analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian reveals that these dynamics originate from interferences among subradiant eigenmodes. Variance analysis further quantifies the spreading of excitation as functions of interatomic spacing and global chirality, showing tunable localization-delocalization transitions. Including nonguided losses, we find that the transport characteristics remain robust for realistic coupling efficiencies (beta >= 0.99). These results establish structured wQED as a practical route to manipulate excitation localization, coherence, and transport through programmable directionality patterns, paving the way for controllable subradiant transport and chiral quantum information routing.

Title: Room-Temperature Quantum Simulation with Atomically Thin Nuclear Spin Layers in Diamond
Authors: Philipp J. Vetter, Christoph Findler, Antonio Verdú, Matthias Kost, Rémi Blinder, Jens Fuhrmann, Christian Osterkamp, Johannes Lang, Martin B. Plenio, Javier Prior, Fedor Jelezko
Abstract: Quantum simulation aims to recreate complex many-body phenomena in controlled environments, offering insights into dynamics that are otherwise difficult to model. Existing platforms, however, are often complex and costly to scale, typically requiring ultra-pure vacuum or low temperatures. Here, we realize a room-temperature quantum simulator using a thin ${}^{13}\text{C}$ nuclear spin layer in diamond. Nearby nitrogen-vacancy centers enable polarization, readout, and, combined with radio-frequency fields, coherent control of the nuclear spins. We demonstrate strong, tunable interactions among the nuclear spins and use the system to investigate discrete time-crystalline order. By combining ease of use with operation at ambient temperatures, our work opens new opportunities for investigating strongly correlated many-body effects.

Title: Revisiting quantum walk advantages: A mean hitting time perspective
Authors: Jan Wójcik
Abstract: The mean squared displacement has been widely used as the primary metric for comparing quantum and classical random walks, with quantum walks showing quadratic scaling versus linear scaling for classical walks. However, this comparison may not capture the full picture: while the mean squared displacement is well-suited for Gaussian distributions, quantum walk distributions exhibit distinctly non-Gaussian features. We propose that the mean hitting time offers a complementary perspective with clear operational meaning for search algorithms. Through analytical calculations, we show that quantum and classical walks yield identical MHT for symmetric initial conditions with two detectors, suggesting that the apparent quantum advantage seen in MSD comparisons may be context-dependent. Interestingly, introducing stochastic resetting reveals new dynamics. We demonstrate analytically that quantum walks can achieve reduced MHT under stochastic reset through quasi-momentum redistribution, while classical walks see no benefit. This quantum advantage naturally degrades with noise, the quantum walk converges to classical behavior. We suggest that MHT reduction under stochastic reset can serve as an additional signature of quantum behavior, particularly useful for characterizing quantum walk implementations on noisy quantum devices. Our results indicate that different metrics can reveal different aspects of quantum-classical comparisons in walk-based algorithms.

Title: Complete characterization of beam deflection based on double weak value amplification system
Authors: Yu Wang, Rongguo Yang, Jing Zhang, Xiaomin Liu, Chenzhen Luo, Kui Liu, Jiangrui Gao
Abstract: The precise measurement of spatial attitude parameters is critical for applications in inertial navigation, industrial monitoring, instrument calibration, quantum metrology, etc. In this work, we theoretically investigate and experimentally realize the simultaneous measurement of the yaw and pitch angles using a Hermite-Gaussian-postselected double weak value system integrated with two sets of high-order-mode balanced homodyne detections, thereby achieving a complete characterization of the beam deflection. Signals of the yaw and pitch angles that are involved in TEM$_{10}$ and TEM$_{01}$ modes output from two dark ports of the system can be measured independently. As a result, the obtained minimum measurable yaw and pitch angles of beam deflection are 83 prad and 89 prad, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding displacements are 0.79 pm and 0.85 pm, respectively. This work expands the beam deflection measurement to two dimensions, which provides a new insight for future high-precision multi-parameter spatial precise detection.

Title: Quantum Secret Sharing Scheme on Hypercyclic Quantum Structures
Authors: Lei Li, Zhi Li
Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of efficient quantum secret sharing schemes for quantum access structures based on hypergraphs with three hyperedges. We prove that hypercycles with three hyperedges are quantum access structures if and only if they can be classified into 12 non-isomorphic types under hypergraph isomorphism, and these hypercyclic quantum access structures encompass all four hyperstars with three this http URL prior work, efficient and perfect quantum secret sharing schemes were constructed for hyperstar access structures with three hyperedges using single photons in d -dimensional quantum systems. These schemes correspond to classical perfect secret sharing schemes with optimal information rates. However, for hypercyclic access structures with three hyperedges, the method described above fails to yield classical perfect secret sharing schemes with optimal information rates. In this work, we explicitly construct classical perfect secret sharing schemes with optimal information rates for these access structures by combining Simmons' geometric method with Shamir's threshold scheme. Subsequently, we employ single photons in d-dimensional quantum systems to build perfect QSS schemes upon these classical this http URL introduce the concept of idealized information rate for minimal access structures in perfect QSS schemes. By extending the notion of efficiency proposed by Cabello [Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 85, no. 26, p. 5635, 2000] for quantum key distribution protocols to QSS, we define the efficiency of minimally authorized subsets. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between the efficiency of minimally authorized subsets and the idealized information rate of minimal access structures. Finally, we rigorously prove that the QSS schemes constructed in this work achieve the highest efficiency among existing solutions.

Title: Auxiliary-state facilitated phase synchronization phenomena in isolated spin systems
Authors: Xylo Molenda, S. Zhong, B. Viswanathan, Xingli Li, Y. Yan, A. M. Marino, D. Blume
Abstract: Extending classical synchronization to the quantum domain is of great interest both from the fundamental physics point of view and with a view toward quantum technology applications. This work characterizes phase synchronization of an effective spin-1 system, which is realized by coupling three quantum states with infinite lifetime to auxiliary excited states that have a finite lifetime. Integrating out the excited states, the effective spin-1 model features coherent and incoherent effective couplings. Our key findings are: (i) Phase synchronization can be controlled by adjusting the phases of the couplings to the excited states. (ii) Unlike in the paradigmatic spin-1 system studied in the literature, where the dissipative couplings describe decay into the limit cycle state, the effective spin-1 model investigated in this work is governed by a competition between dissipative decay into and out of the limit cycle state, with the dissipative decay out of the limit cycle state playing a critical role. (iii) We identify a parameter regime where phase synchronization of the effective spin-1 system is -- in the absence of coherent effective couplings -- governed entirely by the effective dissipators. The effective spin-1 model is benchmarked through comparisons with master equation calculations for the full Hilbert space. Physical insights are gained through analytical perturbation theory calculations. Our findings, which are expected to hold for a broad class of energy level and coupling schemes, are demonstrated using hyperfine states of $^{87}$Rb.

Title: The role of entanglement in energy-restricted communication and randomness generation
Authors: Carles Roch I Carceller, Armin Tavakoli
Abstract: A promising platform for semi-device-independent quantum information is prepare-and-measure experiments restricted only by a bound on the energy of the communication. Here, we investigate the role of shared entanglement in such scenarios. For classical communication, we derive a general correlation criterion for nonlocal resources and use it to show that entanglement can fail to be a resource in standard tasks. For quantum communication, we consider the basic primitive for energy-constrained communication, namely the probabilistic transmission of a bit, and show that the advantages of entanglement only can be unlocked by non-unitary encoding schemes that purposefully decohere the entangled state. We also find that these advantages can be increased by using entanglement of higher dimension than qubit. We leverage these insights to investigate the impact of entanglement for quantum random number generation, which is a standard application of these systems but whose security so far only has been established against classical side information. In the low-energy regime, our attacks on the protocol indicate that the security remains largely intact, thereby paving the way for strengthened security without more complex setups and with negligible performance reductions.

Title: Area-Law Entanglement in Quantum Chaotic System
Authors: Chunyin Chen, Sizhe Yan, Biao WU
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental diagnostic for quantum chaos, typically exhibiting volume-law scaling in highly excited eigenstates of chaotic many-body systems. In this work, we present a striking counterexample: a Floquet-driven quantum many-body system with Rydberg-like blockade that, despite being fully chaotic as indicated by its Wigner-Dyson level statistics and local thermalization, exhibits a strict area-law entanglement entropy. Specifically, the entanglement entropy of every Floquet eigenstate is bounded by $\ln2$, independent of system size. We trace this anomaly to the specific Hilbert space structure imposed by the blockades, which restricts the Schmidt rank across a bipartition. Furthermore, we generalize this discovery by establishing a duality between constrained many-body Hamiltonians and single-particle quantum walks on median graphs, and we outline a general procedure for constructing systems with an entanglement entropy bounded by a predetermined constant. Our results demonstrate that entanglement entropy alone is an insufficient diagnostic of many-body quantum chaos and highlight the profound impact of Hilbert space geometry on quantum dynamics and thermalization.

Title: Experimental Quantum Channel Purification
Authors: Yue-Yang Fei, Zhenhuan Liu, Rui Zhang, Zhenyu Cai, Xu-Fei Yin, Yingqiu Mao, Li Li, Nai-Le Liu, Yu-Ao Chen, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: Quantum networks, which integrate multiple quantum computers and the channels connecting them, are crucial for distributed quantum information processing but remain inherently susceptible to channel noise. Channel purification emerges as a promising technique for suppressing noise in quantum channels without complex encoding and decoding operations, making it particularly suitable for remote quantum information transmission in optical systems. In this work, we introduce an experimental setup for efficient channel purification, harnessing the spatial and polarization properties of photons. Our design employs two Fredkin gates to enable coherent interference between independent noise channels, achieving effective noise suppression across a wide range of noise levels and types. Through application to entanglement distribution, our protocol demonstrates a superior capability to preserve entanglement against channel noise compared to conventional entanglement purification methods.

Title: Entanglement in the energy-constrained prepare-and-measure scenario: applications to randomness certification and channel discrimination
Authors: Raffaele D'Avino, Gabriel Senno, Mir Alimuddin, Antonio Acín
Abstract: Quantum information tasks are often analyzed under varying trust assumptions about the devices involved. The semi-device-independent (SDI) framework offers a balance between needed assumptions and experimental feasibility. In this work, we study the energy-constrained SDI scenario, where the only assumption in a prepare-and-measure setup is an upper bound on the energy of the prepared quantum states. In contrast to previous studies that restricted the preparation and measurement devices to be classically correlated, we show that allowing entanglement strictly enlarges the set of achievable correlations. We identify two operational consequences of this result. The first concerns randomness certification, where we show that allowing the adversary to employ entangled strategies may significantly reduce the amount of certifiable randomness. This includes situations where the amount of randomness drops to zero in the presence of entanglement, while it remains positive when entanglement is excluded. Second, for the task of distinguishing an arbitrary quantum channel from the identity, we show that the known dimension-independent bound on the advantage conferred by entanglement is violated under an energy constraint.

Title: Quantum interference effects in two-photon scattering by a macroscopic lossy sphere
Authors: A. Ciattoni
Abstract: We investigate the quantum optical scattering of two-photon wavepackets by a macroscopic lossy sphere by means of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in the form of modified Langevin noise formalism. The two ingoing photons with arbitrary frequency-polarization spectrum impinge onto the sphere along two different directions and, as consequence of matter losses, their scattering involves the three independent processes where two, one and zero outgoing photons survive. Non-collinearity of ingoing photons causes the existence of two different quantum paths they can follow upon scattering, this producing interference effects in the detection of the above three processes which is governed by the wavepacket spectral symmetry. By exploiting rotational invariance, we show that different classes of scattering geometries exist such that the coincidence detection of the scattered photons shows perfect constructive or destructive (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference, both for symmetric and antisymmetric wavepackets. To assess the impact of matter dispersion/losses on quantum interference effects accompanying photons detection, we analyze the scattering of narrow band two-photon wavepackets by high-index dielectric lossy spheres. We show that classical Mie resonance peaks, due to their Fano-like traits, yield very strong constructive and destructive interference effects, occurring when the wavepacket carrier frequency matches the resonance frequency and side Fano dip frequency, respectively. In addition we consider the overall scattering probabilities of two, one and zero photons and we prove that, at the Mie resonance frequencies, they exhibit quantum interference effects which are extremely sensitive to the spectral symmetry of the input wavepacket, thus suggesting an efficient spectral technique assisted by matter losses to identify entanglement.

Title: Directional quantum scattering transducer in cooperative Rydberg metasurfaces
Authors: Jonas von Milczewski, Kelly Werker Smith, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: We present a single-photon transduction scheme using 4-wave-mixing and quantum scattering in planar, cooperative Rydberg arrays that is both efficient and highly directional and may allow for terahertz-to-optical transduction. In the 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the system in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in the terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective super-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition. As the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident signal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar idler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture is into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific, highly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane. Outside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum devices for further processing. Using a scattering-operator formalism we derive resonance and criticality conditions that govern this two-step process and obtain analytic transduction efficiencies. For infinite lattices, we predict transduction efficiencies into specific spatial directions of up to 50%, while the overall, undirected transduction efficiency can be higher. An analysis for finite arrays of $N^2$ emitters, shows that the output is collimated into lobes that narrow as $1/\sqrt{N}$. Our scheme combines the broadband acceptance of free-space 4-wave mixing with the efficiency, directionality and tunability of cooperative metasurfaces, offering a route towards quantum-coherent THz detection and processing for astronomical spectroscopy, quantum-networked sparse-aperture imaging and other quantum-sensing applications.

Title: Probing non-equilibrium physics through the two-body Bell correlator
Authors: Abhishek Muhuri, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Identifying equilibrium criticalities and phases from the dynamics of a system, known as a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), is a challenging task when relying solely on local observables. We exhibit that the experimentally accessible two-body Bell operator, originally designed to detect nonlocal correlations in quantum states, serves as an effective witness of DQPTs in a long-range (LR) XY spin chain subjected to a magnetic field, where the interaction strength decays as a power law. Following a sudden quench of the system parameters, the Bell operator between nearest-neighbor spins exhibits a distinct drop at the critical boundaries. In this study, we consider two quenching protocols, namely sudden quenches of the magnetic field strength and the interaction fall-off rate. This pronounced behavior defines a threshold, distinguishing intra-phase from inter-phase quenches, remaining valid regardless of the strength of long-range interactions, anisotropy, and system sizes. Comparative analyses further demonstrate that conventional classical and quantum correlators, including entanglement, fail to capture this transition during dynamics.

Title: Teleportation-based squeezer for bosonic cluster states
Authors: Michal Matulík, Radim Filip, Petr Marek
Abstract: The one-way quantum computation utilizing bosonic modes of light offers unmatched scalability of light modes, and it has seen rapid experimental development recently. Scalability requires robust and low-error gates and measurements. Squeezing gate is one of the necessary Gaussian operations. We find the optimal squeezing gate in cluster state architecture. Our approach newly uses amplitude transmission coefficients of unbalanced beam splitters and homodyne detection with subsequent unity-gain feed-forward to squeeze the input state. The approach outperforms the current method based on optimally rotated homodyne detection, but with fixed balanced beam splitters. The performance of both cluster state squeezers is evaluated for Gaussian and non-Gaussian input states. We use different metrics to benchmark the quality of squeezed output states. The result opens a road to low-noise squeezing gates in experimentally achievable cluster states.

Title: Quantum waste management: Utilizing residual states in quantum information processing
Authors: Karol Horodecki, Chirag Srivastava, Leonard Sikorski, Siddhartha Das
Abstract: We propose a framework for quantum residual management, in which states discarded after a resource distillation process are repurposed as inputs for subsequent quantum information tasks. This approach extends conventional quantum resource theories by incorporating secondary resource extraction from residual states, thereby enhancing overall resource utility. As a concrete example, we investigate the distillation of private randomness from the residual states remaining after quantum key distribution (QKD). More specifically, we quantitatively show that after performing a well-known coherent Devetak-Winter protocol one can locally extract private randomness from its residual. We further consider the Gottesman-Lo QKD protocol, and provide the achievable rate of private randomness from the discarded states that are left after its performance. We also provide a formal framework that highlights a general principle for improving quantum resource utilization across sequential information processing tasks.

Title: Path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for the dipole polarizability of quantum plasma
Authors: Juha Tiihonen, David Trejo-Garcia, Tapio T. Rantala, Marco Ornigotti
Abstract: We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit, i.e., the optical region. Unlike the conventional dynamic structure factor in reciprocal space, our approach is based on the real-space dipole autocorrelation function and is suited for long wavelengths and small cell sizes, including finite clusters. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics. For reference, we demonstrate analytic continuation of the Drude model into the imaginary time and Matsubara series, showing perfect agreement with our data within ranges of finite temperatures and densities. Method parameters, such as the finite time-step and finite-size effects prove only modestly significant. Our method, here carefully validated against an exactly solvable reference, remains amenable to more interesting domains in higher-order optical response, quantum confinements and quantum statistical effects, and applications in plasmonics, heterogeneous plasmas and nonlinear optics, such as epsilon-near-zero materials.

Title: Entropy transport in closed quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium
Authors: J. Marijan, H. Strobel, M. K. Oberthaler, J. Berges
Abstract: We investigate entropy transport for universal scaling phenomena in closed quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium. From spatially resolved experimental data of a spinor Bose gas, we demonstrate that entropy decreases on long-distance scales while it increases at short distances. A dynamical separation of scales leads to macrophysics with long-range order, which is insensitive to the highly entropic microphysical processes. Since the total von Neumann entropy is conserved on a fundamental level for the quantum system, our analysis reveals a reciprocal connection between the emergence of macroscopic structure and microscopic disorder. To illustrate the scope of this connection, we exemplify the universal phenomenon also in a relativistic quantum field theory calculation from first principles, which is relevant for particle physics and early-universe cosmology.

Title: Superdiffusion and anomalous fluctuations in chiral integrable dynamics
Authors: Cristiano Muzzi, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Marcello Dalmonte, Lenart Zadnik, Hernan B. Xavier
Abstract: Symmetries strongly influence transport properties of quantum many-body systems, and can lead to deviations from the generic case of diffusion. In this work, we study the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking on the transport and its universal aspects in integrable chiral spin ladders. We observe that the infinite-temperature spin transport is superdiffusive with a dynamical critical exponent z = 3/2 matching the one of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, which also lacks the time reversal symmetry. However, we find that fluctuations of the net magnetization transfer deviate from the KPZ predictions. Moreover, the full probability distribution of the associated spin current obeys fluctuation symmetry despite broken time-reversal and space-reflection symmetries. To further investigate the role of conserved quantities, we introduce an integrable quantum circuit that shares the essential symmetries with the chiral ladder, and which exhibits analogous dynamical behaviour in the absence of energy conservation. Our work shows that time-reversal symmetry breaking is compatible with superdiffusion, but insufficient to stabilize the KPZ universality in integrable systems. This suggests that additional fundamental features are missing in order to identify the emergence of such dynamics in quantum matter.

Title: The Anderson transition -- a view from Krylov space
Authors: J. Clayton Peacock, Vadim Oganesyan, Dries Sels
Abstract: The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerical methods that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. We revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in Krylov superoperator subspace, and can be analytically constructed, given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs (in Krylov space) with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states). Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected fractal exponent.

Title: High-Q microresonators unveil quantum rare events
Authors: Sricharan Raghavan-Chitra, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou
Abstract: Classical linear optics posits that at sufficiently low intensities, light propagation in dielectric media is governed solely by their linear susceptibilities. Here, we demonstrate a departure from this paradigm in high-Q microresonators, where prolonged photon confinement enables rare quantum electrodynamical (QED) events, mediated by the quantum vacuum, to embed distinctive Raman signatures of the coupled analyte into the resonator's linear transmission spectrum despite their absence from the linear susceptibility. We further show that increasing the amount of adsorbed analyte amplifies these Raman fingerprints well above typical noise floors, rendering them experimentally accessible with state-of-the-art photonic architectures and detection schemes. This novel weak-coupling cavity-QED effect offers unique routes to harness extended photon lifetimes and constrained geometries for leveraging vacuum fluctuations in next-generation photonic technologies for chemical and biological sensing and high-precision optical spectroscopy.

Title: QiNN-QJ: A Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
Authors: Yiwei Chen, Kehuan Yan, Yu Pan, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However, most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

Title: Optical Vortices: Revolutionizing the field of linear and nonlinear optics
Authors: Bikash K. Das, Marcelo F. Ciappina
Abstract: Light is the fundamental medium through which we perceive the world around us. In the modern era, light can not only be used in its raw form but can also be used as a versatile tool. Generally, light fields carry energy and momentum (both linear and angular). Due to the transfer of linear momentum from light to matter, the radiation pressure is exerted, whereas, the intrinsic spin angular momentum (SAM) is associated with the polarization states of light. Light fields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as optical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field of optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction process across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by the presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found a myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation to microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among others. Here, we revisit some of the fundamental concepts on optical vortices and discuss extensively on how this new dimension of light i.e., the OAM, has been exploited in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. We discuss the different types of vortex beams, the techniques used to generate and detect their OAM, and their propagation. Particularly, we put a special emphasis on the utilization of vortex beams in nonlinear regimes to explain different optical phenomena such as the second harmonic generation, parametric down-conversion, and high-order harmonic generation. The generation of vortex beams in the UV to XUV regimes, encoded with higher OAM values, could potentially extend their application range to areas such as high-capacity data transmission, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, phase-contrast imaging, and particle trapping in optical tweezers, among others.

Title: Geometry-Driven Resonance and Localization of Light in Fractal Phase Spaces
Authors: L. Yıldız, D. Kaykı, M. F. Ciappina
Abstract: Geometry can fundamentally govern the propagation of light, independent of material constraints. Here, we demonstrate that a fractal phase space, endowed with a non-Euclidean, scale-dependent geometry, can intrinsically induce resonance quantization, spatial confinement, and tunable damping without the need for material boundaries or external potentials. Employing a fractional formalism with a fixed scaling exponent, we reveal how closed-loop geodesics enforce constructive interference, leading to discrete resonance modes that arise purely from geometric considerations. This mechanism enables light to localize and dissipate in a controllable fashion within free space, with geometry acting as an effective quantizing and confining agent. Numerical simulations confirm these predictions, establishing geometry itself as a powerful architect of wave dynamics. Our findings open a conceptually new and experimentally accessible paradigm for material-free control in photonic systems, highlighting the profound role of geometry in shaping fundamental aspects of light propagation.

Title: Modeling partially-ionized dense plasma using wavepacket molecular dynamics
Authors: Daniel Plummer, Pontus Svensson, Wiktor Jasniak, Patrick Hollebon, Sam M. Vinko, Gianluca Gregori
Abstract: We develop a wave packet molecular dynamics framework for modeling the structural properties of partially-ionized dense plasmas, based on a chemical model that explicitly includes bound state wavefunctions. Using hydrogen as a representative system, we compute self-consistent charge state distributions through free energy minimization, following the approach of Plummer et al. [Phys. Rev. E 111, 015204 (2025)]. This enables a direct comparison of static equilibrium properties with path integral Monte Carlo data, facilitating an evaluation of the model's underlying approximations and its ability to capture the complex interplay between ionization and structure in dense plasma environments.

Title: Long-lived giant circular Rydberg atoms at room temperature
Authors: Einius Pultinevicius, Aaron Götzelmann, Fabian Thielemann, Christian Hölzl, Florian Meinert
Abstract: Stability achieved by large angular momentum is ubiquitous in nature, with examples ranging from classical mechanics, over optics and chemistry, to nuclear physics. In atoms, angular momentum can protect excited electronic orbitals from decay due to selection rules. This manifests spectacularly in highly excited Rydberg states. Low angular momentum Rydberg states are at the heart of recent breakthroughs in quantum computing, simulation and sensing with neutral atoms. For these applications the lifetime of the Rydberg levels sets fundamental limits for gate fidelities, coherence times, or spectroscopic precision. The quest for longer Rydberg state lifetimes has motivated the generation, coherent control and trapping of circular Rydberg atoms, which are characterized by the maximally allowed electron orbital momentum and were key to Nobel prize-winning experiments with single atoms and photons. Here, we report the observation of individually trapped circular Rydberg atoms with lifetimes of more than 10 milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer-lived than the established low angular momentum orbitals. This is achieved via Purcell suppression of blackbody modes at room temperature. We coherently control individual circular Rydberg levels at so far elusive principal quantum numbers of up to $n=103$, and observe tweezer trapping of the Rydberg atoms on the few hundred millisecond scale. Our results pave the way for quantum information processing and sensing utilizing the combination of extreme lifetimes and giant Rydberg blockade.

Title: Scalable quantum computation of Quantum Electrodynamics beyond one spatial dimension
Authors: Zong-Gang Mou, Bipasha Chakraborty
Abstract: In the Hamiltonian formulation, Quantum Field Theory calculations scale exponentially with spatial volume, making real-time simulations intractable on classical computers and motivating quantum computation approaches. In Hamiltonian quantisation, bosonic fields introduce the additional challenge of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We present a scalable quantum algorithm for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), an Abelian gauge field theory in higher than one spatial dimensions, designed to address this limit while preserving gauge invariance. In our formulation, Gauss's law is automatically satisfied when the implementation remains fully gauge invariant. We demonstrate how gauge invariance is maintained throughout the lattice discretisation, digitisation, and qubitisation procedures, and identify the most efficient representation for extending to large Hilbert space dimensions. Within this framework, we benchmark several quantum error mitigation techniques and find the calibration method to perform most effectively. The approach scales naturally to larger lattices, and we implement and test the 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional setups on current quantum hardware. Our results indicate that next-generation quantum platforms could enable reliable, fully quantum simulations of large-scale QED dynamics.

Title: Dual-VQE: A quantum algorithm to lower bound the ground-state energy
Authors: Hanna Westerheim, Jingxuan Chen, Zoë Holmes, Ivy Luo, Theshani Nuradha, Dhrumil Patel, Soorya Rethinasamy, Kathie Wang, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm that produces an upper-bound estimate of the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian. As quantum computers become more powerful and go beyond the reach of classical brute-force simulation, it is important to assess the quality of solutions produced by them. Here we propose a dual variational quantum eigensolver (dual-VQE) that produces a lower-bound estimate of the ground-state energy. As such, VQE and dual-VQE can serve as quality checks on their solutions; in the ideal case, the VQE upper bound and the dual-VQE lower bound form an interval containing the true optimal value of the ground-state energy. The idea behind dual-VQE is to employ semi-definite programming duality to rewrite the ground-state optimization problem as a constrained maximization problem, which itself can be bounded from below by an unconstrained optimization problem to be solved by a variational quantum algorithm. When using a convex combination ansatz in conjunction with a classical generative model, the quantum computational resources needed to evaluate the objective function of dual-VQE are no greater than those needed for that of VQE. We also show that the problem is well suited for classical pretraining using matrix product states and these methods help warm-start the optimization. We simulated the performance of dual-VQE on the transverse-field Ising model with and without pretraining and found that, for the example considered, while dual-VQE training is slower and noisier than VQE, it approaches the true value with an error of order $10^{-2}$.

Title: Non-Heisenbergian quantum mechanics
Authors: MohammadJavad Kazemi, Ghadir Jafari
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.

Title: Agnostic Tomography of Stabilizer Product States
Authors: Sabee Grewal, Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, Daniel Liang
Abstract: We define a quantum learning task called agnostic tomography, where given copies of an arbitrary state $\rho$ and a class of quantum states $\mathcal{C}$, the goal is to output a succinct description of a state that approximates $\rho$ at least as well as any state in $\mathcal{C}$ (up to some small error $\varepsilon$). This task generalizes ordinary quantum tomography of states in $\mathcal{C}$ and is more challenging because the learning algorithm must be robust to perturbations of $\rho$. We give an efficient agnostic tomography algorithm for the class $\mathcal{C}$ of $n$-qubit stabilizer product states. Assuming $\rho$ has fidelity at least $\tau$ with a stabilizer product state, the algorithm runs in time $n^{O(1 + \log(1/\tau))} / \varepsilon^2$. This runtime is quasipolynomial in all parameters, and polynomial if $\tau$ is a constant.

Title: Auxiliary-Free Replica Shadows: Efficient Estimation of Multiple Nonlinear Quantum Properties
Authors: Qing Liu, Zihao Li, Xiao Yuan, Huangjun Zhu, You Zhou
Abstract: Efficient estimation of nonlinear properties is a significant yet challenging task from quantum information processing to many-body physics. Current methodologies often suffer from an exponential sampling cost or require auxiliary qubits and deep quantum circuits. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient auxiliary-free replica shadow (AFRS) framework, which leverages the power of the joint entangling operation on a few input replicas while integrating the mindset of shadow estimation. We rigorously prove that AFRS can offer exponential improvements in estimation accuracy compared with the conventional shadow method, and facilitate the simultaneous estimation of various nonlinear properties, unlike the destructive swap test. Additionally, we introduce an advanced local-AFRS variant tailored to estimating local observables with constant-depth quantum circuits, significantly simplifying the experimental implementation. Our work paves the way for efficient and practical estimation of nonlinear properties on near-term quantum devices.

Title: Toward a Theory of Phase Transitions in Quantum Control Landscapes
Authors: Nicolò Beato, Pranay Patil, Marin Bukov
Abstract: Control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) occur as abrupt changes in the cost function landscape upon varying a control parameter, and can be revealed by non-analytic points in statistical order parameters. A prime example are quantum speed limits (QSL) which mark the onset of controllability as the protocol duration is increased. Here we lay the foundations of an analytical theory for CLPTs by developing Dyson, Magnus, and cumulant expansions for the cost function that capture the behavior of CLPTs with a controlled precision. Using linear and quadratic stability analysis, we reveal that CLPTs can be associated with different types of instabilities of the optimal protocol. This allows us to explicitly relate CLPTs to critical structural rearrangements in the extrema of the control landscape: utilizing path integral methods from statistical field theory, we trace back the critical scaling of the order parameter at the QSL to the topological and geometric properties of the set of optimal protocols, such as the number of connected components and its dimensionality. We verify our predictions by introducing a numerical sampling algorithm designed to explore this optimal set via a homotopic stochastic update rule. We apply this new toolbox explicitly to analyze CLPTs in the single- and two-qubit control problems whose landscapes are analytically tractable, and compare the landscapes for bang-bang and continuous protocols. Our work provides the first steps towards a systematic theory of CLPTs and paves the way for utilizing statistical field theory techniques for generic complex control landscapes.

Title: Topological Phase Transitions in a Constrained Two-Qubit Quantum Control Landscape
Authors: Nicolò Beato, Pranay Patil, Marin Bukov
Abstract: In optimal quantum control, control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) indicate sharp changes occurring in the set of optimal protocols, as a physical model parameter is varied. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a new class of CLPTs, associated with changes in the topological properties of the optimal level set in a two-qubit state-preparation problem. In particular, the distance distribution of control protocols sampled through stochastic homotopic dynamics reveals discontinuous changes in the number of connected components in the optimal level set, as a function of the protocol duration. We demonstrate how topological CLPTs can be detected in modern-day experiments.

Title: Generation of Coherent Quantum Light from a Single Impurity-Bound Exciton
Authors: Yuxi Jiang, Christine Falter, Robert M. Pettit, Nils von den Driesch, Yurii Kutovyi, Amirehsan Alizadeh Herfati, Alexander Pawlis, Edo Waks
Abstract: Impurity-bound excitons in II-VI direct-bandgap semiconductors are promising optically active solid-state spin qubits that combine exceptional optical quantum efficiency with an ultra-low spin noise environment. Previous studies on single impurities relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons. However, many quantum applications require resonant driving of quantum emitters to precisely control optical transitions and maintain coherence of the emission. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission of quantum light from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. The resonantly driven emitter exhibits bright quantum light emission that preserves the phase of the resonant drive, validated through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation enables us to directly measure the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, which indicates high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically-driven ionization process that we attribute to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We show that incoherent, low-power laser pumping efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns, recovering the resonance fluorescence emission from the bound exciton. These results pave the way for coherent optical and spin control of the single impurity states through resonant excitation of impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors.

Title: Development of Neural Network-Based Optimal Control Pulse Generator for Quantum Logic Gates Using the GRAPE Algorithm in NMR Quantum Computer
Authors: Ebrahim Khaleghian, Arash Fath Lipaei, Abolfazl Bahrampour, Morteza Nikaeen, Alireza Bahrampour
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a neural network to generate optimal control pulses for general single-qubit quantum logic gates, within a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) quantum computer. By utilizing a neural network, we can efficiently implement any single-qubit quantum logic gates within a reasonable time scale. The network is trained by control pulses generated by the GRAPE algorithm, all starting from the same initial point. After implementing the network, we tested it using numerical simulations. Also, we present the results of applying Neural Network-generated pulses to a three-qubit benchtop NMR system and compare them with simulation outcomes. These numerical and experimental results showcase the precision of the Neural Network-generated pulses in executing the desired dynamics. Ultimately, by developing the neural network using the GRAPE algorithm, we discover the function that maps any single-qubit gate to its corresponding pulse shape. This model enables the real-time generation of arbitrary single-qubit pulses. When combined with the GRAPE-generated pulse for the CNOT gate, it creates a comprehensive and effective set of universal gates. This set can efficiently implement any algorithm in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ era), thereby enhancing the capabilities of quantum optimal control in this domain. Additionally, this approach can be extended to other quantum computer platforms with similar Hamiltonians.

Title: The Jaynes Cummings model as an autonomous Maxwell demon
Authors: Yashovardhan Jha, Dragi Karevski, Cyril Elouard
Abstract: We revisit the Jaynes-Cummings model as an autonomous thermodynamic machine, where a qubit is driven by a cavity containing initially a large coherent field. Our analysis reveals a transition between the expected behavior of ideal-work source of the cavity at short times, and a long-time dynamics where the cavity autonomously measures the qubit and exerts a result-dependent drive. This autonomous feedback then purifies the qubit irrespective of its initial state. We show that the cavity functions thermodynamically as an autonomous Maxwell demon, trading mutual information for cooling power.

Title: Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees
Authors: Jernej Rudi Finžgar, Simone Notarnicola, Madelyn Cain, Mikhail D. Lukin, Dries Sels
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.

Title: Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point
Authors: R. Jafari, J. Naji, A. Langari, Vahid Karimipour, Henrik Johannesson
Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.

Title: Causality, localization, and universality of monitored quantum walks with long-range hopping
Authors: Sayan Roy, Shamik Gupta, Giovanna Morigi
Abstract: A powerful strategy to accelerate quantum-walk-based search algorithms leverages on resetting protocols, where a detector monitors a target site and the evolution of the walker is restarted if no detection occurs within a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyze $S(t)$ for a quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. From this, we provide a strategy to determine the optimal resetting rate. We identify two regimes: for $\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice; for $\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localize the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. Our strategy directly connects local measurement outcomes with the global dynamics encoded in $S(t)$. We derive simple models explaining our numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our findings offer experimentally testable predictions and provide new physical insights on optimizing quantum search through resetting.

Title: A Quantum Range-Doppler Algorithm for Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Formation
Authors: Alessandro Giovagnoli, Sigurd Huber, Gerhard Krieger
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a well established technology in the field of Earth remote sensing. Over the years, the resolution of SAR images has been steadily improving and the pixel count increasing as a result of advances in the sensor technology, and so have the computational resources required to process the raw data to a focused image. Because they are a necessary step in the study of the retrieved data, new high-resolution and low-complexity focusing algorithms are constantly explored in the SAR literature. The theory of quantum computing proposes a new computational framework that might allow to process a vast amount of data in a more efficient way. Relevant to our case is the advantage proven for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), the quantum counterpart of a fundamental element of many SAR focusing algorithms. Motivated by this, in this work we propose a quantum version of the range-Doppler algorithm. We show how in general reference functions, a key element in many SAR focusing algorithms, can be mapped to quantum gates; we present the quantum circuit performing the SAR raw data focusing and we discuss in detail its computational complexity. We find that the core of the quantum range-Doppler algorithm has a computational complexity, namely the number of single- and two-qubit gates, of $O(N)$, less than its classical counterpart with computational complexity $O(N \log N)$.

Title: Typical Machine Learning Datasets as Low-Depth Quantum Circuits
Authors: Florian J. Kiwit, Bernhard Jobst, Andre Luckow, Frank Pollmann, Carlos A. Riofrío
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that investigates the capabilities of quantum computers for learning tasks. While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g., by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.

Title: Quantum harmonic oscillator, index theorem and anomaly
Authors: Shunrui Li, Yang Liu
Abstract: We report a bosonic anomaly emerging in the quantum harmonic oscillator, whose partition function is rigorously identified as the Chern character via the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, establishing a new connection among statistical mechanics, anomaly, Atiyah-Singer index theorem and Gromov-Witten theory. We investigate how its internal energy relates to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, showing that the partition function can be interpreted as the Chern character of "physical sheaf" over Eucildean spacetime by using Grothentic-Riemann-Roch theorem. This correspondence reveals the internal energy of oscillator as a concrete non-SUSY manifestation of the index theorem. Moreover, we show that this connection naturally leads to the emergence of a quantum anomaly. Furthermore, we arrive at Gromov-Witten theory through a more direct and physically intuitive approach. As a result, the internal energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator serves as a bridge linking two key concepts in physics -- statistical mechanics and anomalies -- with three fundamental mathematical frameworks: the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, and Gromov-Witten theory.

Title: On the generic increase of entropy in isolated systems
Authors: Zhiqiang Huang, Qing-yu Cai
Abstract: This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by interactions that induce random-phase fluctuations. By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details, provided the coherent accumulation of systematic biases does not overwhelm the random-phase fluctuations. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. To fully characterize the probability distribution, we introduce both Lorentzian and Gaussian ansatz, analyzing the bulk and tail behaviors respectively, and derive corresponding self-consistent equations for the distribution parameters. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm the predicted logarithmic entropy scaling and validate the self-consistent equations for energy shift and broadening parameters. By combining Lorentzian and Gaussian profiles into an enhanced ansatz, we further refine the description of the distribution, unifying observational entropy concepts with von Neumann entropy dynamics and providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. Our findings resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.

Title: Observation of a Fault Tolerance Threshold with Concatenated Codes
Authors: Grace M. Sommers, Michael Foss-Feig, David Hayes, David A. Huse, Michael J. Gullans
Abstract: We introduce a fault-tolerant protocol for code concatenation of a generalized Shor code using a butterfly network architecture with high noise thresholds and low ancilla overhead to allow implementation on current devices. We develop a probability passing decoder using tensor networks that applies Bayesian updates to the marginal error probabilities after each layer of checks, achieving a state preparation threshold of $e_c \approx 0.089$ for erasure errors, and $\approx 0.015$ for unheralded noise. We implement our state preparation protocol on ion-trap hardware with added noise to demonstrate the threshold behavior in a real quantum device. We further theoretically test the performance of our scheme as a quantum memory and for universal quantum computation through the preparation of low-noise magic states for state distillation and $T$-gate injection.

Title: Macroscopic theory of multipartite correlations in permutation-invariant open quantum systems
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Maciej Chudak, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities have received significant attention as system-independent measures of correlations in many-body quantum systems, e.g., as universal order parameters of synchronization. In this work, we present a method to determine the macroscopic behavior of the steady-state multipartite mutual information between $N$ interacting units undergoing Markovian evolution that is invariant under unit permutations. Using this approach, we extend a conclusion previously drawn for classical systems that the extensive scaling of mutual information is either not possible for systems relaxing to fixed points of the mean-field dynamics or such scaling is not robust to perturbations of system dynamics. In contrast, robust extensive scaling occurs for system relaxing to time-dependent attractors, e.g., limit cycles. We illustrate the applicability of our method on the driven-dissipative Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning for State Tomography Using Classical Data
Authors: Shabnam Jabeen, Dmytro Kurdydyk, Aadi Palnitkar, Mihir Talati, Jeffrey Yan, Jinghong Yang
Abstract: Reconstructing quantum states from measurement data represents a formidable challenge in quantum information science, especially as system sizes grow beyond the reach of traditional tomography methods. While recent studies have explored quantum machine learning (QML) for quantum state tomography (QST), nearly all rely on idealized assumptions, such as direct access to the unknown quantum state as quantum data input, which are incompatible with current hardware constraints. In this work, we present a QML-based tomography protocol that operates entirely on classical measurement data and is fully executable on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our approach employs a variational quantum circuit trained to reconstruct quantum states based solely on measurement outcomes. We test the method in simulation, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse quantum states, including GHZ states, spin chain ground states, and states generated by random circuits. The protocol is then validated on quantum hardware from IBM and IonQ. Additionally, we demonstrate accurate tomography is possible using incomplete measurement bases, a crucial step towards scaling up our protocol. Our results in various scenarios illustrate successful state reconstruction with fidelity reaching 90% or higher. To our knowledge, this is the first QML-based tomography scheme that has been implemented on real quantum processors using exclusively classical measurements. This work establishes the feasibility of QML-based tomography on current quantum platforms and offers a scalable pathway for practical quantum state reconstruction.

Title: How the Kerr-Cat Qubit Dies -- And How to Rescue It
Authors: Othmane Benhayoune-Khadraoui, Cristóbal Lledó, Alexandre Blais
Abstract: Kerr-cat qubits have been experimentally shown to exhibit a large noise bias, with one decay channel suppressed by several orders of magnitude. In superconducting implementations, increasing the microwave drive on the nonlinear oscillator that hosts the Kerr-cat qubit should, in principle, further enhance this bias. Instead, experiments reveal that above a critical drive amplitude the tunneling time, which is the less dominant decay channel, ceases to increase and even decreases. Here, we show that this breakdown arises from the multimode nature of the circuit implementation. Specifically, additional modes, including the buffer mode used to deliver the stabilizing drive and higher modes of the Josephson junction array, can induce multiphoton resonances that sharply degrade Kerr-cat coherence. We uncover this mechanism by retaining the full circuit nonlinearities and treating the strong drive exactly within a Floquet-Markov framework that accounts for quasidegeneracies of the Kerr-cat spectrum. Our results not only provide an explanation for the sudden reduction of the tunneling time but also demonstrate that the Kerr-cat qubit can be very robust in the presence of a carefully engineered electromagnetic environment. Beyond the Kerr-cat qubit, the tools developed here apply broadly to strongly driven dissipative systems with quasidegenerate spectra, including superconducting devices under subharmonic driving (e.g., parametric amplifiers and couplers) and protected qubits where quasidegeneracies similarly govern coherence.

Title: Entanglement Preservation and Clauser-Horne Nonlocality in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Quantum Memories
Authors: Po-Han Tseng, Yong-Fan Chen
Abstract: Entanglement preservation in noisy quantum memories represents a long-standing conceptual challenge in quantum information science. While experiments have shown that electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) memories can store entangled photons, a rigorous theoretical demonstration of whether such memories fundamentally preserve nonlocality has remained elusive. Here we develop a unified open-system model that combines the dark-state polariton formalism with reduced density operator theory to describe the retrieved photon state under realistic ground state decoherence. The analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably transforms an initially pure Bell state into a mixed state and predicts a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Above this threshold, the retrieved photon violates the Clauser-Horne inequality, confirming the preservation of nonlocal quantum correlations, whereas below it, nonlocality is lost. This work provides the first systematic theoretical proof that EIT quantum memories can in principle preserve entanglement and nonlocality, thereby resolving a fundamental question in the physics of quantum information storage.

Title: Characterizing and Mitigating Flux Crosstalk in Superconducting Qubits-Couplers System

Abstract: Superconducting qubits have achieved exceptional gate fidelities, exceeding the error-correction threshold in recent years. One key ingredient of such improvement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the qubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step toward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux control (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and couplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein magnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits or couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux bias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In this study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a multiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout for couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits and couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise compensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line crosstalk from 56.5$\,$permille$\,$to 0.13$\,$permille$\,$ which is close to statistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading to a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free calculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a near-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and supporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors.

Title: Conditional mutual information: A generalization of causal inference in quantum systems
Authors: Anupam Ghosh
Abstract: The concept of causality is fundamental to numerous scientific explanations; however, its extension to the quantum regime has yet to be rigorously explored. This letter introduces the development of a quantum causal index, a novel extension of the classical causal inference framework, tailored to learn the causal relationships inherent in quantum systems. Our study focuses on the asymmetric quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), incorporating the von Neumann entropy, as a directional metric of causal influence in quantum many-body systems. We analyze spin chains using the QCMI, implementing a projective measurement on one site as the intervention and monitoring its effect on a distant site conditioned on intermediate spins. Additionally, we study the effective causal propagation velocity, which is the speed at which QCMI becomes significant at distant sites. These findings indicate the presence of finite-speed propagation of causal influence, along with the emergence of coherent oscillations.

Title: Quantum Phase Sensitivity with Generalized Coherent States Based on Deformed su(1,1) and Heisenberg Algebras
Authors: N.E. Abouelkhir, A. Slaoui, R. Ahl Laamara
Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using a special class of generalized coherent states constructed from generalized Heisenberg and deformed $su(1,1)$ algebras. These states, derived from a perturbed harmonic oscillator with a four parameter deformed spectrum, provide enhanced tunability and nonclassical features. The quantum Fisher information and its associated quantum Cramer-Rao bound are computed to define the fundamental precision limits in phase estimation. We analyze the phase sensitivity under three realistic detection methods: difference intensity detection, single mode intensity detection, and balanced homodyne detection. The performance of each method is compared with the quantum Cramer Rao bound to evaluate their optimality. Our results demonstrate that, for suitable parameter regimes, these generalized coherent states enable phase sensitivities approaching the quantum limit. This offers a flexible framework for precision quantum metrology and potential applications in quantum enhanced sensing.

Title: Foundations of photonic quantum computation
Authors: Martin Bombardelli, Gerard Fleury, Philippe Lacomme, Bogdan Vulpescu
Abstract: This work aims to introduce the fundamental concepts required to perform computations on photonic quantum computers by presenting the gates specific to this architecture and highlighting the connections between standard Pauli gates and those available in photonic systems. The introduction navigates between physical considerations related to the optical components used, theoretical aspects concerning quantum operators, and a more applied section introducing implementations using the Perceval library developed by Quandela. This paper is intended for engineers and researchers familiar with Pauli gates and standard quantum concepts, looking at a clear and compact introduction to photonic components. A second part aims to introduce the concept of polarization, not from a theoretical perspective, but through its practical applications. To do so, we compare the similarities and differences between the original Grover's algorithm formulation and a version that leverages polarization. Gates specific to polarization are introduced and described in the context of the computations involved in Grover's algorithm. The description provided is as mathematical as possible and deliberately avoids physical considerations, in order to allow researchers familiar with "conventional" quantum circuits to more easily grasp the concepts.

Title: Toward Quantum Enabled Solutions for Real-Time Currency Arbitrage in Financial Markets
Authors: Suman Kumar Roy, Rahul Rana, M Girish Chandra, Nishant Kumar, Manoj Nambiar
Abstract: Currency arbitrage leverages price discrepancies in currency exchange rates across different currency pairs to gain risk-free profits. It involves multiple trading, where short-lived price discrepancies require real-time, high-speed processing of vast solution space, posing challenges for classical computing. In this work, we formulate an enhanced mathematical model for the currency arbitrage problem by adding simple cycle preservation constraints, which guarantee trading cycle validity and eliminate redundant or infeasible substructures. To solve this model, we use and benchmark various solvers, including Quantum Annealing (QA), gate-based quantum approaches such as Variational Quantum Algorithm with Adaptive Cost Encoding (ACE), as well as classical solvers such as Gurobi and classical meta heuristics such as Tabu Search (TS). We propose a classical multi-bit swap post-processing to improve the solution generated by ACE. Using real-world currency exchange data, we compare these methods in terms of both arbitrage profit and execution time, the two key performance metrics. Our results give insight into the current capabilities and limitations of quantum methods for real-time financial use cases.

Title: Dynamical quantum codes and logic gates on a lattice with sparse connectivity
Authors: Dominic J. Williamson, Bence Hetényi
Abstract: We introduce several dynamical schemes that take advantage of mid-circuit measurement and nearest-neighbor gates on a lattice with maximum vertex degree three to implement topological codes and perform logic gates between them. We first review examples of Floquet codes and their implementation with nearest-neighbor gates and ancillary qubits. Next, we describe implementations of these Floquet codes that make use of the ancillary qubits to reset all qubits every measurement cycle. We then show how switching the role of data and ancilla qubits allows a pair of Floquet codes to be implemented simultaneously. We describe how to perform a logical Clifford gate to entangle a pair of Floquet codes that are implemented in this way. Finally, we show how switching between the color code and a pair of Floquet codes, via a depth-two circuit followed by mid-circuit measurement, can be used to perform syndrome extraction for the color code.

Title: A Variance-Based Convergence Criterion in Neural Variational Monte Carlo for Quantum Systems
Authors: Huan-Chen Shi, Er-Liang Cui, Dan Zhou
Abstract: The optimization of neural wave functions in variational Monte Carlo crucially relies on a robust convergence criterion. While the energy variance is theoretically a definitive measure, its practical application as a primary convergence criterion has been underexplored. In this work, we develop a lightweight, general-purpose solver that utilizes the energy variance as a convergence criterion. We apply it to several systems-including the harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom, and charmonium hadron-for validating the variance as a reliable diagnostic, and using a empirical threshold $10^{-3}$ as the energy variance convergence values for performing rapid parameter scans to enable preliminary physical verification. To clarify the scope of our approach, we derive an inequality that delineates the limitations of variance-based optimization in nodal systems. Despite these limitations, the energy variance proves to be a highly valuable tool, guiding our solver to efficient and reliable results across a range of quantum problems.

Title: Factorizability of optimal quantum sequence discrimination under maximum-confidence measurements
Authors: Donghoon Ha, Jeong San Kim
Abstract: We consider the discrimination of quantum sequences under maximum-confidence measurements and show that the optimal discrimination of a quantum sequence ensemble can always be factorized into that of each individual ensemble. In other words, the optimal quantum sequence discrimination under maximum-confidence measurements can be achieved just by performing a maximum-confidence discrimination independently at each step of the quantum sequence. We also show that the maximum confidence of identifying a quantum sequence is to achieve the maximum confidence of identifying each state comprising the quantum sequence. We further provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal quantum state discrimination under maximum-confidence measurements.

Title: Can Bose-Einstein condensates enhance radioactive decay?
Authors: Hanzhen Lin, Yukun Lu, Wolfgang Ketterle
Abstract: This paper lays out the principles of how Bose-Einstein condensates can modify radioactive decay. We highlight the challenges of many modes and short coherence times due to the $\approx$ MeV energies of the emitted radiation. Recent proposals for gamma ray and neutrino lasers claim that using a Bose-Einstein condensate as a source would solve these issues. We show that this is not the case, and the proposed experiments would have a gain of only $10^{-20}$ or smaller. We also analyze proposals for gamma ray lasers based on stimulated annihilation of positronium Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title: Stesso: A reconfigurable decomposition of $n$-bit Toffoli gates using symmetrical logical structures and adjustable support qubits
Authors: Shanyan Chen, Ali Al-Bayaty, Xiaoyu Song, Marek Perkowski
Abstract: An $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gate is mainly utilized to construct other quantum gates and operators, such as Fredkin gates, arithmetical adders, and logical comparators, where $n \geq 2$. Several researchers introduced different methods to decompose $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates in a quantum circuit into a set of standard 3-bit Toffoli gates or a set of elementary quantum gates, such as single-qubit and two-qubit gates. However, these methods are not effectively reconfigurable for linearly connected symmetrical structures (layouts) of contemporary quantum computers, usually utilizing more ancilla qubits. This paper introduces a new structural design method to effectively decompose $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates by utilizing configurable ancilla qubits, which we named the ``support qubits". Collectively, we call our decomposition method for symmetrical structures using support qubits the ``step-decreasing structures shaped operators (Stesso)". The main advantage of Stesso is to configurable construct different decomposed operators of various polarities and intermediate sub-circuits, such as Positive Polarity-Stesso, Mixed Polarity-Stesso, and Generalized-Stesso. With Stesso, it has been experimentally proven that $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates always have lower quantum costs than using conventional composition methods.

Title: Practical hybrid decoding scheme for parity-encoded spin systems
Authors: Yoshihiro Nambu
Abstract: We propose a practical hybrid decoding scheme for the parity-encoding architecture. This architecture was first introduced by N. Sourlas as a computational technique for tackling hard optimization problems, especially those modeled by spin systems such as the Ising model and spin glasses, and reinvented by W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller to develop quantum annealing devices. We study the specific model, called the SLHZ model, aiming to achieve a near-term quantum annealing device implemented solely through geometrically local spin interactions. Taking account of the close connection between the SLHZ model and a classical low-density-parity-check code, two approaches can be chosen for the decoding: (1) finding the ground state of a spin Hamiltonian derived from the SLHZ model, which can be achieved via stochastic decoders such as quantum annealing or classical Monte Carlo samplers; (2) using deterministic decoding techniques for the classical LDPC code, such as belief propagation and bit-flip decoder. The proposed hybrid approach combines the two approaches by applying bit-flip decoding to the readout of the stochastic decoder based on the SLHZ model. We present simulations demonstrating that this approach can reveal the latent potential of the SLHZ model, realizing soft-annealing concept proposed by Sourlas.

Title: Quantum Time-Space Tradeoffs for Matrix Problems
Authors: Paul Beame, Niels Kornerup, Michael Whitmeyer
Abstract: We consider the time and space required for quantum computers to solve a wide variety of problems involving matrices, many of which have only been analyzed classically in prior work. Our main results show that for a range of linear algebra problems -- including matrix-vector product, matrix inversion, matrix multiplication and powering -- existing classical time-space tradeoffs, several of which are tight for every space bound, also apply to quantum algorithms. For example, for almost all matrices $A$, including the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, we prove that quantum circuits with at most $T$ input queries and $S$ qubits of memory require $T=\Omega(n^2/S)$ to compute matrix-vector product $Ax$ for $x \in \{0,1\}^n$. We similarly prove that matrix multiplication for $n\times n$ binary matrices requires $T=\Omega(n^3 / \sqrt{S})$. Because many of our lower bounds match deterministic algorithms with the same time and space complexity, we show that quantum computers cannot provide any asymptotic advantage for these problems with any space bound. We obtain matching lower bounds for the stronger notion of quantum cumulative memory complexity -- the sum of the space per layer of a circuit. We also consider Boolean (i.e. AND-OR) matrix multiplication and matrix-vector products, improving the previous quantum time-space tradeoff lower bounds for $n\times n$ Boolean matrix multiplication to $T=\Omega(n^{2.5}/S^{1/4})$ from $T=\Omega(n^{2.5}/S^{1/2})$. Our improved lower bound for Boolean matrix multiplication is based on a new coloring argument that extracts more from the strong direct product theorem used in prior work. Our tight lower bounds for linear algebra problems require adding a new bucketing method to the recording-query technique of Zhandry that lets us apply classical arguments to upper bound the success probability of quantum circuits.
