Title: On the causal efficacy of qualia: Philosophical zombies are fine-tuned, and implications for the quantum measurement theory
Authors: Adam Brownstein
Abstract: We suggest that qualia have a causally efficacious role in quantum mechanics; an occurrence which explains how information about qualia can enter the physical environment. This is compatible with the unitary time-evolution of the quantum state if qualia are understood as effecting the beables of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation or wavefunction collapse process rather than at the wavefunction level. We furthermore suggest that not all quantum states are consistent with qualia. If this is the case, the standard wavefunction collapse postulates of the Copenhagen interpretation will fail to select only those states which are consistent with qualia, and the Born-rule must be modified if wavefunction collapse is to generate the correct dynamical histories across time. This new model which includes qualia clearly demonstrates how non-linear and self-referential phenomena can occur, despite the linear, deterministic time-evolution of the wavefunction. We reject the notion that physical matter operates independently of qualia, and find that the main evidence for epiphenomenalism i.e. the causal closure of the underlying physical time-evolution, has failed to take into consideration fine-tuning of the microcausal degrees of freedom. We propose that the philosophical zombie argument is fine-tuned in the initial conditions, thus making philosophical zombies statistically unlikely if the fine-tuning is removed. We furthermore suggest the presence of fine-tuning can be used as a test for consciousness in the general case. This explains why some classical processes such as computer circuits may never be conscious; because they lack the capacity for fine-tuning when the dynamics is reversed.

Title: Quantum multiphase estimation
Authors: Marco Barbieri, Ilaria Gianani, Aaron Z. Goldberg, Luis L. Sánchez-Soto
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is fundamental to advancing quantum science and technology. While much of the research has concentrated on estimating a single phase, the simultaneous estimation of multiple phases can yield significantly enhanced sensitivities when using specially tailored input quantum states. This work reviews recent theoretical and experimental advancements in the parallel estimation of multiple arbitrary phases. We highlight strategies for constructing optimal measurement protocols and discuss the experimental platforms best suited for implementing these techniques.

Title: A unifying account of warm start guarantees for patches of quantum landscapes
Authors: Hela Mhiri, Ricard Puig, Sacha Lerch, Manuel S. Rudolph, Thiparat Chotibut, Supanut Thanasilp, Zoë Holmes
Abstract: Barren plateaus are fundamentally a statement about quantum loss landscapes on average but there can, and generally will, exist patches of barren plateau landscapes with substantial gradients. Previous work has studied certain classes of parameterized quantum circuits and found example regions where gradients vanish at worst polynomially in system size. Here we present a general bound that unifies all these previous cases and that can tackle physically-motivated ansätze that could not be analyzed previously. Concretely, we analytically prove a lower-bound on the variance of the loss that can be used to show that in a non-exponentially narrow region around a point with curvature the loss variance cannot decay exponentially fast. This result is complemented by numerics and an upper-bound that suggest that any loss function with a barren plateau will have exponentially vanishing gradients in any constant radius subregion. Our work thus suggests that while there are hopes to be able to warm-start variational quantum algorithms, any initialization strategy that cannot get increasingly close to the region of attraction with increasing problem size is likely inadequate.

Title: Enhancing dissipative cat qubit protection by squeezing
Authors: Rémi Rousseau, Diego Ruiz, Emanuele Albertinale, Pol d'Avezac, Danielius Banys, Ugo Blandin, Nicolas Bourdaud, Giulio Campanaro, Gil Cardoso, Nathanael Cottet, Charlotte Cullip, Samuel Deléglise, Louise Devanz, Adam Devulder, Antoine Essig, Pierre Février, Adrien Gicquel, Élie Gouzien, Antoine Gras, Jérémie Guillaud, Efe Gümüş, Mattis Hallén, Anissa Jacob, Paul Magnard, Antoine Marquet, Salim Miklass, Théau Peronnin, Stéphane Polis, Felix Rautschke, Ulysse Réglade, Julien Roul, Jeremy Stevens, Jeanne Solard, Alexandre Thomas, Jean-Loup Ville, Pierre Wan-Fat, Raphaël Lescanne, Zaki Leghtas, Joachim Cohen, Sébastien Jezouin, Anil Murani
Abstract: Dissipative cat-qubits are a promising architecture for quantum processors due to their built-in quantum error correction. By leveraging two-photon stabilization, they achieve an exponentially suppressed bit-flip error rate as the distance in phase-space between their basis states increases, incurring only a linear increase in phase-flip rate. This property substantially reduces the number of qubits required for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we implement a squeezing deformation of the cat qubit basis states, further extending the bit-flip time while minimally affecting the phase-flip rate. We demonstrate a steep reduction in the bit-flip error rate with increasing mean photon number, characterized by a scaling exponent $\gamma=4.3$, rising by a factor of 74 per added photon. Specifically, we measure bit-flip times of 22 seconds for a phase-flip time of 1.3 $\mu$s in a squeezed cat qubit with an average photon number $\bar{n}=4.1$, a 160-fold improvement in bit-flip time compared to a standard cat. Moreover, we demonstrate a two-fold reduction in $Z$-gate infidelity, with an estimated phase-flip probability of $\epsilon_X = 0.085$ and a bit-flip probability of $\epsilon_Z = 2.65 \cdot 10^{-9}$ which confirms the gate bias-preserving property. This simple yet effective technique enhances cat qubit performances without requiring design modification, moving multi-cat architectures closer to fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Quantum Annealing Enhanced Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
Authors: Shunta Arai, Tadashi Kadowaki
Abstract: In this study, we propose quantum annealing-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QAEMCMC), where QA is integrated into the MCMC subroutine. QA efficiently explores low-energy configurations and overcomes local minima, enabling the generation of proposal states with a high acceptance probability. We benchmark QAEMCMC for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and demonstrate its superior performance over the classical MCMC method. Our results reveal larger spectral gaps, faster convergence of energy observables, and reduced total variation distance between the empirical and target distributions. QAEMCMC accelerates MCMC and provides an efficient method for complex systems, paving the way for scalable quantum-assisted sampling strategies.

Title: Dicke-Ising quantum battery of an ion chain driven by a mechanical oscillator
Authors: Jun Wen, Zheng Wen, Ping Peng, Guan-Qiang Li
Abstract: A scheme for implementing quantum batteries in a realizable and controllable platform based on a trapped ion chain driven by a mechanical oscillator is proposed. The effects of the hopping interaction between the two-level ions and the coupling interaction between the ions and the external mechanical oscillator on the charging process of the battery are investigated. The importance of the counter-rotating wave terms in the system's Hamiltonian, which are often ignored, is analyzed, and it is found that the charging energy and the ergotropy of the battery are dramatically affected by the counter-rotating wave terms. The quantum phase transition of the two-level system is restrained by the counter-rotating wave terms due to the destruction of the quantum coherence. Lastly, the power-law dependence of the charging process on the distance between the ions is discussed. Our theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the development of a practical quantum battery.

Title: Reducing thermal noises by a quantum refrigerator
Authors: Han-Jia Bi, Sheng-Wen Li
Abstract: Reducing the thermal noises in microwave (MW) resonators can bring about significant progress in many research fields. Recently, a bench-top cooling method using "quantum refrigerators" has been adopted to reduce the thermal noises, reaching around liquid nitrogen temperature. In this study, we investigate the possible cooling limit of the MW resonator by using three-level or four-level systems as the quantum refrigerator. In this refrigerator system, proper light pump makes the multilevel systems concentrated into their ground states, which continuously absorb the thermal photons in the MW resonator. By adiabatic elimination, we give a more precise description for this cooling process. It turns out, though the multilevel systems can be efficiently cooled down, the laser driving also significantly perturbs their energy levels. For three-level refrigerators, such perturbation causes the atom-resonator interaction to become off-resonant, impeding the heat transfer from the MW resonator to the refrigerator, which greatly weakens the cooling effect. We also find that, by using four-level systems as the refrigerator, this issue can be well overcome. Based on practical parameters, our estimation shows the cooling limit could reach the liquid helium temperature.

Title: Fast and robust production of quantum superposition states by the fractional shortcut to adiabaticity
Authors: Guan-Qiang Li, Hao Guo, Yu-Qi Zhang, Bo Yang, Ping Peng
Abstract: The fractional shortcut to adiabaticity (f-STA) for production of quantum superposition states is proposed firstly via a three-level system with $\Lambda$-type linkage pattern and a four-level system with tripod structure. \textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{\sout{The fast, robust and efficient}} \textcolor[rgb]{0,0,1}{\uwave{The fast and robust}} production of the coherent superposition states is studied by comparing the populations for the f-STA and the fractional stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (f-STIRAP). The \textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{\sout{superposition}} states with equal proportion can be produced by fixing the controllable parameters of the driving pulses at the final moment of the whole process. The effects of the pulse intensity and the time delay of the pulses on the production process are discussed by monitoring the populations on all of the quantum states. In particular, the spontaneous emission arising from the intermediate state is investigated by the quantum master equation. The result reveals that the f-STA exhibits superior advantages over the f-STIRAP in producing the superposition states.

Title: Perfect state transfer between real pure states
Authors: Chris Godsil, Stephen Kirkland, Hermie Monterde
Abstract: Pure states correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$ represented by unit vectors. In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state $\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real pure state $\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state transfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\tau$, there exists a real symmetric matrix $M$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect state transfer relative to $M$ at time $\tau$. We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that among all $n$-vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the Laplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the adjacency matrix.

Title: Chirality, Nonreciprocity and Symmetries for a Giant Atom
Authors: Luting Xu, Lingzhen Guo
Abstract: Chiral and nonreciprocal quantum devices are crucial for signal routing and processing in a quantum network. In this work, we study the chirality and nonreciprocity of a giant atom coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. We clarify that the chiral emission of the giant atom is not directly related to the time-reversal symmetry breaking but to the mirror-symmetry breaking. We propose a passive scheme to realize the chiral emission of a giant atom without breaking time-reversal symmetry by extending the legs of the giant atom. We find the time-reversal symmetry breaking via nonuniform coupling phases is artificial and thus cannot result in nonreciprocal single-photon scattering for the giant atom. The nonreciprocity of the giant atom can be obtained by the external dissipation of the giant atom that truly breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Our work clarifies the roles of symmetries in the chirality and nonreciprocity of giant-atom systems and paves the way for the design of on-chip functional devices with superconducting giant atoms.

Title: Learning-Based Design of LQG Controllers in Quantum Coherent Feedback
Authors: Chunxiang Song, Yanan Liu, Guofeng Zhang, Huadong Mo, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a differential evolution (DE) algorithm specifically tailored for the design of Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controllers in quantum systems. Building upon the foundational DE framework, the algorithm incorporates specialized modules, including relaxed feasibility rules, a scheduled penalty function, adaptive search range adjustment, and the ``bet-and-run'' initialization strategy. These enhancements improve the algorithm's exploration and exploitation capabilities while addressing the unique physical realizability requirements of quantum systems. The proposed method is applied to a quantum optical system, where three distinct controllers with varying configurations relative to the plant are designed. The resulting controllers demonstrate superior performance, achieving lower LQG performance indices compared to existing approaches. Additionally, the algorithm ensures that the designs comply with physical realizability constraints, guaranteeing compatibility with practical quantum platforms. The proposed approach holds significant potential for application to other linear quantum systems in performance optimization tasks subject to physically feasible constraints.

Title: Quantum-Efficient Kernel Target Alignment
Authors: Rodrigo Coelho, Georg Kruse, Andreas Rosskopf
Abstract: In recent years, quantum computers have emerged as promising candidates for implementing kernels. Quantum Embedding Kernels embed data points into quantum states and calculate their inner product in a high-dimensional Hilbert Space by computing the overlap between the resulting quantum states. Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) are typically used for this end, with Kernel Target Alignment (KTA) as cost function. The optimized kernels can then be deployed in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification tasks. However, both classical and quantum SVMs scale poorly with increasing dataset sizes. This issue is exacerbated in quantum kernel methods, as each inner product requires a quantum circuit execution. In this paper, we investigate KTA-trained quantum embedding kernels and employ a low-rank matrix approximation, the Nyström method, to reduce the quantum circuit executions needed to construct the Kernel Matrix. We empirically evaluate the performance of our approach across various datasets, focusing on the accuracy of the resulting SVM and the reduction in quantum circuit executions. Additionally, we examine and compare the robustness of our model under different noise types, particularly coherent and depolarizing noise.

Title: Bound entanglement-assisted prepare-and-measure scenarios
Authors: István Márton, Erika Bene, Tamás Vértesi
Abstract: We present a class of linear correlation witnesses that can detect bound entanglement in two-ququart Bloch-diagonal states within a three-party prepare-and-measure scenario. We relate the detection power of our witnesses to that of the computable cross norm-realignment (CCNR) criterion. Reliable iterative methods reveal that the separable bound is matched by the classical bound of the correlation witnesses. Several bound entangled states can exceed these bounds, including those with metrological usefulness. In particular, we show that a prominent two-ququart bound entangled state with a positive partial transpose (PPT) can be mixed with up to $40\%$ isotropic noise and still be detected as entangled by our prepare-and-measure witness. Furthermore, our witnesses appear to be experimentally practical, requiring only the use of qubit rotations on Alice's and Bob's sides and product measurements with binary outcomes on Charlie's side.

Title: Deterministic generation of non-classical mechanical states in cavity optomechanics via reinforcement learning
Authors: Yu-Hong Liu, Qing-Shou Tan, Le-Man Kuang, Jie-Qiao Liao
Abstract: Non-classical mechanical states, as vital quantum resources for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior, have wide applications in the study of the fundamental quantum mechanics and modern quantum technology. In this work, we propose a scheme for deterministically generating non-classical mechanical states in cavity optomechanical systems. By working in the eigen-representation of the nonlinear optomechanical systems, we identify the carrier-wave resonance conditions and seek for the optimal driving pulses for state preparations. Concretely, we employ the reinforcement learning method to optimize the pulsed driving fields, effectively suppressing the undesired transitions induced by both the pulsed driving fields and dissipations. This approach enables the high-fidelity preparation of phononic Fock states and superposed Fock states in the single-resonator optomechanical systems, as well as two-mode entangled states in the two-resonator optomechanical systems. The statistical properties of the generated states are also examined. Our results open a way for quantum state engineering in quantum optics and quantum information science via reinforcement learning.

Title: Theory of an autonomous quantum heat engine based on superconducting electric circuits with non-Markovian heat baths
Authors: Miika Rasola, Vasilii Vadimov, Tuomas Uusnäkki, Mikko Möttönen
Abstract: We propose and theoretically analyze a realistic superconducting electric circuit that can be used to realize an autonomous quantum heat engine in circuit quantum electrodynamics. Using a quasiclassical, non-Markovian theoretical model, we demonstrate that coherent microwave photon generation can emerge solely from heat flow through the circuit and its nonlinear internal dynamics. The predicted generation rate is sufficiently high for experimental observation in circuit quantum electrodynamics, making this work a significant step toward the first experimental realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine in superconducting circuits.

Title: Demonstration of Fourier-domain Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography for a fast tomographic quantum imaging
Authors: Sylwia M. Kolenderska, Crislane Vieira de Brito, Piotr Kolenderski
Abstract: Using spectrally correlated photon pairs instead of classical laser light and coincidence detection instead of light intensity detection, Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography (Q-OCT) outperforms classical OCT in several experimental terms. It provides twice better axial resolution with the same spectral bandwidth and it is immune to even-order chromatic dispersion, including Group Velocity Dispersion responsible for the bulk of axial resolution degradation in the OCT images. Q-OCT has been performed in the time domain configuration, where one line of the two-dimensional image is acquired by axially translating the mirror in the interferometer's reference arm and measuring the coincidence rate of photons arriving at two single-photon-sensitive detectors. Although successful at producing resolution-doubled and dispersion-cancelled images, it is still relatively slow and cannot compete with its classical counterpart. Here, we experimentally demonstrate Q-OCT in a novel Fourier-domain configuration, theoretically proposed in 2020, where the reference mirror is fixed and the joint spectra are acquired. We show that such a configuration allows for faster image acquisition than its time-domain configuration, providing a step forward towards a practical and competitive solution in the OCT arena. The limitations of the novel approach are discussed, contrasted with the limitations of both the time-domain approach and the traditional OCT.

We derive the optimal probe states that jointly maximize precision, minimize sloppiness, and eliminate quantum incompatibility. Additionally, we analyze the properties of the set of optimal probes and evaluate their robustness against noise.

Title: Towards a function-scalable quantum network with multiplexed energy-time entanglement
Authors: Xiao Xiang, Jingyuan Liu, Bingke Shi, Huibo Hong, Xizi Sun, Yuting Liu, Runai Quan, Tao Liu, Shougang Zhang, Wei Zhang, Ruifang Dong
Abstract: Quantum networks, which hinge on the principles of quantum mechanics, are revolutionizing the domain of information technology. The vision for quantum networks involves the efficient distribution and utilization of quantum resources across a network to support a variety of quantum applications. However, current quantum protocols often develop independently, leading to incompatibilities that limit the functional scalability of the network. In this paper, we showcase a compatible and complementary implementation of two distinct quantum applications, quantum time synchronization and quantum cryptography, by multiplexing the same energy-time entangled biphotons and quantum channel. A proof-of-principle experiment between two independent nodes across a 120 km fiber-optic link is demonstrated, which achieve sub-picosecond synchronization stability based on the quantum two-way time transfer protocol. Simultaneously, this synchronization provides the required timing for implementing dispersive-optic quantum key distribution with an average finite-size secure key rate of 73.8 bits per second, which can be employed to safeguard the security of the transferred timing data. Furthermore, thanks to the compatibility, potential asymmetric delay attacks in the link, which are detrimental to the accomplishment of secure key distribution, can be effectively mitigated by the parallel quantum time synchronization procedure. Our demonstration marks a substantial leap towards unlocking the full potential of energy-time entanglement and paves the way for a resource-efficient, function-scalable, and highly compatible quantum network.

Title: All Hilbert spaces are the same: consequences for generalized coordinates and momenta
Authors: S.J. van Enk, D.A. Steck
Abstract: Making use of the simple fact that all separable complex Hilbert spaces of given dimension are isomorphic, we show that there are just six basic ways to define generalized coordinate operators in Quantum Mechanics. In each case a canonically conjugate generalized momentum operator can be defined, but it may not be self-adjoint. Even in those cases we show there is always either a self-adjoint extension of the operator or a Neumark extension of the Hilbert space that produces a self-adjoint momentum operator. In one of the six cases both extensions work, thus leading to seven basic pairs of coordinate and momentum operators. We also show why there are more ways of defining basic coordinate and momentum measurements. A special role is reserved for measurements that simultaneously measure both.

Title: Fast, accurate, and predictive method for atom detection in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays
Authors: Marc Cheneau, Romaric Journet, Matthieu Boffety, François Goudail, Caroline Kulcsár, Pauline Trouvé-Peloux
Abstract: We introduce a new method, rooted in estimation theory, to detect the individual atoms in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays, such as optical lattices or optical tweezer arrays. Using simulated images, we demonstrate a ten-fold reduction of the detection error rate compared to the popular method based on Wiener deconvolution, under a wide range of experimental conditions. The runtime is fully compatible with real-time applications, even for a very large arrays. Finally, we propose a rigorous definition for the signal-to-noise ratio of an image, and show that it can be used as a predictor for the detection error rate, which opens new prospect for the design of future experiments.

Title: The Born rule -- 100 years ago and today
Authors: Arnold Neumaier
Abstract: Details of the contents, and formulations of the Born rule changed considerably from its inception by Born in 1926 to the present day. Based to a large extent on little known results from the recent books 'Coherent Quantum Physics' by Neumaier and 'Algebraic Quantum Physics', Vol. 1 by Neumaier and Westra, this paper traces the early history 100 years ago, its generalization (essential for today's quantum optics and quantum information theory) to POVMs 50 year ago, and a modern derivation from an intuitive definition of the notion of a quantum detector. Also discussed is the extent to which the various forms of the Born rule have, like any other statement in physics, a restricted domain of validity, which leads to problems when applied outside this domain.

Authors: Vrinda Mehta, Hans De Raedt, Kristel Michielsen, Fengping Jin
Abstract: D-Wave quantum annealers offer reverse annealing as a feature allowing them to refine solutions to optimization problems. This paper investigates the influence of key parameters, such as annealing times and reversal distance, on the behavior of reverse annealing by studying models containing up to 1000 qubits. Through the analysis of theoretical models and experimental data, we explore the interplay between quantum and classical processes. Our findings provide a deeper understanding that can better equip users to fully harness the potential of the D-Wave annealers

Title: Multiplexed qubit readout quality metric beyond assignment fidelity
Authors: Andras Di Giovanni, Adrian Skasberg Aasen, Jürgen Lisenfeld, Martin Gärttner, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov
Abstract: The accurate measurement of quantum two-level objects (qubits) is crucial for developing quantum computing hardware. Over the last decade, the measure of choice for benchmarking readout routines for superconducting qubits has been assignment fidelity. However, this method only focuses on the preparation of computational basis states and therefore does not provide a complete characterization of the readout. Here, we expand the focus to the use of detector tomography to fully characterize multi-qubit readout of superconducting transmon qubits. The impact of different readout parameters on the rate of information extraction is studied using quantum state reconstruction infidelity as a proxy. The results are then compared with assignment fidelities, showing good agreement for separable two-qubit states. We therefore propose the rate of infidelity convergence as an alternative and more comprehensive benchmark for single- and multi-qubit readout optimization. We find the most effective allocation of a fixed shot budget between detector tomography and state reconstruction in single- and two-qubit experiments. To address the growing interest in three-qubit gates, we perform three-qubit quantum state tomography that goes beyond conventional readout error mitigation methods and find a factor of 30 reduction in quantum infidelity. Our results demonstrate that neither quantum nor classical qubit readout correlations are induced even by very high levels of readout noise. Consequently, correlation coefficients can serve as a valuable tool in qubit readout optimization.

Title: Noise Reversal by Entropy Quantum Computing
Authors: Yu-Ping Huang, Yongxiang Hu
Abstract: Signal to noise ratio is key to any measurement. Recent progress in semi/super-conductor technology have pushed the signal detection sensitivity to the ultimate quantum level, but the noise issue remains largely untouched and, in many cases, becomes even more severe because of the high sensitivity. In this paper, we explore a hardware-based approach to noise removal using entropy quantum computing. Distinct to any existing de-noising approach, it observes and reproduces the quantum statistical properties of noise in an optical system to emulate and thereby reverse the noise from data. We show how it can recover 1D and 2D image data mixed with much stronger noise.

Title: Adiabatic quantum unstructured search in parallel
Authors: Sean A. Adamson, Petros Wallden
Abstract: We present an optimized adiabatic quantum schedule for unstructured search building on the original approach of Roland and Cerf [Phys. Rev. A 65, 042308 (2002)]. Our schedule adiabatically varies the Hamiltonian even more rapidly at the endpoints of its evolution, preserving Grover's well-known quadratic quantum speedup. In the errorless adiabatic limit, the probability of successfully obtaining the marked state from a measurement increases directly proportional to time, suggesting efficient parallelization. Numerical simulations of an appropriate reduced two-dimensional Schrödinger system confirm adiabaticity while demonstrating superior performance in terms of probability compared to existing adiabatic algorithms and Grover's algorithm, benefiting applications with possible premature termination. We introduce a protocol that ensures a marked-state probability at least $p$ in time of order $\sqrt{N}(1+p/\varepsilon)$, and analyze its implications for realistic bounded-resource scenarios. Our findings suggest that quantum advantage may still be achievable under constrained coherence times (where other algorithms fail), provided the hardware allows for them to be sufficiently long.

Title: Temporal Model On Quantum Logic
Authors: Francesco D'Agostino
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical framework for modeling temporal memory dynamics, combining concepts from temporal logic, memory decay models, and hierarchical contexts. The framework formalizes the evolution of propositions over time using linear and branching temporal models, incorporating exponential decay (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve) and reactivation mechanisms via Bayesian updating. The hierarchical organization of memory is represented using directed acyclic graphs to model recall dependencies and interference. Novel insights include feedback dynamics, recursive influences in memory chains, and the integration of entropy-based recall efficiency. This approach provides a foundation for understanding memory processes across cognitive and computational domains.

Title: Lattice Defects in Rydberg Atom Arrays
Authors: Hanteng Wang, Chengshu Li, Xingyu Li, Yingfei Gu, Shang Liu
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have become a key platform for studying quantum many-body systems. In these setups, defects arise naturally due to various imperfections and can significantly modify the theoretical predictions compared to an ideal model. Here, we investigate the impact of geometric defects in the simplest situation -- a one-dimensional Rydberg atom array, both at and away from its emergent Ising criticality. In the presence of defects, we demonstrate that relevant physical quantities can be extracted from one-point correlation functions. At the critical point, we show that different types of kinks yield distinct outcomes corresponding to their respective spatial-internal symmetries: site-centered kinks can effectively break the array at the kink position regardless of the kink angle, while bond-centered kinks lead to interesting intermediate-coupling fixed points. In the latter case, due to a special renormalization group flow trajectory, the whole system can appear ordered if the system is not large enough. Additionally, away from criticality, the bond-centered kink induces a localization-delocalization transition of the domain wall, characteristic of quantum wetting. These findings highlight the utility of kinks as experimental probes and stress the importance of controlling defects so that experimental observations remain faithful to the pristine model.

Title: The Observational Partial Order of Causal Structures with Latent Variables
Authors: Marina Maciel Ansanelli, Elie Wolfe, Robert W. Spekkens
Abstract: For two causal structures with the same set of visible variables, one is said to observationally dominate the other if the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the first contains the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the second. Knowing such dominance relations is useful for adjudicating between these structures given observational data. We here consider the problem of determining the partial order of equivalence classes of causal structures with latent variables relative to observational dominance. We provide a complete characterization of the dominance order in the case of three visible variables, and a partial characterization in the case of four visible variables. Our techniques also help to identify which observational equivalence classes have a set of realizable distributions that is characterized by nontrivial inequality constraints, analogous to Bell inequalities and instrumental inequalities. We find evidence that as one increases the number of visible variables, the equivalence classes satisfying nontrivial inequality constraints become ubiquitous. (Because such classes are the ones for which there can be a difference in the distributions that are quantumly and classically realizable, this implies that the potential for quantum-classical gaps is also ubiquitous.) Furthermore, we find evidence that constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that rely solely on conditional independence constraints have a significantly weaker distinguishing power among observational equivalence classes than algorithms that go beyond these (i.e., algorithms that also leverage nested Markov constraints and inequality constraints).

Title: Terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons
Authors: B. Benhamou-Bui, C. Consejo, S.S. Krishtopenko, S. Ruffenach, C. Bray, J. Torres, J. Dzian, F. Le Mardelé, A. Pagot, X. Baudry, S.V. Morozov, N.N. Mikhailov, S.A. Dvoretskii, B. Jouault, P. Ballet, M. Orlita, C. Ciuti, F. Teppe
Abstract: We report intense terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons, representing a major step toward achieving stimulated cyclotron emission and polariton-based lasers. By strongly coupling the cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells with optical cavity modes, we observe efficient emission near the lasing threshold. This work demonstrates that polariton condensation, a process that bypasses the need for electronic population inversion, can significantly reduce the emission threshold compared to conventional mechanisms requiring high electric fields. Moreover, this concept unlocks the potential for stimulated emission in previously unsuitable narrow-gap semiconductors, as well as Dirac materials with non-equidistant Landau levels. These results open a new way for the development of compact, tunable terahertz lasers based on Landau polaritons, offering new opportunities for solid-state laser technology and applications in the terahertz gap.

Title: Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Coherent Transport
Authors: Kay Brandner, Keiji Saito
Abstract: We derive a universal thermodynamic uncertainty relation for Fermionic coherent transport, which bounds the total rate of entropy production in terms of the mean and fluctuations of a single particle current. This bound holds for any multi-terminal geometry and arbitrary chemical and thermal biases, as long as no external magnetic fields are applied. It can further be saturated in two-terminal settings with boxcar-shaped transmission functions and reduces to its classical counterpart in linear response. Upon insertion of a numerical factor, our bound also extends to systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. As an application, we derive trade-off relations between the figures of merit of coherent thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators, which show that such devices can attain ideal efficiency only at vanishing mean power or diverging power fluctuations. To illustrate our results, we work out a model of a coherent conductor consisting of a chain of quantum dots.

Title: Genuine multi-entropy and holography
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka, Mitsuhiro Nishida
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} < \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.

Title: Large N vector models in the Hamiltonian framework
Authors: Diego Barberena
Abstract: We present a fluctuating $N$ formalism, based on second-quantization, to describe large $N$ vector models from field theory using Hamiltonian methods. We first present the method in the simpler setting of a quantum mechanical system with quartic interactions, and then apply these techniques to the $O(N)$ model in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. We recover various known results, such as the gap equation determining the ground state of the system, the presence of bound states at negative coupling and the leading order contribution to critical exponents, and provide an interpretation of the large $N$ path integral saddle point as a Bose-Einstein condensate of extended objects in the presence of a non-local interaction. In the large $N$ limit, this formalism leads naturally to a description of elementary $O(N)$ symmetric excitations in terms of bilocal fields, which are at the basis of $\text{AdS}_4/\text{CFT}_3$ studies of the $O(N)$ model and Vasiliev gravity.

Title: Fermionic CFTs from topological boundaries in abelian Chern-Simons theories
Authors: Kohki Kawabata, Tatsuma Nishioka, Takuya Okuda, Shinichiro Yahagi
Abstract: A quantum field theory is referred to as bosonic (non-spin) if its physical quantities are independent of the spacetime spin structure, and as fermionic (spin) if they depend on it. We explore fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) that emerge from bosonic abelian Chern-Simons theories, playing the role of a symmetry topological field theory, by imposing topological boundary conditions. Our construction includes the fermionic generalization of code CFTs. When the Chern-Simons theory is associated with the root lattice of a simply laced Lie algebra, this approach yields a fermionic CFT with a level-one affine Lie algebra symmetry. As an application, we consider the Chern-Simons theories corresponding to a class of supersymmetric vertex operator algebras studied by Johnson-Freyd and classify their fermionic topological boundary conditions that give rise to supersymmetric CFTs.

Title: The quantum Mpemba effects
Authors: Filiberto Ares, Pasquale Calabrese, Sara Murciano
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a hotter system can equilibrate faster than a cooler one, has long been a subject of fascination in classical physics. In the past few years, significant theoretical and experimental progress has been made in understanding its occurrence in both classical and quantum systems. In this review, we provide a concise overview of the Mpemba effect in quantum systems, with a focus on both open and isolated dynamics which give rise to distinct manifestations of this anomalous non-equilibrium phenomenon. We discuss key theoretical frameworks, highlight experimental observations, and explore the fundamental mechanisms that give rise to anomalous relaxation behaviors. Particular attention is given to the role of quantum fluctuations, integrability, and symmetry in shaping equilibration pathways. Finally, we outline open questions and future directions.

Title: Feshbach spectroscopy of ultracold mixtures of $^{6}{\rm Li}$ and $^{164}{\rm Dy}$ atoms
Authors: Ke Xie, Xi Li, Yu-Yang Zhou, Ji-Hong Luo, Shuai Wang, Yu-Zhao Nie, Hong-Chi Shen, Yu-Ao Chen, Xing-Can Yao, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: We report on the observation of Feshbach resonances in ultracold $^6\mathrm{Li}$-$^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ mixtures, where $^6\mathrm{Li}$ atoms are respectively prepared in their three lowest spin states, and $^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms are prepared in their lowest energy state. We observe 21 interspecies scattering resonances over a magnetic field range from 0 to \SI{702}{\gauss} using atom loss spectroscopy, three of which exhibit relatively broad widths. These broad resonances provide precise control over the interspecies interaction strength, enabling the study of strongly interacting effects in $^6\mathrm{Li}$-$^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ mixtures. Additionally, we observe a well-isolated interspecies resonance at 700.1 G, offering a unique platform to explore novel impurity physics, where heavy dipolar $^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms are immersed in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid of $^6\mathrm{Li}$ atoms.

Title: Homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases in a flat-top optical lattice
Authors: Yu-Xuan Wang, Hou-Ji Shao, Yan-Song Zhu, De-Zhi Zhu, Hao-Nan Sun, Si-Yuan Chen, Xing-Can Yao, Yu-Ao Chen, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: Fermionic atoms in a large-scale, homogeneous optical lattice provide an ideal quantum simulator for investigating the fermionic Hubbard model, yet achieving this remains challenging. Here, by developing a hybrid potential that integrates a flat-top optical lattice with an optical box trap, we successfully realize the creation of three-dimensional, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases across approximately $8\times10^5$ lattice sites. This homogeneous system enables us to capture a well-defined energy band occupation that aligns perfectly with the theoretical calculations for a zero-temperature, ideal fermionic Hubbard model. Furthermore, by employing novel radio-frequency spectroscopy, we precisely measure the doublon fraction $D$ as a function of interaction strength $U$ and temperature $T$, respectively. The crossover from metal to Mott insulator is detected, where $D$ smoothly decreases with increasing $U$. More importantly, we observe a non-monotonic temperature dependence in $D$, revealing the Pomeranchuk effect and the development of extended antiferromagnetic correlations.

Title: Probing the many-body localized spin-glass phase through quench dynamics
Authors: Pietro Brighi, Marko Ljubotina, Maksym Serbyn
Abstract: Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.

Title: Simulating Hawking radiation in quantum many-body systems: deviations from the thermal spectrum
Authors: Gokhan Alkac, Ege Özgün
Abstract: We investigate a recently proposed one-to-one correspondence between quantum field theories in two-dimensional curved spacetime and quantum many-body systems, which enables the simulation of Hawking radiation in static background spacetimes. In particular, we demonstrate that deviations from the thermal spectrum, as predicted by the well-known tunneling method, can be observed in many-body simulations.

Title: Quantum Gravity Without Metric Quantization: From Hidden Variables to Hidden Spacetime Curvatures
Authors: Mohamed Hatifi
Abstract: Bohmian mechanics offers a deterministic alternative to conventional quantum theory through well-defined particle trajectories. While successful in nonrelativistic contexts, its extension to curved spacetime-and hence quantum gravity-remains unresolved. Here, we develop a covariant extension of Bohmian mechanics in curved spacetime that removes the need for metric quantization. From a Lagrangian formulation, we derive a generalized guidance equation in which Bohmian trajectories generate hidden curvature, replacing metric superposition with a statistical ensemble constrained by Heisenberg uncertainty, offering a novel perspective on quantum gravity. Consequently, in our approach, measuring the gravitational potential at a point unveils a pre-existing trajectory and its associated curvature-a departure from the observer-centric paradigm of standard quantum mechanics-providing an alternative in which gravitational effects emerge from deterministic quantum trajectories rather than wavefunction collapse. Numerical simulations in Robertson-Walker and cigar soliton spacetimes reveal that while quantum interference is curvature-sensitive, Zitterbewegung remains invariant, distinguishing fundamental quantum effects. Moreover, deviations from the Born rule in inhomogeneous spacetimes are observed and suggest gravity-induced quantum non-equilibrium. This new approach has far-reaching implications for the role of determinism and potential observational signatures of quantum non-equilibrium in cosmology.

Title: Solutions of the Dirac equation in one-dimensional variable width potential well
Authors: Qiuyu Shan
Abstract: The Fermi acceleration mechanism is a significant source of cosmic rays. When the width of a potential well changes over time, the velocity of particles within the well also changes. For quantum systems, such dynamics should be described by the Schrödinger, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equations. Previous studies have solved the Schrödinger and Klein-Gordon equations under these conditions, but no research has addressed the Dirac equation for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles like electrons. This paper investigates the solutions of the Dirac equation in a dynamically varying potential well.

Title: Collective attack free controlled quantum key agreement without quantum memory
Authors: Arindam Dutta, Anirban Pathak
Abstract: Here we present a new protocol for controlled quantum key agreement and another protocol for key agreement with a specific focus on the security analysis. Specifically, detailed security proof is provided against impersonated fraudulent attack and collective attacks and it is established that the proposed protocols are not only secure, but they also satisfy other desired properties of such schemes (i.e., fairness and correctness). Further, the proposed schemes are critically compared with a set of schemes for quantum key agreement and an existing scheme for controlled quantum key agreement (Tang et al.'s protocol) in terms of efficiency and the required quantum resources. Especially, it is observed that in contrast to the existing schemes, the present scheme does not require quantum memory. In addition, the protocol for controlled quantum key agreement proposed here is found to require quantum resources (Bell state and single photon state) that are easier to produce and maintain compared to the quantum resources (GHZ states) required by the only known existing protocol for the same purpose, i.e., Tang et al.'s protocol.

Title: Potential and limitations of random Fourier features for dequantizing quantum machine learning
Authors: Ryan Sweke, Erik Recio-Armengol, Sofiene Jerbi, Elies Gil-Fuster, Bryce Fuller, Jens Eisert, Johannes Jakob Meyer
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is arguably one of the most explored applications of near-term quantum devices. Much focus has been put on notions of variational quantum machine learning where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are used as learning models. These PQC models have a rich structure which suggests that they might be amenable to efficient dequantization via random Fourier features (RFF). In this work, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which RFF does indeed provide an efficient dequantization of variational quantum machine learning for regression. We build on these insights to make concrete suggestions for PQC architecture design, and to identify structures which are necessary for a regression problem to admit a potential quantum advantage via PQC based optimization.

Title: Online Learning Quantum States with the Logarithmic Loss via VB-FTRL
Authors: Wei-Fu Tseng, Kai-Chun Chen, Zi-Hong Xiao, Yen-Huan Li
Abstract: Online learning of quantum states with the logarithmic loss (LL-OLQS) is a quantum generalization of online portfolio selection (OPS), a classic open problem in online learning for over three decades. This problem also emerges in designing stochastic optimization algorithms for maximum-likelihood quantum state tomography. Recently, Jezequel et al. (arXiv:2209.13932) proposed the VB-FTRL algorithm, the first regret-optimal algorithm for OPS with moderate computational complexity. In this paper, we generalize VB-FTRL for LL-OLQS. Let $d$ denote the dimension and $T$ the number of rounds. The generalized algorithm achieves a regret rate of $O ( d^2 \log ( d + T ) )$ for LL-OLQS. Each iteration of the algorithm consists of solving a semidefinite program that can be implemented in polynomial time by, for example, cutting-plane methods. For comparison, the best-known regret rate for LL-OLQS is currently $O ( d^2 \log T )$, achieved by an exponential weight method. However, no explicit implementation is available for the exponential weight method for LL-OLQS. To facilitate the generalization, we introduce the notion of VB-convexity. VB-convexity is a sufficient condition for the volumetric barrier associated with any function to be convex and is of independent interest.

Title: Cross-platform certification of the qubit space with a minimal number of parameters
Authors: Tomasz Rybotycki, Tomasz Białecki, Josep Batle, Jakub Tworzydło, Adam Bednorz
Abstract: We demonstrate a determinant dimension witness of a qubit space. Our test has a minimal number of independent parameters. We achieve it by mapping the Bloch sphere $\pi/2$-rotation axis angle on the non-planar so-called Viviani curve. We ran our test on different platforms: IBM Quantum, IQM Resonance, and IonQ. Our investigations show that while the majority of qubits are passing the test, some fail it by more than ten standard deviations. The nature of those deviations has no simple explanation, as the test is robust against common imperfections.

Title: Logical coherence in 2D compass codes
Authors: Balint Pato, J. Wilson Staples, Kenneth R. Brown
Abstract: 2D compass codes are a family of quantum error-correcting codes that contain the Bacon-Shor codes, the $X$-Shor and $Z$-Shor codes, and the rotated surface codes. Previous numerical results suggest that the surface code has a constant accuracy and coherence threshold under uniform coherent rotation. However, having analytical proof supporting a constant threshold is still an open problem. It is analytically proven that the toric code can exponentially suppress logical coherence in the code distance $L$. However, the current analytical lower bound on the threshold for the rotation angle $\theta$ is $|\sin(\theta)| < 1/L$, which linearly vanishes in $L$ instead of being constant. We show that this lower bound is achievable by the $Z$-Shor code which does not have a threshold under stochastic noise. Compass codes provide a promising direction to improve on the previous bounds. We analytically determine thresholds for two new compass code families that provide upper and lower bounds to the rotated surface code's numerically established infidelity threshold. Furthermore, using a Majorana mode-based simulator, we use random families of compass codes to smoothly interpolate between the $Z$-Shor codes and the $X$-Shor codes.

Title: Entanglement dynamics in intensity-dependent double Jaynes-Cummings model for squeezed coherent thermal states
Authors: Koushik Mandal
Abstract: In this paper, the entanglement dynamics of different subsystems such as atom-atom, atom-field and field-field with radiation field in squeezed coherent thermal states for the intensity-dependent double Jaynes-Cummings model (IDDJCM) and double Jaynes-Cummings model (DJCM) are investigated. The effects of squeezed and thermal photons on entanglement are examined, revealing their complementary roles in shaping the entanglement behavior in both models. One of the main features of the double Jaynes-Cummings model is the observation of entanglement sudden death for every subsystem. The effects of various interactions such as Ising interaction, single photon exchange interaction and dipole-dipole interaction on entanglement dynamics are studied. The effects of detuning, Kerr-nonlinearity on the entanglement dynamics are investigated for every subsystem. It is noticed that proper choice of the interactions parameters, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity effectively removes entanglement deaths from the dynamics.

Title: Operational Framework for a Quantum Database
Authors: Carla Rieger, Michele Grossi, Gian Giacomo Guerreschi, Sofia Vallecorsa, Martin Werner
Abstract: Databases are an essential component of modern computing infrastructures and allow efficient manipulation of inherently structured data. The structure depends on the type and relationships of the individual data elements and on the access pattern. Extending the concept of databases to the quantum domain is expected to increase both the storage efficiency and the access parallelism through quantum superposition. In addition, quantum databases may be seen as the result of a prior state preparation ready to be used by quantum algorithms when needed. On the other hand, limiting factors exist and include entanglement creation, the impossibility of perfect copying due to the no-cloning theorem, and the impossibility of coherently erasing a quantum state. In this work, we introduce quantum databases within the broader context of data structures using classical, or more precisely cloneable, and quantum data and indexing. In particular, we are interested in quantum databases' practical implementation and usability, focusing on the definition of the basic operations needed to create and manipulate data stored in a superposition state. Specifically, we address the case of quantum indexing in combination with cloneable data. For this scenario, we define the operations for database preparation, extension, removal of indices, writing, and read-out of data, as well as index permutation. We present their algorithmic implementation and highlight their advantages and limitations. Finally, we introduce the next steps toward defining the same operations in the more general context of quantum indexing and quantum data.

Title: Simultaneous quantum identity authentication scheme utilizing entanglement swapping with secret key preservation
Authors: Arindam Dutta, Anirban Pathak
Abstract: Unconditional security in quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on authenticating the identities of users involved in key distribution. While classical identity authentication schemes were initially utilized in QKD implementations, concerns regarding their vulnerability have prompted the exploration of quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols. In this study, we introduce a new protocol for QIA, derived from the concept of controlled secure direct quantum communication. Our proposed scheme facilitates simultaneous authentication between two users, Alice and Bob, leveraging Bell states with the assistance of a third party, Charlie. Through rigorous security analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed protocol withstands various known attacks, including impersonation, intercept and resend and impersonated fraudulent attacks. Additionally, we establish the relevance of the proposed protocol by comparing it with the existing protocols of similar type.

Title: Machine learning with sub-diffraction resolution in the photon-counting regime
Authors: Giuseppe Buonaiuto, Cosmo Lupo
Abstract: The resolution of optical imaging is classically limited by the width of the point-spread function, which in turn is determined by the Rayleigh length. Recently, spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) has been proposed as a method to achieve sub-Rayleigh estimation and discrimination of natural, incoherent sources. Here we show that SPADE yields sub-diffraction resolution in the broader context of image classification. To achieve this goal, we outline a hybrid machine learning algorithm for image classification that includes a physical part and a computational part. The physical part implements a physical pre-processing of the optical field that cannot be simulated without essentially reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. In detail, a spatial-mode demultiplexer is used to sort the transverse field, followed by mode-wise photon detection. In the computational part, the collected data are fed into an artificial neural network for training and classification. As a case study, we classify images from the MNIST dataset after severe blurring due to diffraction. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the ability to classify highly blurred images that would be otherwise indistinguishable by direct imaging without the physical pre-processing of the optical field.

Title: Experimental benchmarking of quantum state overlap estimation strategies with photonic systems
Authors: Hao Zhan, Ben Wang, Minghao Mi, Jie Xie, Liang Xu, Aonan Zhang, Lijian Zhang
Abstract: Accurately estimating the overlap between quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. While various strategies using distinct quantum measurements have been proposed for overlap estimation, the lack of experimental benchmarks on estimation precision limits strategy selection in different situations. Here we compare the performance of four practical strategies for overlap estimation, including tomography-tomography, tomography-projection, Schur collective measurement and optical swap test using photonic quantum systems. We encode the quantum states on the polarization and path degrees of freedom of single photons. The corresponding measurements are performed by photon detection on certain modes following single-photon mode transformation or two-photon interference. We further propose an adaptive strategy with optimized precision in full-range overlap estimation. Our results shed new light on extracting the parameter of interest from quantum systems, prompting the design of efficient quantum protocols.

Title: Generalized Zeno effect and entanglement dynamics induced by fermion counting
Authors: Elias Starchl, Mark H. Fischer, Lukas M. Sieberer
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional lattice system of free fermions subjected to a generalized measurement process: the system exchanges particles with its environment, but each fermion leaving or entering the system is counted. In contrast to the freezing of dynamics due to frequent measurements of lattice site occupation numbers, a high rate of fermion counts induces fast fluctuations in the state of the system. Still, through numerical simulations of quantum trajectories and an analytical approach based on replica Keldysh field theory, we find that instantaneous correlations and entanglement properties of free fermions subjected to fermion counting and local occupation measurements are strikingly similar. We explain this similarity through a generalized Zeno effect induced by fermion counting and a universal long-wavelength description in terms of a nonlinear sigma model. The physical requirements underlying this universal emergent behavior are conservation of the total number of particles in the system and its environment, and conservation of the purity of the state of the system by keeping a full record of all measurement outcomes. For both types of measurement processes, we present strong evidence against the existence of a critical phase with logarithmic entanglement and conformal invariance. Instead, we identify a finite critical range of length scales on which signatures of conformal invariance are observable. While area-law entanglement is established beyond a scale that is exponentially large in the measurement rate, the upper boundary of the critical range is only algebraically large and thus numerically accessible. Our finding that these properties do not rely on particle number conservation has far reaching implications for measurement-induced phenomena beyond noninteracting fermions, such as charge sharpening in random quantum circuits or generic interacting systems.

Title: Perfect chiral quantum routing
Authors: Simone Cavazzoni, Giovanni Ragazzi, Paolo Bordone, Matteo G. A. Paris
Abstract: Routing classical and quantum information is a fundamental task for quantum information technologies and processes. Here, we consider information encoded in the position of a quantum walker on a graph, and design an optimal structure to achieve perfect quantum routing exploiting chirality and weighting of the edges. The topology, termed the Lily Graph, enables perfect (i.e., with fidelity one) and robust routing of classical (localized) or quantum (superposition) states of the walker to n different, orthogonal, spatial regions of the graph, corresponding to the n possible outputs of the device. The routing time is independent of the input signal and the number of outputs, making our scheme a robust and scalable solution for all quantum networks.

Title: Perturbative stability and error correction thresholds of quantum codes
Authors: Yaodong Li, Nicholas O'Dea, Vedika Khemani
Abstract: Topologically-ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general CSS codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the LDPC condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence to stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and time-like defects in the lattice gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of space-like defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of time-like defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.

Title: Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization
Authors: Ling-Zhi Tang, Dan-Wei Zhang, Hai-Feng Yu, Z. D. Wang
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase regimes with the MBDL and delocalized states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase regimes. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL phase, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.

Title: Designing generalized elegant Bell inequalities in high dimension from a quantum bound
Authors: Kwangil Bae, Junghee Ryu, Ilkwon Sohn, Wonhyuk Lee
Abstract: Elegant Bell inequality is well known for its distinctive property, being maximally violated by maximal entanglement, mutually unbiased bases, and symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure elements. Despite its significance in quantum information theory demonstrated based on its unique violation feature, it remains the only known one with the characteristic. We present a method to construct Bell inequalities with violation feature analogous to elegant Bell inequality in higher local dimension from a simple analytic quantum bound. A Bell inequality with the generalized violation feature is derived in three dimension for the first time. It exhibits larger violation than existing Bell inequalities of similar classes, including the original elegant Bell inequality, while requiring arguably small number of measurements.

Title: State Initialization by Gate Operation in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Sirui Chen, Dragomir Davidović
Abstract: A simple yet accurate method is introduced for calculating the initial conditions in open quantum systems with fast gates. This involves letting the system equilibriate with the environment for an extended time, then operating with the gate. We utilize the Bloch-Redfield (BR) master equation, adapted for periodic time-dependent Hamiltonians and fast Fourier transform algorithm, in place of the less efficient Floquet basis. This enables a unified approach that encompasses very long time scales for establishing environmental correlation and very short time-scales for fast gate operation, while maintaining quadratic precision of the coherences in terms of the weak-coupling constant. We examined the characteristics of qubits after this state preparation. We show that the initial qubit state post-gate is typically a hybrid: the population dynamics display Markovian behavior without reaction delays, while the coherence dynamics is exposed to significant vacuum fluctuations. We also find that the gate fidelity displays a continuous spin-echo characteristics as a function of the rotation angle of the qubit.

Title: Genuine multipartite entanglement from many-electron systems
Authors: Filippo Troiani, Celestino Angeli, Andrea Secchi, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: We demonstrate that, contrary to common wisdom, genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) can be abundantly generated from simple non-correlated many-electron states. We show that the extracted GME can be maximized via spin-independent transformations derived from the quantum Fourier transform. We further demonstrate the possibility of maximizing the GME through localized orbitals in a variety of realistic systems and correlated states. Towards the exploitation of potentially useful entanglement, we rationalize system-specific and universal features of the extracted GME.

Title: Characterizing entangled state update in different reference frames with weak measurements
Authors: Jawad Allam, Alex Matzkin
Abstract: The evolution of the quantum state of a system upon measurement results in state update. In this work, we investigate the characterization of updated states of multi-partite entangled qubit states with non-destructive weak measurements, involving weakly coupling a pointer to each qubit in a relativistic context. As is well-known, the updated state at intermediate times is frame-dependent, and outcome randomness intrinsic to projective measurements prevents any information to be acquired on the updated state. Here we will see that when weak measurements are implemented there is instead an interplay between randomness and interference, depending on the number of qubits, so as to maintain consistency between descriptions in arbitrary reference frames. Analytical results are given for a small or infinite number of qubits, while for a finite number of qubits we will resort to Monte-Carlo sampling in order to simulate numerically the results of weak measurements. As a by-product, we show how a single-shot measurement of the pointers positions allows to make quantitative predictions on the outcomes that can be obtained for any observable measured on a distant qubit of the multi-partite state.

Title: Current Trends in Global Quantum Metrology
Authors: Chiranjib Mukhopadhyay, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: Quantum sensors are now universally acknowledged as one of the most promising near-term quantum technologies. The traditional formulation of quantum sensing introduces a concrete bound on ultimate precision through the so-called local sensing framework, in which a significant knowledge of prior information about the unknown parameter value is implicitly assumed. Moreover, the framework provides a systematic approach for optimizing the sensing protocol. In contrast, the paradigm of global sensing aims to find a precision bound for parameter estimation in the absence of such prior information. In recent years, vigorous research has been pursued to describe the contours of global quantum estimation. Here, we review some of these emerging developments. These developments are both in the realm of finding ultimate precision bounds with respect to appropriate figures of merit in the global sensing paradigm, as well as in the search for algorithms that achieve these bounds. We categorize these developments into two largely mutually exclusive camps; one employing Bayesian updating and the other seeking to generalize the frequentist picture of local sensing towards the global paradigm. In the first approach, in order to achieve the best performance, one has to optimize the measurement settings adaptively. In the second approach, the measurement setting is fixed, however the challenge is to identify this fixed measurement optimally.

Title: First-principle theory of the Casimir screening effect
Authors: Yu.A. Budkov, P.E. Brandyshev
Abstract: In this paper, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that, in the Gaussian approximation, the ionic fluctuations contribute separately from the electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", has been previously applied on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to the approach based on Lifshitz theory used by other researchers.

Title: Entanglement teleportation along a regenerating hamster-wheel graph state
Authors: Haiyue Kang, John F. Kam, Gary J. Mooney, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg
Abstract: We scheme an efficient and reusable approach to quantum teleportation that allows cyclic teleportation of a two-qubit graph state around a quantum hamster wheel -- a ring of qubits entangled as a one-dimensional line prepared on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processor. The qubits on the ring are periodically measured and reused to achieve a teleportation depth that exceeds the total number of available qubits in the quantum processor. Using the outcomes measured during teleportation, we calculate and apply byproduct operators through dynamic circuits to correct local transformations induced on the teleported state. We evaluate the quality of teleportation by tracing the preserved entanglement and fidelity of the teleported two-qubit graph state from its density matrix. In the real-machine experiments, we demonstrate that 58% of the teleported state's entanglement is sustained with a measured two-qubit negativity of $0.291\pm0.018$ after three complete revolutions around the hamster wheel, or equivalently, after hopping across 56 qubits. On the machine-specific noisy emulator, we found that the teleported state after 100 hops still sustained 45% of its entanglement. By performing teleportation along a regenerating graph state, our work is a step forward in demonstrating the feasibility of measurement-based quantum computation.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Enhancing Entanglement for Two-Photon-Driven Rabi Model
Authors: Tingting Li, Yiming Zhao, Yong Wang, Yanping Liu, Yazhuang Miao, Xiaolong Zhao
Abstract: A control scheme is proposed that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance entanglement by modulating the two-photon-driven amplitude in a Rabi model. The quantum phase diagram versus the amplitude of the two-photon process and the coupling between the cavity field and the atom in the Rabi model, is indicated by the energy spectrum of the hybrid system, the witness of entanglement, second order correlation, and negativity of Wigner function. From a dynamical perspective, the behavior of entanglement can reflect the phase transition and the reinforcement learning agent is employed to produce temporal sequences of control pulses to enhance the entanglement in the presence of dissipation. The entanglement can be enhanced in different parameter regimes and the control scheme exhibits robustness against dissipation. The replaceability of the controlled system and the reinforcement learning module demonstrates the generalization of this scheme. This research paves the way of positively enhancing quantum resources in non-equilibrium systems.

Title: Optimal control of a Bose-Eintein Condensate in an optical lattice: The non-linear and two-dimensional cases
Authors: E. Dionis, B. Peaudecerf, S. Guérin, D. Guéry-Odelin, D. Sugny
Abstract: We numerically study the optimal control of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice. We present two generalizations of the gradient-based algorithm, GRAPE, in the non-linear case and for a two-dimensional lattice. We show how to construct such algorithms from Pontryagin's maximum principle. A wide variety of target states can be achieved with high precision by varying only the laser phases setting the lattice position. We discuss the physical relevance of the different results and the future directions of this work.

Title: Partial-immunity of two-photon correlation against wavefront distortion for spatially entangled photons
Authors: Kiran Bajar, Rounak Chatterjee, Vikas S. Bhat, Sushil Mujumdar
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement in photons offers notable technological advancements over traditional qubit-based systems, including increased information density and enhanced security. However, such high-dimensional states are vulnerable to disruption by complex disordered media, presenting significant challenges in practical applications. Spatially-entangled photons are conventionally generated using a nonlinear crystal via spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). While the effect of disorder on spatially entangled photons in the near field of the crystal is well understood, the impact of disorder in the far field is more complex. In this work, we present a systematic study of the randomization of two-photon correlations caused by arbitrary phase distortions in the far field by breaking it down into odd and even parity components. First, we theoretically show that the two-photon field is only sensitive to the even-parity part of the phase distortion. In follow-up experiments, we employ a deformable mirror to implement random phase distortions, separating the contributions of odd and even parity phases using Zernike polynomials. The experimental results are in agreements with the theoretical predictions. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to show that these results extend to stronger degrees of disorder. Our key finding is that, since two-photon correlations are only affected by the even-parity component of phase modulations, the number of independent adaptive optics elements required for optimizing the correlation can be effectively halved, offering a significant practical advantage in managing disorder in quantum systems.

Title: Efficient Protein Ground State Energy Computation via Fragmentation and Reassembly
Authors: Laia Coronas Sala (1), Parfait Atchade-Adelemou (1 and 2) ((1) Lighthouse Disruptive Innovation Group S.L., (2) MIT Media Lab)
Abstract: Protein characterization is one of the key components for understanding the human body and advancing drug discovery processes. While the future of quantum hardware holds the potential to accurately characterize these molecules, current efforts focus on developing strategies to fragment larger molecules into computationally manageable subsystems. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to enable quantum simulation using existing quantum algorithms. Our approach involves fragmenting proteins into their corresponding amino acids, simulating them independently, and then reassembling them post-simulation while applying chemical corrections. This methodology demonstrates its accuracy by calculating the ground state energy of relatively small peptides through reassembling, achieving a mean relative error of only $0.00768 \pm 0.01681\%$. Future directions include investigating, with larger quantum computers, whether this approach remains valid for larger proteins.

Title: Positivity and Entanglement in Markovian Open Quantum Systems and Hybrid Classical-Quantum Theories of Gravity
Authors: Oliviero Angeli, Matteo Carlesso
Abstract: Markovian master equations underlie many areas of modern physics and, despite their apparent simplicity, they encode a rich and complex dynamics which is still under active research. We identify a class of continuous variable Markovian master equations for which positivity and complete positivity become equivalent. We apply this result to characterize the positivity of the partially transposed evolution of bipartite Gaussian systems, which encodes the dynamics of entanglement. Finally, the entangling properties of models of classical gravity interacting with quantum matter are investigated in the context of the experimental proposals to detect gravitationally induced entanglement. We prove that entanglement generation can indeed take place within these models. We prove that entanglement generation can indeed take place within these models. In particular, by focusing on the Diósi-Penrose model for two gravitationally interacting masses, we show that entanglement-based experiments have the potential to either falsify the model entirely or constrain the free parameter of the model $R_0$ up to values six orders of magnitude above the current state of the art.

Title: Quantum Advantage in Trading: A Game-Theoretic Approach
Authors: Faisal Shah Khan, Norbert M. Linke, Anton Trong Than, Dror Baron
Abstract: Quantum games, like quantum algorithms, exploit quantum entanglement to establish strong correlations between strategic player actions. This paper introduces quantum game-theoretic models applied to trading and demonstrates their implementation on an ion-trap quantum computer. The results showcase a quantum advantage, previously known only theoretically, realized as higher-paying market Nash equilibria. This advantage could help uncover alpha in trading strategies, defined as excess returns compared to established benchmarks. These findings suggest that quantum computing could significantly influence the development of financial strategies.

Title: Time evolution of nodes in quantum superposition states
Authors: Tarek Yehia
Abstract: The nodes are traditionally viewed as fixed points where the probability density vanishes. However, this work demonstrates that these nodes exhibit time-dependent oscillation in quantum superposition states. We derive this effect for a fundamental system: the 1D particle in a box. It is shown that the probability density in a superposition of two eigenstates evolves with a time-dependent interference term, introducing an oscillation of the nodes at a specific frequency equal to the energy difference between the states. This result suggests a deeper dynamical role for nodes in quantum systems.

Title: Performance of quantum annealing for 2-SAT problems with multiple satisfying assignments
Authors: Vrinda Mehta, Hans De Raedt, Kristel Michielsen, Fengping Jin
Abstract: Using a specially constructed set of hard 2-SAT problems with four satisfying assignments, we study the scaling and sampling performance of numerical simulation of quantum annealing as well as that of the physical quantum annealers offered by D-Wave. To this end, we use both the standard quantum annealing and reverse annealing protocols in both our simulations and on the D-Wave quantum annealer. In the case of ideal quantum annealing the sampling behavior can be explained by perturbation theory and the scaling behavior of the time to solution depends on the scaling behavior of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of the annealing Hamiltonian. The corresponding results from the D-Wave quantum annealers do not fit to this ideal picture, but suggest that the scaling of the time to solution from the quantum annealers matches those calculated from the equilibrium probability distribution.

Title: Transient dynamical phase diagram of the spin-boson model
Authors: Olga Goulko, Hsing-Ta Chen, Moshe Goldstein, Guy Cohen
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model across a broad range of coupling strengths, using the numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. From short- and intermediate-time dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the associated values of the critical exponent. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.

Title: Spin-Valley Protected Kramers Pair in Bilayer Graphene

Abstract: The intrinsic valley degree of freedom makes bilayer graphene (BLG) a unique platform for semiconductor qubits. The single-carrier quantum dot (QD) ground state exhibits a two-fold degeneracy, where the two states that constitute a Kramers pair, have opposite spin and valley quantum numbers. Because of the valley-dependent Berry curvature, an out-of-plane magnetic field breaks the time-reversal symmetry of this ground state and a qubit can be encoded in the spin-valley subspace. The Kramers states are protected against known spin- and valley-mixing mechanisms because mixing requires a simultaneous change of both quantum numbers. Here, we fabricate a tunable QD device in Bernal BLG and measure a spin-valley relaxation time for the Kramers states of ${38~\mathrm{s}}$, which is two orders of magnitude longer than the ${0.4~\mathrm{s}}$ measured for purely spin-blocked states. We also show that the intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit splitting enables a Kramers doublet single-shot readout even at zero magnetic field with a fidelity above ${99\%}$. If these long-lived Kramers states also possess long coherence times and can be effectively manipulated, electrostatically defined QDs in BLG may serve as long-lived semiconductor qubits, extending beyond the spin qubit paradigm.

Title: Extracting work from coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: L. A. Williamson, F. Cerisola, J. Anders, Matthew J. Davis
Abstract: We show how work can be extracted from number-state coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate. With careful tuning of parameters, a sequence of thermodynamically reversible steps transforms a Glauber coherent state into a thermal state with the same energy probability distribution. The work extracted during this process arises entirely from the removal of quantum coherence. More generally, we characterise quantum (from coherence) and classical (remaining) contributions to work output, and find that in this system the quantum contribution can be dominant over a broad range of parameters. The proportion of quantum work output can be further enhanced by squeezing the initial state. Due to the many-body nature of the system, the work from coherence can equivalently be understood as work from entanglement.

Title: Generalized Josephson effect with arbitrary periodicity in quantum magnets
Authors: Anshuman Tripathi, Felix Gerken, Peter Schmitteckert, Michael Thorwart, Mircea Trif, Thore Posske
Abstract: Easy-plane quantum magnets are strikingly similar to superconductors, allowing for spin supercurrent and an effective superconducting phase stemming from their $U(1)$ rotation symmetry around the $z$-axis. We uncover a generalized fractional Josephson effect with a periodicity that increases linearly with system size in one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ chains at selected anisotropies and phase-fixing boundary fields. The effect combines arbitrary integer periodicities in a single system, exceeding the $4\pi $ and $8\pi $ periodicity of superconducting Josephson effects of Majorana zero modes and other exotic quasiparticles. We reveal a universal energy-phase relation and connect the effect to the recently discovered phantom helices.

Title: Turing Video-based Cognitive Tests to Handle Entangled Concepts
Authors: Diederik Aerts, Roberto Leporini, Sandro Sozzo
Abstract: We have proved in both human-based and computer-based tests that natural concepts generally 'entangle' when they combine to form complex sentences, violating the rules of classical compositional semantics. In this article, we present the results of an innovative video-based cognitive test on a specific conceptual combination, which significantly violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt version of Bell's inequalities ('CHSH inequality'). We also show that collected data can be faithfully modeled within a quantum-theoretic framework elaborated by ourselves and a 'strong form of entanglement' occurs between the component concepts. While the video-based test confirms previous empirical results on entanglement in human cognition, our empirical approach surpasses language barriers and eliminates the need for prior knowledge, enabling universal accessibility. Finally, this transformative methodology allows one to unravel the underlying connections that drive our perception of reality. As a matter of fact, we provide a novel explanation for the appearance of entanglement in both physics and cognitive realms.

Title: Experimental online quantum dots charge autotuning using neural networks

Abstract: Spin-based semiconductor qubits hold promise for scalable quantum computing, yet they require reliable autonomous calibration procedures. This study presents an experimental demonstration of online single-dot charge autotuning using a convolutional neural network integrated into a closed-loop calibration system. The autotuning algorithm explores the gates' voltage space to localize charge transition lines, thereby isolating the one-electron regime without human intervention. This exploration leverages the model's uncertainty estimation to find the appropriate gate configuration with minimal measurements while reducing the risk of failures. In 20 experimental runs, our method achieved a success rate of 95% in locating the target electron regime, highlighting the robustness of this approach against noise and distribution shifts from the offline training set. Each tuning run lasted an average of 2 hours and 9 minutes, primarily due to the limited speed of the current measurement. This work validates the feasibility of machine learning-driven real-time charge autotuning for quantum dot devices, advancing the development toward the control of large qubit arrays.

Title: Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in an ideal Bose gas at thermal equilibrium
Authors: Alexej Schelle
Abstract: The theory of ideal gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain certain new fundamental symmetry aspects of ideal and very weakly interacting Bose gases, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.

Title: Force-current structure in Markovian open quantum systems and its applications: geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition and thermodynamic trade-off relations
Authors: Kohei Yoshimura, Yoh Maekawa, Ryuna Nagayama, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: Thermodynamic force and irreversible current are the foundational concepts of classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Entropy production rate is provided by their product in classical systems, ranging from mesoscopic to macroscopic systems. However, there is no complete quantum extension of such a structure that respects quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose anti-Hermitian operators that represent currents and forces accompanied by a gradient structure in open quantum systems described by the quantum master equation. We prove that the entropy production rate is given by the product of the force and current operators, which extends the canonical expression of the entropy production rate in the classical systems. The framework constitutes a comprehensive analogy with the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of discrete classical systems. We also show that the structure leads to the extensions of some results in stochastic thermodynamics: the geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition of entropy production and thermodynamic trade-off relations such as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the dissipation-time uncertainty relation. In discussing the trade-off relations, we will introduce a measure of fluctuation, which we term the quantum diffusivity.

Title: Soft Reverse Reconciliation for Discrete Modulations
Authors: Marco Origlia, Marco Secondini
Abstract: The performance of the information reconciliation phase is crucial for quantum key distribution (QKD). Reverse reconciliation (RR) is typically preferred over direct reconciliation (DR) because it yields higher secure key rates. However, a significant challenge in continuous-variable (CV) QKD with discrete modulations (such as QAM) is that Alice lacks soft information about the symbol decisions made by Bob. This limitation restricts error correction to hard-decoding methods, with low reconciliation efficiency. This work introduces a reverse reconciliation softening (RRS) procedure designed for CV-QKD scenarios employing discrete modulations. This procedure generates a soft metric that Bob can share with Alice over a public channel, enabling her to perform soft-decoding error correction without disclosing any information to a potential eavesdropper. After detailing the RRS procedure, we investigate how the mutual information between Alice's and Bob's variables changes when the additional metric is shared. We show numerically that RRS improves the mutual information with respect to RR with hard decoding, practically achieving the same mutual information as DR with soft decoding. Finally, we test the proposed RRS for PAM-4 signalling with a rate 1/2 binary LDPC code and bit-wise decoding through numerical simulations, obtaining more than 1dB SNR improvement compared to hard-decoding RR.

Title: Quantum Mechanics from General Relativity and the Quantum Friedmann Equation
Authors: Marco Matone, Nikolaos Dimakis
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recently introduced linear equation, reformulating the first Friedmann equation, is the first-order WKB expansion of a quantum cosmological equation. This result shows a deeper underlying connection between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, pointing towards a unified framework. Solutions of this equation are built in terms of a scale factor encapsulating quantum effects on a free-falling particle. The quantum scale factor reshapes cosmic dynamics, resolving singularities at its vanishing points. As an explicit example, we consider the radiation-dominated era and show that the quantum equation is dual to the one in Seiberg-Witten formulation, recently applied to black holes, and incorporates resurgence phenomena and complex metrics, as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten. This links to the invariance of time parametrization under $\Gamma(2)$ transformations of the dual wave function.

Title: Embedded structure in quantum theory, functional operator and multiverse
Authors: Yoshiharu Kawamura
Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as an inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.

Title: Quasiparticle Picture for Entanglement Hamiltonians in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Riccardo Travaglino, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: We employ the quasiparticle picture of entanglement evolution to obtain an effective description for the out-of-equilibrium Entanglement Hamiltonian at the hydrodynamical scale following quantum quenches in free fermionic systems in two or more spatial dimensions. Specifically, we begin by applying dimensional reduction techniques in cases where the geometry permits, building directly on established results from one-dimensional systems. Subsequently, we generalize the analysis to encompass a wider range of geometries. We obtain analytical expressions for the entanglement Hamiltonian valid at the ballistic scale, which reproduce the known quasiparticle picture predictions for the Renyi entropies and full counting statistics. We also numerically validate the results with excellent precision by considering quantum quenches from several initial configurations.

Title: Semiclassical world is one of infinite many cloneworlds in common spacetime
Authors: Lajos Diósi
Abstract: We consider $N$ clones of the quantized world, interacting with each other via quantum gravity, coupled by the downscaled Newton constant $G/N$. In the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, we obtain the semiclassical Einstein equation for every single cloneworld. In the non-relativistic limit, De Filippo had already obtained the semiclassical Schrödinger-Newton equation, we present an alternative elementary proof. In the general relativistic case we complete the semi-finished derivation of Hartle and Horowitz. We compare our simple correlated cloneworlds with Stamp's more complicated proposal of correlated worldlines and show why they differ despite the conceptual similarity.
