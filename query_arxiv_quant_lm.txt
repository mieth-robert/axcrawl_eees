Title: Universal Growth of Krylov Complexity Across A Quantum Phase Transition
Authors: András Grabarits, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the spread complexity in the Krylov space of quantum systems driven across a quantum phase transition. Using the diabatic Magnus expansion, we map the evolution to an effective one-dimensional hopping model. For the transverse field Ising model, we establish an exact link between the growth of complexity and the Kibble-Zurek defect scaling: all cumulants of complexity exhibit the same power-law scaling as the defect density, with coefficients identical to the mean, and the full distribution asymptotically becomes Gaussian. These results yield general scaling arguments for the growth of complexity across arbitrary second-order quantum phase transitions.

Title: Quantum State Designs via Magic Teleportation
Authors: Hugo Lóio, Guglielmo Lami, Lorenzo Leone, Max McGinley, Xhek Turkeshi, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: We investigate how non-stabilizer resources enable the emergence of quantum state designs within the projected ensemble. Starting from initial states with finite magic and applying resource-free Clifford circuits to scramble them, we analyze the ensemble generated by performing projective Pauli measurements on a subsystem of the final state. Using both analytical arguments and large-scale numerics, we show that the projected ensemble converges towards a state $k$-design with an error that decays exponentially with the $k$-th Stabilizer Renyi Entropy of the pre-measurement state, via a Magic-Induced Design Ansatz (MIDA) that we introduce. We identify a universal scaling form, valid across different classes of magic initial states, and corroborate it through numerical simulations and analytical calculations of the frame potential. For finite-depth Clifford unitaries, we show that the timescales at which state designs emerge are controlled by the transport of magic. We identify a ``magic teleportation'' mechanism whereby non-Clifford resources injected locally spread through Clifford scrambling and measurements across distances beyond the lightcone. Our results demonstrate how a small and controlled amount of magic suffices to generate highly random states, providing a systematic route toward generating quantum state designs in early fault-tolerant devices.

Title: Temporal Entanglement Transitions in the Periodically Driven Ising Chain
Authors: Karun Gadge, Abhinav Prem, Rishabh Jha
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can host non-equilibrium phenomena without static analogs, including in their entanglement dynamics. Here, we discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ in a Floquet spin chain, which correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that these transitions are entanglement-driven, i.e., they require initially entangled states and remain invisible to conventional local observables. Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips. At high frequencies, the entanglement Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period, rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\nu=1$, matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes temporal entanglement transitions as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.

Title: Towards gravimetry enhancement with squeezed states
Authors: Oziel R. de Araujo, Lucas S. Marinho, Jonas F. G. Santos, Carlos H. S. Vieira
Abstract: We investigate the estimation sensitivity of gravitational acceleration using squeezed probe states within a quantum metrology framework. In particular, we analyze how the squeezing phase, beyond its amplitudes, of the probes affects the attainable precision. We find that probes squeezed along the canonical phase-space quadrature can fail to achieve a quantum Fisher information (QFI) surpassing the shot-noise limit, regardless of the interaction time with the gravitational field. In contrast, position-momentum correlated input states with the squeezing amplitude can overcome this limit. Furthermore, we show that optimal sensitivity is attained through projective momentum measurements combined with a time-dependent adjustment of the squeezing phase. Our results are important to highlight the fundamental role of phase-engineered squeezing in experimental gravimetry protocols.

Title: Sequential Quantum Measurements and the Instrumental Group Algebra
Authors: Christopher S. Jackson
Abstract: Many of the most fundamental observables | position, momentum, phase-point, and spin-direction | cannot be measured by an instrument that obeys the orthogonal projection postulate. Continuous-in-time measurements provide the missing theoretical framework to make sense of such observables. The elements of the time-dependent instrument define a group called the \emph{instrumental group} (IG). Relative to the IG, all of the time-dependence is contained in a certain function called the \emph{Kraus-operator density} (KOD), which evolves according to a classical Kolmogorov equation. Unlike the Lindblad master equation, the KOD Kolmogorov equation is a direct expression of how the elements of the instrument (not just the total channel) evolve. Shifting from continuous measurement to sequential measurements more generally, the structure of combining instruments in sequence is shown to correspond to the convolution of their KODs. This convolution promotes the IG to an \emph{involutive Banach algebra} (a structure that goes all the way back to the origins of POVM and C*-algebra theory) which will be called the \emph{instrumental group algebra} (IGA). The IGA is the true home of the KOD, similar to how the dual of a von Neumann algebra is the home of the density operator. Operators on the IGA, which play the same role for KODs as superoperators play for density operators, are called \emph{ultraoperators} and various examples are discussed. Certain ultraoperator-superoperator intertwining relations are considered, including the relation between the KOD Kolmogorov equation and the Lindblad master equation. The IGA is also shown to have actually two involutions: one respected by the convolution ultraoperators and the other by the quantum channel superoperators. Finally, the KOD Kolmogorov generators are derived for jump processes and more general diffusive processes.

Title: A Rigorous Quantum Framework for Inequality-Constrained and Multi-Objective Binary Optimization
Authors: Sebastian Egginger, Kristina Kirova, Sonja Bruckner, Stefan Hillmich, Richard Kueng
Abstract: Encoding combinatorial optimization problems into physically meaningful Hamiltonians with tractable energy landscapes forms the foundation of quantum optimization. Numerous works have studied such efficient encodings for the class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. However, many real-world tasks are constrained, and handling equality and, in particular, inequality constraints on quantum computers remains a major challenge. In this letter, we show that including inequality constraints is equivalent to solving a multi-objective optimization. This insight motivates the Multi-Objective Quantum Approximation (MOQA) framework, which approximates the maximum via smaller $p$-norms and comes with rigorous performance guarantees. MOQA operates directly at the Hamiltonian level and is compatible with, but not restricted to, ground-state solvers such as quantum adiabatic annealing, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), or imaginary-time evolution. Moreover, it is not limited to quadratic functions.

Title: A Rigorous Quantum Framework for Inequality-Constrained and Multi-Objective Binary Optimization: Quadratic Cost Functions and Empirical Evaluations
Authors: Sebastian Egginger, Kristina Kirova, Sonja Bruckner, Stefan Hillmich, Richard Kueng
Abstract: The prospect of quantum solutions for complicated optimization problems is contingent on mapping the original problem onto a tractable quantum energy landscape, e.g. an Ising-type Hamiltonian. Subsequently, techniques like adiabatic optimization, quantum annealing, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) can be used to find the ground state of this Hamiltonian. Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is one prominent problem class for which this entire pipeline is well understood and has received considerable attention over the past years. In this work, we provide novel, tractable mappings for the maxima of multiple QUBO problems. Termed Multi-Objective Quantum Approximations, or MOQA for short, our framework allows us to recast new types of classical binary optimization problems as ground state problems of a tractable Ising-type Hamiltonian. This, in turn, opens the possibility of new quantum- and quantum-inspired solutions to a variety of problems that frequently occur in practical applications. In particular, MOQA can handle various types of routing and partitioning problems, as well as inequality-constrained binary optimization problems.

Title: Continuous-variable photonic quantum extreme learning machines for fast collider-data selection
Authors: Benedikt Maier, Michael Spannowsky, Simon Williams
Abstract: We study continuous-variable photonic quantum extreme learning machines as fast, low-overhead front-ends for collider data processing. Data is encoded in photonic modes through quadrature displacements and propagated through a fixed-time Gaussian quantum substrate. The final readout occurs through Gaussian-compatible measurements to produce a high-dimensional random feature map. Only a linear classifier is trained, using a single linear solve, so retraining is fast, and the optical path and detector response set the analytical and inference latency. We evaluate this architecture on two representative classification tasks, top-jet tagging and Higgs-boson identification, with parameter-matched multi-layer perceptron (MLP) baselines. Using standard public datasets and identical train, validation, and test splits, the photonic Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) outperforms an MLP with two hidden units for all considered training sizes, and matches or exceeds an MLP with ten hidden units at large sample sizes, while training only the linear readout. These results indicate that Gaussian photonic extreme-learning machines can provide compact and expressive random features at fixed latency. The combination of deterministic timing, rapid retraining, low optical power, and room temperature operation makes photonic QELMs a credible building block for online data selection and even first-stage trigger integration at future collider experiments.

Title: Qutrits for physics at the LHC
Authors: Miranda Carou Laiño, Veronika Chobanova, Miriam Lucio Martínez
Abstract: The identification of anomalous events, not explained by the Standard Model of particle physics, and the possible discovery of exotic physical phenomena pose significant theoretical, experimental and computational challenges. The task will intensify at next-generation colliders, such as the High- Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Consequently, considerable challenges are expected concerning data processing, signal reconstruction, and analysis. This work explores the use of qutrit- based Quantum Machine Learning models for anomaly detection in high-energy physics data, with a focus on LHC applications. We propose the development of a qutrit quantum model and benchmark its performance against qubit-based approaches, assessing accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency. This study aims to establish whether qutrit architectures can offer an advantage in addressing the computational and analytical demands of future collider experiments.

Title: Decoding Correlated Errors in Quantum LDPC Codes
Authors: Arshpreet Singh Maan, Francisco-Garcia Herrero, Alexandru Paler, Valentin Savin
Abstract: We introduce a decoding framework for correlated errors in quantum LDPC codes under circuit-level noise. The core of our approach is a graph augmentation and rewiring for interference (GARI) method, which modifies the correlated detector error model by eliminating 4-cycles involving Y-type errors, while preserving the equivalence of the decoding problem. We test our approach on the bivariate bicycle codes of distances 6, 10, and 12. A normalized min-sum decoder with a hybrid serial-layered schedule is applied on the transformed graph, achieving high accuracy with low latency. Performance is further enhanced through ensemble decoding, where 24 randomized normalized min-sum decoders run in parallel on the transformed graph, yielding the highest reported accuracy (on par with XYZ-Relay-BP) with unprecedented speed for the tested codes under uniform depolarizing circuit level noise. For the distance 12 (gross) code, our approach yields a logical error rate of $(6.70 \pm 1.93) \times 10^{-9}$ at a practical physical error rate of $10^{-3}$. Furthermore, preliminary FPGA implementation results show that such high accuracy can be achieved in real time, with a per-round average decoding latency of 273 ns and sub-microsecond latency in 99.99% of the decoding instances.

Title: Quantum Search in Superposed Quantum Lattice Gas Automata and Lattice Boltzmann Systems
Authors: Călin A. Georgescu, Matthias Möller
Abstract: As the scope of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) grows to encompass ever larger problem scales, so does the interest in whether quantum computing can provide an advantage. In recent years, Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA) and Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Methods (QLBM) have emerged as promising candidates for quantum-native implementations of CFD solvers. Though the progress in developing QLGA and QLBM algorithms has been significant, it has largely focused on the development of models rather than applications. As a result, the zoo of QLGA and QLBM algorithms has grown to target several equations and to support many extensions, but the practical use of these models is largely limited to quantum state tomography and observable measurement. This limitation is crucial in practice, because unless very specific criteria are met, such measurements may cancel out any potential quantum advantage. In this paper, we propose an application based on discrete optimization and quantum search, which circumvents flow field measurement altogether. We propose methods for simulating many different lattice configurations simultaneously and describe how the usage of amplitude estimation and quantum search can provide an asymptotic quantum advantage. Throughout the paper, we provide detailed complexity analyses of gate-level implementations of our circuits and consider the benefits and costs of several encodings.

Title: Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes
Authors: Bane Vasic, Valentin Savin, Michele Pacenti, Shantom Borah, Nithin Raveendran
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of quantum computing, enabling reliable information processing in the presence of noise. Sparse stabilizer codes -- referred to generally as quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes -- have risen to the forefront of QEC research in recent years. This can be attributed to several key factors. First, classical LDPC codes admit low-complexity belief propagation iterative decoding and near-capacity performance, which contributed to the early interest in QLDPC codes. Then, the result promising constant overhead fault tolerance using QLDPC codes led to the search for code families that go beyond the long-holding $\sqrt{n}$ scaling barrier of minimum distance for codelength $n$. This resulted in recent breakthroughs in the construction of QLDPC codes, which, combined with efficient decoding algorithms and the development of fault-tolerant protocols operating on QLDPC-encoded quantum information, provide a promising pathway to low-overhead, fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, despite their potential, challenges remain, particularly in constructing and decoding finite-length codes that account for, or efficiently leverage, specific characteristics of quantum hardware, such as connectivity, topology, native gate sets, and noise models. This article provides an in-depth examination of QLDPC codes and their iterative decoders, catering to an information theory audience with no or limited background in quantum mechanics. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings, explore unique characteristics of quantum channels, and delineate key code constructions and decoding algorithms, ultimately highlighting the impact and future prospects of QLDPC codes in quantum information science.

Title: Quantum machine learning and quantum-inspired methods applied to computational fluid dynamics: a short review
Authors: Cesar A. Amaral, Vinícius L. Oliveira, Juan P. L. C. Salazar, Eduardo I. Duzzioni
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is central to science and engineering, but faces severe scalability challenges, especially in high-dimensional, multiscale, and turbulent regimes. Traditional numerical methods often become prohibitively expensive under these conditions. Quantum computing and quantum-inspired methods have been investigated as promising alternatives. This review surveys advances at the intersection of quantum computing, quantum algorithms, machine learning, and tensor network techniques for CFD. We discuss the use of Variational Quantum Algorithms as hybrid quantum-classical solvers for PDEs, emphasizing their ability to incorporate nonlinearities through Quantum Nonlinear Processing Units. We further review Quantum Neural Networks and Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks, which extend classical machine learning frameworks to quantum hardware and have shown advantages in parameter efficiency and solution accuracy for certain CFD benchmarks. Beyond quantum computing, we examine tensor network methods, originally developed for quantum many-body systems and now adapted to CFD as efficient high-dimensional compression and solver tools. Reported studies include several orders of magnitude reductions in memory and runtime while preserving accuracy. Together, these approaches highlight quantum and quantum-inspired strategies that may enable more efficient CFD solvers. This review closes with perspectives: quantum CFD remains out of reach in the NISQ era, but quantum-inspired tensor networks already show practical benefits, with hybrid approaches offering the most promising near-term strategy.

Title: Symmetry-protected states of interacting qubits in superconducting quantum circuits
Authors: Yi Shi, Eran Ginossar, Michael Stern, Marzena Szymanska
Abstract: Superconducting circuits are one of the leading candidates for storing and manipulating quantum information. Among them, qubits embedded with intrinsic noise protection have seen rapid advancements in recent years. This noise protection is typically realized by isolating the computational states from local sources of noise. Here, we propose an interacting spin model that requires at least four spins with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, where the two lowest eigenstates form a symmetry-protected qubit manifold, which is robust to both relaxation and dephasing from local perturbations. We map the spin model to a superconducting circuit and show that such a circuit can reach coherence times exceeding several milliseconds in the presence of realistic environmental noise. Our work opens a pathway to realizing qubits with long coherence times in a new generation of quantum devices.

Title: Universal energy-space localization and stable quantum phases against time-dependent perturbations
Authors: Hongye Yu, Tzu-Chieh Wei
Abstract: Stability against perturbation is a highly nontrivial property of quantum systems and is often a requirement to define new phases. In most systems where stability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are considered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent perturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal phenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove that it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the evolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the instantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds remain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This flexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in proving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration spaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space can induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break ergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several systems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving state is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time even under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability of LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In addition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with clustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum Hamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work provides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic quantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and quantum algorithm design.

Title: Classification of Transuranium Elements in Terms of `Winding' Numbers in the Bohr-Sommerfeld Model
Authors: Sergei K. Suslov
Abstract: We revisit the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model to explore hydrogen-like ions of Uranium ($Z=92$), Oganesson ($Z=118$), and hypothetical superheavy elements beyond. Although superseded by the Dirac equation and modern quantum electrodynamics, the semiclassical approach offers a historically and pedagogically valuable perspective. Using the Sommerfeld fine structure formula and computer algebra methods, we demonstrate the appearance of self-intersecting orbits in super strong Coulomb fields, beginning with Oganesson and hypothetical elements up to $Z\le137$. These orbits can be classified by their `winding' numbers, providing a simple topological description of Coulomb field strength in this framework. Our results highlight a conceptual bridge between early quantum theory and modern superheavy element physics.

Title: Quantifiers of Noise Reducibility Under Restricted Control
Authors: Graeme D. Berk, Kavan Modi, Simon Milz
Abstract: The correlation structure of multitime quantum processes - succinctly described by quantum combs - is an important resource for many quantum information protocols and control tasks. Inspired by approaches for quantum states, we introduce quantifiers of the practical utility of quantum processes that satisfy monotonicity properties, thus overcoming shortcomings in previous state-motivated approaches. Applying these quantifiers to the problem of noise reduction of a quantum process under open-loop control, they are shown to represent the largest amount of temporal mutual information that a process can possibly exhibit. In addition, we study their resource composition behaviour and connect them to the recently introduced notion of generalised comb divergences. Finally, in light of these new quantifiers, we re-interpret the numerical findings of npj Quantum Information 9, 104 (2023) on the relationship of dynamical decoupling and non-Markovian memory, which were based on insufficient resource quantifiers, and show that its main conclusion - the interpretation of dynamical decoupling as a resource distillation - still holds.

Title: Offline Dedicated Quantum Attacks on Block Ciphers Based on Two Parallel Permutation-Based Pseudorandom Functions
Authors: Xiao-Fan Zhen, Zhen-Qiang Li, Jia-Cheng Fan, Su-Juan Qin, Fei Gao
Abstract: Quantum cryptanalysis is essential for evaluating the security of cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computing. Recently, Shi et al. introduced the dedicated quantum attack on XOR-type function that greatly reduces the required resources (including circuit depth, width, and the number of gates) compared to the parallel Grover-meets-Simon algorithm. Here, our contribution is in two aspects. On the one hand, we discover new cryptographic structures amenable to this attack: PolyMAC and block ciphers based on two parallel permutation-based pseudorandom functions (TPP-PRFs), including XopEM, SoEM22, SUMPIP, and DS-SoEM, partially answering Shi et al.'s open question. On the other hand, for block ciphers based on TPP-PRFs, we break the obstacle that this attack rely on online query by constructing decoupled XOR-type function, then propose an offline quantum attack on them. Compared to previous results, our offline attack exhibits significantly reduced query complexity. Specifically, we reduce the number of queries to the encryption oracle from $\tilde O(2^{(n+t)/2})$ to $\tilde O(2^{t})$ with the same time complexity in the quantum query model, and enable its implementation in the classical query model, optimizing both the classical query complexity and time complexity from $\tilde O(2^{(2n)/3})$ to $\tilde O(2^{(2n-t)/3})$.

Title: Transferable Equivariant Quantum Circuits for TSP: Generalization Bounds and Empirical Validation
Authors: Monit Sharma, Hoong Chuin Lau
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of generalization in quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) for combinatorial optimization, focusing on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Training quantum policies on large TSP instances is often infeasible, so existing QRL approaches are limited to small-scale problems. To mitigate this, we employed Equivariant Quantum Circuits (EQCs) that respect the permutation symmetry of the TSP graph. This symmetry-aware ansatz enabled zero-shot transfer of trained parameters from $n-$city training instances to larger m-city problems. Building on recent theory showing that equivariant architectures avoid barren plateaus and generalize well, we derived novel generalization bounds for the transfer setting. Our analysis introduces a term quantifying the structural dissimilarity between $n-$ and $m-$node TSPs, yielding an upper bound on performance loss under transfer. Empirically, we trained EQC-based policies on small $n-$city TSPs and evaluated them on larger instances, finding that they retained strong performance zero-shot and further improved with fine-tuning, consistent with classical observations of positive transfer between scales. These results demonstrate that embedding permutation symmetry into quantum models yields scalable QRL solutions for combinatorial tasks, highlighting the crucial role of equivariance in transferable quantum learning.

Title: Polaritons confined in dielectric structures
Authors: Amir Rahmani, Dogyun Ko, Maciej Dems, Andrzej Opala, Michał Matuszewski
Abstract: Light-matter interaction in the regime of strong quantum coupling is usually treated within the framework of the Hopfield model. However, the picture of coupling well-defined modes of light and matter is correct only as long as the shapes of these eigenmodes are not substantially modified by the interaction. Moreover, parameters of theoretical models are usually obtained by fitting to experimental data. To date, there has been no straightforward method to determine a quantum master equation corresponding to a system with specific dielectric structure, which may lead to incompatibility of theoretical descriptions and physical realizations. We present a recipe for obtaining a quantum model in the polariton eigenmode basis based on Bogoliubov transformation in the conservative case and third quantization technique in the dissipative case. We show how this method can be used for boosting interaction strength and engineering nonlocal many-body interactions in carefully designed nanostructures, resulting in strongly nonclassical correlations of emitted light.

Title: Quantum Reinforcement Learning: Recent Advances and Future Directions
Authors: Jawaher Kaldari, Shehbaz Tariq, Saif Al-Kuwari, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Symeon Chatzinotas, Hyundong Shin
Abstract: As quantum machine learning continues to evolve, reinforcement learning stands out as a particularly promising yet underexplored frontier. In this survey, we investigate the recent advances in QRL to assess its potential in various applications. While QRL has generally received less attention than other quantum machine learning approaches, recent research reveals its distinct advantages and transversal applicability in both quantum and classical domains. We present a comprehensive analysis of the QRL framework, including its algorithms, architectures, and supporting SDK, as well as its applications in diverse fields. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities that QRL can unfold, highlighting promising use cases that may drive innovation in quantum-inspired reinforcement learning and catalyze its adoption in various interdisciplinary contexts.

Title: Single-shot antidistinguishability of unitary operations
Authors: Satyaki Manna, Anandamay Das Bhowmik
Abstract: The notion of antidistinguishability captures the possibility of ruling out certain alternatives in a quantum experiment without identifying the actual outcome. Although extensively studied for quantum states, the antidistinguishability of quantum channels remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the single-shot antidistinguishability of unitary operations. We analyse two scenarios: antidistinguishability with single-system probes and with entangled probes. For sets of three unitaries, we first prove that all maximally entangled states are equivalent in their performance as probe. In the qubit case, we further establish that maximally entangled probes are always sufficient: if a set of three qubit unitaries is antidistinguishable with either a single-system or non-maximally entangled probe, then it is also antidistinguishable with a maximally entangled one. However, in higher dimension, this equivalence fails. In \textit{dimension 3}, there exists a set of unitaries that are antidistinguishable with non-maximally entangled probe or single-system probe but not with maximally entangled probe. We also establish that union of two antidistinguishable sets of three qubit unitaries also forms a set of antidistinguishable unitaries. Lastly, we provide methods to construct antidistinguishable unitaries from non-antidistinguishable ones.

Title: Multiparameter quantum-enhanced adaptive metrology with squeezed light
Authors: Giorgio Minati, Enrico Urbani, Nicolò Spagnolo, Valeria Cimini, Fabio Sciarrino
Abstract: Squeezed light enables quantum-enhanced phase estimation, with crucial applications in both fundamental physics and emerging technologies. To fully exploit the advantage provided by this approach, estimation protocols must remain optimal across the entire parameter range and resilient to instabilities in the probe state. In this context, strategies that rely on pre-calibrated squeezing levels are vulnerable to degradation over time and become sub-optimal when experimental conditions fluctuate. Here, we develop an adaptive multiparameter estimation strategy for ab-initio phase estimation, achieving sub-standard quantum limit precision in the full periodicity interval $[0,\pi)$, without relying on prior knowledge of the squeezing parameter. Our approach employs real-time feedback to jointly estimate both the optical phase and the squeezing level, ensuring robustness against experimental drifts and calibration errors. This self-calibrating scheme establishes a reliable quantum-enhanced sensing framework, opening new routes for practical scenarios and scalable distributed sensor networks using squeezed light.

Title: Unsupervised Learning to Recognize Quantum Phases of Matter
Authors: Mehran Khosrojerdi, Alessandro Cuccoli, Paola Verrucchi, Leonardo Banchi
Abstract: Drawing the quantum phase diagram of a many-body system in the parameter space of its Hamiltonian can be seen as a learning problem, which implies labelling the corresponding ground states according to some classification criterium that defines the phases. In this work we adopt unsupervised learning, where the algorithm has no access to any priorly labeled states, as a tool for determining quantum phase diagrams of many-body systems. The algorithm directly works with quantum states: given the ground-state configurations for different values of the Hamiltonian parameters, the process uncovers the most significant way of grouping them based on a similarity criterion that refers to the fidelity between quantum states, that can be easily estimated, even experimentally. We benchmark our method with two specific spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains, with states determined via tensor network techniques. We find that unsupervised learning algorithms based on spectral clustering, combined with ``silhouette'' and ``elbow'' methods for determining the optimal number of phases, can accurately reproduce the phase diagrams. Our results show how unsupervised learning can autonomously recognize and possibly unveil novel phases of quantum matter.

Title: Spectral subspace extraction via incoherent quantum phase estimation
Authors: Stefano Scali, Josh Kirsopp, Antonio Márquez Romero, Michał Krompiec
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm for extracting Hamiltonian eigenvalues, but its standard form targets individual eigenstates and requires carefully prepared coherent inputs. To overcome these limitations, we adopt an ensemble-based formulation of QPE that estimates the density of states (DOS) of the Hamiltonian generator of the evolution. This approach, which we refer to as DOS-QPE, builds on a prior formulation introduced by one of the authors. In this work, we present DOS-QPE as a circuit primitive, extending it with symmetry-adapted input ensembles and advanced spectrum reconstruction techniques. This variant of QPE enables natural access to thermodynamic properties, symmetry-resolved spectral functions, and features relevant to quantum many-body systems. We demonstrate its performance on fermionic models and nuclear Hamiltonians by casting the spectrum reconstruction problem as a quadratic program solved via compressed sensing. These use cases highlight the potential of DOS-QPE for early fault-tolerant quantum simulations in spectroscopy, electronic structure, and nuclear theory.

Title: Quantum remeshing and efficient encoding for fracture mechanics
Authors: Ulysse Remond, Pierre-Emmanuel Emeriau, Liam Lysaght, Jean Ruel, Joseph Mikael, Kyryl Kazymyrenko
Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm for structural mechanical problems, specifically addressing crack opening simulations that traditionally require extensive computational resources. Our approach provides an alternative solution for a relevant 2D case by implementing a parametrized quantum circuit that stores nodal displacements as quantum amplitudes and efficiently extracts critical observables. The algorithm achieves optimal nodal displacements by minimizing the elastic energy obtained from finite element method. The energy is computed with only a polylogarithmic number of measurements. Extracting relevant scalar observables such as the stress intensity factor is then done efficiently on the converged solution. To validate the scalability of our approach, we develop a warm start strategy based on a remeshing technique that uses coarse solutions to circumvent barren plateaus in the optimization landscape of the more refined problems. Our method has been experimentally validated on Quandela's photonic quantum processor Ascella and comprehensive numerical simulations demonstrate its scalability across increasingly complex quantum systems.

Title: ParaToric 1.0-beta: Continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo for the toric code in a parallel field
Authors: Simon M. Linsel, Lode Pollet
Abstract: We introduce ParaToric, a C++ package for simulating the toric code in a parallel field (i.e., $X$- and $Z$-fields) at finite temperature. We implement and extend the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm of Wu, Deng, and Prokof'ev on the square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices with open and periodic boundaries, respectively. The package is expandable to arbitrary lattice geometries and custom observables diagonal in either the $X$- or $Z$-basis. ParaToric also supports snapshot extraction in both bases, making it ideal for generating training/benchmarking data for other methods, such as lattice gauge theories, cold atom or other quantum simulators, quantum spin liquids, artificial intelligence, and quantum error correction. The software provides bindings to C/C++ and Python, and is thus almost universally integrable into other software projects.

Title: Efficient adaptive control strategy for multi-parameter quantum metrology in two-dimensional systems
Authors: Qifei Wei, Shengshi Pang
Abstract: Quantum metrology leverages quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing to enhance parameter estimation precision beyond classical limits. While optimal quantum control strategies can assist to reach or even surpass the Heisenberg limit, their practical implementation often requires the knowledge of the parameters to be estimated, necessitating adaptive control methods with feedback. Such adaptive control methods have been considered in single-parameter quantum metrology, but not much in multi-parameter quantum metrology so far. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing an efficient adaptive control strategy for multi-parameter quantum metrology in two-dimensional systems. By eliminating the trade-offs among optimal measurements, initial states, and control Hamiltonians through a system extension scheme, we derive an explicit relation between the estimator variance and evolution time. Through a reparameterization technique, the optimization of evolution times in adaptive iterations are obtained, and a recursive relation is established to characterize the precision improvement across the iterations. The proposed strategy achieves the optimal performance up to an overall factor of constant order with only a few iterations and demonstrates strong robustness against deviations in the errors of control parameters at individual iterations. Further analysis shows the effectiveness of this strategy for Hamiltonians with arbitrary parameter dependence. This work provides a practical approach for multi-parameter quantum metrology with adaptive Hamiltonian control in realistic scenarios.

Title: Signatures of Topological Symmetries on a Noisy Quantum Simulator
Authors: Christopher Lamb, Robert M. Konik, Hubert Saleur, Ananda Roy
Abstract: Topological symmetries, invertible and otherwise, play a fundamental role in the investigation of quantum field theories. Despite their ubiquitous importance across a multitude of disciplines ranging from string theory to condensed matter physics, controlled realizations of models exhibiting these symmetries in physical systems are rare. Quantum simulators based on engineered solid-state devices provide a novel alternative to conventional condensed matter systems for realizing these models. In this work, eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians and loop operators associated with the topological symmetries for the Ising conformal field theory in two space-time dimensions are realized on IBM's Kingston simulator. The relevant states are created on the quantum device using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on a variation of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ansatz combined with the quantum natural gradient optimization method. Signatures of the topological symmetry are captured by measuring correlation functions of different qubit operators with results obtained from the quantum device in reasonable agreement with those obtained from classical computations. The current work demonstrates the viability of noisy quantum simulators as platforms for investigating low-dimensional quantum field theories with direct access to observables that are often difficult to probe in conventional condensed matter experiments.

Title: Ruelle-Pollicott Decay of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in Many-Body Systems
Authors: Jerónimo Duarte, Ignacio García-Mata, Diego A. Wisniacki
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed many-body quantum systems.

Title: Fast and fault-tolerant logical measurements: Auxiliary hypergraphs and transversal surgery
Authors: Alexander Cowtan, Zhiyang He, Dominic J. Williamson, Theodore J. Yoder
Abstract: Quantum code surgery is a promising technique to perform fault-tolerant computation on quantum low-density parity-check codes. Recent developments have significantly reduced the space overhead of surgery. However, generic surgery operations still require $O(d)$ rounds of repeated syndrome extraction to be made fault-tolerant. In this work, we focus on reducing the time overhead of surgery. We first present a general set of conditions that ensure fault-tolerant surgery operations can be performed with constant time overhead. This fast surgery necessarily makes use of an auxiliary complex described by a hypergraph rather than a graph. We then introduce a concrete scheme called block reading, which performs transversal surgery across multiple code blocks. We further investigate surgery operations with intermediate time overhead, between $O(1)$ and $O(d)$, which apply to quantum locally testable codes. Finally, we establish a circuit equivalence between homomorphic measurement and hypergraph surgery and derive bounds on the time overhead of generic logical measurement schemes. Overall, our results demonstrate that reducing the time cost of code surgery is not reliant on the quantum memory being single-shot. Instead it is chiefly the connectivity between a code and its measurement ancilla system that determines the achievable measurement time overhead.

Title: Forecasting Quantum Observables: A Compressed Sensing Approach with Performance Guarantees
Authors: Víctor Valls, Albert Akhriev, Olatz Sanz Larrarte, Javier Oliva del Moral, Štěpán Šmíd, Josu Etxezarreta Martinez, Sergiy Zhuk, Dmytro Mishagli
Abstract: Noise in near-term quantum devices limits the timescales over which measurements can be reliably obtained. Existing data-driven extrapolation methods extend the dynamics of quantum observables from measurements, but they cannot guarantee that the recovered model reflects the true dynamics. In this paper, we introduce atomic norm minimization as a framework to certify that a model learned by any algorithm accurately captures the underlying dynamics of quantum observables. This certification is valid when the system is governed by a small number of well-separated Bohr frequencies. We validate the framework across multiple algorithms on numerical experiments with spin-chain Hamiltonians involving 8-20 qubits. Comparing with exact diagonalization, certification yields an average forecasting error below 0.1 (within the observable's range of $[-1, 1]$) in 98% of cases and below 0.05 in 89-97% of cases, depending on the forecasting algorithm. Even in the presence of realistic shot noise, certified models remain robust, with success rates decreasing only to 88-95% for the 0.1 error threshold.

Title: Continuous-time quantum walk on a random graph using quantum circuits
Authors: Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Rohit Sarma Sarkar, Sonjoy Majumder, Rohit Kishan Ray
Abstract: Quantum walks, particularly continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW), have emerged as powerful tools for modeling quantum transport, simulating complex dynamics, and developing quantum algorithms with potential speedups over classical counterparts. In this work, we present a scalable quantum circuit formalism to simulate CTQW on random graph structures, especially focusing on Erdős-Rényi random graphs. Our quantum circuit construction efficiently implements the time evolution of the graph Laplacian, using the Trotterization scheme. We investigate key dynamical properties, \emph{i.e.,} the localization behavior of the CTQW. Our quantum circuit implementation over random graph ensures that the circuit design can work on any graph structure, thereby laying the foundation for realizing CTQW-based quantum simulations efficiently.

Title: Decoherence-Aware Entangling and Swapping Strategy Optimization for Entanglement Routing in Quantum Networks
Authors: Shao-Min Huang, Cheng-Yang Cheng, Ming-Huang Chien, Jian-Jhih Kuo, Chih-Yu Wang
Abstract: Quantum teleportation enables high-security communications through end-to-end quantum entangled pairs. End-to-end entangled pairs are created by using swapping processes to consume short entangled pairs and generate long pairs. However, due to environmental interference, entangled pairs decohere over time, resulting in low fidelity. Thus, generating entangled pairs at the right time is crucial. Moreover, the swapping process also causes additional fidelity loss. To this end, this paper presents a short time slot protocol, where a time slot can only accommodate a process. It has a more flexible arrangement of entangling and swapping processes than the traditional long time slot protocol. It raises a new optimization problem TETRIS for finding strategies of entangling and swapping for each request to maximize the fidelity sum of all accepted requests. To solve the TETRIS, we design two novel algorithms with different optimization techniques. Finally, the simulation results manifest that our algorithms can outperform the existing methods by up to 60 ~ 78% in general, and by 20 ~ 75% even under low entangling probabilities.

Title: Current fluctuations in nonequilibrium open quantum systems beyond weak coupling: a reaction coordinate approach
Authors: Khalak Mahadeviya, Saulo V. Moreira, Sheikh Parvez Mandal, Mahasweta Pandit, Javier Prior, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: We investigate current fluctuations in open quantum systems beyond the weak-coupling and Markovian regimes, focusing on a coherently driven qubit strongly coupled to a structured bosonic environment. By combining full counting statistics with the reaction coordinate mapping, we develop a framework that enables the calculation of steady-state current fluctuations and their temporal correlations in the strong-coupling regime. Our analysis reveals that, unlike in weak coupling, both the average current and its fluctuations exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on the system-environment interaction strength. Notably, we identify a regime where current noise is suppressed below the classical thermodynamic uncertainty bound, coinciding with enhanced anticorrelations in quantum jump trajectories and faster system relaxation. We further show that these features are linked to nonclassical properties of the reaction coordinate mode, such as non-Gaussianity and quantum coherence. Our results provide new insights and design principles for controlling current fluctuations in quantum devices operating beyond the standard weak-coupling paradigm.

Title: Orders matter: tight bounds on the precision of sequential quantum estimation for multiparameter models
Authors: Gabriele Fazio, Jiayu He, Matteo G. A. Paris
Abstract: In multiparameter quantum metrology, the ultimate precision of joint estimation is dictated by the Holevo Cramér-Rao bound. In this paper, we discuss and analyze in detail an alternative approach: the stepwise estimation strategy. In this approach, parameters are estimated sequentially, using an optimized fraction of the total available resources allocated to each step. We derive a tight and achievable precision bound for this protocol, the stepwise separable bound, and provide its closed-form analytical expression, revealing a crucial dependence on the chosen measurement ordering. We provide a rigorous comparison with the joint measurement strategy, deriving analytical conditions that determine when the stepwise approach offers superior precision. Through the analysis of several paradigmatic SU(2) unitary encoding models, we demonstrate that the stepwise strategy can indeed outperform joint measurements, particularly in scenarios characterized by non-optimal probes or models with a high degree of sloppiness. Our findings establish stepwise estimation as a powerful alternative to joint and collective measurements, proving that sequential protocols can provide a genuine metrological advantage, especially in resource-constrained or imperfect experimental settings.

Title: Quantum modeling of radical pair magnetic sensor based on electric dipole moment
Authors: Mahboobe Sehati, Ali Soltanmanesh, Shabnam Abutalebi, Abolfazl Bahrampour, Naser Haeri, Sareh Rostami, Alireza Bahrampour
Abstract: Photoreduction of cryptochrome protein in the retina is a well-known mechanism of navigation of birds through the geomagnetic field, yet the biosignal nature of the mechanism remains unclear. The absorption of blue light by the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore can alter the distribution of electrons in cryptochrome and create radical pairs with separated charges. In this study, the spin dynamics of electrons in the radical pair and its coupling with spatial position were investigated by computational modeling from a quantum mechanical perspective. Several interactions were considered in the presence of an external magnetic field, and the resulting electric dipole moment in cryptochrome was computed as the quantity emerging from this coupling. The computations show the induced electric dipole moment clearly depend on the characteristics of the applied magnetic field even after considering dissipative effects. In fact, our findings indicate that the radical pair in cryptochrome protein is a magnetic biosensor, in the sense that in the presence of the geomagnetic field, variations in spin states can influence its electric dipole moment, which may be interpreted via the bird as an orientation signal. The results can be used in the advancement of bio-inspired technologies which replicate animal magnetic sensitivity. On the other hand, with increasing concern about the detrimental effects of electromagnetic fields on wildlife and human health, studying the phenomenon of magnetoreception can contribute to a deeper understanding of how biological structures interact with these fields.

Title: Bayes or Heisenberg: Who(se) Rules?
Authors: Volker Tresp Hang Li, Federico Harjes, Yunpu Ma
Abstract: Although quantum systems are generally described by quantum state vectors, we show that in certain cases their measurement processes can be reformulated as probabilistic equations expressed in terms of probabilistic state vectors. These probabilistic representations can, in turn, be approximated by the neural network dynamics of the Tensor Brain (TB) model. The Tensor Brain is a recently proposed framework for modeling perception and memory in the brain, providing a biologically inspired mechanism for efficiently integrating generated symbolic representations into reasoning processes.

Title: Diffeomorphism invariant tensor networks for 3d gravity
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Charlie Cummings
Abstract: Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.

Title: Decoherence in high energy collisions as renormalization group flow
Authors: Jiayin Gu, Shi-Jia Lin, Ding Yu Shao, Lian-Tao Wang, Si-Xiang Yang
Abstract: The unification of quantum information science and collider physics is opening a new frontier in high-energy experiments, making a systematic understanding of decoherence a critical challenge. We present a framework to systematically compute spin decoherence from final-state radiation by combining soft-collinear effective theory and open quantum system techniques. We demonstrate that the renormalization group (RG) evolution of the final-state spin density matrix constitutes a quantum channel, where the RG flow parameter, rather than time, drives a Markovian loss of quantum information. Our approach incorporates explicit detector resolution parameters, allowing a direct connection between experimental capabilities and the preservation of quantum coherence. Applying this formalism to a fermion pair ($f\bar{f}$) in the high-energy limit with QED-like final-state radiation, we provide the first systematically RG-improved prediction for decoherence as a function of experimental resolution, revealing the underlying decoherence mechanism to be a phase-flip channel. This work establishes an essential theoretical tool for future precision measurements of quantum phenomena in high-energy collisions and offers a new perspective on the interplay between RG flow and decoherence of open quantum systems.

Title: De Sitter holographic complexity from Krylov complexity in DSSYK
Authors: Michal P. Heller, Fabio Ori, Jacopo Papalini, Tim Schuhmann, Meng-Ting Wang
Abstract: We utilize the recent connection between the high energy limit of the double-scaled SYK model and two-dimensional de Sitter solutions of sine dilaton gravity to identify the length of a family of geodesics spanned between future and past infinities with Krylov spread complexity. This constitutes an explicit top-down microscopic realization of holographic complexity in a cosmological spacetime. Our identification is different from the existing holographic complexity proposals for de Sitter geometries which are anchored either on horizons as holographic screens or on timelike observers. This leads us to introduce and investigate a new cosmological holographic complexity proposal in any dimension. It is based on extremal timelike volumes anchored at the asymptotic past and future and at large values of the anchoring boundary coordinate grows linearly with growth rate proportional to the product of de Sitter entropy and temperature.

Title: Impact of irradiation conditions on the magnetic field sensitivity of spin defects in hBN nano flakes
Authors: Saksham Mahajan, Ravi Kumar, Aferdita Xhameni, Gautham Venu, Basanta Mistri, Felix Donaldson, T.Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, Siddharth Dhomkar, Antonio Lombardo, John J.L. Morton
Abstract: We study $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres generated by helium focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation in thin ($\sim$70 nm) hBN nanoflakes, in order to investigate the effect of implantation conditions on the key parameters that influence the magnetic field sensitivity of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ quantum sensors. Using a combination of photoluminescence, optically detected magnetic resonance, and Raman spectroscopy, we examine the competing factors of maximising signal intensity through larger $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ concentration against the degradation in spin coherence and lattice quality observed at high ion fluences. Our results indicate that both the $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin properties and hBN lattice parameters are largely preserved up to an ion fluence of $10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$, and beyond this significant degradation occurs in both. At the optimal implantation dose, an AC magnetic sensitivity of $\sim 1\,\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ is achieved. Using the patterned implantation enabled by the FIB, we find that $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres and the associated lattice damage are well localised to the implanted regions. This work demonstrates how careful selection of fabrication parameters can be used to optimise the properties of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres in hBN, supporting their application as quantum sensors based on 2D materials.

Title: Bell-State Quantum Holography with Metasurfaces
Authors: Qinmiao Chen, Guangzhou Geng, Hong Liang, Wai Chun Wong, Tailin An, Randy Stefan Tanuwijaya, Junjie Li, Jensen Li
Abstract: Metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures enable simultaneous control of polarization and wavefront, greatly enhancing holographic information capacity. Building on this capability, we extend holography into the quantum domain by experimentally realizing Bell-state holograms-distinct holographic images encoded in polarization-entangled Bell states of photon pairs. A polarization-multiplexed dielectric metasurface generates spatial modes conditioned on both input and output polarizations, entangling the holographic pattern with the two-photon state. To characterize these quantum holograms, we further develop quantum hologram tomography, reconstructing the full density matrix of the holographic state pixel by pixel. The reconstructed density-matrix hologram reveals tailor-made holographic symbols attached to individual Bell states through the metasurface, with contrast built up among the different Bell components as theory shows. This framework unifies metasurface photonics with quantum-state reconstruction and provides a scalable route toward high-dimensional quantum communication, encryption and information processing based on holographically encoded quantum light.

Title: Phenomenological Ehrenfest Dynamics with Topological and Geometric Phase Effects and the curious case of Elliptical intersection
Authors: Dhruv Sharma
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational framework for simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics with explicit inclusion of geometric phase (GP) effects. Our approach is based on a generalized two-level Hamiltonian model that can represent various electronic state crossings - conical intersections, avoided crossings, and elliptic intersections - through appropriate parameterization. We introduce a novel prelooping trajectory initialization scheme, allowing us to encode the memory as an initial phase accumulated due to the adiabatic evolution over the potential energy surface. This is a unified framework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry curvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate representation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method incorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic intersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy) independent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter (e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with theoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to geometric phase effects. This framework provides a valuable tool for studying quantum-classical interactions in molecular systems where geometric phase effects play a significant role. The elliptical intersection and geometric phase effect opens avenue for the design and discovery of degenerate materials. It produces a fresh look to help develop a new kind of spectroscopy and potential qubit applications. This simple Hamiltonian reveals a pathological phase protection effect E = kr, where k is real, that has great utility in a new spectroscopy design.

Title: Small-time approximate controllability of the logarithmic Schr\''dinger equation
Authors: Karine Beauchard (ENS Rennes, IRMAR), Rémi Carles (IRMAR, CNRS), Eugenio Pozzoli (CNRS, IRMAR)
Abstract: We consider Schr{ö}dinger equations with logarithmic nonlinearity and bilinear controls, posed on $\mathbb{T}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove their small-time global $L^2$-approximate controllability. The proof consists in extending to this nonlinear framework the approach introduced by the first and third authors in \cite{beauchard-pozzoli2} to control the linear equation: it combines the small-time controllability of phases and gradient flows. Due to the nonlinearity, the required estimates are more difficult to establish than in the linear case. The proof here is inspired by WKB analysis. This is the first result of (small-time) global approximate controllability, for nonlinear Schr{ö}dinger equations, with bilinear controls.

Title: Enhanced Secondary Electron Detection of Single Ion Implants in Silicon Through Thin SiO2 Layers
Authors: Ella B Schneider, Oscar G Lloyd-Willard, Kristian Stockbridge, Mark Ludlow, Sam Eserin, David C Cox, Roger P Webb, Ben N Murdin, Steve K Clowes
Abstract: Deterministic placement of single dopants is essential for scalable quantum devices based on group-V donors in silicon. We demonstrate a non-destructive, high-efficiency method for detecting individual ion implantation events using secondary electrons (SEs) in a focused ion beam (FIB) system. Using low-energy Sb ions implanted into undoped silicon, we achieve up to 98% single-ion detection efficiency, verified by calibrated ion-current measurements before and after implantation. The technique attains ~30 nm spatial resolution without requiring electrical contacts or device fabrication, in contrast to ion-beam-induced-current (IBIC) methods. We find that introducing a controlled SiO2 capping layer significantly enhances SE yield, consistent with an increased electron mean free path in the oxide, while maintaining high probability of successful ion deposition in the underlying substrate. The yield appears to scale with ion velocity, so higher projectile mass (e.g. Yb, Bi etc) requires increased energy to maintain detection efficiency. Our approach provides a robust and scalable route to precise donor placement and extends deterministic implantation strategies to a broad range of material systems and quantum device architectures.

Title: Interplay of ferromagnetism, nematicity and Fermi surface nesting in kagome flat band
Authors: Yuman He, Wentao Jiang, Siqi Wu, Xuzhe Ying, Berthold Jack, Xi Dai, Hoi Chun Po
Abstract: Recent experiment on Fe-doped CoSn has uncovered a series of correlated phases upon hole doping of the kagome flat bands. Among the phases observed, a nematic phase with a six- to two-fold rotation symmetry breaking is found to prevail over a wide doping and temperature range. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the interaction-driven phases realized in a kagome model with partially filled, weakly dispersing flat bands. Density-density interactions up to second-nearest neighbors are considered. We identify a close competition between ferromagnetic and nematic phases in our self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations: while on-site interaction favors ferromagnetism, the sizable inter-sublattice interactions stabilize nematicity over a wide doping window. Competition from translational-symmetry-breaking phases is also considered. Overall, our results show that nematicity is a generic outcome of partially filled kagome flat bands and establish a minimal framework for understanding correlated flat-band phases.

Title: Nonlinear Landau levels in the almost-bosonic anyon gas
Authors: Alireza Ataei, Ask Ellingsen, Filippa Getzner, Théotime Girardot, Douglas Lundholm, Dinh-Thi Nguyen
Abstract: We consider the quantitative description of a many-particle gas of interacting abelian anyons in the plane, confined in a trapping potential. If the anyons are modeled as bosons with a magnetic flux attachment, and if the total magnetic flux is small compared to the number of particles, then an average-field description becomes appropriate for the low-energy collective state of the gas. Namely, by means of a Hartree-Jastrow ansatz, we derive a two-parameter Chern-Simons-Schrödinger energy functional which extends the well-known Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schrödinger density functional theory to the magnetic (anyonic) self-interaction. One parameter determines the total number of self-generated magnetic flux units in the system, and the other the effective strength of spin-orbit self-interaction. This latter interaction can be either attractive/focusing or repulsive/defocusing, and depends both on the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction and the relative length scale of the flux profile of the anyons. Densities and energies of ground and excited states are studied analytically and numerically for a wide range of the parameters and align well with a sequence of exact nonlinear Landau levels describing Jackiw-Pi self-dual solitons. With increasing flux, counter-rotating vortices are formed, enhancing the stability of the gas against collapse. Apart from clarifying the relations between various different anyon models that have appeared in the literature, our analysis sheds considerable new light on the many-anyon spectral problem, and also exemplifies a novel supersymmetry-breaking phenomenon.

Title: On Krylov Complexity as a Probe of the Quantum Mpemba Effect
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli
Abstract: We investigate Krylov state complexity as a probe of the quantum Mpemba effect in quantum spin chains. For models without global $U(1)$ symmetry, Krylov complexity exhibits clear Mpemba-like crossings, consistent with conventional diagnostics such as the trace distance, while offering a complementary interpretation in terms of Hilbert-space exploration and dynamical delocalization. In $U(1)$-symmetric systems, we confirm that the recently proposed symmetric component of Krylov complexity serves as a robust and reliable indicator of the QME, capturing anomalous relaxation even in cases where the total complexity fails to do so.

Title: Impact of rotation on a cold atom interferometer and compensation strategy
Authors: Noémie Marquet, Yannick Bidel, Malo Cadoret, Alexis Bonnin, Sylvain Schwartz, Phuong-Anh Huynh, Alexandre Bresson, Antoine Godard, Franck Pereira Dos Santos, Olivier Carraz, Nassim Zahzam
Abstract: Rotations play a detrimental role in achieving ultra-high-performance inertial measurements with an atom interferometer, leading potentially to a total loss of interference contrast and the emergence of dominant phase shift biases. This becomes particularly significant when considering operation in dynamic conditions such as those encountered in Earth orbiting satellites in the perspective of future space gravity missions on-boarding a cold atom accelerometer. We study in this context the impact of rotation on the phase shift and contrast of an atom interferometer and investigate mitigation strategies. An analytical model is derived and compared to experimental demonstrations carried out using an original setup in which the well-controlled proof-mass of a space electrostatic accelerometer is used as the retro-reflection mirror of a cold atom gravimeter. By properly counter-rotating the electrostatic proof-mass, we demonstrate for instance the possibility of recovering the interferometer contrast, otherwise equal to zero, to a level better than 90%, in both cases of constant angular velocities or in presence of angular accelerations. Our results demonstrate the possibility to perform high performance inertial measurements with a cold atom interferometer in a challenging environments.

Title: Herman-Kluk-Like Semi-Classical Initial-Value Representation for Boltzmann Operator
Authors: Binhao Wang, Fan Yang, Chen Xu, Peng Zhang
Abstract: The coherent-state initial-value representation (IVR) for the semi-classical real-time propagator of a quantum system, developed by Herman and Kluk (HK), is widely used in computational studies of chemical dynamics. On the other hand, the Boltzmann operator $e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)}$, with $\hat{H}$,$k_B$, and $T$ representing the Hamiltonian, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively, plays a crucial role in chemical physics and other branches of quantum physics. One might naturally assume that a semi-classical IVR for the matrix element of this operator in the coordinate representation (i.e., $ \langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, or the imaginary-time propagator) could be derived via a straightforward ``real-time $\rightarrow$ imaginary-time transformation'' from the HK IVR of the real-time propagator. However, this is not the case, as such a transformation results in a divergence in the high-temperature limit $(T \rightarrow \infty)$. In this work, we solve this problem and develop a reasonable HK-like semi-classical IVR for $\langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, specifically for systems where the gradient of the potential energy (i.e., the force intensity) has a finite upper bound. The integrand in this IVR is a real Gaussian function of the positions $x$ and $\tilde{x}$, which facilitates its application to realistic problems. Our HK-like IVR is exact for free particles and harmonic oscillators, and its effectiveness for other systems is demonstrated through numerical examples.

Title: Quantum Fisher Information as a Thermal and Dynamical Probe in Frustrated Magnets: Insights from Quantum Spin Ice
Authors: Chengkang Zhou, Zhengbang Zhou, Félix Desrochers, Yong Baek Kim, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a novel measure of multipartite quantum entanglement that can be measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on quantum magnets. In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of quantum magnets.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the properties of finite groups that are witnessed by group invariants arising in the context of Dijkgraaf--Witten theory, a topological quantum field theory, as invariants of surfaces. These invariants can be considered generalizations of the commuting probability, an invariant that has been well studied in the group theory literature.

Title: Monogamy of entanglement between cones
Authors: Guillaume Aubrun, Alexander Müller-Hermes, Martin Plávala
Abstract: A separable quantum state shared between parties $A$ and $B$ can be symmetrically extended to a quantum state shared between party $A$ and parties $B_1,\ldots ,B_k$ for every $k\in\mathbf{N}$. Quantum states that are not separable, i.e., entangled, do not have this property. This phenomenon is known as "monogamy of entanglement". We show that monogamy is not only a feature of quantum theory, but that it characterizes the minimal tensor product of general pairs of convex cones $\mathsf{C}_A$ and $\mathsf{C}_B$: The elements of the minimal tensor product $\mathsf{C}_A\otimes_{\min} \mathsf{C}_B$ are precisely the tensors that can be symmetrically extended to elements in the maximal tensor product $\mathsf{C}_A\otimes_{\max} \mathsf{C}^{\otimes_{\max} k}_B$ for every $k\in\mathbf{N}$. Equivalently, the minimal tensor product of two cones is the intersection of the nested sets of $k$-extendible tensors. It is a natural question when the minimal tensor product $\mathsf{C}_A\otimes_{\min} \mathsf{C}_B$ coincides with the set of $k$-extendible tensors for some finite $k$. We show that this is universally the case for every cone $\mathsf{C}_A$ if and only if $\mathsf{C}_B$ is a polyhedral cone with a base given by a product of simplices. Our proof makes use of a new characterization of products of simplices up to affine equivalence that we believe is of independent interest.

Title: Electromagnetic momentum in the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference experiment from a physical perspective
Authors: Ashok K. Singal
Abstract: In the Aharonov-Bohm setup, a double-slit experiment, when a long but thin solenoid of current is introduced between the two coherent beams of electrons behind the slits, an extra phase difference between the interfering beams appears, as shown by a shift in the interference pattern. This mysterious effect, purportedly arises owing to an electromagnetic momentum, attributed to the presence of a vector potential at the location of either beam, due to the solenoid of current even when the magnetic field is zero outside the solenoid. It has remained a puzzle, how mere potential, thought to be just a mathematical tool for calculating electromagnetic field, can give rise to electromagnetic momentum in a system. Experimentally the effect has been amply verified, with hardly any doubts that the observed effect is real. A satisfactory physical explanation of the existence of momentum, at least under the aegis of classical electromagnetism, is still missing since inception of the idea more than half a century back. We show here the presence of electromagnetic momentum in the product of the drift velocities of the current-carrying charges within the solenoid and the mass equivalent of their potential energies in the electric field of the external charges.

Title: Quantum Polar Metric Learning: Efficient Classically Learned Quantum Embeddings
Authors: Vinayak Sharma, Ashish Padhy, Sourav Behera, Lord Sen, Shyamapada Mukherjee, Aviral Shrivastava
Abstract: Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the classical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was also adapted to quantum computers via Quantum Metric Learning(QMeL). QMeL consists of a 2 step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit into the limited number of qubits, then train a Parameterized Quantum Circuit(PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high circuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) that uses a classical model to learn the parameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with $R_y$ and $R_z$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of $ZZ(\theta)$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity via a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train both classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, QPMeL achieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of gates and depth. We also demonstrate that QPMeL outperforms classical networks with similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.

Title: Fundamental limitations on the recoverability of quantum processes
Authors: Sohail, Vivek Pandey, Uttam Singh, Siddhartha Das
Abstract: Quantum information processing and computing tasks can be understood as quantum networks, comprising quantum states and channels and possible physical transformations on them. It is hence pertinent to estimate the change in informational content of quantum processes due to physical transformations they undergo. The physical transformations of quantum states are described by quantum channels, while the transformations of quantum channels are described by quantum superchannels. In this work, we determine fundamental limitations on how well the physical transformation on quantum channels can be undone or reversed, which are of crucial interest to design and benchmark quantum information and computation devices. In particular, we refine (strengthen) the quantum data processing inequality for quantum channels under the action of quantum superchannels. We identify a class of quantum superchannels, which appears to be the superchannel analogue of subunital quantum channels, under the action of which the entropy of an arbitrary quantum channel is nondecreasing. We also provide a refined inequality for the entropy change of quantum channels under the action of an arbitrary quantum superchannel.

Title: Flexible quantum data bus for quantum networks
Authors: Julia Freund, Alexander Pirker, Wolfgang Dür
Abstract: We consider multi-path routing of entanglement in quantum networks, where a pre-prepared multipartite entangled 2D cluster state serves as a resource to perform different tasks on demand. We show how to achieve parallel connections between multiple, freely chosen groups of parties by performing appropriate local measurements among diagonal paths, which preserves the entanglement structure of the remaining state. We demonstrate how to route multiple Bell-states along parallel lines via crossings, turns and fade-in/-outs, analogously to a data bus. The results apply to networks at any scale.

Title: Demonstrating Quantum Scaling Advantage in Approximate Optimization for Energy Coalition Formation with 100+ Agents
Authors: Naeimeh Mohseni, Thomas Morstyn, Corey O'Meara, David Bucher, Jonas Nüßlein, Giorgio Cortiana
Abstract: The formation of energy communities is pivotal for advancing decentralized and sustainable energy management. Within this context, Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) emerges as a promising framework. The complexity of CSG grows rapidly with the number of agents, making classical solvers impractical for even moderate sizes. This suggests CSG as an ideal candidate for benchmarking quantum algorithms against classical ones. Facing ongoing challenges in attaining computational quantum advantage for exact optimization, we pivot our focus to benchmarking quantum and classical solvers for approximate optimization. Approximate optimization is particularly critical for industrial use cases requiring real-time optimization, where finding high-quality solutions quickly is often more valuable than achieving exact solutions more slowly. Our findings indicate that quantum annealing (QA) on DWave can achieve solutions of comparable quality to our best classical solver, but with more favorable runtime scaling, showcasing an advantage. This advantage is observed when compared to solvers, such as Tabu search, simulated annealing, and the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi, in finding approximate solutions for energy community formation involving over 100 agents. DWave also surpasses 1-round QAOA on IBM hardware. Our findings represent the largest benchmark of quantum approximate optimizations for a real-world dense model beyond the hardware's native topology, where D-Wave demonstrates a scaling advantage.

Title: Expectation value estimation with parametrized quantum circuits
Authors: Bujiao Wu, Lingyu Kong, Yuxuan Yan, Fuchuan Wei, Zhenhuan Liu
Abstract: Estimating properties of quantum states, such as fidelities, molecular energies, and correlation functions, is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Due to the limitation of practical quantum devices, including limited circuit depth and connectivity, estimating even linear properties encounters high sample complexity. To address this inefficiency, we propose a framework that optimizes sample complexity for estimating the expectation value of any observable using a shallow parameterized quantum circuit. Within this framework, we introduce two decomposition algorithms, a tensor network approach and a greedy projection approach that decompose the target observable into a linear combination of multiple observables, each of which can be diagonalized with the shallow circuit. Using this decomposition, we then apply an importance sampling algorithm to estimate the expectation value of the target observable. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by estimating the expectation values of some specific Hamiltonians and inner product of a Slater determinant with a pure state, highlighting advantages compared to some conventional methods. Additionally, we derive the fundamental lower bound for the sample complexity required to estimate a target observable using a given shallow quantum circuit, thereby enhancing our understanding of the capabilities of shallow circuits in quantum learning tasks.

Title: A recipe for local simulation of strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers: the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model
Authors: Arash Jafarizadeh, Frank Pollmann, Adam Gammon-Smith
Abstract: The simulation of quantum many-body systems, relevant for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers before fault-tolerance. However, since the vast majority of quantum computing technologies are built around qubits and discrete gate-based operations, the translation of the physical problem into this framework is a crucial step. This translation will often be device specific, and a suboptimal implementation will be punished by the exponential compounding of errors on real devices. The importance of an efficient mapping is already revealed for models of spinful fermions in two or three dimensions, which naturally arise when the relevant physics relates to electrons. Using the most direct and well-known mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, leads to a non-local representation of local degrees of freedom, and necessities efficient decompositions of non-local unitary gates into a sequence of hardware accessible local gates. In this paper, we provide a step-by-step recipe for simulating the paradigmatic two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on a quantum computer using only local operations. To provide the ingredients for such a recipe, we briefly review the plethora of different approaches that have emerged recently but focus on the Derby-Klassen compact fermion mapping in order to make our discussion concrete. We provide a detailed recipe for an end-to-end simulation including embedding on a physical device, preparing initial states such as ground states, simulation of unitary time evolution, and measurement of observables and spectral functions. We explicitly compute the resource requirements for simulating a global quantum quench and conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions for simulating strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers.

Title: Oracle problems as communication tasks and optimization of quantum algorithms
Authors: Amit Te'eni, Zohar Schwartzman-Nowik, Marcin Nowakowski, Paweł Horodecki, Eliahu Cohen
Abstract: Quantum query complexity studies the number of queries needed to learn some property of a black box. A closely related question is how well an algorithm can succeed with this learning task using only a fixed number of queries. In this work, we propose measuring an algorithm's performance using the mutual information between the output and the actual value. The task of optimizing this mutual information using a single query, is similar to a basic task of quantum communication, where one attempts to maximize the mutual information of the sender and receiver. We make this analogy precise by splitting the algorithm between two agents, obtaining a communication protocol. The oracle's target property plays the role of a message that Alice encodes into a quantum state, which is subsequently sent over to Bob. The first part of the algorithm performs this encoding, and the second part measures the state and aims to deduce the message from the outcome. Moreover, we formally consider the oracle as a separate subsystem, whose state records the unknown oracle identity. Within this construction, Bob's optimal measurement basis minimizes the quantum correlations between the two subsystems. We also find a lower bound on the mutual information, which is related to quantum coherence. These results extend to multiple-query algorithms. As a result, we describe the optimal non-adaptive algorithm that uses at most a fixed number of queries, for any oracle classification problem. We demonstrate our results by studying several well-known algorithms through the proposed framework. Finally, we discuss some practical implications of our results.

Title: Pulsed Quantum Excitation
Authors: Juan Camilo López Carreño
Abstract: A two-level system (2LS) is the most fundamental building block of matter. Its response to classical light is well known, as it converts pulses of coherent light into antibunched emission. However, recent theoretical proposals have predicted that it is advantageous to illuminate two-level systems with Quantum Light; i.e., the light emitted from a quantum system. However, those proposals were done considering continuous excitation of the source of light. Here, we advance the field by changing the paradigm of excitation: we use the emission of a 2LS, itself driven by a laser pulse, to excite another 2LS. Thus, we present a thorough analysis of Resonance Fluorescence under pulsed quantum excitation and show, in particular, that the emission from a 2LS driven with quantum light is more antibunched and more indistinguishable than if it were driven with classical light. Our results reinforce the claim of the advantage of the excitation with quantum light, provide support to the recent experimental observations, and can be used as a road-map for the future of light-matter interaction research.

Title: Dissipation in fermionic two-body continuous-time quantum walk under the steepest entropy ascent formalism
Authors: Rohit Kishan Ray, R. Srikanth, Sonjoy Majumder
Abstract: Quantum walks play a crucial role in quantum algorithms and computational problems. Many-body quantum walks can reveal and exploit quantum correlations that are unavailable for single-walker cases. Studying quantum walks under noise and dissipation, particularly in multi-walker systems, has significant implications. In this context, we use a thermodynamically consistent formalism of dissipation modeling, namely the steepest entropy ascent (SEA) formalism. We analyze two spinless fermionic continuous-time walkers on a 1D graph with tunable Hubbard and extended Hubbard-like interactions. By contrasting SEA-driven dynamics with unitary evolution, we systematically investigate how interaction strengths modulate thermalization and entropy production. Our findings highlight the relevance of SEA formalism in modeling nonlinear dissipation in many-body quantum systems and its implications for quantum thermalization.

Title: Heuristic Time Complexity of NISQ Shortest-Vector-Problem Solvers
Authors: Miloš Prokop, Petros Wallden
Abstract: Shortest Vector Problem is believed to be hard both for classical and quantum computers. Two of the three NIST post-quantum cryptosystems standardised by NIST rely on its hardness. Research on theoretical and practical performance of quantum algorithms to solve SVP is crucial to establish confidence in them. Exploring the capabilities that Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) that can run on NISQ devices have in solving SVP has been an active research area. The qubit-requirement for doing so has been analysed and it was demonstrated that it is plausible to encode SVP on the ground state of a Hamiltonian efficiently. Due to the heuristic nature of VQAs no analysis of the time complexity of those approaches for scales beyond the non-interesting classically simulatable sizes has been performed. Motivated by Boulebnane and Montanaro work on the k-SAT problem, we propose to use angle pretraining of the QAOA for SVP and we demonstrate that it performs well on much larger instances than those used in training. Avoiding the limitations that arise due to the use of optimiser, we are able to extrapolate the observed performance and observe the probability of success scaling as $2^{-0.695n}$ with n being dimensionality of the search space for a depth $p=3$ pre-trained QAOA. We observe time heuristic complexity $O(2^{0.695n})$, a bit worse than the fault-tolerant Grover approach of $O(2^{0.5n})$. However, both the number of qubits, and the depth of each quantum computation, are considerably better-Grover requires exponential depth, while each run of constant p fixed-angles QAOA requires polynomial depth. We also propose a novel method to avoid the zero vector solution to SVP without introducing more logical qubits. This improves upon the previous works as it results in more space efficient encoding of SVP on NISQ architectures without ignoring the zero vector problem.

Title: Benchmarking the quality of multiplexed qubit readout beyond assignment fidelity
Authors: Andras Di Giovanni, Adrian Skasberg Aasen, Jürgen Lisenfeld, Martin Gärttner, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov
Abstract: The accurate measurement of quantum two-level objects (qubits) is crucial for developing quantum computers. Over the last decade, the measure of choice for benchmarking readout routines for superconducting qubits has been assignment fidelity. However, this method only focuses on the preparation of computational basis states and therefore does not provide a complete characterization of the readout. Here, we expand the focus to the use of detector tomography to fully characterize multiqubit readout of superconducting transmon qubits. The impact of different readout parameters on the rate of information extraction is studied using quantum state reconstruction infidelity as a proxy. The results are then compared with assignment fidelities, showing good agreement for separable two-qubit states. We therefore propose the rate of infidelity convergence as a validation tool for assignment fidelity and a more comprehensive benchmark for single- and multiqubit readout optimization. To make the best use of experimental resources, we investigate the most efficient distribution of a limited shot budget between detector tomography and state reconstruction within the context of single- and two-qubit experiments. To address the growing interest in three-qubit gates and test scalability of the validation tool, we perform three-qubit quantum state tomography that goes beyond conventional readout-error-mitigation methods and find a factor of 30 reduction in quantum infidelity. Our results demonstrate that qubit readout correlations are not induced by a significantly reduced state distinguishability. Consequently, correlation coefficients can serve as a valuable tool in qubit readout optimization.

Title: Hong-Ou-Mandel effect with two frequency-entangled photons of vastly different color
Authors: Felix Mann, Helen M. Chrzanowski, Marlon Placke, Felipe Gewers, Sven Ramelow
Abstract: In the original formulation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment, when two otherwise indistinguishable photons are incident upon the two input ports of a balanced beam splitter, they coalesce, always leaving via the same output port. It is often interpreted that this interference arises due to the indistinguishability of the single photons at the beam splitter; the situation, however, is often more nuanced. Here, we demonstrate an analog of HOM interference between two photons of completely different color. To do so, we utilize a quantum frequency converter based on sum- and difference-frequency generation as an `active' beam splitter -- coupling frequency-entangled red and telecom single photons with an octave-spanning energy difference of 282 THz. We achieve an uncorrected two-photon interference visibility beyond 90%. This work presents the first demonstration of HOM interference between two single photons of distinctly different color, deepening our understanding of what underlies quantum interference. It also suggests a novel approach to interfacing photonic qubits in heterogeneous quantum systems where frequency conversion and quantum interference are unified.

Title: Microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits
Authors: Kui Zhao, Wei-Guo Ma, Ziting Wang, Hao Li, Kaixuan Huang, Yun-Hao Shi, Kai Xu, Heng Fan
Abstract: Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $\ket{001} \leftrightarrow \ket{110}$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). The protocol maintains process fidelities exceeding $98\%$ under decoherence, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced parameter variations and compatibility with existing all-microwave two-qubit gate architectures. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

Title: A Temperature Change can Solve the Deutsch-Jozsa Problem : An Exploration of Thermodynamic Query Complexity
Authors: Jake Xuereb
Abstract: We demonstrate how a single heat exchange between a probe thermal qubit and multi-qubit thermal machine encoding a Boolean function, can determine whether the function is balanced or constant, thus providing a novel thermodynamic solution to the Deutsch-Jozsa problem. We introduce a thermodynamic model of quantum query complexity, showing how qubit thermal machines can act as oracles, queried via heat exchange with a probe. While the Deutsch-Jozsa problem requires an exponential encoding in the number of oracle bits, we also explore a restricted Bernstein-Vazirani problem, which admits a linear thermal oracle and a single thermal query solution. We establish bounds on the number of samples needed to determine the probe temperature encoding the solution for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem, showing that it remains constant with problem size. Additionally, we propose a proof-of-principle experimental implementation to solve the 3-bit Bernstein-Vazirani problem via thermal kickback. This work bridges thermodynamics and complexity theory, suggesting that quantum thermodynamics could provide an unconventional route to computing beyond classical computation.

Title: Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.

Title: No-go theorems for logical gates on product quantum codes
Authors: Esther Xiaozhen Fu, Han Zheng, Zimu Li, Zi-Wen Liu
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes are essential to the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Homological products of classical codes offer a versatile framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes with desirable properties, especially quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes. Based on extensions of the Bravyi--König theorem that encompass codes without geometric locality, we establish a series of general no-go theorems for fault-tolerant logical gates supported by hypergraph product codes. Specifically, we show that non-Clifford logical gates cannot be implemented transversally on hypergraph product codes of all product dimensions, and that the dimensions impose various limitations on the accessible level of the Clifford hierarchy gates by constant-depth local circuits. We also discuss examples both with and without geometric locality which attain the Clifford hierarchy bounds. Our results reveal fundamental restrictions on logical gates originating from highly general algebraic structures, extending beyond existing knowledge only in geometrically local, finite logical qubits, transversal, or 2-dimensional product cases, and may guide the vital study of fault-tolerant quantum computation with qLDPC codes.

Title: Orbital angular momentum of entangled photons as a probe for relativistic effects
Authors: Fazilah Nothlawala, Kiki Dekkers, Moslem Mahdavifar, Jonathan Leach, Andrew Forbes, Isaac Nape
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. We show that the joint OAM spectrum from entangled states is modified by length contraction when measured by two observers moving relative to the entanglement source. This relative motion rescales the spatial dimensions, thus breaking the orthogonality of the OAM measurement process and resulting in a broadening of the joint OAM spectrum that can precisely determine the Lorentz factor. We experimentally simulate velocities up to $0.99c$, confirm the predicted broadening, and use the measurement outcomes to extract the Lorentz factor. Our work provides a pathway for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that leverage OAM structured light as a resource.

Title: Entangled Polariton States in the Visible and Mid-Infrared Spectral Ranges
Authors: Vladislav Yu. Shishkov, Oleg Kotov, Emily Haughton, Darius Urbonas, Lee A. Rozema, Francisco J. Garcia-Vidal, Johannes Feist, Anton V. Zasedatelev
Abstract: Entanglement generation in polariton systems is fundamentally constrained by high losses and decoherence, which typically outweigh polariton nonlinearities. Here, we propose a conceptually different approach that uses optomechanical interactions, rather than polariton-polariton interactions, to generate entangled polaritons. Our double-resonant scheme relies on strong exciton-phonon coupling, found in both inorganic and molecular semiconductors, enabling room-temperature generation of spectrally disparate photon pairs. The quantum coherent and delocalized nature of polariton states inside optical cavities ensures efficient single-mode outcoupling and allows for unconditional quantum state preparation - not relying on any post-selection or projective measurements. When conditioned on exciton-polariton emission, single phonon-polariton states can be prepared that subsequently yield bright, heralded single-photon emission in the mid-IR/THz. We introduce a double-resonant optomechanical platform that enables scalable, room-temperature quantum polaritonics without relying on conventional excitonic nonlinearities.

Title: Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum
Authors: Philip A. LeMaitre
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.

Title: Deep Anomaly Detection for Active Attacks on the Receiver in Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Junxuan Liu, Bingcheng Huang, Jialei Su, Qingquan Peng, Anqi Huang
Abstract: Traditional countermeasures against attacks targeting the receiver in quantum key distribution (QKD) systems often suffer from poor compatibility with deployed infrastructure, the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities, and limited applicability to specific types of active attacks. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection (AD) model based on one-class machine learning to address active attacks targeting the receiver. By constructing a dataset from the QKD system's operational states, the AD model learns the characteristics of normal behavior under secure conditions. When an active attack occurs, the system's state deviates from the learned normal patterns and is identified as anomalous by the model. Experimental results show that the AD model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 99%, effectively safeguarding the receiver of the QKD system. Compared to traditional approaches, our model can be deployed with minimal cost in existing QKD networks without requiring additional optical or electrical components, thus avoiding the introduction of new side channels. Furthermore, unlike multi-class machine learning algorithms, our approach does not rely on prior knowledge of specific attack types and is potentially able to detect unknown active attacks. These advantages-generality, ease of deployment, low cost, and high accuracy-make our model a practical and effective tool for protecting the receiver of QKD systems against active attacks.

Title: From Membership-Privacy Leakage to Quantum Machine Unlearning
Authors: Junjian Su, Runze He, Guanghui Li, Sujuan Qin, Zhimin He, Haozhen Situ, Fei Gao
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has the potential to achieve quantum advantage for specific tasks by combining quantum computation with classical Machine Learning (ML). In classical ML, a significant challenge is membership privacy leakage, whereby an attacker can infer from model outputs whether specific data were used in training. When specific data are required to be withdrawn, removing their influence from the trained model becomes necessary. Machine Unlearning (MU) addresses this issue by enabling the model to forget the withdrawn data, thereby preventing membership privacy leakage. However, this leakage remains underexplored in QML. This raises two research questions: do QML models leak membership privacy about their training data, and can MU methods efficiently mitigate such leakage in QML models? We investigate these questions using two QNN architectures, a basic Quantum Neural Network (basic QNN) and a Hybrid QNN (HQNN), evaluated in noiseless simulations and on quantum hardware. For the first question, we design a Membership Inference Attack (MIA) tailored to QNN in a gray-box setting. Our experiments indicate clear evidence of leakage of membership privacy in both QNNs. For the second question, we propose a Quantum Machine Unlearning (QMU) framework, comprising three MU mechanisms. Experiments on two QNN architectures show that QMU removes the influence of the withdrawn data while preserving accuracy on retained data. A comparative analysis further characterizes the three MU mechanisms with respect to data dependence, computational cost, and robustness. Overall, this work provides a potential path towards privacy-preserving QML.

Title: Modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for CSS codes
Authors: Sebastian Stengele, Ángela Capel, Li Gao, Angelo Lucia, David Pérez-García, Antonio Pérez-Hernández, Cambyse Rouzé, Simone Warzel
Abstract: We consider the class of Davies quantum semigroups modelling thermalization for translation-invariant Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes in D dimensions. We prove that conditions of Dobrushin-Shlosman-type on the quantum Gibbs state imply a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with a constant that is uniform in the system's size. This is accomplished by generalizing parts of the classical results on thermalization by Stroock, Zegarlinski, Martinelli, and Olivieri to the CSS quantum setting. The results in particular imply the rapid thermalization at any positive temperature of the toric code in 2D and the star part of the toric code in 3D, implying a rapid loss of stored quantum information for these models.

Title: Recent quantum runtime (dis)advantages
Authors: J. Tuziemski, J. Pawłowski, P. Tarasiuk, Ł. Pawela, B. Gardas
Abstract: We (re)evaluate recent claims of quantum advantage in annealing- and gate-based algorithms, testing whether reported speedups survive rigorous end-to-end runtime definitions and comparison against strong classical baselines. Conventional analyses often omit substantial overhead (readout, transpilation, thermalization, etc.) yielding biased assessments. While excluding seemingly not important parts of the simulation may seem reasonable, on most current quantum hardware a clean separation between "pure compute" and "overhead" cannot be experimentally justified. This may distort "supremacy" results. In contrast, for most classical hardware total time $\approx$ compute $+$ a weakly varying constant leading to robust claims. We scrutinize two important milestones: (1) quantum annealing for approximate QUBO PRL 134, 160601 (2025) [this https URL], which uses a sensible time-to-$\epsilon$ metric but proxies runtime by the annealing time (non-measurable); (2) a restricted Simon's problem PRX 15, 021082 (2025) [this https URL] , whose advantageous scaling in oracle calls is undisputed; yet, as we demonstrate, estimated runtime of the quantum experiment is $\sim 100 \times$ slower than a tuned classical baseline. Finally, we show that recently claimed "runtime advantage" of the BF-DCQO hybrid algorithm (arXiv:2505.08663) does not withstand rigorous benchmarking. Therefore, we conclude that runtime-based supremacy remains elusive on NISQ hardware, and credible claims require a careful time accounting with a proper reference selections, and an adequate metric.

Title: Local active error correction from simulated confinement
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.

Title: Quantum complementarity
Authors: Davide Rolino, Paolo Perinotti, Alessandro Tosini
Abstract: We propose an operational definition of complementarity, pinning down the concept originally introduced by Bohr. Two properties of a system are considered complementary if they cannot be simultaneously well defined. We further show that, within quantum theory, this notion is equivalent to the incompatibility of operations -- that is, their inability to be performed simultaneously.

Title: Synthetic fractional flux quanta in a ring of superconducting qubits
Authors: Luca Chirolli, Juan Polo, Gianluigi Catelani, Luigi Amico
Abstract: A ring of capacitively coupled transmons threaded by a synthetic magnetic field is studied as a realization of a strongly interacting bosonic system. The synthetic flux is imparted through a specific Floquet modulation scheme based on a suitable periodic sequence of Lorentzian pulses that are known as 'Levitons'. Such scheme has the advantage to preserve the translation invariance of the system and to work at the qubit sweet spots. We employ this system to demonstrate the concept of fractional values of flux quanta. Although such fractionalization phenomenon was originally predicted for bright solitons in cold atoms, it may be in fact challenging to access with that platform. Here, we show how fractional flux quanta can be read out in the absorption spectrum of a suitable 'scattering experiment' in which the qubit ring is driven by microwaves.

Title: The cognitive triple-slit experiment
Authors: Luca Sassoli de Bianchi, Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi
Abstract: Quantum cognition has made it possible to model human cognitive processes very effectively, revealing numerous parallels between the properties of conceptual entities tested by the human mind and those of microscopic entities tested by measurement apparatuses. The success of quantum cognition has also made it possible to formulate an interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the conceptuality interpretation, which ascribes to quantum entities a conceptual nature similar to that of human concepts. The present work fits into these lines of research by analyzing a cognitive version of single, double, and triple-slit experiments. The data clearly show the formation of the typical interference fringes between the slits as well as the embryos of secondary fringes. Our analysis also shows that while quantum entities and human concepts may share a same conceptual nature, the way they manifest it in specific contexts can be quite different. This is also evident from the significant deviation from zero observed for the Sorkin parameter, indicating the presence of strong irreducible third-order interference contributions in human decision.

Title: Finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: J. Pawlowski, J. Herbrych, M. Mierzejewski
Abstract: Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the long-time properties of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.

Title: Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions
Authors: Reja H. Wilke, Henning Schlömer, Simon M. Linsel, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.

Title: Graphon Quantum Filtering Systems
Authors: Hamed Amini, Nina H. Amini, Sofiane Chalal, Gaoyue Guo
Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system, establish its well-posedness, and prove propagation of chaos for multi-class bosonic systems with blockwise interactions. We then discuss applications to quantum state preparation and quantum graphon games.

Title: Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics
Authors: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
Abstract: This study examines the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles were functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, silica nanoparticles behave as harmonic oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with respect to motion of the silica nanoparticles which can be explained by a theoretical model. Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to the spectra. Dimensionality reduction detected differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized silica nanoparticles. Random forest modeling provided further evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types.

Title: Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator
Authors: Junming Wu, Shihao Zhou, Benedetta Flebus, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.

Title: Algorithmic Temperature Induced by Adopted Regular Universal Turing Machine
Authors: Kentaro Imafuku
Abstract: We prove that an effective temperature naturally emerges from the algorithmic structure of a regular universal Turing machine (UTM), without introducing any external physical parameter. In particular, the redundancy growth of the machine's wrapper language induces a Boltzmann--like exponential weighting over program lengths, yielding a canonical ensemble interpretation of algorithmic probability. This establishes a formal bridge between algorithmic information theory and statistical mechanics, in which the adopted UTM determines the intrinsic ``algorithmic temperature.'' We further show that this temperature approaches its maximal limit under the universal mixture (Solomonoff distribution), and discuss its epistemic meaning as the resolution level of an observer.
