Title: Optimization of Quantum-Repeater Networks using Stochastic Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Guus Avis, Stefan Krastanov
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are envisioned to enable long-distance entanglement distribution. Analysis of quantum-repeater networks could hasten their realization by informing design decisions and research priorities. Determining derivatives of network properties is crucial towards that end, facilitating optimizations and revealing parameter sensitivity. Doing so, however, is difficult because the networks are discretely random. Here we use a recently developed technique, stochastic automatic differentiation, to automatically extract derivatives from discrete Monte Carlo simulations of repeater networks. With these derivatives, we optimize rate-fidelity tradeoffs in a repeater chain, determine the chain's sensitivity with respect to the coherence times of different nodes, and finally choose the locations of quantum repeaters in a two-dimensional plane to optimize the guaranteed quality of service between four end nodes. In particular, the technique enabled us to discover how the best achievable quality of service, the minimal number of repeaters required to improve a network, and the number of repeaters required to saturate the network scale with the physical size of the network.

Title: Arithmetic sequences as quantum states
Authors: Ruge Lin, Germán Sierra, José I. Latorre
Abstract: We consider arithmetic sequences, here defined as ordered lists of positive integers. Any such a sequence can be cast onto a quantum state, enabling the quantification of its `surprise' through von Neumann entropy. We identify typical sequences that maximize entanglement entropy across all bipartitions and derive an analytical approximation as a function of the sequence length. This quantum-inspired approach offers a novel perspective for analyzing randomness in arithmetic sequences.

Title: Sensing the vibration of non-reflective surfaces with 10-dB-squeezed-light enhancement
Authors: Pascal Gewecke, Jascha Zander, Roman Schnabel
Abstract: Laser light with squeezed quantum uncertainty is a powerful tool for interferometric sensing. A routine application can be found in gravitational wave observatories. A significant quantum advantage is only achievable if a large fraction of the photons are actually measured. For this reason, quantum-enhanced vibrational measurements of strongly absorbing or scattering surfaces have not been considered so far. Here we demonstrate the strongly quantum-enhanced measurement of the frequency characteristics of surface vibrations in air by measuring the air pressure wave instead. Our squeezed laser beam, which simply passes the vibrating surface, delivers a sensitivity that an ultra-stable conventional light beam in the same configuration can only achieve with ten times the power. The pressure amplitude of a ultrasonic wave of just 0.12 mPa/ Hz was clearly visible with a spatial resolution in the millimetre range and a 1 kHz resolution bandwidth. We envision applications in sensor technology where distant, highly absorbing or optically inaccessible surface vibrations in air are to be measured with limited, e.g. eye-safe, light powers.

Title: Quantum Entanglement and Measurement Noise: A Novel Approach to Satellite Node Authentication
Authors: Pooria Madani, Carolyn McGregor
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel authentication scheme for satellite nodes based on quantum entanglement and measurement noise profiles. Our approach leverages the unique noise characteristics exhibited by each satellite's quantum optical communication system to create a distinctive "quantum noise fingerprint." This fingerprint is used for node authentication within a satellite constellation, offering a quantum-safe alternative to traditional cryptographic methods. The proposed scheme consists of a training phase, where each satellite engages in a training exercise with its neighbors to compile noise profiles, and an online authentication phase, where these profiles are used for real-time authentication. Our method addresses the inherent challenges of implementing cryptographic-based schemes in space, such as key management and distribution, by exploiting the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics and the unavoidable imperfections in quantum systems. This approach enhances the security and reliability of satellite communication networks, providing a robust solution to the authentication challenges in satellite constellations. We validated and tested several hypotheses for this approach using IBM System One quantum computers.

Title: Neutral atom entangling gate in the ultrastrong coupling regime
Authors: Ebubechukwu O. Ilo-Okeke, Tongzhou Wang, Valentin Ivannikov, Tim Byrnes
Abstract: We propose a method to deterministically entangle qubits or ensembles of qubits interacting with a shared bosonic mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that the resulting gate is a product of two unitaries: one unitary acts only on the quantum state of the qubits and entangles them, while the other acts only on the quantum state of the boson, producing a phase shift. We find that the gate time is inversely proportional to the qubit-boson interaction strength, and by tuning the qubit-boson interaction strength, one can prepare a maximally entangled state or a squeezed state. Applying the quantum gate to multiple qubit ensembles, we show that the quantum gate prepares a Schrödinger cat state. We also examine imperfections such as including free evolution of the qubits, and show that this produces an effective mixing. Our proposal is feasible for ultrastrong coupling experiments.

Title: Experimental Test of Nonlocality Limits from Relativistic Independence
Authors: Francesco Atzori, Salvatore Virzì, Enrico Rebufello, Alessio Avella, Fabrizio Piacentini, Iris Cusini, Henri Haka, Federica Villa, Marco Gramegna, Eliahu Cohen, Ivo Pietro Degiovanni, Marco Genovese
Abstract: Quantum correlations, like entanglement, represent the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, and pose essential issues and challenges to the interpretation of this pillar of modern physics. Although quantum correlations are largely acknowledged as a major resource to achieve quantum advantage in many tasks of quantum technologies, their full quantitative description and the axiomatic basis underlying them are still under investigation. Previous works suggested that the origin of nonlocal correlations is grounded in principles capturing (from outside the quantum formalism) the essence of quantum uncertainty. In particular, the recently-introduced principle of Relativistic Independence gave rise to a new bound intertwining local and nonlocal correlations. Here we test such a bound by realizing together sequential and joint weak measurements on entangled photon pairs, allowing to simultaneously quantify both local and nonlocal correlations by measuring incompatible observables on the same quantum system without collapsing its state, a task typically forbidden in the traditional (projective) quantum measurement framework. Our results demonstrate the existence of a fundamental limit on the extent of quantum correlations, shedding light on the profound role of uncertainty in both enabling and balancing them.

Title: A graph-based approach to entanglement entropy of quantum error correcting codes
Authors: Wuxu Zhao, Menglong Fang, Daiqin Su
Abstract: We develop a graph-based method to study the entanglement entropy of Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum codes. This method offers a straightforward interpretation for the entanglement entropy of quantum error correcting codes through graph-theoretical concepts, shedding light on the origins of both the local and long-range entanglement. Furthermore, it inspires an efficient computational scheme for evaluating the entanglement entropy. We illustrate the method by calculating the von Neumann entropy of subsystems in toric codes and a special type of quantum low-density-parity check codes, known as bivariate bicycle codes, and by comparing the scaling behavior of entanglement entropy with respect to subsystem size. Our method provides a new perspective for understanding the entanglement structure in quantum many-body systems.

Title: The quantum enigma of teleportation near black holes
Authors: Abhijit Mandal, Sovik Roy
Abstract: The enigma surrounding the existence of black holes has recently been substantiated through the groundbreaking work of experimental physicists \cite{genzel2024}. Exploring quantum systems under the gravitational influence of black holes has emerged as a pivotal area of research. Among the frontier works in quantum information processing is the utilization of quantum states as quantum channels. A fundamental quantum information protocol is teleportation, in which two parties, Alice and Bob, share entangled states. In this protocol, the sender, Alice, who holds an unknown qubit, utilizes local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to recreate the qubit at the recipient's (Bob's) end. Notably, during the execution of this protocol, Alice loses the unknown qubit on her side. The teleportation protocol, originally proposed by Bennett et al. \cite{bennett1993}, has been extensively studied with various states and under different physical setups. Researchers have explored both modifications to the protocol itself and the viability of various quantum states as teleportation channels. In this paper, we investigate whether bipartite mixed states derived from two inequivalent classes of tripartite pure states, subjected to the gravitational influence of two different black hole models, can still serve as efficient quantum channels for teleportation. We emphasize the teleportation fidelity of these states, a critical factor for determining their efficacy as quantum channels. Specifically, the fidelity must exceed the classical limit of $\frac{2}{3}$ to be considered effective \cite{pop1994}. We conjecture that, even under the gravitational influence of black holes, the quantum characteristics of the given states are preserved, enabling them to function effectively as quantum channels for teleportation.

Title: Probability Density in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Taeseung Choi, Yeong Deok Han
Abstract: In the realm of relativistic quantum mechanics, we address a fundamental question: Which one, between the Dirac or the Foldy-Wouthuysen density, accurately provide a probability density for finding a massive particle with spin $1/2$ at a certain position and time. Recently, concerns about the Dirac density's validity have arisen due to the Zitterbewegung phenomenon, characterized by a peculiar fast-oscillating solution of the coordinate operator that disrupts the classical relation among velocity, momentum, and energy. To explore this, we applied Newton and Wigner's method to define proper position operators and their eigenstates in both representations, identifying 'localized states' orthogonal to their spatially displaced counterparts. Our analysis shows that both densities could represent the probability of locating a particle within a few Compton wavelengths. However, a critical analysis of Lorentz transformation properties reveals that only the Dirac density meets all essential physical criteria for a relativistic probability density. These criteria include covariance of the position eigenstate, adherence to a continuity equation, and Lorentz invariance of the probability of finding a particle. Our results provide a clear and consistent interpretation of the probability density for a massive spin-$1/2$ particle in relativistic quantum mechanics.

Title: Gaussian R\'enyi-2 correlations in a nondegenerate three-level laser
Authors: Jamal El Qars
Abstract: Quantum correlation is a key component in various quantum information processing tasks. Decoherence process imposes limitations on achieving these quantum tasks. Therefore, understanding the behavior of quantum correlations in dissipative-noisy systems is of paramount importance. Here, on the basis of the Gaussian Rényi-2 entropy, we analyze entanglement and quantum discord in a two-mode Gaussian state $\rho_{AB}$. The mode $A$($B$) is generated within the first(second) transition of a nondegenerate three-level cascade laser. Using realistic experimental parameters, we show that both entanglement and discord could be generated and enhanced by inducing more quantum coherence. Under thermal noise, entanglement is found more fragile having a tendency to disappear rapidly. While, quantum discord exhibits a freezing behavior, where it can be captured within a wide range of temperature. Surprisingly, we find that entanglement can exceed quantum discord in contrary to the expectation based on the assumption that the former is only a part of the later. Finally, we show numerically as well as analytically that optimal quantum discord can be captured by performing Gaussian measurements on mode $B$. The obtained results suggest that nondegenerate three-level lasers may be a valuable resource for some quantum information tasks, especially, for those do not require entanglement.

Title: Gauge invariance of the natural lineshape and dissipative dynamics of a two-level atom
Authors: Chris Gustin
Abstract: The natural lineshape of an excited two-level atom (TLA) has long been known to be gauge-dependent, with certain experiments in better agreement with the lineshape calculated with the dipole gauge. We show that by using a Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian truncated in a manner consistent with the gauge principle, the correct output spectrum can be obtained. For TLAs undergoing dynamics arising from additional Hamiltonian couplings, we also show that the master equation is gauge-invariant under the same conditions of validity as the Born-Markov approximation, despite different gauges having different spectral densities. These results highlight the importance of using correctly truncated gauge-invariant Hamiltonians in input-output theory for accurate frequency-dependent spectra, even in weak coupling regimes.

Title: Non-Markovian Noise in Symmetry-Preserving Quantum Dynamics
Authors: William M. Watkins, Gregory Quiroz
Abstract: In quantum dynamics, symmetries are vital for identifying and assessing conserved quantities that govern the evolution of a quantum system. When promoted to the open quantum system setting, dynamical symmetries can be negatively altered by system-environment interactions, thus, complicating their analysis. Previous work on noisy symmetric quantum dynamics has focused on the Markovian setting, despite the ubiquity of non-Markovian noise in a number of widely used quantum technologies. In this study, we develop a framework for quantifying the impact of non-Markovian noise on symmetric quantum evolution via root space decompositions and the filter function formalism. We demonstrate analytically that symmetry-preserving noise maintains the symmetric subspace, while non-symmetric noise leads to highly specific leakage errors. We support our findings with a numerical study of the transverse field Ising model subject to spatiotemporally correlated noise. Our results are broadly applicable, providing new analytic insights into the control and characterization of open quantum system dynamics.

Title: Synthetic $\pi$-flux system in 2D superconducting qubit array with tunable coupling

Abstract: Flat-band systems provide an ideal platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, where the strongly suppressed kinetic energy in these flat energy bands suggests the potential for exotic phases driven by geometric structure, disorder, and interactions. While intriguing phenomena and physical mechanisms have been unveiled in theoretical models, synthesizing such systems within scalable quantum platforms remains challenging. Here, we present the experimental realization of a $\pi$-flux rhombic system using a two-dimensional superconducting qubit array with tunable coupling. We experimentally observe characteristic dynamics, e.g., $\pi$-flux driven destructive interference, and demonstrate the protocol for eigenstate preparation in this rhombic array with coupler-assisted flux. Our results provide future possibilities for exploring the interplay of geometry, interactions, and quantum information encoding in such degenerate systems.

Title: Comfortability of quantum walks on embedded graphs on surfaces
Authors: Yusuke Higuchi, Etsuo Segawa
Abstract: In this paper, a quantum walk model which reflects the underlying embedding on the surface is proposed. We obtain the scattering matrix of this quantum walk model characterized by the faces on the surface, and find a detection of the orientablility of the underlying embedding by the scattering information. The comfortability is the square norm of the stationary state restricted to the internal and reflected by the underlying embedding. We find that quantum walker feels more comfortable to a surface with small genus in some natural setting.

Title: Optical phase estimation via homodyne measurement in the presence of saturation effect of photodetectors
Authors: Jialin Li, Yazhi Niu, Lupei Qin, Xin-Qi Li
Abstract: For optical phase estimation via homodyne measurement, we generalize the theory from detector's linear to nonlinear response regime, which accounts for the presence of saturation effect. For optical coherent light, we carry out analytic expressions for detector's current and estimate precision. Using specific device parameters, we illustrate the improved estimation after accounting for the saturation effect.

Title: Exploring dynamical quantum phase transition from pure states to mixed states through generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models
Authors: Kaiyuan Cao, Jian Wang
Abstract: We investigate dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the framework of the generalized SSH model, specifically analyzing the SSH-3 and SSH-4 models, which exhibit different symmetries. We find that the SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states associated with its topological properties. Our results show that DQPTs for pure states occur following a quench that crosses the topological transition, even with an open energy band gap. For mixed states, DQPT behavior is consistent at low temperatures, but significant changes are observed at high temperatures, resulting in the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, allows for the analysis of two distinct energy spectrum configurations. We conclude that the occurrence of DQPTs for pure states in the SSH-4 model necessitates a quench from an initial state without a band gap while crossing the critical point of the topological transition, whereas DQPTs are absent for mixed states at elevated temperatures.

Title: Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect
Authors: Wen-Zheng Ling, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu
Abstract: In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a non-Hermitian square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.

Title: Capability of anti-degradable quantum channel with additional entanglement
Authors: Changchun Zhong
Abstract: Quantum communication theory focuses on the study of quantum channels for transmitting quantum information, where the transmission rate is measured by quantum channel capacity. This quantity exhibits several intriguing properties, such as non-additivity, superactivation and so on. In this work, we show that a type of quantum channel known as the anti-degradable one-mode Gaussian channel -- whose capacity is believed to be zero -- can be ``activated" to transmit quantum information through the introduction of quantum entanglement. Although the channel's output alone cannot be used to retrieve the input signal, combining it with extra entanglement makes this possible. Beyond its theoretical implications, this activation can also be realized in practical systems. For example, in electro-optic systems used for quantum transduction in the two-mode squeezing interaction regime, the transduction channel is anti-degradable. We demonstrate that this system can transmit microwave-optical quantum information with the assistance of entanglement with an ancillary mode. This results in a new type of quantum transducer that exhibits positive quantum capacity over a wide parameter space.

Title: On the eternal non-Markovianity of qubit maps
Authors: Vinayak Jagadish, R. Srikanth
Abstract: As is well known, unital Pauli maps can be eternally non-CP-divisible. In contrast, here we show that in the case of non-unital maps, eternal non-Markovianity in the non-unital part is ruled out. In the unital case, the eternal non-Markovianity can be obtained by a convex combination of two dephasing semigroups, but not all three of them. We study these results and the ramifications arising from them.

Title: A Flux-Tunable cavity for Dark matter detection
Authors: Fang Zhao, Ziqian Li, Akash V. Dixit, Tanay Roy, Andrei Vrajitoarea, Riju Banerjee, Alexander Anferov, Kan-Heng Lee, David I. Schuster, Aaron Chou
Abstract: Developing a dark matter detector with wide mass tunability is an immensely desirable property, yet it is challenging due to maintaining strong sensitivity. Resonant cavities for dark matter detection have traditionally employed mechanical tuning, moving parts around to change electromagnetic boundary conditions. However, these cavities have proven challenging to operate in sub-Kelvin cryogenic environments due to differential thermal contraction, low heat capacities, and low thermal conductivities. Instead, we develop an electronically tunable cavity architecture by coupling a superconducting 3D microwave cavity with a DC flux tunable SQUID. With a flux delivery system engineered to maintain high coherence in the cavity, we perform a hidden-photon dark matter search below the quantum-limited threshold. A microwave photon counting technique is employed through repeated quantum non-demolition measurements using a transmon qubit. With this device, we perform a hidden-photon search with a dark count rate of around 64 counts/s and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to ${\varepsilon}< 4\times 10^{-13}$ in a tunable band from 5.672 GHz to 5.694 GHz. By coupling multimode tunable cavities to the transmon, wider hidden-photon searching ranges are possible.

Title: Is Born-Jordan really the universal Path Integral Quantization Rule?
Authors: John E. Gough
Abstract: It has been argued that the Feynman path integral formalism leads to a quantization rule, and that the Born-Jordan rule is the unique quantization rule consistent with the correct short-time propagator behavior of the propagator for non-relativistic systems. We examine this short-time approximation and conclude, contrary to prevailing views, that the asymptotic expansion applies only to Hamiltonian functions that are at most quadratic in the momentum and with constant mass. While the Born-Jordan rule suggests the appropriate quantization of functions in this class, there are other rules which give the same answer, most notably the Weyl quantization scheme.

Title: QSteed: Quantum Software of Compilation for Supporting Real Quantum Device
Authors: Hong-Ze Xu, Zheng-An Wang, Yu-Long Feng, Yu Chen, Xinpeng Zhang, Jingbo Wang, Xu-Dan Chai, Wei-Feng Zhuang, Yu-Xin Jin, Yirong Jin, Haifeng Yu, Heng Fan, Meng-Jun Hu, Dong E. Liu
Abstract: We present QSteed, a quantum compilation system that can be deployed on real quantum computing devices and quantum computing clusters. It is designed to meet the challenges of effectively compiling quantum tasks and managing multiple quantum backends. The system integrates two core components: a quantum compiler and a quantum computing resource virtualization manager, both of which provide standardized interfaces. The resource manager models quantum chips into different abstract layers, including the real quantum processing unit (QPU), the standard QPU (StdQPU), the substructure QPU (SubQPU), and the virtual QPU (VQPU), and stores this information in a quantum computing resource virtualization database, thus realizing the unified management of quantum computing devices. The quantum compiler adopts a modular and extensible design, providing a flexible framework for customizing compilation optimization strategies. It provides hardware-aware compilation algorithms that account for quantum gate noise and qubit coupling structures. By selecting the most suitable computing resources from the VQPU library, the compiler maps quantum tasks to the optimal qubit regions of the target device. We validated the effectiveness of the QSteed on the superconducting devices of the Quafu quantum cloud computing cluster. The quantum computing resource virtualization management technology of QSteed and the flexible and extensible design of its compiler make it possible to achieve unified management and task compilation for backend devices of multiple physical systems such as neutral-atom and ion-trap.

Title: Quantum signal processing without angle finding
Authors: Abhijeet Alase
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) has emerged as a unifying subroutine in quantum algorithms. In QSP, we are given a function $f$ and a unitary black-box $U$, and the goal is to construct a quantum circuit for implementing $f(U)$ to a given precision. The existing approaches to performing QSP require a classical preprocessing step to compute rotation angle parameters for quantum circuits that implement $f$ approximately. However, this classical computation often becomes a bottleneck, limiting the scalability and practicality of QSP. In this work, we propose a novel approach to QSP that bypasses the computationally intensive angle-finding step. Our method leverages a quantum circuit for implementing a diagonal operator that encodes $f$, which can be constructed from a classical circuit for evaluating $f$. This approach to QSP simplifies the circuit design significantly while enabling nearly optimal implementation of functions of block-encoded Hermitian matrices for black-box functions. Our circuit closely resembles the phase estimation-based circuit for function implementation, challenging conventional skepticism about its efficiency. By reducing classical overhead, our work significantly broadens the applicability of QSP in quantum computing.

Title: Improving key rates by tighter information reconciliation leakage estimation for quantum key distribution
Authors: Hao-Kun Mao, Bo Yang, Yu-Cheng Qiao, Bing-Ze Yan, Qiang Zhao, Bing-Jie Xu, Qiong Li
Abstract: Previous research has aimed to precisely estimate information leakage to improve the secure key rate (SKR) and maximum transmission distance in quantum key distribution (QKD). However, existing methods repeatedly considerd the information of the multi-photon pulses known to Eve before and after information reconciliation, resulting in an overestimation of the leakage amount. We propose a novel approach that considers the quantum part's effect on post-processing, providing a more accurate estimation of information reconciliation leakage to improve the SKR. Theoretical analysis shows that our method more accurately estimates the information reconciliation leakage, significantly improving the SKR at any distance as well as the maximum transmission distance. It is worth mentioning that previous studies treat information leakage of the error correction as Shannon bound $Nh(e)$, and our method can estimate it more tightly. Simulation results for decoy-BB84 and measurement-device-independent (MDI) protocols using Cascade are consistent with the theoretical analysis. The farther the transmission distance, the greater the growth rate of SKR. When the error rate is 33%, compared with the original method, the SKR growth rate of decoy-BB84 at 100KM is 100.4%, and the transmission distance of MDI increases by 22KM.

Here, we propose a unique design of a quantum frequency converter based on a ring-Mach Zehnder interferometer coupled with a periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguide. The proposed device can be-directionally convert quantum signals i.e. single photons from quantum memory such as SiV-center in diamond to the telecom wavelength offering conversion efficiency as high as 90% at mW pump power with noise photon rate below 0.1Hz.

Title: Necessary and sufficient condition for constructing a single qudit insertion/deletion code and its decoding algorithm
Authors: Taro Shibayama
Abstract: This paper shows that Knill-Laflamme condition, known as a necessary and sufficient condition for quantum error-correction, can be applied to quantum errors where the number of particles changes before and after the error. This fact shows that correctabilities of single deletion errors and single insertion errors are equivalent. By applying Knill-Laflamme condition, we generalize the previously known correction conditions for single insertion and deletion errors to necessary and sufficient level. By giving an example that satisfies this condition, we construct a new single qudit insertion/deletion code and explain its decoding algorithm.

Title: Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise
Authors: Pei Wang
Abstract: We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse, based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. Upon quantization, the wave function obeys a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that respects statistical Lorentz symmetry. The localization mechanism is driven by the colored noise, derived from the d'Alembert equation using generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3-dimensional spacetime. We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases.

Title: The exact convex roof for GHZ-W mixtures for three qubits and beyond
Authors: Andreas Osterloh
Abstract: I present an exact solution for the convex roof of the square root threetangle for all states within the Bloch sphere. The working hypothesis is that optimal decompositions contain as many states from the zero-polytope as possible which can be called zero-state locking. The footprint of the measure of entanglement consists in a characteristic pattern for the fixed pure states on the surface which form the optimal solution. The solution is subject to transformation properties due to the SL-invariance of the entanglement measure.

Title: PPO-Q: Proximal Policy Optimization with Parametrized Quantum Policies or Values
Authors: Yu-Xin Jin, Zi-Wei Wang, Hong-Ze Xu, Wei-Feng Zhuang, Meng-Jun Hu, Dong E. Liu
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML), which combines quantum computing with machine learning, is widely believed to hold the potential to outperform traditional machine learning in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ). As one of the most important types of QML, quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) with parameterized quantum circuits as agents has received extensive attention in the past few years. Various algorithms and techniques have been introduced, demonstrating the effectiveness of QRL in solving some popular benchmark environments such as CartPole, FrozenLake, and MountainCar. However, tackling more complex environments with continuous action spaces and high-dimensional state spaces remains challenging within the existing QRL framework. Here we present PPO-Q, which, by integrating hybrid quantum-classical networks into the actor or critic part of the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, achieves state-of-the-art performance in a range of complex environments with significantly reduced training parameters. The hybrid quantum-classical networks in the PPO-Q incorporate two additional traditional neural networks to aid the parameterized quantum circuits in managing high-dimensional state encoding and action selection. When evaluated on 8 diverse environments, including four with continuous action space, the PPO-Q achieved comparable performance with the PPO algorithm but with significantly reduced training parameters. Especially, we accomplished the BipedalWalker environment, with a high-dimensional state and continuous action space simultaneously, which has not previously been reported in the QRL. More importantly, the PPO-Q is very friendly to the current NISQ hardware. We successfully trained two representative environments on the real superconducting quantum devices via the Quafu quantum cloud service.

Title: Bosonic Amplitude-Damping Codes Beyond Binomial Schemes
Authors: En-Jui Chang
Abstract: We introduce two new families of bosonic quantum error correction (QEC) codes to address collective coherent and amplitude-damping errors, building upon our previous multi-qubit QEC codes. These new bosonic codes enhance existing binomial codes for oscillators and permutation-invariant codes for qubits by reducing the required excitations per input qubit from linear to sub-linear growth. The mappings from multi-qubit stabilizer codes to bosonic codes establish a bridge between QEC code construction for qubits and oscillators, offering a unified approach to error correction across different quantum systems.

Title: Tensor decomposition technique for qubit encoding of maximal-fidelity Lorentzian orbitals in real-space quantum chemistry
Authors: Taichi Kosugi, Xinchi Huang, Hirofumi Nishi, Yu-ichiro Matsushita
Abstract: To simulate the real- and imaginary-time evolution of a many-electron system on a quantum computer based on the first-quantized formalism, we need to encode molecular orbitals (MOs) into qubit states for typical initial-state preparation. We propose an efficient scheme for encoding an MO as a many-qubit state from a Gaussian-type solution that can be obtained from a tractable solver on a classical computer. We employ the discrete Lorentzian functions (LFs) as a fitting basis set, for which we maximize the fidelity to find the optimal Tucker-form state to represent a target MO. For $n_{\mathrm{prod}}$ three-dimensional LFs, we provide the explicit circuit construction for the state preparation involving $\mathcal{O} (n_{\mathrm{prod}})$ CNOT gates. Furthermore, we introduce a tensor decomposition technique to construct a canonical-form state to approximate the Tucker-form state with controllable accuracy. Rank-$R$ decomposition reduces the CNOT gate count to $\mathcal{O} (R n_{\mathrm{prod}}^{1/3}).$ We demonstrate via numerical simulations that the proposed scheme is a powerful tool for encoding MOs of various quantum chemical systems, paving the way for first-quantized calculations using hundreds or more logical qubits.

Title: Non-Markovian dynamics of collectively-encoded qubits

Abstract: Collectively-encoded qubits, involving ensembles of atomic or solid-state emitters, present many practical advantages for quantum technologies. However, they suffer from uncontrolled inhomogeneous dephasing which couples them to a quasi-continuum of dark states. In most cases, this process cannot be encompassed in a standard master equation with time-independent coefficients, making its description either tedious or inaccurate. We show that it can be understood as a displacement in time-frequency phase space and accurately included in resource-efficient numerical simulations of the qubit's dynamics. This description unveils a regime where the qubit becomes protected from dephasing through a combination of strong driving and non-Markovianity. We experimentally investigate this regime using a Rydberg superatom and extend its coherent dynamics beyond the inhomogeneous-dephasing characteristic time by an order of magnitude.

Title: Characterization of Entanglement in Higher Dimensional Bipartite as well as Multipartite Quantum System and its Application
Authors: Shruti Aggarwal
Abstract: In recent years considerable progress has been made towards developing a general theory of quantum entanglement. In particular, criteria to decide whether a given quantum state is entangled are of high theoretical and practical interest. This problem is additionally complicated by the existence of bound entanglement, which are weak entangled states and hard to detect. In this thesis, we have worked on the characterization of bipartite and tripartite entanglement. We have established a few separability criteria that successfully detect Negative Partial Transpose (NPT) as well as Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) entangled states. Although the topic of detection of entanglement has been extensively studied in the literature through many approaches, the majority of these criteria are not physically realizable. This means that they are well accepted in the mathematical language but cannot be implemented in a laboratory setting. In this thesis, we propose some theoretical ideas to realize these entanglement detection criteria experimentally.

Title: Multipartite quantum correlated bright frequency combs

Abstract: This experimental work demonstrates multipartite quantum correlation in bright frequency combs out of a microresonator integrated on silicon nitride working above its oscillation threshold. Multipartite features, going beyond so far reported two-mode correlation, naturally arise due to a cascade of non-linear optical processes, making a single-color laser pump sufficient to initiate their generation. Our results show the transition from two-mode to multipartite correlation, witnessed by noise reductions as low as $-2.5$\,dB and $-2$\,dB, respectively, compared to corresponding classical levels. A constant of the movement of the non-linear interaction Hamiltonian is identified and used to asses the multipartite behavior. Reported demonstrations pave the way to next generation on-chip multipartite sources for quantum technologies applications.

Title: Selective band interaction and long-range hopping in a structured environment with giant atoms
Authors: Ying Xia, Jia-Qi Li, Xin Wang
Abstract: Giant atoms, which couple to the environment at multiple discrete points, exhibit various nontrivial phenomena in quantum optics due to their nonlocal couplings. In this study, we propose a one-dimensional cross-stitch ladder lattice featuring both a dispersive band and a flat band. By modulating the relative phase between the coupling points, the giant atom selectively interacts with either band. First, we analyze the scenario where the dispersive and flat bands intersect at two points, and the atomic frequency lies within the band. Unlike the small atom, which simultaneously interacts with both bands, a single giant atom with a controllable phase interacts exclusively with the dispersive or flat band. Second, in the bandgap regime, where two atoms interact through bound-state overlaps manifesting as dipole-dipole interactions, we demonstrate that giant atoms enable deterministic long-range hopping and energy exchange with higher fidelity compared to small atoms. These findings provide promising applications in quantum information processing, offering enhanced controllability and selectivity for quantum systems and devices.

Title: A Multiplexed Programmable Quantum Photonic Network
Authors: Natalia Herrera Valencia, Annameng Ma, Suraj Goel, Saroch Leedumrongwatthanakun, Francesco Graffitti, Alessandro Fedrizzi, Will McCutcheon, Mehul Malik
Abstract: Entanglement distribution in quantum networks will enable next-generation technologies for quantum-secured communications, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Future quantum networks will require dense connectivity, allowing multiple parties to share entangled states in a reconfigurable manner, while long-distance connections are established through the teleportation of entangled states, namely entanglement swapping. However, developing flexible physical platforms that can distribute entanglement through a high-capacity and scalable architecture remains a significant challenge. Here we realise a multiplexed programmable network where entanglement is routed and teleported between four parties through a reconfigurable multi-port circuit operating on the transverse-spatial photonic degree-of-freedom. We harness the natural mode-mixing process inside a multi-mode fibre and place it between two programmable phase planes to implement high-dimensional operations for two independent photons carrying eight transverse-spatial modes. This complex-medium-based circuit allows for the control of a four-party state where high-fidelity entangled states can be simultaneously distributed over multiple channels with different on-demand configurations. Our design allows us to break away from the limited planar geometry and bypass the control and fabrication challenges of conventional integrated platforms. Our demonstration showcases the potential of this architecture for enabling quantum networks with scalable and versatile connectivity that is fully compatible with existing communications infrastructure.

Title: Estimating quantum relative entropies on quantum computers
Authors: Yuchen Lu, Kun Fang
Abstract: Quantum relative entropy, a quantum generalization of the well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence, serves as a fundamental measure of the distinguishability between quantum states and plays a pivotal role in quantum information science. Despite its importance, efficiently estimating quantum relative entropy between two quantum states on quantum computers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose the first quantum algorithm for estimating quantum relative entropy and Petz Rényi divergence from two unknown quantum states on quantum computers, addressing open problems highlighted in [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032431 (2024)] and [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 70, 5653-5680 (2024)]. This is achieved by combining quadrature approximations of relative entropies, the variational representation of quantum f-divergences, and a new technique for parameterizing Hermitian polynomial operators to estimate their traces with quantum states. Notably, the circuit size of our algorithm is at most 2n+1 with n being the number of qubits in the quantum states and it is directly applicable to distributed scenarios, where quantum states to be compared are hosted on cross-platform quantum computers. We validate our algorithm through numerical simulations, laying the groundwork for its future deployment on quantum hardware devices.

Title: Secure quantum bit commtiment from separable operations
Authors: Ziad Chaoui, Anna Pappa, Matteo Rosati
Abstract: Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive and a cornerstone for numerous two-party cryptographic protocols, including zero-knowledge proofs. However, it has been proven that unconditionally secure bit commitment, both classical and quantum, is impossible. In this work, we demonstrate that imposing a restriction on the committing party to perform only separable operations enables secure quantum bit commitment schemes. Specifically, we prove that in any perfectly hiding bit commitment protocol, an honestly-committing party limited to separable operations will be detected with high probability if they attempt to alter their commitment. To illustrate our findings, we present an example protocol.

Title: Enhancing the sensitivity of single microwave photon detection with bandwidth tunability
Authors: Louis Pallegoix, Jaime Travesedo, Alexandre S. May, Léo Balembois, Denis Vion, Patrice Bertet, Emmanuel Flurin
Abstract: We report on the characteristics of a microwave photon counter device based on a superconducting transmon qubit. Its design is similar to [arXiv:2307.03614], with an additional bandwidth tuning circuit that allows optimizing the device efficiency and noise. Owing to this new feature and to improvements in device fabrication, a power sensitivity of $3 \cdot 10^{-23} \mathrm{W}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ is reached. We confirm the high performance of the device by measuring single spin microwave fluorescence.

Title: High-efficiency, high-count-rate 2D superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array
Authors: Fiona Fleming, Will McCutcheon, Emma E. Wollman, Andrew D. Beyer, Vikas Anant, Boris Korzh, Jason P. Allmaras, Lautaro Narváez, Saroch Leedumrongwatthanakun, Gerald S. Buller, Mehul Malik, Matthew D. Shaw
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are the current leading technology for the detection of single-photons in the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions, due to record performance in terms of detection efficiency, low dark count rate, minimal timing jitter, and high maximum count rates. The various geometry and design parameters of SNSPDs are often carefully tailored to specific applications, resulting in challenges in optimising each performance characteristic without adversely impacting others. In particular, when scaling to larger array formats, the key challenge is to manage the heat load generated by the many readout cables in the cryogenic cooling system. Here we demonstrate a practical, self-contained 64-pixel SNSPD array system which exhibits high performance of all operational parameters, for use in the strategically important SWIR spectral region. The detector is an 8x8 array of 27.5 x 27.8 {\mu}m pixels on a 30 {\mu}m pitch, which leads to an 80 -- 85% fill factor. At a wavelength of 1550nm, a uniform average per-pixel photon detection efficiency of 77.7% was measured and the observed system detection efficiency (SDE) across the entire array was 65%. A full performance characterisation is presented, including a dark count rate of 20 cps per pixel, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) jitter of 100 ps per pixel, a 3-dB maximum count rate of 645 Mcps and no evidence of crosstalk at the 0.1% level. This camera system therefore facilitates a variety of picosecond time-resolved measurement-based applications that include biomedical imaging, quantum communications, and long-range single-photon light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and 3D imaging.

Title: Efficient Quantum Circuit Compilation for Near-Term Quantum Advantage
Authors: Yuchen Guo, Shuo Yang
Abstract: Quantum noise in real-world devices poses a significant challenge in achieving practical quantum advantage, since accurately compiled and executed circuits are typically deep and highly susceptible to decoherence. To facilitate the implementation of complex quantum algorithms on noisy hardware, we propose an approximate method for compiling target quantum circuits into brick-wall layouts. This new circuit design consists of two-qubit CNOT gates that can be directly implemented on real quantum computers, in conjunction with optimized one-qubit gates, to approximate the essential dynamics of the original circuit while significantly reducing its depth. Our approach is evaluated through numerical simulations of time-evolution circuits for the critical Ising model, quantum Fourier transformation, and Haar-random quantum circuits, as well as experiments on IBM quantum platforms. By accounting for compilation error and circuit noise, we demonstrate that time evolution and quantum Fourier transformation circuits achieve high compression rates, while random quantum circuits are less compressible. The degree of compression is related to the rate of entanglement accumulation in the target circuit. In particular, experiments on IBM platforms achieve a compression rate of $12.5$ for $N=12$, significantly extending the application of current quantum devices. Furthermore, large-scale numerical simulations for system sizes up to $N=30$ reveal that the optimal depth $d_{\mathrm{max}}$ to achieve maximal overall fidelity is independent of system size $N$, suggesting the scalability of our method for large quantum devices in terms of quantum resources.

Title: Reconstruction of quantum states by applying an analytical optimization model
Authors: Rohit Prasad, Pratyay Ghosh, Ronny Thomale, Tobias Huber-Loyola
Abstract: When working with quantum states, analysis of the final quantum state generated through probabilistic measurements is essential. This analysis is typically conducted by constructing the density matrix from either partial or full tomography measurements of the quantum state. While full tomography measurement offers the most accurate reconstruction of the density matrix, limited measurements pose challenges for reconstruction algorithms, often resulting in non-physical density matrices with negative eigenvalues. This is often remedied using maximum likelihood estimators, which have a high computing time or by other estimation methods that decrease the reconstructed fidelity. In this study, we show that when restricting the measurement sample size, improvement over existing algorithms can be achieved. Our findings underline the multiplicity of solutions in the reconstruction problem, depending upon the generated state and measurement model utilized, thus motivating further research towards identifying optimal algorithms tailored to specific experimental contexts.

Title: Characterisation of Open Quantum System Dynamics based on Information Back-flow
Authors: Vijay Pathak, R.Srikanth
Abstract: For unital dynamics, we show that a generalized trace distance measure offers no advantage over the trace distance measure for witnessing non-Markovianity. We determine the class of non-unital channels where the standard trace distance measure is insufficient here and the generalized measure is necessary. Finally, we assess the status of the GTD measure as an indicator of information flow between an open system and its environment.

Title: Equivalence between exponential concentration in quantum machine learning kernels and barren plateaus in variational algorithms
Authors: Pranav Kairon, Jonas Jäger, Roman V. Krems
Abstract: We formalize a rigorous connection between barren plateaus (BP) in variational quantum algorithms and exponential concentration of quantum kernels for machine learning. Our results imply that recently proposed strategies to build BP-free quantum circuits can be utilized to construct useful quantum kernels for machine learning. This is illustrated by a numerical example employing a provably BP-free quantum neural network to construct kernel matrices for classification datasets of increasing dimensionality without exponential concentration.

Title: Topological Operations Around Exceptional Points via Shortcuts to Adiabaticity
Authors: Vishnu Chavva, Hugo Ribeiro
Abstract: The existence of singularities in the spectrum of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians leads to a non-trivial spectral topology which can be exploited to generate topological operations. However, their implementation has remained elusive due to the difficulty of generating a true adiabatic evolution. Here, we develop fast, robust control protocols that generate a desired topological operation. Our strategy relies on shortcuts to adiabaticity, but is not a trivial extension. The presence of spectral singularities renders the strategy developed for Hermitian Hamiltonians impractical as it will lead to faulty control protocols. Moreover, due to the dynamics sensitivity to parameter uncertainties, not all shortcuts to adiabaticity can be used in a realistic setting. We illustrate our method in the context of a two-mode non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and discuss why in general celebrated shortcuts to adiabaticiy like transitionless driving and superadiabatic transitionless driving are not appropriate control protocols for non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Stabilization of quantum properties under intrinsic decoherence in presence of external magnetic fields
Authors: Essalha Chaouki, Anna Sanpera, Mostafa Mansour
Abstract: The dynamical behavior of quantum state properties under intrinsic decoherence models can be modified by the presence of external magnetic fields. Although generically external magnetic fields are detrimental to preserve quantumness in the presence of intrinsic decoherence, judicious adjustment of the magnetic field can stabilize such features. This stabilization arises from novel resonances between energy eigenstates resulting from the presence of an external magnetic field. Here, we present our findings using as a model system two spin 1-particles confined in a double-well potential under intrinsic decoherence. We stress, however, that our results are generic and independent on the used model.

Title: Machine Learning-Enhanced Characterisation of Structured Spectral Densities: Leveraging the Reaction Coordinate Mapping
Authors: Jessica Barr, Alessandro Ferraro, Mauro Paternostro, Giorgio Zicari
Abstract: Spectral densities encode essential information about system-environment interactions in open-quantum systems, playing a pivotal role in shaping the system's dynamics. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to reconstruct key environmental features, going beyond the weak-coupling regime by simulating the system's dynamics using the reaction coordinate mapping. For a dissipative spin-boson model with a structured spectral density expressed as a sum of Lorentzian peaks, we demonstrate that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by a neural network to classify the spectral density as comprising one, two, or three Lorentzian peaks and accurately predict their central frequency.

Title: Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase
Authors: Benedikt M. Reible, Ana Djurdjevac, Luigi Delle Site
Abstract: Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.

Title: Dynamics in an emergent quantum-like state space generated by a nonlinear classical network
Authors: Gregory D. Scholes
Abstract: This work exploits a framework whereby a graph (in the mathematical sense) serves to connect a classical system to a state space that we call `quantum-like' (QL). The QL states comprise arbitrary superpositions of states in a tensor product basis. The graph plays a special dual role by directing design of the classical system and defining the state space. We study a specific example of a large, dynamical classical system -- a system of coupled phase oscillators -- that maps, via a graph, to the QL state space. We investigate how mixedness of the state diminishes or increases as the underlying classical system synchronizes or de-synchronizes respectively. This shows the interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of the variables of the classical system and the QL state space. We prove that maps from one time point to another in the state space are linear maps. In the limit of a strongly phase-locked classical network -- that is, where couplings between phase oscillators are very large -- the state space evolves according to unitary dynamics, whereas in the cases of weaker synchronization, the classical variables act as a hidden environment that promotes decoherence of superpositions.

Title: Floquet-engineered system-reservoir interaction in the transverse field Ising model
Authors: Maritza Ahumada, Natalia Valderrama-Quinteros, Guillermo Romero
Abstract: Periodically driving a quantum many-body system can drastically change its properties, leading to exotic non-equilibrium states of matter without a static analog. In this scenario, parametric resonances and the complexity of an interacting many-body system are pivotal in establishing non-equilibrium states. We report on a Floquet-engineered transverse field Ising model for the controlled propagation in one dimension of spin waves. The underlying mechanisms behind our proposal rely on high-frequency drivings using characteristic parametric resonances of the spin lattice. Many-body resonances modulating spin-sping exchange or individual spin gaps inhibit interactions between spins thus proving a mechanism for controlling spin-wave propagation and a quantum switch. Our schemes may have applications in coupling-decoupling schemes for system-reservoir interaction, and routing in quantum networks.

Title: Zero-temperature phase-flip rate in a biased parametric oscillator
Authors: Daniel K. J. Boneß, Mark I. Dykman, Wolfgang Belzig
Abstract: A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.

Title: Charge-transport enhanced by the quantum entanglement in the Photosystem II reaction center
Authors: Ling-Fang Li, Shun-Cai Zhao, Lu-Xin Xu
Abstract: Revealing the role of quantum entanglement in charge-transport in the Photosystem II reaction center (PSII RC) is of great significance. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that the robust quantum entanglement provides regulatory benefits to the charge-transport via a quantum heat engine (QHE) model with two absorbed photon channels. The calculation results manifest that the dynamic charge-transport and the steady-state photosynthetic properties of the PSII RC were enhanced by the intensity of quantum entanglement. Insight into the role of quantum entanglement in photosynthesis could motivate new experimental strategies for biomimetic photosynthetic devices in the future.

Title: Influence of the coupled-dipoles on photosynthetic performance in a photosynthetic quantum heat engine
Authors: Ling-Fang Li, Shun-Cai Zhao
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that the multi charge-separation pathways can contribute to the photosynthetic performance. In this work, the influence of coupled-dipoles on the photosynthetic performance was investigated in a two-charge separation pathways quantum heat engine (QHE) model. And the population dynamics of the two coupled sites, j-V characteristics and power involving this photosynthetic QHE model were evaluated for the photosynthetic performance. The results illustrate that the photosynthetic performance can be greatly enhanced but quantum interference was deactivated by the coupled-dipoles between the two-charge separation pathways. However, the photosynthetic performance can also be promoted by the deactivated quantum interference owing to the coupled-dipoles. It is a novel role of the coupled-dipoles in the energy transport process of biological photosynthetic and some artificial strategies may be motivated by this photosynthetic QHE model in the future.

Title: Enhancing energy transport utilising permanent molecular dipoles
Authors: Adam Burgess, Erik Gauger
Abstract: We study exciton quantum transfer along a molecular chain whilst accounting for the effects of permanent dipoles that are induced by charge displacements in the molecular orbitals. These effects are typically neglected as they do not arise in atomic quantum optics; however, they can play an important role in molecular systems. We also consider novel collective photon-assisted transport and compare it against the scaling of phonon-assisted transport in chains featuring permanent dipoles, and determine a linear scaling with the number of dipoles, akin to single-excitation superradiance. We further demonstrate how permanent dipoles, dipoles can preferentially arrange energy eigenstates to support excitation transport. Finally, we show how permanent dipoles can enhance the ability of the molecular chain to support excitation transport compared to that of systems that do not possess permanent dipoles across a range of environmental and system configurations.

Title: Tensorization of neural networks for improved privacy and interpretability
Authors: José Ramón Pareja Monturiol, Alejandro Pozas-Kerstjens, David Pérez-García
Abstract: We present a tensorization algorithm for constructing tensor train representations of functions, drawing on sketching and cross interpolation ideas. The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the tensor train representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing tensor trains in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.

Title: Coherent dynamics of flavor mode entangled neutrinos
Authors: Ashutosh Kumar Alok, Massimo Blasone, Trambak Jyoti Chall, Neetu Raj Singh Chundawat, Gaetano Lambiase
Abstract: As the lynchpin of all quantum correlations, quantum coherence is fundamental for distinguishing quantum systems from classical ones and is essential for realizing quantum advantages in areas such as computation, communication, and metrology. In this study, we investigate the relationship between quantum coherence and neutrino oscillations by mapping the neutrino state as a multi-mode quantum system into qubit and qutrit frameworks. Our analysis extends beyond the commonly used $l_1$-norm and relative entropy of coherence to include all relevant measures of coherence such as robustness of coherence, coherence concurrence, trace-norm distance measure of coherence, coherence of formation, Schatten-$p$-norm-based functionals, geometric coherence and logarithmic coherence rank, each offering unique insights into the quantum correlations in these systems. Notably, while the $l_1$-norm and relative entropy-based measures apply to general quantum states, the other measures are particularly relevant for entangled systems, highlighting the critical role of entanglement in neutrino oscillations. We present a detailed methodology for calculating coherence measures in both two-flavor and three-flavor mixing scenarios, contributing to a deeper understanding of how quantum coherence manifests and evolves in mode-entangled neutrino systems. Our findings emphasize the potential of these systems as robust candidates for quantum information tasks, facilitated by the weak interaction nature of neutrinos.

Title: The Instantaneous Breit Equation with an Application to Charmonium
Authors: Walter S. Jaronski
Abstract: The solution of the Breit equation with an instantaneous potential for the case of two spin-1/2 particles in a pseudoscalar bound state is considered. This is then applied to charmonium using a potential of the Cornell type. The masses of the two JP = 0^- states below charm threshold are calculated in this model. We allow different mixtures of the Lorentz nature (vector or scalar) of the linear confining term and investigate the effect of these on the bound-state energies. Some general comments are made on the issue of how the bound nature of these states depends on the vector-scalar mix.

Title: Heat Conduction and Thermal Switching Performance of Surface Plasmon Polaritons in Ag2Se Quantum Dot Composite Polymer Film
Authors: Congliang Huang, Changkang Du, Qiangqiang Huang, Xiaodong Wang
Abstract: To stabilize the working temperature of an equipment, a solid-state thermal resistor is usually a requisite, which could adjust its heat conductance continuously according to the temperature. In this work, the thermal conductivity and the thermal switching performances of surface plasmon polaritons in the polymer films filled with Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) were theoretically analyzed, and a theoretical model was also derived to reveal the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the temperature and the structure of a composite film, which is verified to be effective by numerical calculations. It shows that the thermal conductivity will decrease following ~t-3exp({\zeta}/Td) rule under the thin film limit, here t, d and T are film thickness, diameter of QDs and temperature, respectively, and {\zeta} is a constant. A high thermal conductivity could be only realized at a device with a size lager than millimeter scale, due to the need of avoiding boundary scatterings of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). At the millimeter scale, the thermal conductivity could be reduced by 100 times by increasing temperature from 300 to 400 K, which suggests a very high thermal switching ratio almost in all kinds of solid-state thermal resistor. This study brings new insights in designing thermal resistor and understanding heat conduction in films by adjusting its structures.

Title: Unveiling Code Clones in Quantum Programming: An Empirical Study with Qiskit
Authors: Kenta Manoku, Jianjun Zhao
Abstract: Code clones, referring to identical or similar code fragments, have long posed challenges in classical programming, impacting software quality, maintainability, and scalability. However, their presence and characteristics in quantum programming remain unexplored. This paper presents an empirical study of code clones in quantum programs, specifically focusing on software developed using the Qiskit framework. We examine the existence, distribution, density, and size of code clones in quantum software, revealing a high density of Type-2 and Type-3 clones involving minor modifications. Our findings suggest that these clones are more frequent in quantum software, likely due to the complexity of quantum algorithms and their integration with classical logic. This highlights the need for advanced clone detection and refactoring tools specifically designed for the quantum domain to improve software maintainability and scalability.

Title: Quantum Testing in the Wild: A Case Study with Qiskit Algorithms
Authors: Neilson Carlos Leite Ramalho, Erico Augusto da Silva, Higor Amario de Souza, Marcos Lordello Chaim
Abstract: Although classical computing has excelled in a wide range of applications, there remain problems that push the limits of its capabilities, especially in fields like cryptography, optimization, and materials science. Quantum computing introduces a new computational paradigm, based on principles of superposition and entanglement to explore solutions beyond the capabilities of classical computation. With the increasing interest in the field, there are challenges and opportunities for academics and practitioners in terms of software engineering practices, particularly in testing quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of testing patterns in quantum algorithms. We analyzed all the tests handling quantum aspects of the implementations in the Qiskit Algorithms library and identified seven distinct patterns that make use of (1) fixed seeds for algorithms based on random elements; (2) deterministic oracles; (3) precise and approximate assertions; (4) Data-Driven Testing (DDT); (5) functional testing; (6) testing for intermediate parts of the algorithms being tested; and (7) equivalence checking for quantum circuits. Our results show a prevalence of classical testing techniques to test the quantum-related elements of the library, while recent advances from the research community have yet to achieve wide adoption among practitioners.

Title: Fermion as a non-local particle-hole excitation
Authors: Alok Kushwaha, Rishi Paresh Joshi, Girish Sampath Setlur
Abstract: We show that the fermion, in the context of a system that comprises many such entities - which, by virtue of the Pauli exclusion principle, possesses a Fermi surface at zero temperature - may itself be thought of as a collection of non-local particle-hole excitations across this Fermi surface. This result is purely kinematical and completely general - not being restricted to any specific dimension, applicable to both continuum and lattice systems. There is also no implication that it is applicable only to low-energy phenomena close to the Fermi surface. We are able to derive the full single-particle dynamical Green function of this fermion at finite temperature by viewing it as a collection of these non-local particle-hole excitations. The Green function of the fermion then manifests itself as a solution to a first-order differential equation in a parameter that controls the number of particle-hole pairs across the Fermi surface, and this equation itself reveals variable coefficients that may be identified with a Bose-Einstein distribution - implying that there is a sense in which the non-local particle-hole excitations have bosonic qualities while not being exact bosons at the level of operators. We also recall the definition of the non-local particle-hole operator that may be used to diagonalize the kinetic energy of free fermions of the sort mentioned above. Number-conserving products of creation and annihilation operators of fermions are expressible as a (rather complicated) combination of these non-local particle-hole operators.

Title: PT-Symmetric $SU(2)$-like Random Matrix Ensembles: Invariant Distributions and Spectral Fluctuations
Authors: Stalin Abraham, A. Bhagwat, Sudhir Ranjan Jain
Abstract: We consider an ensemble of $2\times 2$ normal matrices with complex entries representing operators in the quantum mechanics of 2 - level parity-time reversal (PT) symmetric systems. The randomness of the ensemble is endowed by obtaining probability distributions based on symmetry and statistical independence. The probability densities turn out to be power law with exponents that depend on the boundedness of the domain. For small spacings, $\sigma$, the probability density varies as $\sigma^{\nu}$, $\nu \geq 2$. The degree of level repulsion is a parameter of great interest as it makes a connection to quantum chaos; the lower bound of $\nu$ for our ensemble coincides with the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. We believe that the systematic development presented here paves the way for further generalizations in the field of random matrix theory for PT-symmetric quantum systems.

Title: The role of antisymmetric orbitals and electron-electron interactions on the two-particle spin and valley blockade in graphene double quantum dots
Authors: Samuel Möller, Luca Banszerus, Katrin Hecker, Hubert Dulisch, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Christian Volk, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: We report on an experimental study of spin and valley blockade in two-electron bilayer graphene (BLG) double quantum dots (DQDs) and explore the limits set by asymmetric orbitals and electronelectron interactions. The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.

Title: Quantum Data Sketches
Authors: Qin Zhang, Mohsen Heidari
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum technologies, particularly in quantum sensing and simulation, have facilitated the generation and analysis of inherently quantum data. This progress underscores the necessity for developing efficient and scalable quantum data management strategies. This goal faces immense challenges due to the exponential dimensionality of quantum data and its unique quantum properties such as no-cloning and measurement stochasticity. Specifically, classical storage and manipulation of an arbitrary n-qubit quantum state requires exponential space and time. Hence, there is a critical need to revisit foundational data management concepts and algorithms for quantum data. In this paper, we propose succinct quantum data sketches to support basic database operations such as search and selection. We view our work as an initial step towards the development of quantum data management model, opening up many possibilities for future research in this direction.

Title: Black-box optimization and quantum annealing for filtering out mislabeled training instances
Authors: Makoto Otsuka, Kento Kodama, Keisuke Morita, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.

Authors: Zebo Yang, Ali Ghubaish, Raj Jain, Ala Al-Fuqaha, Aiman Erbad, Ramana Kompella, Hassan Shapourian, Reza Nejabati
Abstract: With its significant security potential, the quantum internet is poised to revolutionize technologies like cryptography and communications. Although it boasts enhanced security over traditional networks, the quantum internet still encounters unique security challenges essential for safeguarding its Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). This study explores these challenges by analyzing the vulnerabilities and the corresponding mitigation strategies across different layers of the quantum internet, including physical, link, network, and application layers. We assess the severity of potential attacks, evaluate the expected effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and identify vulnerabilities within diverse network configurations, integrating both classical and quantum approaches. Our research highlights the dynamic nature of these security issues and emphasizes the necessity for adaptive security measures. The findings underline the need for ongoing research into the security dimension of the quantum internet to ensure its robustness, encourage its adoption, and maximize its impact on society.

Title: Exact density profile in a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise
Authors: Taiki Ishiyama, Fujimoto Kazuya, Tomohiro Sasamoto
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the many-body dynamics of a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on the infinite interval. We obtain the exact solution of an average particle-density profile for the domain wall and the alternating initial conditions via the Bethe ansatz, analytically deriving the asymptotic expressions for the long time dynamics. For the domain wall initial condition, we obtain the scaling form of the average density, elucidating that the diffusive transport always emerges in the long time dynamics if the strength of the dephasing, no matter how small, is positive. For the alternating initial condition, our exact solution leads to the fact that the average density displays oscillatory decay or over-damped decay depending on the strength of the dissipation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic forms approach those of the symmetric simple exclusion process, identifying corrections from it.

Title: State-space reduction techniques exploiting specific constraints for quantum search Application to a specific job scheduling problem
Authors: Rodolphe Griset (EDF R&amp;D), Ioannis Lavdas, Jiri Guth Jarkovsky
Abstract: Quantum search has emerged as one of the most promising fields in quantum computing. State-of-the-art quantum search algorithms enable the search for specific elements in a distribution by monotonically increasing the density of these elements until reaching a high density. This kind of algorithms demonstrate a theoretical quadratic speed-up on the number of queries compared to classical search algorithms in unstructured spaces. Unfortunately, the major part of the existing literature applies quantum search to problems which size grows exponnentialy with the input size without exploiting any specific problem structure, rendering this kind of approach not exploitable in real industrial problems. In contrast, this work proposes exploiting specific constraints of scheduling problems to build an initial superposition of states with size almost quadraticaly increasing as a function of the problem size. This state space reduction, inspired by the quantum walk algorithm, constructs a state superposition corresponding to all paths in a state-graph embedding spacing constraints between jobs. Our numerical results on quantum emulators highlights the potential of state space reduction approach, which could lead to more efficient quantum search processes by focusing on a smaller, more relevant, solution space.

Title: Exposing a Fatal Flaw in Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization Methods
Authors: Peter Reinholdt, Karl Michael Ziems, Erik Rosendahl Kjellgren, Sonia Coriani, Stephan P. A. Sauer, Jacob Kongsted
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schrödinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we show that QSCI methods face fundamental limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality CI expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a fatal flaw in QSCI methods as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis: A Short Review
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli
Abstract: Understanding how an isolated quantum system evolves toward a thermal state from an initial state far from equilibrium such as one prepared by a global quantum quench has attracted significant interest in recent years. This phenomenon can be elucidated through the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), which has had a profound impact across various fields, from high-energy physics to condensed matter physics. The purpose of this review article is to present the fundamental concepts of quantum equilibrium and the ETH to a broad audience within the physics community, particularly for those in high-energy physics who seek a comprehensive understanding of these important topics.

Title: Second quantization for classical nonlinear dynamics
Authors: Dimitrios Giannakis, Mohammad Javad Latifi Jebelli, Michael Montgomerry, Philipp Pfeffer, Jörg Schumacher, Joanna Slawinska
Abstract: Using techniques from many-body quantum theory, we propose a framework for representing the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic flows through infinite-dimensional rotation systems on tori. This approach is based on a class of weighted Fock spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by a 1-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H_\tau$, and endowed with commutative Banach algebra structure under the symmetric tensor product using a subconvolutive weight $w$. We describe the construction of the spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ and show that their Banach algebra spectra, $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$, decompose into a family of tori of potentially infinite dimension. Spectrally consistent unitary approximations $U^t_\tau$ of the Koopman operator acting on $\mathcal H_\tau$ are then lifted to rotation systems on these tori akin to the topological models of ergodic systems with pure point spectra in the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. Our scheme also employs a procedure for representing observables of the original system by polynomial functions on finite-dimensional tori in $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$ of arbitrarily large degree, with coefficients determined from pointwise products of eigenfunctions of $U^t_\tau$. This leads to models for the Koopman evolution of observables on $L^2$ built from tensor products of finite collections of approximate Koopman eigenfunctions. Numerically, the scheme is amenable to consistent data-driven implementation using kernel methods. We illustrate it with applications to Stepanoff flows on the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system. Connections with quantum computing are also discussed.

Title: Robust M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate for neutral atoms using rapid adiabatic Rydberg dressing
Authors: Anupam Mitra, Michael J. Martin, Grant W. Biedermann, Alberto M. Marino, Pablo M. Poggi, Ivan H. Deutsch
Abstract: The Rydberg blockade mechanism is now routinely considered for entangling qubits encoded in clock states of neutral atoms. Challenges towards implementing entangling gates with high fidelity include errors due to thermal motion of atoms, laser amplitude inhomogeneities, and imperfect Rydberg blockade. We show that adiabatic rapid passage by Rydberg dressing provides a mechanism for implementing two-qubit entangling gates by accumulating phases that are robust to these imperfections. We find that the typical error in implementing a two-qubit gate, such as the controlled phase gate, is dominated by errors in the single atom light shift, and that this can be easily corrected using adiabatic dressing interleaved with a simple spin echo sequence. This results in a two-qubit Mølmer-Sørenson gate. A gate fidelity $\sim 0.995$ is achieveable with modest experimental parameters and a path to higher fidelities is possible for Rydberg states in atoms with a stronger blockade, longer lifetimes, and larger Rabi frequencies.

Title: Bipartite polygon models: entanglement classes and their nonlocal behaviour
Authors: Mayalakshmi Kolangatt, Thigazholi Muruganandan, Sahil Gopalkrishna Naik, Tamal Guha, Manik Banik, Sutapa Saha
Abstract: Hardy's argument constitutes an elegantly logical test for identifying nonlocal features of multipartite correlations. In this paper, we investigate Hardy's nonlocal behavior within a broad class of operational theories, including the qubit state space as a specific case. Specifically, we begin by examining a wider range of operational models with state space descriptions in the form of regular polygons. First, we present a systematic method to characterize the possible forms of entangled states within bipartite compositions of these models. Then, through explicit examples, we identify the classes of entangled states that exhibit Hardy-type nonlocality. Remarkably, our findings highlight a closer analogy between odd polygon models and the qubit state space in terms of their bipartite Hardy nonlocal behavior compared to even-sided polygons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the emergence of mixed-state Hardy nonlocality in any operational model is determined by a specific symmetry inherent in its dynamic description. Finally, our results uncover an unexplored class of almost-quantum correlations that can be associated with an explicit operational model.

Title: Can QBism exist without Q? Morphophoric measurements in generalised probabilistic theories
Authors: Anna Szymusiak, Wojciech Słomczyński
Abstract: In a Generalised Probabilistic Theory (GPT) equipped additionally with some extra geometric structure we define the morphophoric measurements as those for which the measurement map sending states to distributions of the measurement results is a similarity. In the quantum case, morphophoric measurements generalise the notion of a 2-design POVM, thus in particular that of a SIC-POVM. We show that the theory built on this class of measurements retains the chief features of the QBism approach to the basis of quantum mechanics. In particular, we demonstrate how to extend the primal equation ('Urgleichung') of QBism, designed for SIC-POVMs, to the morphophoric case of GPTs. In the latter setting, the equation takes a different, albeit more symmetric, form, but all the quantities that appear in it can be interpreted in probabilistic and operational terms, as in the original 'Urgleichung'.

Title: Transient effects in quantum refrigerators with finite environments
Authors: Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Ahana Ghoshal, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: We explore a small quantum refrigerator consisting of three qubits, each of which is kept in contact with an environment. We consider two settings: one is when there is necessarily transient cooling and the other is when both steady-state and transient coolings prevail. Our primary focus, however, is on the transient cooling phenomena. We show that in the transient regime, the temperature of the cold qubit can decrease further compared to the case where all qubits are connected to Markovian environments, by replacing the environment attached to the cold qubit with a finite-size spin environment, modeled by a few quantum spins interacting with the cold qubit. We also consider refrigeration with more than one finite-size spin environments of the three-qubit refrigerating device. As expected, a steady temperature is reached only if there are at least two Markovian baths, regardless of whether the cold qubit is attached to an environment. We investigate the effects of the finite-size environments on the cooling of the cold qubit when one, two, or all Markovian baths are replaced by finite-size environments. Additionally, we examine this effect in two- and single-qubit self-sustained devices connected to one or more finite-size environments. In deriving the dynamical equations for the qubits connected to finite-size environments, we made no assumptions about the Markovian nature of the environment. As a result, these finite-size environments inherently exhibit information backflow from the environment to the system, a hallmark of non-Markovianity. Hence, we propose a witness to detect non-Markovianity in such systems. Finally, the cooling processes are studied in presence of Markovian noise, and we analyse the response on the refrigeration of the noise strength. In particular, we find the noise strength until which refrigeration remains possible.

Title: Validation of a noisy Gaussian boson sampler via graph theory
Authors: Denis Stanev, Taira Giordani, Nicolò Spagnolo, Fabio Sciarrino
Abstract: Quantum photonic processors are emerging as promising platforms to prove preliminary evidence of quantum computational advantage towards the realization of universal quantum computers. In the context of non-universal noisy intermediate quantum devices, photonic-based sampling machines solving the Gaussian Boson Sampling problem currently play a central role in the experimental demonstration of a quantum computational advantage. In particular, the recently developed photonic machine Borealis, a large-scale instance of a programmable Gaussian Boson Sampling device encoded in the temporal modes of single photons, is available online for external users. In this work, we test the performances of Borealis as a sampling machine and its possible use cases in graph theory. We focused on the validation problem of the sampling process in the presence of experimental noise, such as photon losses, that could undermine the hardness of simulating the experiment. To this end, we used a recent protocol that exploits the connection between Guassian Boson Sampling and graphs perfect match counting. Such an approach to validation also provides connections with the open question on the effective advantage in using noisy Gaussian Boson Sampling devices for graphs similarity and isomorphism problems.

Title: Response to "The measurement postulates of quantum mechanics are not redundant"
Authors: Lluís Masanes, Thomas D. Galley, Markus P. Müller
Abstract: Adrian Kent has recently presented a critique [arXiv:2307.06191] of our paper [Nat. Comms. 10, 1361 (2019)] in which he claims to refute our main result: the measurement postulates of quantum mechanics can be derived from the rest of postulates, once we assume that the set of mixed states of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space is finite-dimensional. To construct his argument, Kent considers theories resulting from supplementing quantum mechanics with hypothetical "post-quantum" measurement devices. We prove that each of these theories contains pure states (i.e. states of maximal knowledge) which are not rays of the Hilbert space, in contradiction with the "pure state postulate" of quantum mechanics. We also prove that these alternatives violate the finite-dimensionality of mixed states. Each of these two facts separately invalidates the refutation. In this note we also clarify the assumptions used in [Nat. Comms. 10, 1361 (2019)] and discuss the notions of pure state, physical system, and the sensitivity of the structure of the state space under modifications of the measurements or the dynamics.

Title: Macroproperties vs. Microstates in the Classical Simulation of Critical Phenomena in Quench Dynamics of 1D Ising Models
Authors: Anupam Mitra, Tameem Albash, Philip Daniel Blocher, Jun Takahashi, Akimasa Miyake, Grant W. Biedermann, Ivan H. Deutsch
Abstract: We study the tractability of classically simulating critical phenomena in the quench dynamics of one-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIMs) using highly truncated matrix product states (MPS). We focus on two paradigmatic examples: a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) that occurs in nonintegrable long-range TFIMs, and the infinite-time correlation length of the integrable nearest-neighbor TFIM when quenched to the critical point. For the DQPT, we show that the order parameters can be efficiently simulated with surprisingly heavy truncation of the MPS bond dimension. This can be used to reliably extract critical properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, even when the full many-body state is not simulated with high fidelity. The long-time correlation length near the critical point is more sensitive to the full many-body state fidelity, and generally requires a large bond dimension MPS. Nonetheless, we find that this can still be efficiently simulated with strongly truncated MPS because it can be extracted from the short-time behavior of the dynamics where entanglement is low. Our results demonstrate that while accurate calculation of the full many-body state (microstate) is typically intractable due to the volume-law growth of entanglement, a precise specification of an exact microstate may not be required when simulating phases of matter of many-body systems (macrostates). We also study the tractability of simulation using truncated MPS based on quantum chaos and equilibration in the models. We find a counterintuitive inverse relationship, whereby local expectation values are most easily approximated for chaotic systems whose exact many-body state is most intractable.

Title: Generalized quantum data-syndrome codes and belief propagation decoding for phenomenological noise
Authors: Kao-Yueh Kuo, Ching-Yi Lai
Abstract: Quantum stabilizer codes often struggle with syndrome errors due to measurement imperfections. Typically, multiple rounds of syndrome extraction are employed to ensure reliable error information. In this paper, we consider phenomenological decoding problems, where data qubit errors may occur between extractions, and each measurement can be faulty. We introduce generalized quantum data-syndrome codes along with a generalized check matrix that integrates both quaternary and binary alphabets to represent diverse error sources. This results in a Tanner graph with mixed variable nodes, enabling the design of belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithms that effectively handle phenomenological errors. Importantly, our BP decoders are applicable to general sparse quantum codes. Through simulations, we achieve an error threshold of more than 3\% for quantum memory protected by rotated toric codes, using solely BP without post-processing. Our results indicate that $d$ rounds of syndrome extraction are sufficient for a toric code of distance $d$. We observe that at high error rates, fewer rounds of syndrome extraction tend to perform better, while more rounds improve performance at lower error rates. Additionally, we propose a method to construct effective redundant stabilizer checks for single-shot error correction. Our simulations show that BP decoding remains highly effective even with a high syndrome error rate.

Title: Finding eigenvectors with a quantum variational algorithm
Authors: Juan Carlos Garcia-Escartin
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid variational quantum algorithm that finds a random eigenvector of a unitary matrix with a known quantum circuit. The algorithm is based on the SWAP test on trial states generated by a parametrized quantum circuit. The eigenvector is described by a compact set of classical parameters that can be used to reproduce the found approximation to the eigenstate on demand. This variational eigenvector finder can be adapted to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem, to find the eigenvectors of normal matrices and to perform quantum principal component analysis (QPCA) on unknown input mixed states. These algorithms can all be run with low depth quantum circuits, suitable for an efficient implementation on noisy intermediate state quantum computers (NISQC) and, with some restrictions, on linear optical systems. Limitations and potential applications are discussed.

Title: Efficient Learning of Long-Range and Equivariant Quantum Systems
Authors: Štěpán Šmíd, Roberto Bondesan
Abstract: In this work, we consider a fundamental task in quantum many-body physics - finding and learning ground states of quantum Hamiltonians and their properties. Recent works have studied the task of predicting the ground state expectation value of sums of geometrically local observables by learning from data. For short-range gapped Hamiltonians, a sample complexity that is logarithmic in the number of qubits and quasipolynomial in the error was obtained. Here we extend these results beyond the local requirements on both Hamiltonians and observables, motivated by the relevance of long-range interactions in molecular and atomic systems. For interactions decaying as a power law with exponent greater than twice the dimension of the system, we recover the same efficient logarithmic scaling with respect to the number of qubits, but the dependence on the error worsens to exponential. Further, we show that learning algorithms equivariant under the automorphism group of the interaction hypergraph achieve a sample complexity reduction, leading in particular to a constant number of samples for learning sums of local observables in systems with periodic boundary conditions. We demonstrate the efficient scaling in practice by learning from DMRG simulations of $1$D long-range and disordered systems with up to $128$ qubits. Finally, we provide an analysis of the concentration of expectation values of global observables stemming from the central limit theorem, resulting in increased prediction accuracy.

Title: Demonstration of Algorithmic Quantum Speedup for an Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem
Authors: P. Singkanipa, V. Kasatkin, Z. Zhou, G. Quiroz, D.A. Lidar
Abstract: Simon's problem is to find a hidden period (a bitstring) encoded into an unknown 2-to-1 function. It is one of the earliest problems for which an exponential quantum speedup was proven for ideal, noiseless quantum computers, albeit in the oracle model. Here, using two different 127-qubit IBM Quantum superconducting processors, we demonstrate an algorithmic quantum speedup for a variant of Simon's problem where the hidden period has a restricted Hamming weight $w$. For sufficiently small values of $w$ and for circuits involving up to 58 qubits, we demonstrate an exponential speedup, albeit of a lower quality than the speedup predicted for the noiseless algorithm. The speedup exponent and the range of $w$ values for which an exponential speedup exists are significantly enhanced when the computation is protected by dynamical decoupling. Further enhancement is achieved with measurement error mitigation. This constitutes a demonstration of a bona fide quantum advantage for an Abelian hidden subgroup problem.

Title: Theory of Multimode Squeezed Light Generation in Lossy Media
Authors: Denis A. Kopylov, Torsten Meier, Polina R. Sharapova
Abstract: A unified theoretical approach to describe the properties of multimode squeezed light generated in a lossy medium is presented. This approach is valid for Markovian environments and includes both a model of discrete losses based on the beamsplitter approach and a generalized continuous loss model based on the spatial Langevin equation. For an important class of Gaussian states, we derive master equations for the second-order correlation functions and illustrate their solution for both frequency-independent and frequency-dependent losses. Studying the mode structure, we demonstrate that in a lossy environment no broadband basis without quadrature correlations between the different broadband modes exists. Therefore, various techniques and strategies to introduce broadband modes can be considered. We show that the Mercer expansion and the Williamson-Euler decomposition do not provide modes in which the maximal squeezing contained in the system can be measured. In turn, we find a new broadband basis that maximizes squeezing in the lossy system and present an algorithm to construct it.

Title: Simulating electronic structure on bosonic quantum computers
Authors: Rishab Dutta, Nam P. Vu, Chuzhi Xu, Delmar G. A. Cabral, Ningyi Lyu, Alexander V. Soudackov, Xiaohan Dan, Haote Li, Chen Wang, Victor S. Batista
Abstract: Quantum harmonic oscillators, or qumodes, provide a promising and versatile framework for quantum computing. Unlike qubits, which are limited to two discrete levels, qumodes have an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, making them well-suited for a wide range of quantum simulations. In this work, we focus on the molecular electronic structure problem. We propose an approach to map the electronic Hamiltonian into a qumode bosonic problem that can be solved on bosonic quantum devices using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach is demonstrated through the computation of ground potential energy surfaces for benchmark model systems, including H$_2$ and the linear H$_4$ molecule. The preparation of trial qumode states and the computation of expectation values leverage universal ansatzes based on the echoed conditional displacement (ECD), or the selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) operations. These techniques are compatible with circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms, where microwave resonators coupled to superconducting transmon qubits can offer an efficient hardware realization. This work establishes a new pathway for simulating many-fermion systems, highlighting the potential of hybrid qubit-qumode quantum devices in advancing quantum computational chemistry.

Title: Compression of quantum shallow-circuit states
Authors: Yuxiang Yang
Abstract: Shallow quantum circuits feature not only computational advantages over their classical counterparts but also cutting-edge applications. Storing quantum information generated by shallow circuits is a fundamental question of both theoretical and practical importance that remained largely unexplored. In this work, we show that $N$ copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state generated by a fixed-depth circuit can be compressed into a hybrid memory of $O(n \log_2 N)$ (qu)bits, which achieves the optimal scaling of memory cost. Our work shows that the computational complexity of resources can significantly impact the rate of quantum information processing, offering a unique and unified view of quantum Shannon theory and quantum computing.

Title: Structure learning of Hamiltonians from real-time evolution
Authors: Ainesh Bakshi, Allen Liu, Ankur Moitra, Ewin Tang
Abstract: We study the problem of Hamiltonian structure learning from real-time evolution: given the ability to apply $e^{-\mathrm{i} Ht}$ for an unknown local Hamiltonian $H = \sum_{a = 1}^m \lambda_a E_a$ on $n$ qubits, the goal is to recover $H$. This problem is already well-understood under the assumption that the interaction terms, $E_a$, are given, and only the interaction strengths, $\lambda_a$, are unknown. But how efficiently can we learn a local Hamiltonian without prior knowledge of its interaction structure? We present a new, general approach to Hamiltonian learning that not only solves the challenging structure learning variant, but also resolves other open questions in the area, all while achieving the gold standard of Heisenberg-limited scaling. In particular, our algorithm recovers the Hamiltonian to $\varepsilon$ error with total evolution time $O(\log (n)/\varepsilon)$, and has the following appealing properties: (1) it does not need to know the Hamiltonian terms; (2) it works beyond the short-range setting, extending to any Hamiltonian $H$ where the sum of terms interacting with a qubit has bounded norm; (3) it evolves according to $H$ in constant time $t$ increments, thus achieving constant time resolution. As an application, we can also learn Hamiltonians exhibiting power-law decay up to accuracy $\varepsilon$ with total evolution time beating the standard limit of $1/\varepsilon^2$.

Title: QUACK: Quantum Aligned Centroid Kernel
Authors: Kilian Tscharke, Sebastian Issel, Pascal Debus
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) seems to show potential for application in machine learning (ML). In particular quantum kernel methods (QKM) exhibit promising properties for use in supervised ML tasks. However, a major disadvantage of kernel methods is their unfavorable quadratic scaling with the number of training samples. Together with the limits imposed by currently available quantum hardware (NISQ devices) with their low qubit coherence times, small number of qubits, and high error rates, the use of QC in ML at an industrially relevant scale is currently impossible. As a small step in improving the potential applications of QKMs, we introduce QUACK, a quantum kernel algorithm whose time complexity scales linear with the number of samples during training, and independent of the number of training samples in the inference stage. In the training process, only the kernel entries for the samples and the centers of the classes are calculated, i.e. the maximum shape of the kernel for n samples and c classes is (n, c). During training, the parameters of the quantum kernel and the positions of the centroids are optimized iteratively. In the inference stage, for every new sample the circuit is only evaluated for every centroid, i.e. c times. We show that the QUACK algorithm nevertheless provides satisfactory results and can perform at a similar level as classical kernel methods with quadratic scaling during training. In addition, our (simulated) algorithm is able to handle high-dimensional datasets such as MNIST with 784 features without any dimensionality reduction.

Title: Efficient discrimination between real and complex quantum theories
Authors: Josep Batle, Tomasz Białecki, Tomasz Rybotycki, Jakub Tworzydło, Adam Bednorz
Abstract: We improve the test to show the impossibility of a quantum theory based on real numbers by a larger ratio of complex-to-real bound on a Bell-type parameter. In contrast to previous theoretical and experimental proposals the test requires three settings for the parties $A$ and $C$, but also six settings for the middle party $B$, assuming separability of the sources. The bound we found for this symmetric configuration imposed on a real theory is $14.69$ while the complex maximum is $18$. This large theoretical difference enables us to demonstrate the concomitant experimental violation on IBM quantum computer via a designed quantum network, without resorting to error mitigation, obtaining as a result $15.44$ at more than $100$ standard deviations above the found real bound.

Title: Exponential optimization of adiabatic quantum-state preparation
Authors: Davide Cugini, Davide Nigro, Mattia Bruno, Dario Gerace
Abstract: The preparation of a given quantum state on a quantum computing register is a typically demanding operation, requiring a number of elementary gates that scales exponentially with the size of the problem. Using the adiabatic theorem for state preparation, whose error decreases exponentially as a function of the preparation time, we derive an explicit analytic expression for the dependence of the characteristic time on the Hamiltonian used in the adiabatic evolution. Exploiting this knowledge, we then design a preconditioning term that modifies the adiabatic preparation, thus reducing its characteristic time and hence giving an exponential advantage in state preparation. We prove the efficiency of our method with extensive numerical experiments on prototypical spin-models, which gives a promising strategy to perform quantum simulations of manybody models via Trotter evolution on near-term quantum processors.

Title: Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo for systems larger than your Quantum Computer
Authors: Stuart Ferguson, Petros Wallden
Abstract: Quantum computers theoretically promise computational advantage in many tasks, but it is much less clear how such advantage can be maintained when using existing and near-term hardware that has limitations in the number and quality of its qubits. Layden et al. [Nature 619, 282 (2023)] proposed a promising application by introducing a Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) approach to reduce the thermalization time required when sampling from hard probability distributions. In QeMCMC the size of the required quantum computer scales linearly with the problem, putting limitations on the sizes of systems that one can consider. In this work we introduce a framework to coarse grain the algorithm in such a way that the quantum computation can be performed using considerably smaller quantum computers and we term the method the Coarse Grained Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (CGQeMCMC). Example strategies within this framework are put to the test, with the quantum speedup persisting while using only $\sqrt{n}$ simulated qubits where $n$ is the number of qubits required in the original QeMCMC -- a quadratic reduction in resources. The coarse graining framework has the potential to be practically applicable in the near term as it requires very few qubits to approach classically intractable problem instances; in this case only 6 simulated qubits suffice to gain advantage compared to standard classical approaches when investigating the magnetization of a 36 spin system. Our method can be easily combined with other classical and quantum techniques and is adaptable to various quantum hardware specifications -- in particular those with limited connectivity.

Title: Photon loss effects on light-mediated non-Gaussian entangled Bose-Einstein condensates projecting with different photon measurement outcomes
Authors: Shuai Gao, Manish Chaudhary, Alexey N. Pyrkov, Ebubechukwu O. Ilo-Okeke, Xin Meng, Jingyan Feng, Muhammad Jamil Khan, Tim Byrnes, Chaogang Lou
Abstract: The theory of quantum information processing for macroscopic qubits is based on the fact that every macroscopic qubit has a conserved number of particles. However, from an experimental point of view, every such qubit experiences processes of decoherence that impact the possibilities for entanglement generation between such qubits and use in quantum information processing efficiently. One of the most prospective methods for generating entanglement between distant atomic BECs is quantum nondemolition measurements. Here, we study how the effects of photon measurement impact the entanglement when photon loss decoherence is included. We employ the thermally entangled state representation (TESR) and integral within the ordered operator(IWOP) approach to obtain the accurate density matrix in a photon loss channel. We demonstrate that varying outcomes of photon number measurements lead to the generation of distinct entangled states, each exhibiting unique characteristics. We find that using the Hofmann-Takeuchi and Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller criterion provides advantages in entanglement detection compared to the Wineland squeezing and EPR steering criterion in such settings.

Title: Detection of entanglement via moments of positive maps
Authors: Mazhar Ali
Abstract: We have reexamined the moments of positive maps and the criterion based on these moments to detect entanglement. For two qubits, we observed that reduction map is equivalent to partial transpose map as the resulting matrices have the same set of eigenvalues although both matrices look different in same computational basis. Consequently, the detection power of both maps is same. For $2 \otimes 4$ systems, we find that moments of reduction map are capable to detect a family of bound entangled states. For qutrit-qutrit systems, we show that moments of reduction map can detect two well known families of bound entangled states. The moments of another positive map can detect the complete range of entanglement for a specific family of quantum states, whereas the earlier criterion fails to detect a small range of entangled states. For three qubits system, we find that applying reduction map to one of the qubit is equivalent to partial transpose operation. In particularly, for GHZ state and W state mixed with white noise, all the moments of a reduction map are exactly the same as the moments of partial transpose map.

Title: Quantum space-time Poincar\'e inequality for Lindblad dynamics
Authors: Bowen Li, Jianfeng Lu
Abstract: We investigate the mixing properties of primitive Markovian Lindblad dynamics (i.e., quantum Markov semigroups), where the detailed balance is disrupted by a coherent drift term. It is known that the sharp $L^2$-exponential convergence rate of Lindblad dynamics is determined by the spectral gap of the generator. We show that incorporating a Hamiltonian component into a detailed balanced Lindbladian can generically enhance its spectral gap, thereby accelerating the mixing. In addition, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap for Lindblad dynamics with a large coherent contribution. However, estimating the spectral gap, particularly for a non-detailed balanced Lindbladian, presents a significant challenge. In the case of hypocoercive Lindblad dynamics, we extend the variational framework originally developed for underdamped Langevin dynamics to derive fully explicit and constructive exponential decay estimates for convergence in the noncommutative $L^2$-norm. This analysis relies on establishing a quantum analog of space-time Poincaré inequality. Furthermore, we provide several examples with connections to quantum noise and quantum Gibbs samplers as applications of our theoretical results.

Title: Finite (quantum) effect algebras
Authors: Stan Gudder, Teiko Heinosaari
Abstract: We investigate finite effect algebras and their classification. We show that an effect algebra with $n$ elements has at least $n-2$ and at most $(n-1)(n-2)/2$ nontrivial defined sums. We characterize finite effect algebras with these minimal and maximal number of defined sums. The latter effect algebras are scale effect algebras (i.e., subalgebras of [0,1]), and only those. We prove that there is exactly one scale effect algebra with $n$ elements for every integer $n \geq 2$. We show that a finite effect algebra is quantum effect algebra (i.e. a subeffect algebra of the standard quantum effect algebra) if and only if it has a finite set of order-determining states. Among effect algebras with 2-6 elements, we identify all quantum effect algebras.

Title: Quantum-like product states constructed from classical networks
Authors: Gregory D. Scholes, Graziano Amati
Abstract: Can complex classical systems be designed to exhibit superpositions of tensor products of basis states, thereby mimicking quantum states? We exhibit a one-to one map between the product basis of quantum states comprising an arbitrary number of qubits and the eigenstates of a construction comprising classical oscillator networks. Specifically, we prove the existence of this map based on Cartesian products of graphs, where the graphs depict the layout of oscillator networks. We show how quantum-like gates can act on the classical networks to allow quantum-like operations in the state space.

Title: Theory of Complex Particle without Extra Dimensions
Authors: Takayuki Hori
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.

Title: Molecular Nanomagnet $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ as Resource for Bipartite and Tripartite Quantum Entanglement and Coherence
Authors: Azadeh Ghannadan, Hamid Arian Zad, Saeed Haddadi, Jozef Strečka, Zhirayr Adamyan, Vadim Ohanyan
Abstract: We investigate key quantum characteristics of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer under the influence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the distributions of bipartite and tripartite entanglement quantified through the respective negativities, and the $l_1$-norm of coherence with the help of rigorous analytical and numerical methods. Our findings suggest that the heterotrinuclear molecular nanomagnet $[\{\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{L}\}_2\text{Ni}^\text{II}(\text{H}_2\text{O})_2](\text{ClO}_4)_{2} . 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$, which represents an experimental realization of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer, exhibits a significant bipartite entanglement between $\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ and $\text{Ni}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions along with robust tripartite entanglement among all three constituent $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions. The significant bipartite and tripartite entanglement persists even at relatively high temperatures up to $37\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields up to $46\,\text{T}$, whereby the coherence is maintained even at elevated temperatures. {It is evidenced that the aforementioned molecular complex with the magnetic core $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ provides an intriguing quantum resource, which exhibits a star-shaped state within the singlet eigenstate at low magnetic fields and W-like state within the triplet eigenstate at moderate magnetic fields.

Title: Encoded probabilistic imaginary-time evolution on a trapped-ion quantum computer for ground and excited states of spin qubits
Authors: Hirofumi Nishi, Yuki Takei, Taichi Kosugi, Shunsuke Mieda, Yutaka Natsume, Takeshi Aoyagi, Yu-ichiro Matsushita
Abstract: In this study, we employed a quantum computer to solve a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for spin defects in diamond (so-called NV centre) and wurtzite-type aluminium nitride, which are anticipated to be qubits. The probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) method, designed for use in a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) era, was employed to calculate the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state, as represented by the effective Hamiltonian. It is difficult to compute the spin singlet state correctly using density functional theory (DFT), which should be described by multiple Slater determinants. To mitigate the effects of quantum errors inherent in current quantum computers, we implemented a $[[ n+2,n,2 ]]$ quantum error detection (QED) code called the Iceberg code. Despite the inevitable destruction of the encoded state resulting from the measurement of the ancilla qubit at each PITE step, we were able to successfully re-encode and recover the logical success state. In the implementation of the PITE, it was observed that the effective Hamiltonian comprises large components of the diagonal part and a relatively small non-diagonal part, which is frequently the case with quantum chemistry calculations. An efficient implementation of Hamiltonian simulations, in which the diagonal components dominate, was developed on a quantum computer based on the second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. This is the first instance of an encoded PITE circuit being executed on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our results demonstrate that QED effectively reduces quantum errors and that we successfully obtained both the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state. Our demonstration clearly manifests that Zr$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, Ti$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, and Hf$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$ defects have a high potential as spin qubits for quantum sensors.

Title: Near-deterministic quantum search algorithm without phase design
Authors: Zhen Wang, Kun Zhang, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: Grover's algorithm solves the unstructured search problem. Grover's algorithm can find the target state with certainty only if searching one out of four. Designing the deterministic search algorithm can avoid any repetition of the algorithm, especially when Grover's algorithm is a subroutine in other algorithms. Grover's algorithm can be deterministic if the phase of the oracle or the diffusion operator is delicately designed. The precision of the phases could be a problem. A near-deterministic quantum search algorithm without the phase design is proposed. The algorithm has the same oracle and diffusion operators as Grover's algorithm. One additional component is the rescaled diffusion operator. It acts partially on the database. The success probability of Grover's algorithm is improved by the partial diffusion operator in two different ways. The possible cost is one or two more queries to the oracle. The deterministic search algorithm is also designed when searching one out of eight, sixteen, and thirty-two.

Title: Quantum Circuits for the heat equation with physical boundary conditions via Schrodingerisation
Authors: Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Yue Yu
Abstract: This paper explores the explicit design of quantum circuits for quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) with physical boundary conditions. These equations and/or their discretized forms usually do not evolve via unitary dynamics, thus are not suitable for quantum simulation. Boundary conditions (either time-dependent or independent) make the problem more difficult. To tackle this challenge, the Schrodingerisation method can be employed, which converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations, via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher dimension. Despite advancements in Schrodingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of quantum circuits for solving general PDEs, especially with physical boundary conditions, remains underdeveloped. We present two methods for handling the inhomogeneous terms arising from time-dependent physical boundary conditions. One approach utilizes Duhamel's principle to express the solution in integral form and employs linear combination of unitaries (LCU) for coherent state preparation. Another method applies an augmentation to transform the inhomogeneous problem into a homogeneous one. We then apply the quantum simulation technique from [CJL23] to transform the resulting non-autonomous system to an autonomous system in one higher dimension. We provide detailed implementations of these two methods and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis in terms of queries to the time evolution input oracle.

Title: Deriving the Born Rule from a model of the quantum measurement process
Authors: Alan Schaum
Abstract: The quantum mechanics postulate called the Born Rule attributes a probabilistic meaning to a wave function. This paper derives the Born Rule from other quantum principles along with a model of the measurement process. The nondeterministic nature of quantum measurements is hypothesized to arise from an ignorance of the quantum states of a measuring device's microscopic components. Their interactions with a system to be measured are modeled heuristically with any member of a particular class of stochastic processes, each of which generate the Born Rule. One member of the class appears particularly compatible with properties expected of quantum interactions.

Title: Rate-adaptive Reconciliation for Experimental Continuous-variable Quantum Key Distribution with Discrete Modulation over a Free-space Optical Link
Authors: Kadir Gümüş, João dos Reis Frazão, Vincent van Vliet, Sjoerd van der Heide, Menno van den Hout, Gabriele Liga, Yunus Can Gültekin, Aaron Albores-Mejia, Thomas Bradley, Alex Alvarado, Chigo Okonkwo
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has been proposed as a method for securely exchanging keys to protect against the security concerns caused by potential advancements in quantum computing. In addition to optical fibre transmission, the free-space optical (FSO) channel is an interesting channel for CV-QKD, as it is possible to share keys over this channel wirelessly. The instability of the FSO channel caused by turbulence-induced fading, however, can cause a degradation in the system's performance. One of the most important aspects of CV-QKD is the reconciliation step, which significantly impacts the performance of the CV-QKD system. Hence, rate-adaptive reconciliation is necessary for CV-QKD over FSO to combat the fluctuations in the channel and improve secret key rates (SKRs). Therefore, in this paper, we simulate the impact of discrete modulation on the reconciliation efficiency and consider the use of $d$-dimensional reconciliation with $d > 8$ to mitigate this impact, improving reconciliation efficiencies by up to 3.4%. We validate our results by experimentally demonstrating CV-QKD over a turbulent FSO link and demonstrate SKR gains by up to 165%. Furthermore, we optimise the reconciliation efficiency for FSO links, achieving additional SKR gains of up to 7.6%.

Abstract: Diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles are one of the most promising solid-state quantum platforms for various sensing applications. The combination of a long spin dephasing time ($T_2^*$) and a high NV center concentration is crucial for pushing the sensitivity limits. In this work, we propose a systematic measurement approach to quantify the electron spin dephasing in NV center ensembles and analyze the contributions of various sources to the dephasing time, including NV-NV interactions, strain and electric field distributions, $^{13}$C nuclear spins, and P1 electron spins. Our method is validated using a series of high-performance diamond samples, providing a comprehensive understanding of dephasing mechanisms and revealing correlations between NV concentration and different dephasing sources. Based on these insights, we further evaluate and propose strategies to improve the achievable sensitivity limits for DC magnetic field measurements.

Title: Quantum Wasserstein Compilation: Unitary Compilation using the Quantum Earth Mover's Distance
Authors: Marvin Richter, Abhishek Y. Dubey, Axel Plinge, Christopher Mutschler, Daniel D. Scherer, Michael J. Hartmann
Abstract: Despite advances in the development of quantum computers, the practical application of quantum algorithms requiring deep circuit depths or high-fidelity transformations remains outside the current range of the so-called noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Now and beyond, quantum circuit compilation (QCC) is a crucial component of any quantum algorithm execution. Besides translating a circuit into hardware-specific gates, it can optimize circuit depth and adapt to noise. Variational quantum circuit compilation (VQCC) optimizes the parameters of an ansatz according to the goal of reproducing a given unitary transformation. In this work, we present a VQCC-objective function called the quantum Wasserstein compilation (QWC) cost function based on the quantum Wasserstein distance of order 1. We show that the QWC cost function upper bounds the average infidelity of two circuits. An estimation method based on measurements of local Pauli-observable is utilized in a generative adversarial network to learn a given quantum circuit. We demonstrate the efficacy of the QWC cost function by compiling hardware efficient ansatz (HEA) as both the target and the ansatz and comparing to cost functions such as the Loschmidt echo test (LET) and the Hilbert-Schmidt test (HST). Finally, our experiments demonstrate that QWC as a cost function is the least affected by barren plateaus when compared to LET and HST for deep enough circuits.

Title: Quantifying non-Markovianity via local quantum Fisher information
Authors: Yassine Dakir, Abdallah Slaoui, Lalla Btissam Drissi, Rachid Ahl Laamara
Abstract: Characterizing non-Markovianity in open quantum systems (OQSs) is gaining increasing attention due to its profound implications for quantum information processing. This phenomenon arises from the system's evolution being influenced by its previous interactions with the environment. To better understand these complex dynamics, various measures have been proposed, including those based on divisibility, quantum mutual information, and trace distance. Each of these measures provides a different perspective on the behavior of OQSs. Here, we introduce a novel approach to quantifying non-Markovianity by focusing on metrological non-classical correlations. This approach is based on a discord-like measure of quantum correlations for multi-component quantum systems known as local quantum Fisher information (LQFI), which was introduced in [58]. It is defined as the minimization of quantum Fisher information with respect to local observables and measurements. Thereby, we examine some examples to clarify the use of our metric by applying it to three different channels: the phase damping channel, the amplitude damping channel, and the depolarizing channel. In contrast to other approaches, this new metric focuses on correlated bipartite $2\otimes d$ systems, has a clear physical interpretation, and effectively captures the features of non-Markovianity. We demonstrate that the non-Markovian or Markovian evolution of an open correlated bipartite system corresponds to an increase or decrease, respectively, in the quantumness of the quantum state. This quantumness is quantified by the maximum of the measurement-induced Fisher information across all local von Neumann measurements. Compared to measuring non-Markovianity based on local quantum uncertainty, a measure of non-classical correlation of the discord type based on single observables, our results confirm that the ..

Title: Theory of optical spin polarization of axial divacancy and nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-SiC
Authors: Guodong Bian, Gergő Thiering, Ádám Gali
Abstract: The neutral divacancy and the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) are two of the most prominent candidates for functioning as room-temperature quantum bits (qubits) with telecommunication-wavelength emission. Nonetheless, the pivotal role of electron-phonon coupling in the spin polarization loop is still unrevealed. In this work, we theoretically investigate the microscopic magneto-optical properties and spin-dependent optical loops utilizing the first-principles calculations. First, we quantitatively demonstrate the electronic level structure, assisted by symmetry analysis. Moreover, the fine interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and spin-spin interaction, are fully characterized to provide versatile qubit functional parameters. Subsequently, we explore the electron-phonon coupling, encompassing dynamics- and pseudo-Jahn--Teller effects in the intersystem crossing transition. In addition, we analyze the photoluminescence PL lifetime based on the major transition rates in the optical spin polarization loop. We compare two promising qubits with similar electronic properties, but their respective rates differ substantially. Finally, we detail the threshold of ODMR contrast for further optimization of the qubit operation. This work not only reveals the mechanism underlying the optical spin polarization but also proposes productive avenues for optimizing quantum information processing tasks based on the ODMR protocol.

Title: Multipartite Entanglement and Quantum Sensing in a Spin-5/2 Heisenberg Molecular Iron(III) Triangle
Authors: Hamid Arian Zad, Jozef Strečka, Winfried Plass
Abstract: This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex $[\mathrm{Fe}_3\mathrm{Cl}_3(\mathrm{saltag^\mathrm{Br}})(\mathrm{py})_6]\mathrm{ClO}_4$ to be further abbreviated as Fe$_3$. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately 30~K and 70~K, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.

Title: Influence of bias voltage noise on the Inelastic Cooper-Pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA)
Authors: Ulrich Martel, Romain Albert, Florian Blanchet, Joël Griesmar, Gabriel Ouellet, Hugo Therrien, Naveen Nehra, Nicolas Bourlet, Ambroise Peugeot, Max Hofheinz
Abstract: We experimentally show that the Inelastic Cooper-Pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA), implementing a DC-powered parametric amplification scheme, can achieve gain and noise performance similar to that of Josephson parametric amplifiers. Using experimental data and simulations, we show that the ICTA has near-quantum-limited noise as long as the integral voltage bias noise divided by the superconducting flux quantum is below the amplification bandwidth. We observe a gain of 20 dB with noise below 1.7 times the quantum limit when the full width at half maximum of the integral voltage noise, expressed as frequency, is 5.6 MHz.

Title: Quasi Inverse of Qubit Channels for Mixed States
Authors: Muhammad Faizan, Muhammad Faryad
Abstract: We found the quasi inverse of qubit channels as a unitary map, $\mathcal{E}^i$, by minimizing the average trace distance between the input state to the channel and the output of the quasi inverse channel for arbitrary qubit channel $\mathcal{E}$ and for arbitrary input states. The channel $\mathcal{E}$ was assumed completely positive and trace-preserving. To find the quasi inverse for mixed states, we proposed an alternative definition of the quasi inverse based on the mean square of the trace distance (MSTD) of a channel. The definition based on the trace distance allowed easy generalization of the quasi inverse to mixed input states. The quasi inverse of the Pauli, generalized amplitude damping, mixed unitary, and tetrahedron channels calculated based on the MSTD agreed with the one computed using average fidelity in the special case of input states being pure.

Title: Statistical features of quantum chaos using the Krylov operator complexity
Authors: Zhuoran Li, Wei Fan
Abstract: Recently the variance of Lanzcos coefficients in the Krylov space of an initial operator is recognized as an important indicator of quantum chaos. In this paper, we generate samples of random initial operators from given probability distribtions (GOE, GUE and the uniform distribution) and do statistics on the variance of Lanczos coefficients over these initial operators. Using the Sinai billiard with an integrability-breaking term, we propose two statistical quantities that have distinct behaviors as the system changes from nonchaotic to chaotic. One is the average correlation matrix $\langle x_{i} x_{j}\rangle$ of Lanczos coefficients, which exhibits different patterns in the nonchaotic and the chaotic regime. The other one is the resulting distribution of the variance of Lanzcos coefficients. In the nonchaotic case, the resulting distributions are almost overlapping together. In the chaotic case, they split into two well-separated groups. Furthermore, the resulting statistics of these two quantities are the Wishart distribution and the (rescaled) chi-square distribution respectively, which are independent of the distributions of initial operators and become the normal distribution in the case of large matrix size.

Title: Multipartite entanglement distribution in Bell-pair networks without Steiner trees and with reduced gate cost
Authors: S. Siddardha Chelluri, Sumeet Khatri, Peter van Loock
Abstract: Multipartite entangled states, particularly Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) and other graph states, are important resources in multiparty quantum network protocols and measurement-based quantum computing. We consider the problem of generating such states from networks of bipartite entangled (Bell) pairs. Although an optimal protocol (in terms of time steps and consumed Bell pairs) for generating GHZ states in Bell-pair networks has been identified in [Phys. Rev. A 100, 052333 (2019)], it makes use of at most $O(N^2)$ gates, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. It also involves solving the NP-hard Steiner tree problem as an initial step. Reducing the gate cost is an important consideration now and into the future, because both qubits and gate operations are noisy. To this end, we present a protocol for producing GHZ states in arbitrary Bell-pair networks that provably requires only $O(N)$ gates, and we present numerical evidence that our protocol indeed reduces the gate cost on real-world network models, compared to prior work. Notably, the gate cost of our protocol depends only on the number of nodes and is independent of the topology of the network. At the same time, our protocol maintains nearly the optimal number of consumed Bell pairs, and it avoids finding a Steiner tree or solving any other computationally hard problem by running in polynomial time with respect to $N$. By considering the number of gates as a figure of merit, our work approaches entanglement distribution from the perspective that, in practice, unlike the traditional information-theoretic setting, local operations and classical communications are not free.

Title: Dissipation alters modes of information encoding in small quantum reservoirs near criticality
Authors: Krai Cheamsawat, Thiparat Chotibut
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.

Title: Revisiting the Bohr Model of the Atom through Brownian Motion of the Electron
Authors: Vasil Yordanov
Abstract: In this work, we enhance the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom by incorporating Stochastic Mechanics to describe the electron's behavior through Brownian motion. In contrast to traditional quantum mechanics, where the Born rule postulates the physical interpretation of the wave function, our model derives the Born rule by performing statistical averaging of single-particle positions. Because the particle always has a definite, though random, position, there is no need for wave function collapse, as required by the Copenhagen interpretation. In this approach, we use the wave function to compute the electron's optimal drift velocity within its stochastic equation of motion. We develop modified stochastic equations in curvilinear spherical coordinates and demonstrate that the resulting radial and angular kinetic energies align with those from the operator approach. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical framework by showing stable electron orbits and accurately reproducing the probability distribution of finding the electron around the hydrogen nucleus as defined by the Born rule. We show that at very short timescales, wave function-based single electron probability distributions can be inadequate due to insufficient statistical averaging of single-particle trajectories. This model thus offers enhanced insights into the quantum world beyond conventional interpretations. Our findings underscore the potential of applying wave function-derived drift velocities within Stochastic Mechanics to the hydrogen atom, providing new perspectives on atomic dynamics.

Title: High-fidelity Generation of Bell and W States in Giant Atom System via Bound State in the Continuum
Authors: Mingzhu Weng, Hongwei Yu, Zhihai Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a high-fidelity scheme for generating entangled states in a system of two and three giant atoms coupled to the coupled resonator waveguide. Our approach leverages the bound state in the continuum, which is robust against waveguide disorder. Specifically, we achieve a fidelity exceeding $98\%$ for Bell state generation, overcoming the limitations of conventional decoherence-free interaction mechanisms. This scheme can be readily extended to a three-giant-atom system for generating W states. In both the two- and three-atom setups, the maximally entangled states are generated in a short time and remain stable even as time approaches infinity. Our proposal is feasible for implementation on state-of-the-art solid-state quantum platforms and significantly broadens the applications of giant atoms and waveguide QED system in quantum information processing.

Title: Experimental Realization of Criticality-Enhanced Global Quantum Sensing via Non-Equilibrium Dynamics
Authors: Yefei Yu, Ran Liu, Guangming Xue, Chuhong Yang, Chenlu Wang, Jingning Zhang, Jiangyu Cui, Xiaodong Yang, Jun Li, Jiaxiu Han, Haifeng Yu
Abstract: Quantum critical systems offer promising advancements in quantum sensing and metrology, yet face limitations like critical slowing down and a restricted criticality-enhanced region. Here, we introduce a critical sensing scheme that mitigate critical slowing down by leveraging the non-equilibrium dynamics of a perturbed Ising spin model, coupled with an adaptive strategy to enlarge its sensing interval. We validate the proposed scheme on a superconducting quantum processor and demonstrate that our scheme achieves a Heisenberg scaling with respect to the encoding duration. Additionally, the adaptive strategy tunes the model to operate near its critical point with limited prior information about the parameter, enabling what is known as global sensing. Our work showcases the metrological applications empowered by non-equilibrium critical dynamics and hence opens up a pathway for devising critical quantum sensors.

Title: Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties
Authors: Ke Wang, Xiantao Li
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM), conceived as an error suppression paradigm without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose non-Markovian Noise Mitigation (NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions (BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on the spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.

Title: A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures
Authors: Nicholas J. Sorensen, Vitaliy Sultanov, Maria V. Chekhova
Abstract: The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano- and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple example of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.

Authors: Athena Caesura, Cristian L. Cortes, William Pol, Sukin Sim, Mark Steudtner, Gian-Luca R. Anselmetti, Matthias Degroote, Nikolaj Moll, Raffaele Santagati, Michael Streif, Christofer S. Tautermann
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations of molecular systems are among the most promising applications for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) in quantum chemistry and drug design. However, while recent algorithmic advancements such as qubitization and Tensor Hypercontraction (THC) have significantly reduced the complexity of such calculations, they do not yet achieve computational runtimes short enough to be practical for industrially relevant use cases. In this work, we introduce several advances to electronic structure calculation for molecular systems, resulting in a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup of estimated runtimes over prior-art algorithms run on comparable quantum devices. One of these advances is a novel framework for block-invariant symmetry-shifted Tensor Hypercontraction (BLISS-THC), with which we achieve the tightest Hamiltonian factorizations reported to date. We compile our algorithm for an Active Volume (AV) architecture, a technical layout that has recently been proposed for fusion-based photonic quantum hardware. AV compilation contributes towards a lower runtime of our computation by eliminating overheads stemming from connectivity issues in the underlying surface code. We present a detailed benchmark of our approach, focusing primarily on the computationally challenging benchmark molecule P450. Leveraging a number of hardware tradeoffs in interleaving-based photonic FTQC, we estimate runtimes for the electronic structure calculation of P450 as a function of the device footprint.

Title: Upper bounds for Grothendieck constants, quantum correlation matrices and CCP functions
Authors: Frank Oertel
Abstract: Within the framework of the search for the still unknown exact value of the real and complex Grothendieck constant $K_G^\mathbb{F}$ in the famous Grothendieck inequality (unsolved since 1953), where $\mathbb{F}$ denotes either the real or the complex field, we concentrate our search on their smallest upper bound. To this end, we establish a basic framework, built on functions which map correlation matrices to correlation matrices entrywise by means of the Hadamard product, such as the Krivine function in the real case or the Haagerup function in the complex case. By making use of multivariate real and complex Gaussian analysis, higher transcendental functions, integration over spheres and combinatorics of the inversion of Maclaurin series, we provide an approach by which we also recover all famous upper bounds of Grothendieck himself ($K_G^\mathbb{R} \leq \sinh(\pi/2) \approx 2.301$), Krivine ($K_G^\mathbb{R} \leq \frac{\pi}{2 \ln(1 + \sqrt{2})} \approx 1,782$) and Haagerup ($K_G^\mathbb{C} \leq 1.405$, numerically approximated); each of them as a special case. In doing so, we aim to unify the real and complex case as much as possible and apply our results to several concrete examples, including the Walsh-Hadamard transform (''quantum gate'') and the multivariate Gaussian copula - with foundations of quantum theory and quantum information theory in mind. Moreover, we offer a shortening and a simplification of the proof of the strongest estimation until now; namely that $K_G^\mathbb{R} < \frac{\pi}{2 \ln(1 + \sqrt{2})}$. We summarise our key results in form of an algorithmic scheme and shed light on related open problems and topics for future research.

Abstract: We realize a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermionic atoms in an optical tweezer. By utilizing a single atom and spin resolved imaging technique, we sample the Laughlin wavefunction, thereby revealing its distinctive features, including a vortex distribution in the relative motion, correlations in the particles' relative angle, and suppression of the inter-particle interactions. Our work lays the foundation for atom-by-atom assembly of fractional quantum Hall states in rotating atomic gases.

Title: Room temperature quantum emitters in van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3
Authors: Jeonghan Lee, Haiyuan Wang, Keun-Yeol Park, Soonsang Huh, Donghan Kim, Mihyang Yu, Changyoung Kim, Kristian Sommer Thygesen, Jieun Lee
Abstract: Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the generation of room temperature single-photon emission from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 0.4 Mcts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.

Title: InAs on Insulator: A New Platform for Cryogenic Hybrid Superconducting Electronics
Authors: Alessandro Paghi, Giacomo Trupiano, Giorgio De Simoni, Omer Arif, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconducting circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconducting InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.

Title: Quadrupolar resonance spectroscopy of individual nuclei using a room-temperature quantum sensor
Authors: S. Alex Breitweiser, Mathieu Ouellet, Tzu-Yung Huang, Tim H. Taminiau, Lee C. Bassett
Abstract: Nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy reveals chemical bonding patterns in materials and molecules through the unique coupling between nuclear spins and local fields. However, traditional NQR techniques require macroscopic ensembles of nuclei to yield a detectable signal, which precludes the study of individual molecules and obscures molecule-to-molecule variations due to local perturbations or deformations. Optically active electronic spin qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, facilitate the detection and control of individual nuclei through their local magnetic couplings. Here, we use NV centers to perform NQR spectroscopy on their associated nitrogen-14 ($^{14}$N) nuclei at room temperature. In mapping the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian, we resolve minute variations between individual nuclei. The measurements further reveal correlations between the parameters in the NV center's electronic spin Hamiltonian and the $^{14}$N quadropolar Hamiltonian, as well as a previously unreported Hamiltonian term that results from symmetry breaking. We further design pulse sequences to initialize, readout, and control the quantum evolution of the $^{14}$N nuclear state using the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian.

Title: Driven-Dissipative Dynamics of Ultracold Atoms Trapped in an Array of Harmonic Potentials
Authors: Roland Cristopher F. Caballar
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a gas of ultracold atoms that are trapped in an array of harmonic potentials and that interacts with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that acts as a reservoir of Bogoliubov excitations. The ground and excited energy levels of these trapped ultracold atoms are coupled to each other via detuned Raman lasers with corresponding Rabi frequencies. Once excited via the Raman lasers, these trapped ultracold atoms then return to their ground energy levels, but not necessarily to their original trap locations, by emitting Bogoliubov excitations into the BEC. This combination of driving via Raman lasers to excited energy levels and dissipation via interaction with the BEC resulting in emission of Bogoliubov excitations into it will result in the trapped ultracold atoms approaching a steady state, whereby the expectation value of the number of trapped ultracold atoms in each harmonic trap of the array will attain a constant value over time. One can then use this system to prepare states that require a definite number of atoms in a particular energy level, such as BECs and atom lasers used for atom interferometry and for tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics.

Title: Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators
Authors: Pok Man Tam, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Jiabin Yu
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.

Title: Machine Learning for Improved Current Density Reconstruction from 2D Vector Magnetic Images
Authors: Niko R. Reed, Danyal Bhutto, Matthew J. Turner, Declan M. Daly, Sean M. Oliver, Jiashen Tang, Kevin S. Olsson, Nicholas Langellier, Mark J.H. Ku, Matthew S. Rosen, Ronald L. Walsworth
Abstract: The reconstruction of electrical current densities from magnetic field measurements is an important technique with applications in materials science, circuit design, quality control, plasma physics, and biology. Analytic reconstruction methods exist for planar currents, but break down in the presence of high spatial frequency noise or large standoff distance, restricting the types of systems that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate the use of a deep convolutional neural network for current density reconstruction from two-dimensional (2D) images of vector magnetic fields acquired by a quantum diamond microscope (QDM) utilizing a surface layer of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Trained network performance significantly exceeds analytic reconstruction for data with high noise or large standoff distances. This machine learning technique can perform quality inversions on lower SNR data, reducing the data collection time by a factor of about 400 and permitting reconstructions of weaker and three-dimensional current sources.

Title: Many-body localization crossover is sharper in quasiperiodic spin chains
Authors: Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Adith Sai Aramthottil, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.

Title: Quantifying Light-assisted Collisions in Optical Tweezers Across the Hyperfine Spectrum
Authors: Steven K. Pampel, Matteo Marinelli, Mark O. Brown, José P. D'Incao, Cindy A. Regal
Abstract: We investigate the role of hyperfine structure in resonant-dipole interactions between two atoms cotrapped in an optical tweezer. Two-body loss rates from light-assisted collisions (LACs) are measured across the $^{87}$Rb hyperfine spectrum and connected to properties of molecular photoassociation potentials via a semiclassical model. To obtain our results, we introduce an imaging technique that leverages repulsive LACs to detect two atoms in a trap, thereby circumventing parity constraints in tweezers. Our findings offer key insights for exploiting hyperfine structure in laser-induced collisions to control cold atoms and molecules in a broad range of quantum science applications.

Title: Thickness dependence of the mechanical properties of piezoelectric high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators made from aluminium nitride
Authors: Anastasiia Ciers, Alexander Jung, Joachim Ciers, Laurentius Radit Nindito, Hannes Pfeifer, Armin Dadgar, Jürgen Bläsing, André Strittmatter, Witlef Wieczorek
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors (\Qm{}) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase \Qm{}. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from \SI{45}{\nano\meter} to \SI{295}{\nano\meter}, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below \SI{200}{\nano\meter} thickness exhibit the highest \Qf{}-product, on the order of $10^{12}$\,Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher \Qf{}-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.

Title: Information Scrambling with Higher-Form Fields
Authors: Karunava Sil, Sourav Maji, Stavros Christodoulou, Abhishek Chowdhury
Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.

Title: Generalized and new solutions of the NRT nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
Authors: P. R. Gordoa, A. Pickering, D. Puertas-Centeno, E. V. Toranzo
Abstract: In this paper we present new solutions of the non-linear Schröodinger equation proposed by Nobre, Rego-Monteiro and Tsallis for the free particle, obtained from different Lie symmetry reductions. Analytical expressions for the wave function, the auxiliary field and the probability density are derived using a variety of approaches. Solutions involving elliptic functions, Bessel and modified Bessel functions, as well as the inverse error function are found, amongst others. On the other hand, a closed-form expression for the general solution of the traveling wave ansatz (see Bountis and Nobre) is obtained for any real value of the nonlinearity index. This is achieved through the use of the so-called generalized trigonometric functions as defined by Lindqvist and Drábek, the utility of which in analyzing the equation under study is highlighted throughout the paper.

Title: Exploring the properties of quantum scars in a toy model
Authors: Sudip Sinha, S. Sinha
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ergodicity and explore its deviation caused by quantum scars in an isolated quantum system, employing a pedagogical approach based on a toy model. Quantum scars, originally identified as traces of classically unstable orbits in certain wavefunctions of chaotic systems, have recently regained interest for their role in non-ergodic dynamics, as they retain memory of their initial states. We elucidate these features of quantum scars within the same framework of this toy model. The integrable part of the model consists of two large spins, with a classical counterpart, which we combine with a random matrix to induce ergodic behavior. Scarred states can be selectively generated from the integrable spin Hamiltonian by protecting them from the ergodic states using a projector method. Deformed projectors mimic the `quantum leakage' of scarred states, enabling tunable mixing with ergodic states and thereby controlling the degree of scarring. In this simple model, we investigate various properties of quantum scarring and shed light on different aspects of many-body quantum scars observed in more complex quantum systems. Notably, the underlying classicality can be revealed through the entanglement spectrum and the dynamics of `out-of-time-ordered correlators'.

Title: State transfer in discrete-time quantum walks via projected transition matrices
Authors: Krystal Guo, Vincent Schmeits
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze state transfer in quantum walks by using combinatorial methods. We generalize perfect state transfer in two-reflection discrete-time quantum walks to a notion that we call 'peak state transfer'; we define peak state transfer as the highest state transfer that can be achieved between an initial and a target state under unitary evolution, even when perfect state transfer is unattainable. We give a spectral characterization of peak state transfer that allows us to fully characterize peak state transfer in the arc-reversal (Grover) walk on various families of graphs, including strongly regular graphs and incidence graphs of block designs (assuming that the walk starts at a point of the design). In addition, we provide many examples of peak state transfer, including an infinite family where the amount of peak state transfer tends to $1$ as the number of vertices grows. We further demonstrate that peak state transfer properties extend to infinite families of graphs generated by vertex blow-ups, and we characterize periodicity in the vertex-face walk on toroidal grids. In our analysis, we make extensive use of the spectral decomposition of a matrix that is obtained by projecting the transition matrix down onto a subspace. Though we are motivated by a problem in quantum computing, we identify several open problems that are purely combinatorial, arising from the spectral conditions required for peak state transfer in discrete-time quantum walks.

Title: Lifshitz tail states in non-Hermitian disordered photonic lattices
Authors: Stefano Longhi
Abstract: In lattices with uncorrelated on-site potential disorder, Anderson localization near the band edges can exhibit anomalously weak localization in the form of Lifshitz tail states. These states correspond to clusters of contiguous sites with nearly identical on-site energies, allowing excitations to extend significantly beyond the characteristic localization length determined by the inverse of Lyapunov exponent. Since Lifshitz tail states are rare events, with an exponentially small density of states, they are typically considered of limited practical importance. In this work, we demonstrate that when Anderson localization is induced by disorder in an imaginary on-site potential, Lifshitz tail states can dominate the system's dynamics and become experimentally observable. This phenomenon is illustrated through the Anderson-Bernoulli model in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice, shedding light on the unique interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in such systems

Title: Robustness of chaotic-light correlation imaging against turbulence
Authors: Giovanni Scala, Gianlorenzo Massaro, Germano Borreggine, Cosmo Lupo, Milena D'Angelo, Francesco V. Pepe
Abstract: We consider an imaging scheme, inspired by microscopy, in which both correlation imaging and first-order intensity imaging can be performed simultaneously, to investigate the effects of strong turbulence on the two different kinds of images. The comparison between direct and correlation imaging in the presence of strong turbulence unambiguously revealed an advantage of the latter. Remarkably, this advantage, quantified by analyzing the visibility of periodic sample patterns, is more striking when the presence of turbulence becomes the dominant factor in determining the image resolution.

Title: Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).

Title: Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.
