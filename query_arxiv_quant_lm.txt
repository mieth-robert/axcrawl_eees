Title: Quantum Systems as Indivisible Stochastic Processes
Authors: Jacob A. Barandes
Abstract: According to the stochastic-quantum correspondence, a quantum system can be understood as a stochastic process unfolding in an old-fashioned configuration space based on ordinary notions of probability and `indivisible' stochastic laws, which are a non-Markovian generalization of the laws that describe a textbook stochastic process. The Hilbert spaces of quantum theory and their ingredients, including wave functions, can then be relegated to secondary roles as convenient mathematical appurtenances. In addition to providing an arguably more transparent way to understand and modify quantum theory, this indivisible-stochastic formulation may lead to new possible applications of the theory. This paper initiates a deeper investigation into the conceptual foundations and structure of the stochastic-quantum correspondence, with a particular focus on novel forms of gauge invariance, dynamical symmetries, and Hilbert-space dilations.

Title: Vacuum-Induced Quantum Gate
Authors: Arash Azizi
Abstract: We demonstrate that the quantum vacuum, as perceived by a uniformly accelerating observer, can be harnessed to perform a quantum Z-gate. A two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in a superposition of its ground and excited states, undergoes a second-order interaction with the vacuum, resulting in a two-photon emission. We derive the exact analytical form of the final entangled detector-field state and show that this emission is conditional on a phase flip of the detector's initial state-the defining feature of the gate's operation. This process harvests entanglement from the Minkowski vacuum, producing photon pairs entangled across causally disconnected Rindler wedges. This work reframes acceleration-induced radiation not as thermal noise but as a coherent computational resource, offering new pathways for relativistic quantum information.

Title: Probing quantum mechanics using nanoparticle Schrödinger cats
Authors: Sebastian Pedalino, Bruno E. Ramírez-Galindo, Richard Ferstl, Klaus Hornberger, Markus Arndt, Stefan Gerlich
Abstract: The quantum superposition principle is a cornerstone of physics and at the heart of many quantum technologies. Yet, it is still often regarded counterintuitive because we do not observe its key features on the macroscopic scales of our daily lives. It is therefore intriguing to ask how quantum properties persist or change as we increase the size and complexity of objects. A paradigmatic test for this question can be realized by matter-wave interferometry, where the motion of individual massive particles becomes delocalized and needs to be described by a wave function that spans regions far larger than the particle itself. Here we present an experimental platform extending matter-wave interference to a qualitatively new class of materials that can vary widely in mass and size. We specifically demonstrate quantum interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7'000 atoms at masses greater than 170'000 dalton. They propagate in a Schrödinger cat state with a macroscopicity of $\mu$ = 15.5, surpassing all previous experiments by an order of magnitude and providing the most stringent exclusion limit for generic macrorealistic modifications of the Schrödinger equation to date.

Title: Robust qubit interactions mediated by photonic topological edge states
Authors: Boris Gurevich, Weihua Xie, Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Michael H. Kolodrubetz
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.

Title: Emergence of Classicality in Wigner's Friend Scenarios
Authors: Tom Rivlin, Sophie Engineer, Veronika Baumann
Abstract: The Wigner's Friend (WF) thought experiment concerns quantum measurements by a 'superobserver' of an observer measuring a quantum system. Variations on the setup and its extended versions have seen a resurgence in recent years, in light of a series of no-go theorems that reveal new quantum effects and question the existence of absolute events. But most theoretical and experimental studies of WF scenarios have restricted themselves to a 'friend' composed of a single qubit with idealised measurement settings in an idealised lab. In this work, we consider a specific, unitary model of the interaction between the Friend and the system in the presence of a decohering environment. In particular, we study WF scenarios from the perspective of quantum Darwinism (QD). The QD framework is well-suited to studying the questions of observations and agents in quantum theory that WF scenarios raise, as it is concerned with how observers record objective information about a system with access only to its surroundings. Here we describe how to add environments to simple and extended WF scenarios in the QD framework, and present numerical results that study the emergence of classicality, in the form of the Friend's measurement result becoming more objective. In both the simple and extended cases, we also find that the model and the environment obfuscate genuine WF effects and introduce strong restrictions on them. However, we also find a novel form of WF effect that exploits coherence between the Friend and the environment.

Title: Benchmarking a Tunable Quantum Neural Network on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Hardware
Authors: Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Xingxin Liu, Richard Barney, Sarah H. Miller, Alaina M. Green, Norbert M. Linke, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.

Title: The Augmented Tree Tensor Network Cookbook
Authors: Nora Reinić, Luka Pavešić, Daniel Jaschke, Simone Montangero
Abstract: An augmented tree tensor network (aTTN) is a tensor network ansatz constructed by applying a layer of unitary disentanglers to a tree tensor network. The disentanglers absorb a part of the system's entanglement. This makes aTTNs suitable for simulating higher-dimensional lattices, where the entanglement increases with the lattice size even for states that obey the area law. These lecture notes serve as a detailed guide for implementing the aTTN algorithms. We present a variational algorithm for ground state search and discuss the measurement of observables, and offer an open-source implementation within the Quantum TEA library. We benchmark the performance of the ground state search for different parameters and hyperparameters in the square lattice quantum Ising model and the triangular lattice Heisenberg model for up to $32 \times 32$ spins. The benchmarks identify the regimes where the aTTNs offer advantages in accuracy relative to computational cost compared to matrix product states and tree tensor networks.

Title: All non-locally Realized Continuous Variable Bipartite Gaussian States are Entangled
Authors: Souvik Agasti
Abstract: We investigate the connection between entanglement and non-locality between continuous-variable bipartite Gaussian states. The investigation initiates with formulating non-locality by using the phase-space Wigner representation of Bell's function. Furthermore, our analysis shows entanglement to be necessary for nonlocality, but not sufficient for it; however, nonlocality is sufficient to ensure entanglement.

Title: Construction and Rigorous Analysis of Quantum-Like States
Authors: Ethan Dickey, Abhijeet Vyas, Sabre Kais
Abstract: Extending upon the observations of the emergence of quantum-like states from classical complex synchronized networks, this work adds mathematical rigor to the analysis of single Quantum-Like (QL) bits constructed by eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of such networks. First, we rigorously show that symmetric construction of such networks (regular undirected/symmetric bipartite graph $G_C$ connecting two regular undirected subgraphs $G_A,\,G_B$) leads to an equal superposition of the $|+\rangle, |-\rangle$ Hadamard states (with basis $|0\rangle,\,|1\rangle$ set from eigenvectors of the subgraphs), and provide an analysis of sufficient conditions on the network for construction of such states. Second, we prove two methods to construct any arbitrary single qubit state $|\psi\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle,\, |a|^2+|b|^2=1$ and provide a switching lemma for the boundaries of both methods. The first method of construction is by detuning the regularities of the two subgraphs and the second is by asymmetrically constructing the bipartite connection matrix $C$ by allowing it to be directed, and then detuning those regularities. While the intuition is derived from the motivation of using complex synchronized networks for quantum information storage and computations, the proofs for constructing eigenvectors that interact in a quantum-like fashion only require the structure of the graph embedded in the adjacency matrix. Practically, this means that synchronization is not important to creating quantum-like bits, only that the edge weights are generally unit or close to unit and that the subgraphs are regular. As such, the results on combinations of random k-regular graphs (precisely Erdős-Rényi graphs) may be independently interesting.

Title: Orthogonalization speed-up from quantum coherence after a sudden quench
Authors: Beatrice Donelli, Gabriele De Chiara, Francesco Scazza, Stefano Gherardini
Abstract: We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon reminiscent of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC) that arises in the transient dynamics following an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic and initial superposition states vanishes with a power law scaling with the number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and with an exponent that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped cold-atom system.

Title: On Post-Quantum Cryptography Authentication for Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Juan Antonio Vieira Giestinhas, Timothy Spiller
Abstract: The traditional way for a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) user to join a quantum network is by authenticating themselves using pre-shared key material. While this approach is sufficient for small-scale networks, it becomes impractical as the network grows, due to the total quadratic increase in the number of pre-shared keys required. To address this scalability issue, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) combined with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) offers a more scalable solution, allowing users to authenticate the QKD traffic remotely to obtain information-theoretical secure (ITS) keys under the presented assumptions. Unlike traditional PKI, which relies on classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, the approach presented in this paper leverages PQC algorithms that are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks. Similarly to the SIGMA or TLS protocols, authentication, confidentiality, and integrity are achievable against bounded adversaries to ensure secure and scalable quantum networks.

Title: Pushing the Limits of LLMs in Quantum Operations
Authors: Dayton C. Closser, Zbigniew J. Kabala
Abstract: What is the fastest Artificial Intelligence Large Language Model (AI LLM) for generating quantum operations? To answer this, we present the first benchmarking study comparing popular and publicly available AI models tasked with creating quantum gate designs. The Wolfram Mathematica framework was used to interface with the 4 AI LLMs, including WolframLLM, OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek. This comparison evaluates both the time taken by each AI LLM platform to generate quantum operations (including networking times), as well as the execution time of these operations in Python, within Jupyter Notebook. Our results show that overall, Gemini is the fastest AI LLM in producing quantum gate designs. At the same time, the AI LLMs tested achieved working quantum operations 80% of the time. These findings highlight a promising horizon where publicly available Large Language Models can become fast collaborators with quantum computers, enabling rapid quantum gate synthesis and paving the way for greater interoperability between two remarkable and cutting-edge technologies.

Title: On Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Filtering of Stochastic Volatility Models
Authors: Eric Ghysels, Jack Morgan, Hamed Mohammadbagherpoor
Abstract: Stochastic volatility models are the backbone of financial engineering. We study both continuous time diffusions as well as discrete time models. We propose two novel approaches to estimating stochastic volatility diffusions, one using Quantum-Inspired Classical Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and the other using Quantum Hidden Markov Models. In both cases we have approximate likelihood functions and filtering algorithms that are easy to compute. We show that the non-asymptotic bounds for the quantum HMM are tighter compared to those with classical model estimates.

Title: Resource-Free Quantum Hamiltonian Learning Below the Standard Quantum Limit
Authors: Bora Baran, Timothy Heightman
Abstract: Accurate and resource-efficient estimation of quantum Hamiltonians is crucial for developing practical quantum technologies, yet current methods typically demand entanglement resources or dynamical control. Here, we demonstrate a method that surpasses the standard quantum limit without requiring entanglement resources, coherent measurements, or dynamical control. Our method relies on trajectory-based Hamiltonian learning, in which we apply local, randomized pre-processing to probe states and apply the maximum-likelihood estimation to optimally scheduled Pauli measurements. Analytically, we establish the emergence of a transient Heisenberg-limited regime for short-time probes for our procedure. Furthermore, we outline how to estimate all Hamiltonian parameters in parallel using ensembles of probe states, removing the need for parameter isolation and structural priors. Finally, we supplement our findings with a numerical study, learning multiple disordered, anisotropic Heisenberg models for a 1D chain of spin-1/2 particles, featuring local transverse fields with both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbour interactions, as well as a gapless XXZ Hamiltonian. Our numerics show that our method needs only one shot per Pauli measurement, making it well-suited for experimental scenarios. The code for our method is available online and open-source.

Title: Towards self-correcting quantum codes for neutral atom arrays
Authors: Jinkang Guo, Yifan Hong, Adam Kaufman, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: Discovering low-overhead quantum error-correcting codes is of significant interest for fault-tolerant quantum computation. For hardware capable of long-range connectivity, the bivariate bicycle codes offer significant overhead reduction compared to surface codes with similar performance. In this work, we present "ZSZ codes", a simple non-abelian generalization of the bivariate bicycle codes based on the group $\mathbb{Z}_\ell \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_m$. We numerically demonstrate that certain instances of this code family achieve competitive performance with the bivariate bicycle codes under circuit-level depolarizing noise using a belief-propagation and ordered-statistics decoder, with an observed threshold around $0.5\%$. We also benchmark the performance of this code family under local "self-correcting" decoders, where we observe significant improvements over the bivariate bicycle codes, including evidence of a sustainable threshold around $0.095\%$, which is higher than the $0.06\%$ that we estimate for the four-dimensional toric code under the same noise model. These results suggest that ZSZ codes are promising candidates for scalable self-correcting quantum memories. Finally, we describe how ZSZ codes can be realized with neutral atoms trapped in movable tweezer arrays, where a complete round of syndrome extraction can be achieved using simple global motions of the atomic arrays.

Title: Dissipation in the Broadband and Ultrastrong Coupling Regimes of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: An \emph{Ab Initio} Quantized Quasinormal Mode Approach
Authors: Chris Gustin, Juanjuan Ren, Sebastian Franke, Stephen Hughes
Abstract: Phenomenological approaches to photon loss have long been the workhorse of cavity-QED, but prove inadequate in the presence of sufficiently broadband light-matter interactions. We present a rigorous and \emph{ab initio} derivation of a quantum master equation for a quantized optical cavity mode coupled to a dipole, using a quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization procedure for plasmonic and dielectric open-system cavity-QED, which is valid in broadband light-matter interaction regimes, including ultrastrong coupling (USC). The theory supports general three-dimensional resonators with arbitrary dispersion and loss, and thus can be applied to a wide range of open cavities. Our \emph{ab initio} and gauge-invariant approach fully recovers the recent result of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized cavity with a single dipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum correspondence for bosonic Hopfield model systems, and reveals important departures from previous heuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We identify a new criterion for what we term the ``broadband'' dissipative regime of cavity-QED, where phenomenological models require corrections in accordance with the intrinsic and spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also shed light on \emph{fundamental limits} to single-mode models in extreme coupling regimes. Using plasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show validity ranges of our QNM master equation and spectral USC calculations, and discuss prospects for near-term experimental observation of broadband dissipative effects.

Title: Security loophole in error verification in quantum key distribution
Authors: Toyohiro Tsurumaru, Akihiro Mizutani, Toshihiko Sasaki
Abstract: The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is evaluated based on the secrecy of Alice's key and the correctness of the keys held by Alice and Bob. A practical method for ensuring correctness is known as error verification, in which Alice and Bob reveal a portion of their reconciled keys and check whether the revealed information matches. In this paper, we argue that when the verification is executed in QKD protocols, it must be assumed that its outcome is leaked to Eve. However, we observe that some existing security proofs for QKD protocols that abort based on this outcome do not explicitly take into account the information leakage associated with this outcome. To address this problem, we present a simple and practical method that builds on Renner's approach using the leftover hash lemma. Specifically, we show that even if verification's outcome is leaked to Eve, the security can still be guaranteed by increasing the number of bits reduced in privacy amplification by just one bit. This result, presenting a method to incorporate a key step in practical QKD protocols into security proofs, is expected to play an important role in future standardization and formal certification of QKD protocols.

Title: Long-distance free-space quantum key distribution with continuous variables

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) enables remote users to share high-rate and unconditionally secure secret keys while maintaining compatibility with classical optical communication networks and effective resistance against background noise. However, CVQKD experiments have only been demonstrated indoors or over short outdoor distances. Here, by developing channel-fluctuation-independent high-precision manipulation of continuous-variable quantum states, high-accuracy quantum signal acquisition and processing, and high-efficiency free-space acquisition, tracking, and pointing technology, we overcome the excess noise due to atmospheric effects especially in daylight without extra wavelength conversion and spectral filtering, and demonstrate for the first time long-distance free-space quantum key distribution over 7-km inland and 9.6-km maritime atmospheric channels with Gaussian-modulated coherent states. This achieved distribution distance of secure quantum secret keys is well beyond the atmosphere's effective thickness, offering a promising alternative for realizing satellite-based quantum cryptography communication in daylight. Moreover, given that the CVQKD system is naturally compatible with existing ground fiber telecommunication networks, it marks an essential step for realizing integrated air-ground quantum access networks with cross-domain applications.

Title: Quantum-Classical Boundary Engineering in Weak-to-Strong Measurements via Squeezed Vacua
Authors: Janarbek Yuanbek, Wen-Long Ma, Yusuf Turek
Abstract: This study establishes a post-selected von Neumann framework to regulate non-classical features of single-photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum (SPSSV) and two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states during weak-to-strong measurement transitions. By synergizing Wigner-Yanase skew information, Amplitude Squared (AS) squeezing, sum squeezing, and photon statistics, we demonstrate weak value amplification as a unified control mechanism for quantum properties. Phase-space analysis via the Husimi Kano Q function reveals a critical transition: as coupling strength increases, SPSSV and TMSV states evolve from quantum non-Gaussianity to classical single-peak separability, marking a quantum-classical boundary crossing. This critical point is validated as the optimal threshold for noise suppression and signal enhancement in quantum metrology. The work provides a tunable platform for quantum sensing and weak-signal detection technologies.

Title: An em algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machines
Authors: Takeshi Kimura, Kohtaro Kato, Masahito Hayashi
Abstract: We develop a quantum version of the em algorithm for training quantum Boltzmann machines. The em algorithm is an information-geometric extension of the well-known expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, offering a structured alternative to gradient-based methods with potential advantages in stability and convergence. We implement the algorithm on a semi-quantum restricted Boltzmann machine, where quantum effects are confined to the hidden layer. This structure enables analytical update rules while preserving quantum expressivity. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves stable learning and outperforms gradient-based training in several cases. These results demonstrate the potential of information-geometric optimization for quantum machine learning, particularly in settings where standard methods struggle due to non-commutativity or vanishing gradients.

Title: Foundations of Relational Quantum Field Theory I: Scalars
Authors: Samuel Fedida, Jan Głowacki
Abstract: We develop foundations for a relational approach to quantum field theory (RQFT) based on the operational quantum reference frames (QRFs) framework considered in a relativistic setting. Unlike other efforts in combining QFT with QRFs, we use the latter to provide novel mathematical and conceptual foundations for the former. We focus on scalar fields in Minkowski spacetime and discuss the emergence of relational local (bounded) observables and (pointwise) fields from the consideration of Poincaré-covariant (quantum) frame observables defined over the space of (classical) inertial reference frames. We recover a relational notion of Poincaré covariance, with transformations on the system directly linked to the state preparations of the QRF. We introduce and analyse various causality conditions and how they can arise as a consequence of the properties of the frame itself. The theory makes direct contact with established foundational approaches to QFT: we demonstrate that the vacuum expectation values derived within our framework reproduce many of the essential properties of Wightman functions, carry out a detailed comparison of the proposed formalism with Wightman QFT with the frame smearing functions describing the QRF's localisation uncertainty playing the role of the Wightmanian test functions, and show how the algebras generated by relational local observables satisfy all of the core axioms of Algebraic QFT. We finish with an extensive outlook describing a number of further research directions. This work is an early step in revisiting the mathematical foundations of QFT from a relational and operational perspective.

Title: Complete Positivity of Subsystems in Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Anumita Mukhopadhyay, Praggnyamita Ghosh, Shibdas Roy
Abstract: Although many quantum channels satisfy Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) condition, there are valid quantum channels that can be non-completely positive (NCP). In a search of the conditions of noisy evolution to be a useful resource for quantum computing, we study the relation of complete positivity (CP) with unitality, where we find that a map must be non-unital in order to be NCP, but not vice-versa. As memory effects can provide advantages in the dynamics of noisy quantum systems, we investigate the relative CP condition and the CP-divisibility condition of the system and environment subsystems of a joint system-environment quantum state evolving noiselessly. We show that the system and environment channels must be both CP (NCP) or CP-divisible (CP-indivisible) for the evolution in the joint system-environment space to be unitary. We illustrate our results with examples of Bell state created from $|00\rangle$, GHZ state created from $|000\rangle$, W state created from $|100\rangle$, and the partial transpose (PT) operation acting on the Bell state.

Title: Constructive Quantum Field Theory on Curved Surfaces and Related Topics
Authors: Jiasheng Lin
Abstract: This is the Ph.D. thesis of the author. In this thesis, we construct the $ P(\phi)_2 $ Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model on curved surfaces and show that it satisfies Segal's axioms (arXiv:2403.12804). An important ingredient in this construction is the use of a local regularization procedure to define the interaction as a random variable with respect to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). We provide a counterexample demonstrating that spectral truncation regularization violates locality (arXiv:2312.15511). We then explain how Segal's formalism can be extended to the gluing of surfaces with slits, which offers a geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy. Using this interpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field Theory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity corresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We then show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This allows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese (arXiv:2501.19014). Finally, Segal's formalism is also related to the asymptotics of zeta determinants on surfaces of large genus where the genus tends to infinity (arXiv:2505.01586). We provide a geometric proof--independent of Segal's axioms--of the corresponding result using heat kernels, in addition to another proof based on Segal's axioms. Both proofs are presented in the thesis.

Title: High-harmonic generation under electronic strong coupling: A time-dependent combined quantum electrodynamics/quantum chemistry study
Authors: Paul A. Albrecht, Eric W. Fischer, Tillmann Klamroth, Peter Saalfrank
Abstract: The creation of light-matter hybrid states, polaritons, in a cavity offers new intriguing opportunities to manipulate the electronic structure and electron dynamics of atoms and molecules. Here, we investigate the effect of electronic strong coupling (ESC) between atoms or molecules and field modes of a Fabry-Pérot cavity on High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) spectra within a theoretical model study. We assume that the atom or molecule is driven by an intense classical laser field, giving rise to HHG, while being strongly coupled to quantized cavity modes as described by the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in the framework of molecular quantum electrodynamics (QED). Specifically, as a test case, we first consider a model Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional hydrogen atom coupled to a cavity mode, which can be treated ``numerically exact'' using grid methods. Further, a hydrogen molecule coupled to a cavity mode is considered and treated within a recently suggested QED-TD-CI (Quantum Electrodynamics Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction) method [Weidman $\textit{et al.}$, J. Chem. Phys. $\textbf{160}$, 094111 (2024)]. The resulting HHG spectra show (i) a suppression of the harmonic cutoff in line with excitation of quantum light in the cavity and, in some cases, (ii) enhancement of some harmonics of the coupled light-matter system.

Title: Solving a real-world modular logistic scheduling problem with a quantum-classical metaheuristics
Authors: Florian Krellner, Abhishek Awasthi, Nico Kraus, Sarah Braun, Michael Poppel, Daniel Porawski
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of a quantum-classical metaheuristic and a traditional classical mathematical programming solver, applied to two mathematical optimization models for an industry-relevant scheduling problem with autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs). The two models are: (1) a time-indexed mixed-integer linear program, and (2) a novel binary optimization problem with linear and quadratic constraints and a linear objective. Our experiments indicate that optimization methods are very susceptible to modeling techniques and different solvers require dedicated methods. We show in this work that quantum-classical metaheuristics can benefit from a new way of modeling mathematical optimization problems. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison of the two solution methods for each optimization model.

Title: Quantum coherence leveraged agnostic phase estimation
Authors: H. S. Karthik
Abstract: Quantum metrology concerns improving the estimation of an unknown parameter using an optimal measurement scheme on the quantum system. More the optimality of the measurement, the better will be the improvement in sensing the value of the unknown parameter. Pertaining to the case of a two level system (qubit) undergoing rotation, a typical metrological task concerns the estimation of the angle of rotation ($\tau$) given the information about the axis of rotation ($\theta,\phi$). The method for garnering information about ($\tau)$ is through maximizing the Fisher information. In the absence of the axis-knowledge, the optimality of the metrological task reduces drastically. Drawing inspiration from recent works leveraging entanglement to connect closed time-like curves and metrology, we overcome this limitation (lack of the knowledge of the rotation axis) using an ancilla assisted protocol. Here, the probe and the ancilla interact through a coherently controlled superposition of unitary evolutions. The quantum coherence in the initial state of the ancilla forms as the resource aiding the protocol. By measuring the ancilla in the same coherent basis in which it was prepared, we achieve optimal Fisher information about the rotation angle, independent of the axis parameters. Notably, this resource-efficient and operationally simple agnostic sensing alternative is independent of both the entanglement in the initial joint state of the probe and the ancilla and entangling measurements, yet accounts for maximum Fisher information about the angle of rotation.

Title: Hierarchy of entanglement detection criteria for random high-dimensional states
Authors: Akhil Kumar Awasthi, Sudipta Mondal, Rivu Gupta, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Entanglement is a cornerstone in quantum information science, yet detecting it efficiently remains a challenging task. Focusing on non-positive partially transposed (NPT) states, we establish a hierarchy among entropy-based, majorization, realignment, and reduction criteria for Haar uniformly generated random states in finite dimensions, analyzing their performance based on rank and subsystem dimension. We prove lower bounds on the rank of mixed quantum states beyond which the realignment and entropic criteria fail to detect entanglement. We evaluate the relative effectiveness of the considered detection methods using three key indicators -- fraction of detected states, mean detectable entanglement, and minimum required entanglement. Our results provide insights into the entanglement thresholds needed for reliable detection, showing that, beyond a certain level of entanglement, all criteria become equally powerful for low-rank states, while hierarchy among various criteria emerges with moderate to high ranks. Intriguingly, the proposed ordering among the considered criteria in qubit-qudit systems is different from that in higher dimensions. Additionally, we establish that the detection efficiency is influenced by the asymmetry in the subsystem dimensions, by illustrating how the realignment criterion behaves more efficiently than other detection methods when the difference between the subsystem dimensions is small.

Title: Sampling (noisy) quantum circuits through randomized rounding
Authors: Victor Martinez, Omar Fawzi, Daniel Stilck França
Abstract: The present era of quantum processors with hundreds to thousands of noisy qubits has sparked interest in understanding the computational power of these devices and how to leverage it to solve practically relevant problems. For applications that require estimating expectation values of observables the community developed a good understanding of how to simulate them classically and denoise them. Certain applications, like combinatorial optimization, however demand more than expectation values: the bit-strings themselves encode the candidate solutions. While recent impossibility and threshold results indicate that noisy samples alone rarely beat classical heuristics, we still lack classical methods to replicate those noisy samples beyond the setting of random quantum circuits. Focusing on problems whose objective depends only on two-body correlations such as Max-Cut, we show that Gaussian randomized rounding in the spirit of Goemans-Williamson applied to the circuit's two-qubit marginals-produces a distribution whose expected cost is provably close to that of the noisy quantum device. For instance, for Max-Cut problems we show that for any depth-D circuit affected by local depolarizing noise p, our sampler achieves an approximation ratio $1-O[(1-p)^D]$, giving ways to efficiently sample from a distribution that behaves similarly to the noisy circuit for the problem at hand. Beyond theory we run large-scale simulations and experiments on IBMQ hardware, confirming that the rounded samples faithfully reproduce the full energy distribution, and we show similar behaviour under other various noise models. Our results supply a simple classical surrogate for sampling noisy optimization circuits, clarify the realistic power of near-term hardware for combinatorial tasks, and provide a quantitative benchmark for future error-mitigated or fault-tolerant demonstrations of quantum advantage.

Title: Data-driven quantum Koopman method for simulating nonlinear dynamics
Authors: Baoyang Zhang, Zhen Lu, Yaomin Zhao, Yue Yang
Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.

Title: On the emergence of quantum memory in non-Markovian dynamics
Authors: Alexander Yosifov, Aditya Iyer, Vlatko Vedral, Jinzhao Sun
Abstract: Quantum systems are often hindered by decoherence due to impact from the environment. While memoryless Markovian collision models are commonly used to approximate such evolution, non-Markovian dynamics (with memory) is typical in practice, with memory effects being harnessed as a resource for many tasks like quantum error correction and information processing. Yet, the type of memory, classical or quantum, necessary to realize the dynamics of many collision models is not known. In this work, we extend the quantum homogenizer to the non-Markovian regime by introducing intra-ancilla interactions mediated by Fredkin gates, and study the nature of its memory. Using entanglement measures and relying only on the local dynamics as a witness, we prove the model can be realized with either classical or quantum memory, depending on the initialization of the reservoir and the propagation of non-classical correlations within the reservoir. We further explore how quantum memory emerges across a wide range of practical scenarios. The results shed light on the origin of memory in open quantum systems and can advent the design of near-term quantum technologies for a variety of applications.

Title: A Grover-Based Quantum Algorithm for Solving Perfect Mazes via Fitness-Guided Search
Authors: Michelle L. Wu
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving perfect mazes by casting the pathfinding task as a structured search problem. Building on Grover's amplitude amplification, the algorithm encodes all candidate paths in superposition and evaluates their proximity to the goal using a reversible fitness operator based on quantum arithmetic. A Grover-compatible oracle marks high-fitness states, and an adaptive cutoff strategy refines the search iteratively. We provide formal definitions, unitary constructions, and convergence guarantees, along with a resource analysis showing efficient scaling with maze size and path length. The framework serves as a foundation for quantum-hybrid pathfinding and planning. The full algorithmic pipeline is specified from encoding to amplification, including oracle design and fitness evaluation. The approach is readily extensible to other search domains, including navigation over tree-like or acyclic graphs.

Title: Pauli Measurements Are Near-Optimal for Single-Qubit Tomography
Authors: Jayadev Acharya, Abhilash Dharmavarapu, Yuhan Liu, Nengkun Yu
Abstract: We provide the first non-trivial lower bounds for single-qubit tomography algorithms and show that at least ${\Omega}\left(\frac{10^N}{\sqrt{N} \varepsilon^2}\right)$ copies are required to learn an $N$-qubit state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d},d=2^N$ to within $\varepsilon$ trace distance. Pauli measurements, the most commonly used single-qubit measurement scheme, have recently been shown to require at most $O\left(\frac{10^N}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ copies for this problem. Combining these results, we nearly settle the long-standing question of the complexity of single-qubit tomography.

Title: Quantum generative modeling for financial time series with temporal correlations
Authors: David Dechant, Eliot Schwander, Lucas van Drooge, Charles Moussa, Diego Garlaschelli, Vedran Dunjko, Jordi Tura
Abstract: Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a method for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods. We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation method.

Title: Supervised Quantum Image Processing
Authors: Marco Parigi, Mehran Khosrojerdi, Filippo Caruso, Leonardo Banchi
Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.

Title: Variational Quantum Sensing for Structured Linear Function Estimation
Authors: Priyam Srivastava, Vivek Kumar, Gurudev Dutt, Kaushik P. Seshadreesan
Abstract: We study the variational optimization of entangled probe states for quantum sensing tasks involving the estimation of a structured linear function of local phase parameters. Specifically, we consider scenarios where each qubit in a spin-1/2 array accumulates a phase phi_i = alpha_i * theta, with a known weight vector alpha, reducing the task to single-parameter estimation of theta. Using parameterized quantum circuits composed of dipolar-interacting gates and global rotations, we optimize probe states with respect to the Classical Fisher Information (CFI) using a gradient-free evolutionary strategy. We benchmark the optimized circuits for two relevant cases: (i) uniform encoding, where all qubits contribute equally to the phase function, and (ii) a custom encoding where a central qubit dominates the weight vector. In both cases, the optimized probe states approach the respective entanglement-enhanced (EE) limits dictated by the encoding structure. Our results demonstrate the power of variational approaches for tailoring metrologically useful entanglement to specific estimation tasks in quantum sensor networks.

Title: Pitfalls when tackling the exponential concentration of parameterized quantum models
Authors: Reyhaneh Aghaei Saem, Behrang Tafreshi, Zoë Holmes, Supanut Thanasilp
Abstract: Identifying scalable circuit architectures remains a central challenge in variational quantum computing and quantum machine learning. Many approaches have been proposed to mitigate or avoid the barren plateau phenomenon or, more broadly, exponential concentration. However, due to the intricate interplay between quantum measurements and classical post-processing, we argue these techniques often fail to circumvent concentration effects in practice. Here, by analyzing concentration at the level of measurement outcome probabilities and leveraging tools from hypothesis testing, we develop a practical framework for diagnosing whether a parameterized quantum model is inhibited by exponential concentration. Applying this framework, we argue that several widely used methods (including quantum natural gradient, sample-based optimization, and certain neural-network-inspired initializations) do not overcome exponential concentration with finite measurement budgets, though they may still aid training in other ways.

Title: On the Generalization of Kitaev Codes as Generalized Bicycle Codes
Authors: François Arnault, Philippe Gaborit, Nicolas Saussay
Abstract: Surface codes have historically been the dominant choice for quantum error correction due to their superior error threshold performance. However, recently, a new class of Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes, constructed from binary circulant matrices with three non-zero elements per row, achieved comparable performance with fewer physical qubits and higher encoding efficiency. In this article, we focus on a subclass of GB codes, which are constructed from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two non-zero elements per row. We introduce a family of codes that generalizes both standard and optimized Kitaev codes for which we have a lower bound on their minimum distance, ensuring performance better than standard Kitaev codes. These codes exhibit parameters of the form $ [| 2n , 2, \geq \sqrt{n} |] $ where $ n$ is a factor of $ 1 + d^2 $. For code lengths below 200, our analysis yields $21$ codes, including $7$ codes from Pryadko and Wang's database, and unveils $14$ new codes with enhanced minimum distance compared to standard Kitaev codes. Among these, $3$ surpass all previously known weight-4 GB codes for distances $4$, $8$, and $12$.

Title: Quantum Geometry of Data

Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our understanding of cognitive phenomena within the framework of quantum cognition.

Title: NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standard Algorithms Based on Quantum Random Number Generators
Authors: Abel C. H. Chen
Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed potential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to resist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in certain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These algorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve as the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital signature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along with the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the statistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests for verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed (IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six QRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and QRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future deployment of PQC systems.

Title: Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice
Authors: Yi-Ting Tu, David M. Long, Dominic V. Else
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.

Title: (2,2)-GB Codes: Classification and Comparison with weight-4 Surface Codes
Authors: François Arnault, Philippe Gaborit, Nicolas Saussay
Abstract: Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes offer a compelling alternative to surface codes for quantum error correction. This paper focuses on (2,2)-Generalized Bicycle codes, constructed from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two non-zero elements per row. Leveraging a lower bound on their minimum distance, we construct three novel infinite families of optimal (2,2)-GB codes with parameters [[ 2n^2, 2, n ]], [[ 4r^2, 2, 2r ]], and [[(2t + 1)^2 + 1, 2, 2t + 1 ]]. These families match the performance of Kitaev's toric code and the best 2D weight-4 surface codes, reaching known theoretical limits. In particular, the second family breaks a long-held belief by providing optimal even-distance GB codes, previously deemed impossible. All are CSS codes derived from Cayley graphs. Recognizing that standard equivalence relations do not preserve their CSS structure, we introduce a CSS-preserving equivalence relation for rigorous comparison of Cayley graph-based CSS codes. Under this framework, the first two families are inequivalent to all previously known optimal weight-4 2D surface codes, while the third family is equivalent to the best-known odd-distance 2D surface code. Finally, we classify all extremal, non-equivalent (2,2)-GB codes with length below 200 and present a comparison table with existing notable 2D weight-4 surface codes.

Title: Anomaly-free symmetries with obstructions to gauging and onsiteability
Authors: Wilbur Shirley, Carolyn Zhang, Wenjie Ji, Michael Levin
Abstract: We present counterexamples to the lore that symmetries that cannot be gauged or made on-site are necessarily anomalous. Specifically, we construct unitary, internal symmetries of two-dimensional lattice models that cannot be consistently coupled to background or dynamical gauge fields or disentangled to a tensor product of on-site operators. These symmetries are nevertheless anomaly-free in the sense that they admit symmetric, gapped Hamiltonians with unique, invertible ground states. We show that symmetries of this kind are characterized by an index $[\omega]\in H^2(G,\mathbb{Q}_+)$, where $\mathbb{Q}_+$ is the multiplicative group of rational numbers labeling one-dimensional quantum cellular automata.

Title: The Non-Abelian Casimir Effect for Plates, Symmetrical Tube and Box on the Lattice
Authors: B. A. Ngwenya, A. K. Rothkopf, W. A. Horowitz
Abstract: We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D in the confined and deconfined phase. For the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D are explored and we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical tube and symmetrical box is attractive. The Casimir potential for the tube differs from the massless non-interacting scalar field theory prediction, where a repulsive Casimir potential is expected. Unlike the parallel plate geometry where the plate-size is fixed, in the case of the tube and box, the sizes of the faces forming the walls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We propose various methods that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating the boundaries. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a deconfined phase does not alter the Casimir potential. This observation is consistent with prior work suggesting that the region inside the walls is a boundary induced deconfined phase.

Title: Enhancing Spectroscopy and Microscopy with Emerging Methods in Photon-Correlation and Quantum Illumination
Authors: Chieh Tsao, Haonan Ling, Alex Hinkle, Yifan Chen, Keshav Kumar Jha, Zhen-Li Yan, Hendrik Utzat
Abstract: Quantum optics has driven major advances in our ability to generate and detect correlations between individual photons. Its principles are now increasingly translated into nanoscale characterization techniques, enhancing spectroscopy, microscopy, and metrology. In this Review, we highlight rapid progress in the field driven by advances in single-photon detectors and quantum light sources, including time-resolved single-photon counting cameras, superconducting nanowire detectors, and increasingly bright sources of entangled photons. We emphasize emerging applications in super-resolution microscopy, measurements below classical noise limits, and photon-number-resolved spectroscopy-a powerful paradigm for probing nanoscale electronic materials and molecular dynamics. We conclude by outlining key technological challenges and future opportunities across materials science and bio-nanophotonics.

Title: Non-interacting fractional topological Stark insulator
Authors: Yi-Hong Chen, Si-Yuan Chen, Xin-Chi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Fractional topological phases, such as the fractional quantum Hall state, usually rely on strong interactions to generate ground state degeneracy with gap protection and fractionalized topological response. Here, we propose a fractional topological phase without interaction in $(1+1)$-dimension, which is driven by the Stark localization on top of topological flat bands, different from the conventional mechanism of the strongly correlated fractional topological phases. A linear potential gradient applied to the flat bands drives the Stark localization, under which the Stark localized states may hybridize and leads to a new gap in the real space, dubbed the real space energy gap (RSEG). Unlike the integer topological band insulator obtained in the weak linear potential regime without closing the original bulk gap, the fractional topological Stark insulating phase is resulted from the RSEG when the linear potential gradient exceeds a critical value. We develop a theoretical formalism to characterize the fractional topological Stark insulator, and further show that the many-body state under topological pumping returns to the initial state only after multiple $2\pi$ periods of evolution, giving the fractional charge pumping, similar to that in fractional quantum Hall state. Finally, we propose how to realize the fractional topological Stark insulator in real experiment.

Title: Dynamics of a Mobile Ion in a Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Piotr Wysocki, Marek Tylutki, Krzysztof Jachymski
Abstract: Characterization of the dynamics of an impurity immersed in a quantum medium is vital for fundamental understanding of matter as well as applications in modern day quantum technologies. The case of strong and long-ranged interactions is of particular importance here, as it opens the possibility to leverage quantum correlations in controlling the system properties. Here, we consider a charged impurity moving in a bosonic gas and study its properties out of equilibrium. We extract the stationary momentum of the ion at long times, which is nonzero due to the superfluid nature of the medium, and the effective mass which stems from dressing the impurity with the host atoms. The nonlinear evolution leads not only to emission of density waves, but also momentum transfer back to the ion, resulting in the possibility of oscillatory dynamics.

Title: Antirealism in sheep's clothing: Wave function realism and scientific realism
Authors: Raoni Arroyo, Jonas R. Becker Arenhart
Abstract: Scientific realism is the philosophical stance that science tracks truth, in particular in its depiction of the world's ontology. Ontologically, this involves a commitment to the existence of entities posited by our best scientific theories; metaontologically, it includes the claim that the theoretical framework itself is true. In this article, we examine wave function realism as a case study within this broader methodological debate. Wave function realism holds that the wave function, as described by quantum mechanics, corresponds to a real physical entity. We focus on a recent formulation of this view that commits to the ontology of the wave function while deliberately avoiding the metaontological question of the framework's truth. Instead, the view is defended on pragmatic, non-truth-conductive grounds. This, we argue, raises tensions for the purported realism of wave function realism and its compatibility with scientific realism more broadly.

Title: Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate
Authors: Elrina Hartman, Michael E Tobar, Ben T McAllister, Jeremy F Bourhill, Andreas Erb, Maxim Goryachev
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.09$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.11$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.797 \pm 0.088$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.442 \pm 0.104$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.

Title: Vibronic spectra at nonzero temperatures from Herman-Kluk coherence thermofield dynamics
Authors: Fabian Kröninger, Caroline Lasser, Jiří J. L. Vaníček
Abstract: We combine the semiclassical Herman--Kluk approximation with the coherence thermofield dynamics in order to evaluate vibrationally resolved electronic spectra at nonzero temperatures. In coherence thermofield dynamics, the dipole time correlation function is rewritten exactly as a wavepacket autocorrelation function, and the corresponding wavepacket is a solution to a zero-temperature time-dependent Schrödinger equation on an augmented configuration space of doubled dimension. We derive the Herman--Kluk representation for the thermofield wavepacket autocorrelation function and demonstrate how it can be computed from individual trajectories. To analyze this method, we compare spectra of Morse potentials of increasing anharmonicity evaluated at various temperatures with a numerically exact approach, with the Herman--Kluk coherence thermofield dynamics, and with the single-trajectory thawed Gaussian coherence thermofield dynamics. At low anharmonicity, both approximate methods yield accurate spectra. However, in a Morse potential with higher anharmonicity, the thawed Gaussian thermofield dynamics, based on the local harmonic approximation, fails to capture emerging hot bands, whereas the Herman--Kluk thermofield approach successfully reproduces them.

Title: Refined approach to cellularization: going from Heller's thawed Gaussian approximation to the Herman--Kluk propagator
Authors: Sergey V. Antipov, Fabian Kröninger, Jiří J. L. Vaníček
Abstract: We present a refined cellularization (Filinov filtering) scheme for the semiclassical Herman--Kluk propagator, which employs the inverse Weierstrass transform and optimal scaling of the cell's size with the number of cells, and was previously used only in the context of the dephasing representation. In the new methodology, the sampling density for the cell centers correlates with the cell size, allowing for an effective sampling of the phase space covered by the initial state of the system. The main advantage of the presented approach is that, unlike the standard cellularization, it converges to the original Herman--Kluk result in the limit of an infinite number of trajectories and to the thawed Gaussian approximation when a single trajectory is used. We illustrate the performance of the refined cellularization scheme by calculating autocorrelation functions and spectra of both integrable and chaotic model systems.

Title: Comparing Visual Qubit Representations in Quantum Education: The Bloch sphere Enhances Task Efficiency
Authors: Linda Qerimi, Sarah Malone, Eva Rexigel, Jochen Kuhn, Stefan Küchemann
Abstract: Visual-graphical qubit representations offer a means to introduce abstract quantum concepts - such as quantum state, superposition, or measurement - in an accessible manner, particularly for learners with low prior knowledge. Building on a previous expert rating of mechanisms of qubit representations, this study compared two representations - Bloch sphere and Quantum Bead - in terms of learning outcomes, task performance, cognitive load, and mid-term retention. The study was conducted with N=149 school students. The study assessed conceptual understanding, application-oriented task performance by measuring accuracy per time, and cognitive load. A follow-up test after 1-2 weeks assessed mid-term retention. Results showed no significant effect of representation type on post-test learning outcomes. However, process data revealed that learners using the Bloch sphere completed application-oriented tasks significantly more efficiently. The cognitive load was similar in both groups. Mid-term retention of quantum concepts was stable across groups, and early learning performance emerged as the strongest predictor of mid-term retention. In conclusion, these findings emphasize that instructional impact is not solely determined by outcome measures, but also by how representations influence cognitive processing, task integration, and learners' interaction with complex content.

Title: Static and Dynamical Characterization of Ground State Phases Induced by Frustration and Magnetic Field in the Spin-1 Orthogonal Dimer Chain
Authors: Ernest Ong, Dhiman Bhowmick, Sharoz Schezwen, Pinaki Sengupta
Abstract: The spin-$1$ orthogonal dimer chain is investigated using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. A transformation to a basis that uses the local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin states for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the symmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration) and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully selected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are complemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of the dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the emergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong interactions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for interacting S=1 Heisenberg spins.

Title: Heating Dynamics of Correlated Fermions under Dephasing
Authors: Antonio Picano, Matthieu Vanhoecke, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of correlated fermions evolving in presence of a local dephasing bath. To this extent we consider the infinite coordination limit of the corresponding Lindblad master equation, provided by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for open quantum systems. We solve the resulting quantum impurity problem, describing an Anderson impurity coupled to a local dephasing, using weak-coupling perturbation theory in interaction and dephasing. We show that the dissipative dynamics describes heating towards infinite temperature, with a relaxation rate that depends strongly on interaction. The resulting steady-state spectral functions are however non-trivial and show an interplay between coherent quasiparticle peak and local dephasing. We then discuss how thermalization towards infinite temperature emerges within DMFT, by solving the impurity problem throughout its self-consistency. We show that thermalization under open quantum system dynamics is qualitatively different from the closed system case. In particular, the thermalization front found in the unitary is strongly modified, a signature of the irreversibility of the open system dynamics.

Title: Quantum Interferometry in External Gravitational Fields
Authors: Thomas B. Mieling, Thomas Morling, Christopher Hilweg, Philip Walther
Abstract: Current models of quantum interference experiments in external gravitational fields lack a common framework: while matter-wave interferometers are commonly described using the Schrödinger equation with a Newtonian potential, gravitational effects in quantum optics are modeled using either post-Newtonian metrics or highly symmetric exact solutions to Einstein's field equations such as those of Schwarzschild and Kerr. To coherently describe both kinds of experiments, this paper develops a unified framework for modeling quantum interferometers in general stationary space-times. This model provides a rigorous description and coherent interpretation of the effects of classical gravity on quantum probes.

Title: Saturating interaction in coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: R Eid (LCF), S Tiengo (LCF), M Lévy (LCF), T Bourdel (LCF)
Abstract: Rabi-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, with competing intra-and interspecies interactions, enable independent control of two-and three-body interactions. We show that coupling can also drive the system into a strongly nonlinear regime of saturating interaction. More precisely, the equation of state interpolates between low-and high-density regimes described by two different two-body scattering lengths. Interestingly, the transition can be determined by the strength of the coupling. We experimentally demonstrate this saturation phenomenon by measurements of the interaction energy of a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the detuning and of the strength of the Rabi coupling in spin mixtures of potassium 39.

Title: Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure
Authors: Pietro Maria Forcella, Cesare Tresca, Antonio Sanna, Gianni Profeta
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides are a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, leading to a range of exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, the phase diagram of mercury sulfide (HgS) remains difficult to characterize, with significant uncertainty surrounding the transition pressure between phases. Based on recent experimental results, we employ Density Functional Theory and Superconducting Density Functional Theory to investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and its interplay with the emergence of superconductivity as the crystal transitions from the cinnabar phase (space group P3$_1$21) to the rock salt phase (space group Fm$\bar{3}$m). Remarkably, the rocksalt phase hosts a multigap superconducting state driven by distinct Fermi surface sheets, with two dominant gaps; the unusually high critical temperature of $\sim$11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic models. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconducting gap structures emerge under pressure.

Title: Consistent quantum treatments of non-convex kinetic energies
Authors: C. Koliofoti, M. A. Javed, R.-P. Riwar
Abstract: The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in Wilczek and Shapere's classical time crystal, or nonlinear capacitors) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. Essentially there occurs a dissipative phase transition from a non-convex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. This resolves apparent inconsistencies and provide computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.

Title: Unitary Complexity and the Uhlmann Transformation Problem
Authors: John Bostanci, Yuval Efron, Tony Metger, Alexander Poremba, Luowen Qian, Henry Yuen
Abstract: State transformation problems such as compressing quantum information or breaking quantum commitments are fundamental quantum tasks. However, their computational difficulty cannot easily be characterized using traditional complexity theory, which focuses on tasks with classical inputs and outputs. To study the complexity of such state transformation tasks, we introduce a framework for unitary synthesis problems, including notions of reductions and unitary complexity classes. We use this framework to study the complexity of transforming one entangled state into another via local operations. We formalize this as the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, an algorithmic version of Uhlmann's theorem. Then, we prove structural results relating the complexity of the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, polynomial space quantum computation, and zero knowledge protocols. The Uhlmann Transformation Problem allows us to characterize the complexity of a variety of tasks in quantum information processing, including decoding noisy quantum channels, breaking falsifiable quantum cryptographic assumptions, implementing optimal prover strategies in quantum interactive proofs, and decoding the Hawking radiation of black holes. Our framework for unitary complexity thus provides new avenues for studying the computational complexity of many natural quantum information processing tasks.

Title: Observable Statistical Mechanics
Authors: Lodovico Scarpa, Abdulla Alhajri, Vlatko Vedral, Fabio Anza
Abstract: Predicting the stationary behavior of observables in isolated many-body quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum statistical mechanics. While one can often use the Gibbs ensemble, which is simple to compute, there are many scenarios where this is not possible and one must instead use another ensemble, such as the diagonal, microcanonical or generalized Gibbs ensembles. However, these all require detailed information about the energy or other conserved quantities to be constructed. Here we propose a general and computationally easy approach to determine the stationary probability distribution of observables with few outcomes. Interpreting coarse measurements at equilibrium as noisy communication channels, we provide general analytical arguments in favor of the applicability of a maximum entropy principle for this class of observables. We show that the resulting theory accurately predicts stationary probability distributions without detailed microscopic information like the energy eigenstates. Extensive numerical experiments on 7 non-weakly interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians demonstrate the broad applicability and robustness of this framework in both quantum integrable and chaotic models.

Title: A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits
Authors: Hannah J. Manetsch, Gyohei Nomura, Elie Bataille, Kon H. Leung, Xudong Lv, Manuel Endres
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have transformed atomic and molecular physics, now forming the backbone for a range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times, low-loss, and high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum science, particularly towards quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. We show room-temperature trapping lifetimes of 23 minutes, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We present a plan for zone-based quantum computing and demonstrate necessary coherence-preserving qubit transport and pick-up/drop-off operations on large spatial scales, characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, along with recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing and quantum error correction with thousands to tens of thousands of physical qubits could be a near-term prospect.

Title: Meta-Designing Quantum Experiments with Language Models
Authors: Sören Arlt, Haonan Duan, Felix Li, Sang Michael Xie, Yuhuai Wu, Mario Krenn
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can solve complex scientific problems beyond human capabilities, but the resulting solutions offer little insight into the underlying physical principles. One prominent example is quantum physics, where computers can discover experiments for the generation of specific quantum states, but it is unclear how finding general design concepts can be automated. Here, we address this challenge by training a transformer-based language model to create human-readable Python code, which solves an entire class of problems in a single pass. This strategy, which we call meta-design, enables scientists to gain a deeper understanding and extrapolate to larger experiments without additional optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we uncover previously unknown experimental generalizations of important quantum states, e.g. from condensed matter physics. The underlying methodology of meta-design can naturally be extended to fields such as materials science or engineering.

Title: Integrability and Quantum Chaos in the Spectrum of Bell Operators
Authors: Albert Aloy, Guillem Müller-Rigat, Maciej Lewenstein, Jordi Tura, Matteo Fadel
Abstract: We introduce a permutationally invariant multipartite Bell inequality for many-body three-level systems and use it to investigate a connection between Bell nonlocality and (lack of) quantum chaos. Interpreting the Bell operator, defined by fixing measurement settings, as an effective Hamiltonian, we analyze its spectral statistics across different SU(3) irreducible representations and measurement choices. Surprisingly, we find that, in every irreducible representation exhibiting nonlocality, the measurement settings yielding maximal violation result in a Bell operator with Poissonian level statistics, thus signaling integrable behavior. This integrability is both unique and fragile, since generic or slightly perturbed measurements lead to the Wigner-Dyson statistics associated with chaotic behavior. Through further analysis, we are able to identify an emergent parity symmetry in the Bell operator near the point of maximal violation, providing an explanation for the observed regularity in the spectrum. These results suggest a deep interplay between optimal quantum measurements, non-local correlations, and integrability, opening new perspectives at the intersection of Bell nonlocality and quantum chaos.

Title: Connecting extended Wigner's friend arguments and noncontextuality
Authors: Laurens Walleghem, Yìlè Yīng, Rafael Wagner, David Schmid
Abstract: The Local Friendliness argument is an extended Wigner's friend no-go theorem that provides strong constraints on the nature of reality -- stronger even than those imposed by Bell's theorem or by noncontextuality arguments. In this work, we prove a variety of connections between Local Friendliness scenarios and Kochen-Specker noncontextuality. Specifically, we first show how one can derive new Local Friendliness inequalities using known tools and results from the literature on Kochen-Specker noncontextuality. In doing so, we provide a new derivation for some of the facets of the Local Friendliness polytope, and we prove that this polytope is equal to the Bell polytope in a wide range of extended Wigner's friend scenarios with multipartite agents and sequential measurements. We then show how any possibilistic Kochen-Specker argument can be mathematically translated into a related proof of the Local Friendliness no-go theorem. In particular, we construct a novel kind of Local Friendliness scenario where a friend implements several compatible measurements (or joint measurements of these) in between the superobserver's operations on them. We illustrate this with the well-known 5-cycle and Peres-Mermin contextuality arguments.

Title: Quantum enhanced stratification of Breast Cancer: exploring quantum expressivity for real omics data
Authors: Valeria Repetto, Elia Giuseppe Ceroni, Giuseppe Buonaiuto, Romina D'Aurizio
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is considered one of the most promising applications of Quantum Computing in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era for the impact it is thought to have in the near future. Although promising theoretical assumptions, the exploration of how QML could foster new discoveries in Medicine and Biology fields is still in its infancy with few examples. In this study, we aimed to assess whether Quantum Kernels (QK) could effectively classify subtypes of Breast Cancer (BC) patients on the basis of molecular characteristics. We performed an heuristic exploration of encoding configurations with different entanglement levels to determine a trade-off between kernel expressivity and performances. Our results show that QKs yield comparable clustering results with classical methods while using fewer data points, and are able to fit the data with a higher number of clusters. Additionally, we conducted the experiments on the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) to evaluate the effect of noise on the outcome. We found that less expressive encodings showed a higher resilience to noise, indicating that the computational pipeline can be reliably implemented on the NISQ devices. Our findings suggest that QK methods show promises for application in Precision Oncology, especially in scenarios where the dataset is limited in size and a granular non-trivial stratification of complex molecular data cannot be achieved classically.

Title: Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states
Authors: Robin Y. Wen, Gilles Parez, Liuke Lyu, William Witczak-Krempa, Achim Kempf
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.

Title: Controllable single-photon wave packet scattering in two-dimensional resonator array by a giant atom
Authors: Weijun Cheng, Zhihai Wang, Yu-Xi Liu
Abstract: Nonlocal interactions between photonic resonator array and giant atoms have attracted extensive attentions. Optimization and control of quantum states via giant atoms have been shown. We here study the dynamical scattering of a single-photon wave packet by a giant atom coupled to a two-dimensional photonic resonator array via multiple spatial points. Using several iterations of time evolutions, we can prepare an expected wave packet with a stable size and use it as the incident state for the scattering process. We show that spatially symmetric or asymmetric target scattering states of single-photon wave packet can be generated by adjusting the coupling strengths between the giant atom and different lattice sites of the resonator array. Furthermore, the dynamical scattering of the wave packets enables us to study the atomic excitation and propagating properties of the scattering states. We find that the atomic excitation has negligibly small probability during the scattering process. Our study may provide a new way to generate an expected photon state via photon scattering by a giant atom in two-dimensional photonic array.

Title: Limits to the validity of quantum-optical models of the effects of gravitational redshift on photonic quantum states
Authors: Nils Leber, Luis Adrián Alanís Rodríguez, Alessandro Ferreri, Andreas Wolfgang Schell, David Edward Bruschi
Abstract: We analyze the domain of validity of a quantum optical model describing the effects of gravitational redshift on the quantum state of photons that propagate in curved spacetime. We find that the model is consistent for small redshift, but fails for larger redshifts. Surprisingly, the range of the redshift for which the model applies is conditional not only to the gravitational parameters, but also to those that define the photonic modes. We provide an analysis to characterize this aspect and propose a solution. Finally, we discuss implications for theoretical science as well as for the development of quantum technologies.

Title: Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat
Authors: T. Koide, F. Nicacio
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.

Title: Efficient spectrum analysis for multi-junction superconducting circuit
Authors: A. Tomonaga, H. Mukai, K. Mizuno, J. S. Tsai
Abstract: The extraction of transition frequencies from a spectrum has conventionally relied on empirical methods, and particularly in complex systems, it is a time-consuming and cumbersome process. To address this challenge, we establish a semi-automated efficient and precise spectrum analysis method. It first employs image processing methods to extract transition frequencies, subsequently estimating the Hamiltonians of a superconducting quantum circuit containing multiple Josephson junctions. In addition, we determine the suitable range of approximations in simulation methods, evaluating the physical reliability of the analysis.

Title: Can gravity mediate the transmission of quantum information?
Authors: Andrea Mari, Stefano Zippilli, David Vitali
Abstract: We propose an experiment to test the non-classicality of the gravitational interaction. We consider two optomechanical systems that are perfectly isolated, except for a weak gravitational coupling. If a suitable resonance condition is satisfied, an optical signal can be transmitted from one system to the other over a narrow frequency band, a phenomenon that we call gravitationally induced transparency. In this framework, the challenging problem of testing the quantum nature of gravity is mapped to the easier task of determining the non-classicality of the gravitationally-induced optical channel: If the optical channel is not entanglement-breaking, then gravity must have a quantum nature. This approach is applicable without making any assumption on the, currently unknown, correct model of gravity in the quantum regime. In the second part of this work, we model gravity as a quadratic Hamiltonian interaction (e.g. a weak Newtonian force), resulting in a Gaussian thermal attenuator channel between the two systems. Depending on the strength of thermal noise, the system presents a sharp transition from an entanglement-breaking to a non-classical channel capable not only of entanglement preservation but also of asymptotically perfect quantum communication.

Title: The Janus State: Strong Photon Antibunching from a Superposition of Squeezed Vacua
Authors: Arash Azizi
Abstract: Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, have long been used to create nonclassical "cat states" from classical-like components. We push this concept into the fully quantum regime by introducing the "Janus State"-a superposition of two squeezed vacuum states. Here, we report the discovery that this state, born from two photon-bunched components, exhibits strong photon antibunching. Our exact analytical theory reveals this emergent nonclassicality is driven by pure quantum interference. We identify a universal lower bound of $g^{(2)}=1/2$ in the asymptotic limit of vanishing squeezing, and also find a local minimum of $g^{(2)} \approx 0.567$ in a more experimentally accessible regime. The existence of this operational sweet spot fundamentally challenges the paradigm that strong antibunching requires non-Gaussian resources or post-selection. The Janus State thus constitutes a new foundational tool for quantum engineering, providing a deterministic route to generating highly nonclassical light.

Title: Stability of thermal equilibrium in long-range quantum systems
Authors: Tim Möbus, Jorge Sánchez-Segovia, Álvaro M. Alhambra, Ángela Capel
Abstract: Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analogue simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.

Title: Phase-Space Topology in a Single-Atom Synthetic Dimension
Authors: Kyungmin Lee, Sunkyu Yu, Jiyong Kang, Seungwoo Yu, Wonhyeong Choi, Daun Chung, Sumin Park, Taehyun Kim
Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the synthetic lattice, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the Fock-state lattice, we introduce a topological invariant based on phase-space geometry -- the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, computed using a phase-space parameter, is directly related to the phase-space winding number. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties -- topologically protected fermionic states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.

Title: Bayesian frequency estimation at the fundamental quantum limit
Authors: James W. Gardner, Tuvia Gefen, Ethan Payne, Su Direkci, Sander M. Vermeulen, Simon A. Haine, Joseph J. Hope, Lee McCuller, Yanbei Chen
Abstract: Searching for a weak signal at an unknown frequency is a canonical task in experiments probing fundamental physics such as gravitational-wave observatories and ultra-light dark matter haloscopes. These state-of-the-art sensors are limited by quantum noise arising from the fundamental uncertainty about the state of the device. Classically, frequency estimation suffers from a threshold effect in the signal-to-noise ratio such that weak signals are extremely hard to localise in frequency. We show that this phenomenon persists at the fundamental quantum limit but that the classical approach, a quadrature measurement, can nevertheless be beaten by a coherent protocol of projecting onto the "quantum whitened" possible quantum states. Quantum whitening is a covariant measurement, and we examine it analytically in the wide-prior limit and numerically for finite-width priors. Beyond accelerating searches for unknown frequencies, quantum whitening may be used generally to sense the parameter of a unitary encoding given no prior information about the parameter.

Abstract: The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a fundamental component of many quantum computing algorithms. In this paper, we present an alternative method for factoring this transformation. Inspired by this approach, we introduce a new quantum circuit for implementing the QFT. We show that this circuit is more efficient than the conventional design. Furthermore, using this circuit, we develop alternative versions of the HHL algorithm and Shor's algorithm, which also demonstrate improved performance compared to their standard implementations.

Title: Quantum Boltzmann Machines using Parallel Annealing for Medical Image Classification
Authors: Daniëlle Schuman, Mark V. Seebode, Tobias Rohe, Maximilian Balthasar Mansky, Michael Schroedl-Baumann, Jonas Stein, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien, Florian Krellner
Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea of Noè et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM executions.

Title: A photon density wavefunction
Authors: Stéphane Virally
Abstract: Maxwell's equations in the vacuum can be formally cast in the form of Schrödinger's equation. Unfortunately, the vector to which this equation directly applies is not a wavefunction: its amplitude squared is not a probability density but the expected energy density of the field. Since we can count photons, there must be a more convincing wavefunction, derived from the EM field, whose amplitude squared is an expected photon density. Mandel proposed the second quantized version of such a wavefunction, but did not link it directly to the EM field. We show how this can be accomplished.

Title: Multiparameter estimation with position-momentum correlated Gaussian probes
Authors: João C. P. Porto, Carlos H. S. Vieira, Pedro R. Dieguez, Irismar G. da Paz, Lucas S. Marinho
Abstract: Gaussian quantum probes have been widely used in quantum metrology and thermometry, where the goal is to estimate the temperature of an environment with which the probe interacts. It was recently shown that introducing initial position-momentum (PM) correlations in such probes can enhance the estimation precision compared to standard, uncorrelated Gaussian states. Motivated by these findings, we investigate whether PM correlations can also be advantageous in a simultaneous estimation setting, specifically, when estimating both the PM correlations themselves and the effective environment temperature that interacts with the probe. Using the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, we derive new precision bounds for this joint estimation task. Additionally, we demonstrate that such correlations can serve as a resource to improve temperature estimation within this multiparameter context. Finally, we analyze the compatibility between the two parameters, establishing conditions under which the derived bounds can be saturated.

Title: Toward quantum tunneling from excited states: Recovering imaginary-time instantons from a real-time analysis
Authors: Thomas Steingasser, David I. Kaiser
Abstract: We revisit the path integral description of quantum tunneling and lay the groundwork for its generalization to excites states through real-time path integral techniques. For clarity, we focus on the simple toy model of a point particle in a double-well potential, for which we perform all steps explicitly. Instead of performing the familiar Wick rotation from physical to imaginary time -- which is inconsistent with the requisite boundary conditions when treating tunneling from states other than the false vacuum -- we regularize the path integral by adding an infinitesimal complex contribution to the Hamiltonian, while keeping time strictly real. We find that this gives rise to a complex stationary-phase solution, in agreement with recent insights from Picard-Lefshitz theory. We then show that there exists a class of analytic solutions for the corresponding equations of motion, which can be made to match the appropriate boundary conditions in the physically relevant limits of a vanishing regulator and an infinite physical time. We provide a detailed discussion of this non-trivial limit. We find that, for systems without an explicit time-dependence, our approach reproduces the picture of an instanton-like solution defined on a finite Euclidean-time interval. Lastly, we discuss the generalization of our approach to broader classes of systems, for which it serves as a reliable framework for high-precision calculations.

Title: Sub-ballistic operator growth in spin chains with heavy-tailed random fields
Authors: Christopher L. Baldwin
Abstract: We rigorously prove that in nearly arbitrary quantum spin chains with power-law-distributed random fields, namely such that the probability of a field exceeding $h$ scales as $h^{-\alpha}$, it is impossible for any operator evolving in the Heisenberg picture to spread with dynamical exponent less than $1/\alpha$. In particular, ballistic growth is impossible for $\alpha < 1$, diffusive growth is impossible for $\alpha < 1/2$, and any finite dynamical exponent becomes impossible for sufficiently small $\alpha$. This result thus establishes a wide family of models in which the disorder provably prevents conventional transport. We express the result as a tightening of Lieb-Robinson bounds due to random fields -- the proof modifies the standard derivation such that strong fields appear as effective weak interactions, and then makes use of analogous recent results for random-bond spin chains.

Title: Computational complexity of three-dimensional Ising spin glass: Lessons from D-Wave annealer
Authors: Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Finding an exact ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem (i.e., at least as hard as any problem in the nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP) class). Given validity of the exponential time hypothesis, its computational complexity was proven to be no less than $2^{N^{2/3}}$, where $N$ is the total number of spins. Here, we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\le 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, which scales as $2^{N/ \beta}$ with $\beta\approx 10^3$. Based on statistical analysis of low-energy states, we argue that with an improvement of annealing protocols and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. This suggests that, for $N<\beta^3$, annealing devices provide most efficient way to find an exact ground state.

Title: Implementing Large Quantum Boltzmann Machines as Generative AI Models for Dataset Balancing
Authors: Salvatore Sinno, Markus Bertl, Arati Sahoo, Bhavika Bhalgamiya, Thomas Groß, Nicholas Chancellor
Abstract: This study explores the implementation of large Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines (QRBMs), a key advancement in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), as generative models on D-Wave's Pegasus quantum hardware to address dataset imbalance in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By leveraging Pegasus's enhanced connectivity and computational capabilities, a QRBM with 120 visible and 120 hidden units was successfully embedded, surpassing the limitations of default embedding tools. The QRBM synthesized over 1.6 million attack samples, achieving a balanced dataset of over 4.2 million records. Comparative evaluations with traditional balancing methods, such as SMOTE and RandomOversampler, revealed that QRBMs produced higher-quality synthetic samples, significantly improving detection rates, precision, recall, and F1 score across diverse classifiers. The study underscores the scalability and efficiency of QRBMs, completing balancing tasks in milliseconds. These findings highlight the transformative potential of QML and QRBMs as next-generation tools in data preprocessing, offering robust solutions for complex computational challenges in modern information systems.

Title: Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2 $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain
Authors: Riccardo Borsato, Miguel García Fernández
Abstract: Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.

Title: Compton Form Factor Extraction using Quantum Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Brandon B. Le, Dustin Keller
Abstract: We present an extraction of Compton Form Factors (CFFs) from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) experiments conducted at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, utilizing Quantum Deep Neural Networks (QDNNs). The analysis employs the standard Belitsky, Kirchner, and Müller formalism at twist-two, complemented by a fitting procedure designed to minimize model dependence in a manner analogous to conventional local fits. A pseudodata extraction test of the CFFs is performed using both Classical Deep Neural Networks (CDNNs) and QDNNs, with a detailed comparative analysis. Results indicate that QDNNs can outperform CDNNs in particular cases, offering enhanced predictive accuracy and precision even with limited model complexity. Motivated by this, we develop a metric to quantify the extent of the quantum advantage based on characteristics of DVCS experimental data. These findings underscore the promising role of QDNNs in advancing future investigations into multidimensional parton distributions and hadronic physics.

Title: Streamline controlled rectification of supercurrent in thin-film asymmetric weak links
Authors: Filippo Antola, Sebastiano Battisti, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto, Giorgio De Simoni
Abstract: In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.
