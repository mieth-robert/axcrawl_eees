Title: Quantum Quenches from the Critical Point: Theory and Experimental Validation in a Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulator
Authors: Chen-Xu Wang, András Grabarits, Jin-Ming Cui, Hua-Bi Zeng, Yun-Feng Huang, Chuan-Feng Li, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We investigate quantum quenches starting from a critical point and experimentally probe the associated defect statistics using a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the transverse-field Ising model. The cumulants of the defect number distribution exhibit universal scaling with quench depth, featuring Gaussian behavior at leading order and systematic subleading corrections. Our results are in excellent agreement with both exact and approximate theoretical predictions, establishing quench-depth scaling as a powerful and precise experimental benchmark for nonequilibrium quantum critical dynamics.

Title: On Quantum Simulation of QED in Coulomb Gauge
Authors: Xiaojun Yao
Abstract: A recent work (Li, 2406.01204) considered quantum simulation of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider representing the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and Hamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the continuum limit or the UV completion of QED.

Title: Efficient Gate Reordering for Distributed Quantum Compiling in Data Centers
Authors: Riccardo Mengoni, Walter Nadalin, Mathys Rennela, Jimmy Rotureau, Tom Darras, Julien Laurat, Eleni Diamanti, Ioannis Lavdas
Abstract: Just as classical computing relies on distributed systems, the quantum computing era requires new kinds of infrastructure and software tools. Quantum networks will become the backbone of hybrid, quantum-augmented data centers, in which quantum algorithms are distributed over a local network of quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via shared entanglement. In this context, it is crucial to develop methods and software that minimize the number of inter-QPU communications. Here we describe key features of the quantum compiler araQne, which is designed to minimize distribution cost, measured by the number of entangled pairs required to distribute a monolithic quantum circuit using gate teleportation protocols. We establish the crucial role played by circuit reordering strategies, which strongly reduce the distribution cost compared to a baseline approach.

Title: Anonymous and private parameter estimation in networks of quantum sensors
Authors: Jarn de Jong, Santiago Scheiner, Naomi R. Solomons, Ziad Chaoui, Damian Markham, Anna Pappa
Abstract: Anonymity and privacy are two key functionalities in modern communication networks. In quantum networks, distributed quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful use case, with applications to clock synchronisation, detecting gravitational effects and more. In this work, we develop a new protocol combining the different cryptographic functionalities of anonymity and privacy for the task of distributed parameter estimation. That is, we present a protocol that allows a selected subset of network participants to anonymously collaborate in estimating the average of their private parameters. Crucially, this is achieved without disclosing either the individual parameter values or the identities of the participants, neither to each other nor to the broader network. Our approach builds on a modified scheme that preserves the distinct security guarantees of existing protocols, while avoiding potential vulnerabilities that could arise from applying those protocols sequentially.

Title: A Stochastic Schrödinger Equation for the Generalized Rate Operator Unravelings
Authors: Federico Settimo
Abstract: Stochastic unravelings are a widely used tool to solve open quantum system dynamics, in which the exact solution is obtained via an average over a stochastic process on the set of pure quantum states. Recently, the generalized rate operator unraveling formalism was derived, allowing not only for an engineering of the stochastic realizations, but also to unravel without reverse jumps even for some dynamics in which P-divisibility is violated, thus hugely improving the simulation efficiency. This is possible because the unraveling depend on an arbitrary non-linear transformation which can incorporate the memory effects. In this work, a stochastic Schrödinger equation for this formalism is derived, both for cases with and without reverse jumps. It is also shown that a failure of this method can be used to witness master equations leading unphysical time evolutions, independently on the particular non-linear transformation considered.

Title: All entangled states can be certified by a violation of noncontextuality inequalities
Authors: Yujie Zhang, Jonah Spodek, David Schmid, Carter Reid, Liam J. Morrison, Thomas Jennewein, Kevin J. Resch, Robert W. Spekkens
Abstract: By combining the assumption of Bell locality with that of generalized noncontextuality, we define different classes of noncontextuality inequalities for correlations in a bipartite Bell scenario, with the classes being distinguished by which set of operational identities are taken into account, with certain natural subsets defining a hierarchy of classes. We prove that violations of the inequalities at different levels of the hierarchy can witness that a bipartite state is entangled, steerable, or nonlocal, respectively, thereby providing a means of certifying these different forms of quantum correlations. To illustrate the power of this approach, we demonstrate the violation of one such inequality in an experiment with polarization-entangled photons. This allows us to certify entanglement in certain qubit isotropic states for which certification by Bell or steering inequalities is known to be impossible. Our entanglement certification scheme is the first to combine all of the following desirable features: it requires no prior characterization of the measurements, it delivers a verdict based on quantities that are independent of the tomographic gauge freedom, it is able to certify any entangled state, and it requires no auxiliary entangled sources.

Title: Quantum Computing in Discrete- and Continuous-Variable Architectures
Authors: Shraddha Singh
Abstract: This thesis develops a theoretical framework for hybrid continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum systems, with emphasis on quantum control, state preparation, and error correction. A central contribution is non-abelian quantum signal processing (NA-QSP), a generalization of quantum signal processing to settings where control parameters are non-commuting operators. Within this framework, we introduce the Gaussian-Controlled-Rotation (GCR) protocol, which enables high-fidelity control of CV states using DV ancillae. This approach allows for deterministic preparation of squeezed, cat, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states without numerical optimization. Two previously unpublished contributions are included: (i) Chapter 2.3 introduces the Gaussian hierarchy, a classification of CV operations analogous to the Clifford hierarchy, offering a new lens for understanding CV gate sets; (ii) Chapter 5 presents an analytical framework for correcting photon loss in finite-energy GKP codes, introducing the notion of probabilistic error correction, providing insight into recent GKP experiments surpassing break-even thresholds. Overall, this work lays the groundwork for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation in hybrid CV-DV architectures, with applications to logical gate synthesis, readout, and hybrid algorithm design using ancilla oscillators.

Title: Temperature and Magnetic-Field Dependence of Energy Relaxation in a Fluxonium Qubit

Abstract: Noise from material defects at device interfaces is known to limit the coherence of superconducting circuits, yet our understanding of the defect origins and noise mechanisms remains incomplete. Here we investigate the temperature and in-plane magnetic-field dependence of energy relaxation in a low-frequency fluxonium qubit, where the sensitivity to flux noise and charge noise arising from dielectric loss can be tuned by applied flux. We observe an approximately linear scaling of flux noise with temperature $T$ and a power-law dependence of dielectric loss $T^3$ up to 100 mK. Additionally, we find that the dielectric-loss-limited $T_1$ decreases with weak in-plane magnetic fields, suggesting a potential magnetic-field response of the underlying charge-coupled defects. We implement a multi-level decoherence model in our analysis, motivated by the widely tunable matrix elements and transition energies approaching the thermal energy scale in our system. These findings offer insight for fluxonium coherence modeling and should inform microscopic theories of intrinsic noise in superconducting circuits.

Title: Revisiting Noise-adaptive Transpilation in Quantum Computing: How Much Impact Does it Have?
Authors: Yuqian Huo, Jinbiao Wei, Christopher Kverne, Mayur Akewar, Janki Bhimani, Tirthak Patel
Abstract: Transpilation, particularly noise-aware optimization, is widely regarded as essential for maximizing the performance of quantum circuits on superconducting quantum computers. The common wisdom is that each circuit should be transpiled using up-to-date noise calibration data to optimize fidelity. In this work, we revisit the necessity of frequent noise-adaptive transpilation, conducting an in-depth empirical study across five IBM 127-qubit quantum computers and 16 diverse quantum algorithms. Our findings reveal novel and interesting insights: (1) noise-aware transpilation leads to a heavy concentration of workloads on a small subset of qubits, which increases output error variability; (2) using random mapping can mitigate this effect while maintaining comparable average fidelity; and (3) circuits compiled once with calibration data can be reliably reused across multiple calibration cycles and time periods without significant loss in fidelity. These results suggest that the classical overhead associated with daily, per-circuit noise-aware transpilation may not be justified. We propose lightweight alternatives that reduce this overhead without sacrificing fidelity -- offering a path to more efficient and scalable quantum workflows.

Title: Coupled Cluster Downfolding Theoryin Simulations of Chemical Systems on Quantum Hardware
Authors: Nicholas P. Bauman, Muqing Zheng, Chenxu Liu, Nathan M. Myers, Ajay Panyala, Bo Peng, Ang Li, Karol Kowalski
Abstract: The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach: coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization of quantum advantage in chemistry.

Title: Testing Determinism and the Role of Time in Atoms
Authors: Mark G. Raizen
Abstract: We propose and analyze experiments to test determinism and the role of time in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if stable isotopes change over time. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for newly created stable isotopes and compare them to the same isotopes found in nature. The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons, lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number of protons and neutrons. These experiments would search for possible changes in the nuclear magnetic moment of isotopes since they were first created during nucleosynthesis. We propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of thulium-170 is analyzed, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.

Title: Passive polarization and phase stabilization scheme for Twin-Field QKD
Authors: Christiano M. S. Nascimento, Felipe Calliari, Guilherme P. Temporão
Abstract: Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution requires first-order interference between coherent states sent by Alice and Bob in a mid-station Charlie. In order to obtain stable operation and maximum interferometric visibility, not only phase stabilization but also polarization control is required, especially in optical-fiber setups. In this paper, we propose an experimental setup that simultaneously provides passive stabilization of phase and polarization fluctuations by combining a Sagnac-like interferometer with a "Plug-and-Play" configuration employing Faraday mirrors. Experimental results show a net interferometric visibility maintained around 95.3% during 72 hours of continuous operation, with a standard deviation of 0.47%. The setup can be straightforwardly adapted to a multi-user scenario employing either a star network, a bus topology, or a combination of both.

Title: A Fundamental Bound for Robust Quantum Gate Control
Authors: Robert L. Kosut, Daniel A. Lidar, Herschel Rabitz
Abstract: We derive a universal performance limit for coherent quantum control in the presence of modeled and unmodeled uncertainties. For any target unitary $W$ that is implementable in the absence of error, we prove that the worst-case (and hence the average) gate fidelity obeys the lower bound $F \ge \Flb\bigl(\tf \Omeff\bigr)$, where $\tf$ is the gate duration and $\Omeff$ is a single frequency-like measure that aggregates \emph{all} bounded uncertainty sources, e.g., coherent control imperfections, unknown couplings, and residual environment interactions, without assuming an initially factorizable system-bath state or a completely positive map. The bound is obtained by combining an interaction-picture averaging method with a Bellman-Gronwall inequality and holds for any finite-norm Hamiltonian decomposition. Hence it applies equally to qubits, multi-level qudits, and ancilla-assisted operations. Because $\Flb$ depends only on the dimensionless product $\tf\Omeff$, it yields a device-independent metric that certifies whether a given hardware platform can, in principle, reach a specified fault-tolerance threshold, and also sets a quantitative target for robust-control synthesis and system identification.

Title: Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates and Less Overhead
Authors: Seigo Kikura, Kazufumi Tanji, Akihisa Goban, Shinichi Sunami
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.

Title: Quantum state reconstruction with variational quantum circuit
Authors: Shabnam Jabeen, Dmytro Kurdydyk, Aadi Palnitkar, Mihir Talati, Jeffrey Yan, Jinghong Yang
Abstract: Reconstructing quantum states from measurement data represents a formidable challenge in quantum information science, especially as system sizes grow beyond the reach of traditional tomography methods. While recent studies have explored quantum machine learning (QML) for quantum state tomography (QST), nearly all rely on idealized assumptions, such as direct access to the unknown quantum state as quantum data input, which are incompatible with current hardware constraints. In this work, we present a QML-based tomography protocol that operates entirely on classical measurement data and is fully executable on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our approach employs a variational quantum circuit trained to reconstruct quantum states based solely on measurement outcomes. We test the method in simulation, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse quantum states, including GHZ states, spin chain ground states, and states generated by random circuits. The protocol is then validated on quantum hardware from IBM and IonQ. Additionally, we demonstrate accurate tomography is possible using incomplete measurement bases, a crucial step towards scaling up our protocol. Our results in various scenarios illustrate successful state reconstruction with fidelity reaching 90% or higher. To our knowledge, this is the first QML-based tomography scheme that uses exclusively classical measurement data and has been implemented on real quantum processors. This work establishes the feasibility of QML-based tomography on current quantum platforms and offers a scalable pathway for practical quantum state reconstruction.

Title: Hardness of Quantum Distribution Learning and Quantum Cryptography
Authors: Taiga Hiroka, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Tomoyuki Morimae
Abstract: The existence of one-way functions (OWFs) forms the minimal assumption in classical cryptography. However, this is not necessarily the case in quantum cryptography. One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer, provide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies $PP\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the analogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \neq NP$-has long been studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning in various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to $P \neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for OWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of OWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution learning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper quantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that follows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution learning can be derived from $PP \neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to average-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from $PP \neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if worst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite that, we show that $PP \neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of hardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \neq BQP$ if and only if agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard. As a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\Sigma_3^P}$ learners implies $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$.

Title: Superradiant Echoes Induced by Multiple Re-phasing of NV Spin Sub-ensembles Grating at Room Temperature
Authors: Qilong Wu, Yuan Zhang, Huihui Yu, Chong-Xin Shan, Klaus Mølmer
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose that superradiant echoes can be achieved at room temperature by applying a laser illumination and a microwave Hahn echo sequence to a diamond with a high concentration of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers placed in a dielectric microwave cavity. We identify that the combined action of two microwave driving pulses and a free evolution imprints a phase grating among NV spin sub-ensembles in frequency space, and multiple re-phasing of the grated spin sub-ensembles leads to multiple superradiant echoes through a collective coupling with the cavity. Furthermore, we show that the superradiant echoes can be actively tailored with the microwave pulses and the laser illumination by modifying the grating parameters, and the multiple re-phasing dynamics is analogous to the one leading to superradiant beats in optical clock system. In the future, the spin sub-ensembles grating and the resulting echoes can be further optimized with dynamical decoupling, which might pave the way for applications in quantum sensing.

Title: Quantum phase estimation based filtering: performance analysis and application to low-energy spectral calculation
Authors: Rei Sakuma, Kaito Wada, Shu Kanno, Kimberlee Keithley, Kenji Sugisaki, Takashi Abe, Hajime Nakamura, Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: Filtering is an important technique in quantum computing used for isolating or enhancing some specific states of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we analyze the performance of filters based on the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, in which filtering removes states associated with bitstrings in the ancilla register above a given threshold. We show that when the conventional rectangular window function is used for the QPE input state, the resulting filter function exhibits an oscillating behavior known as the Gibbs phenomenon. We also show that in the case of the sine and Kaiser windows, this phenomenon is suppressed. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to compare the number of necessary queries to the Hamiltonian time evolution operation of for the QPE-based filtering algorithm and the quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QETU). We find that the number of queries required for Kaiser window-based filtering is comparable to that for QETU with optimized phase angles. As an application of the QPE-based filter, we also study a two-step algorithm for low-energy spectral simulations, composed of a coarse grid for filtering and a fine grid for obtaining final high-resolution spectra. As a benchmark of the proposed scheme for realistic continuous spectra, we present the density-of-states (DOS) calculation of antiferromagnetic type-II MnO in a one-particle approximation.

Title: The robustness of composite pulses elucidated by classical mechanics: Stability around the globe
Authors: Jonathan Berkheim, David J. Tannor
Abstract: Composite Pulses (CPs) are widely used in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), optical spectroscopy, optimal control experiments and quantum computing to manipulate systems that are well-described by a two-level Hamiltonian. A careful design of these pulses can allow the refocusing of an ensemble at a desired state, even if the ensemble experiences imperfections in the magnitude of the external field or resonance offsets. Since the introduction of CPs, several theoretical justifications for their robustness have been suggested. In this work, we suggest another justification based on the classical mechanical concept of a stability matrix. The motion on the Bloch Sphere is mapped to a canonical system of coordinates and the focusing of an ensemble corresponds to caustics, or the vanishing of an appropriate stability matrix element in the canonical coordinates. Our approach highlights the directionality of the refocusing of the ensemble on the Bloch Sphere, revealing how different ensembles refocus along different directions. The approach also clarifies when CPs can induce a change in the width of the ensemble as opposed to simply a rotation of the axes. As a case study, we investigate the $90(x)180(y)90(x)$ CP introduced by Levitt, where the approach provides a new perspective into why this CP is effective.

Title: Exploiting complex 3D-printed surface structures for portable quantum technologies
Authors: Nathan Cooper, David Johnson, Benjamin Hopton, Matthew Overton, David Stupple, Alexandra Bratu, Edward Wilson, John Robinson, Laurence Coles, Manolis Papastavrou, Lucia Hackermueller
Abstract: Portable quantum technologies require robust, lightweight apparatus with superior performance. For techniques dependent upon high-vacuum environments, such as atom interferometers and atomic clocks, 3D-printing enables new avenues to tailor in-vacuum gas propagation dynamics. We demonstrate intricate, fine-scale surface patterning of 3D-printed vacuum components to increase the rate at which gas particles collide with the surface. By applying a non-evaporable getter coating for use as a surface pump, we show that the patterned surface pumps gas particles 3.8 times faster than an equivalent flat areas. These patterns can be directly integrated into additively manufactured components, enabling application in close proximity to key experimental regions and contributing to overall mass-reduction. We develop numerical simulations that show good agreement with this result and predict up to a ten-fold increase in pumping rate, for realistic surface structures. Our work has direct applications in enabling passively-pumped portable quantum technologies, but also establishes 3D-printing as a powerful technique for the creation of optimized surface patterning to provide enhanced control over high-vacuum gas dynamics for a broad range of applications.

Title: Fiber transmission of cluster states via multi-level time-bin encoding
Authors: Philip Rübeling, Robert Johanning, Jan Heine, Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Michael Kues
Abstract: The next generation of telecommunication networks will rely on the transmission of complex quantum states to enable secure and transformative information processing, utilizing entanglement and superposition. Cluster states - multipartite entangled states that retain entanglement under local measurements - are a vital resource for quantum networking applications such as blind photonic quantum computing, quantum state teleportation and all-photonic quantum repeaters. However, the transmission of cluster states over optical fiber has remained elusive with previous approaches. Here, we demonstrate the first transmission of a four-qubit cluster state over 25 km of single-mode fiber by using a two-photon multi-level time-bin encoding. We directly generate the state by exploiting coherent control of a parametric generation process, rendering a resource-intensive controlled-phase gate obsolete. To enable efficient and reconfigurable projective measurements on the multi-level time-bin encoded state, we introduce chirped-pulse modulation and implement the first time-bin beam splitter, allowing us to certify genuine multipartite entanglement and to demonstrate one-way computing operations. Our approach enables the transmission of complex quantum states over long-distance fibers, permitting the implementation of multipartite protocols and laying the foundation for large-scale quantum resource networks.

Title: Measuring spatial coherence of quantum and classical light with an ultrastable monolithic interferometer
Authors: Edoardo Suerra, Mirko Siano, Bruno Paroli, Samuele Altilia, Marco A. C. Potenza, Matteo G. A. Paris, Simone Cialdi
Abstract: We describe a monolithic interferometer for spatial coherence measurements of both classical and quantum light sources. The design combines parametric down-conversion with a thermal source, using two identical calcite crystals to control beam alignment via birefringence. The monolithic structure ensures inherent stability. Spatial coherence is measured through temporal interferograms and spectral analysis, with both methods showing close agreement with theoretical predictions. The system is robust and performs reliably for both quantum and classical light. Its design enables automated, rapid coherence measurements across different source types.

Title: Time Crystal in the Nonlinear Phonon Mode of the Trapped Ions
Authors: Yi-Ling Zhan, Chun-Fu Liu, J.-T. Bu, K.-F Cui, S.-L. Su, L.-L. Yan, Gang Chen
Abstract: Time crystals constitute a novel phase of matter defined by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry. We present a scheme for realizing a continuous-time crystal using the vibrational phonon mode of a trapped-ion system. By coupling two addressable standing-wave lasers to individual ions via adiabatic elimination, we generate a nonlinear phonon mode with controllable linear gain ($g$) and nonlinear damping ($\kappa$). This scheme enables stable dissipative dynamics over timescales significantly longer than the oscillation period, leading to the emergence of time-translation symmetry breaking - a time crystal - under specific conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the experimental feasibility and numerically demonstrate this phonon time crystal using experimentally feasible parameters. These results provide a practical scheme for observing a time crystal in a nonlinear phonon mode, which will advance research into time crystals.

Title: Many-Body Fluctuation Theorems for Quantum Coherence and Correlation Dynamics
Authors: Kun Zhang, Mo-Yang Ni, Hai-Long Shi, Xiao-Hui Wang, Jin Wang
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish exact relations for nonequilibrium dynamics, profoundly advancing the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we extend quantum fluctuation theorems beyond the traditional thermodynamic framework to quantum information dynamics and many-body systems, where both the system and the environment are multipartite without assuming any thermodynamic constraints. Based on the two-point measurement scheme and the classical probability, we establish the fluctuation theorem for the dynamics of many-body classical mutual information. By extending to quasiprobability, we derive quantum fluctuation theorems for many-body coherence and quantum correlations, presenting them in both integral and detailed forms. Our theoretical results are illustrated and verified using three-qubit examples, and feasible experimental verification protocols are proposed. These findings uncover the statistical structure underlying the nonequilibrium quantum information dynamics, providing fundamental insights and new tools for advancing quantum technologies.

Title: An exact Markovian decoherence dynamics of two interacting harmonic oscillators coupled to a bosonic heat bath
Authors: Gábor Homa, Dávid Hamar, József Zsolt Bernád, Peter Adam, András Csordás
Abstract: We present an exact analytical solution of the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation in a precise Markovian limit for a system of two harmonically coupled harmonic oscillators interacting with a common thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. The thermal bath is initially considered to be at arbitrary temperatures and characterized by an Ohmic Lorentz-Drude spectral density. In the examined system, couplings between the two harmonic oscillators and the environment ensure a complete decoupling of the center-of-mass and relative degrees of freedom, resulting in undamped dynamics in the relative coordinate. The exact time evolution is used to analyze the system's entanglement dynamics, quantified through logarithmic negativity and quantum mutual information, while ensuring the positivity of the density operator to confirm the physical validity of the results. We demonstrate that, under certain parameter regimes and initial conditions, the asymptotic dynamics can give rise to periodic entanglement-disentanglement behavior. Furthermore, numerical simulations reveal that for negative values of the direct coupling between the oscillators, which are sufficiently close to a critical lower bound beyond which the system becomes unstable, the system can maintain entanglement across a broad temperature range and for arbitrarily long durations.

Title: Toward graviton detection via photon-graviton quantum state conversion
Authors: Taiki Ikeda, Youka Kaku, Sugumi Kanno, Jiro Soda
Abstract: A magnetic field enables the interconversion of photons and gravitons, yet the process is usually analysed only at the level of classical wave equations. We revisit photon-graviton conversion in a quantum field theoretic framework, allowing us to track the evolution of arbitrary quantum states. Treating the photons as squeezed coherent states and the gravitons as the squeezed vacuum expected for primordial gravitational waves, we derive analytic expressions for the conversion probability and show that it can be significantly enhanced compared to the conventional estimate. We further demonstrate that the conversion both swaps preexisting entanglement and generates genuinely new entanglement between the electromagnetic and gravitational sectors, which is impossible in any classical description. Detecting such nonclassical correlations would constitute compelling evidence for the quantization of gravity and offers a novel pathway toward graviton detection.

Title: An entangled photon source for the telecom C-band based on a semiconductor-confined spin
Authors: Petros Laccotripes, Junyang Huang, Ginny Shooter, Andrea Barbiero, Matthew S. Winnel, David A. Ritchie, Andrew J. Shields, Tina Muller, R. Mark Stevenson
Abstract: Multiphoton entangled states are a key resource for quantum networks and measurement-based quantum computation. Scalable protocols for generating such states using solid-state spin-photon interfaces have recently emerged, but practical implementations have so far relied on emitters operating at short wavelengths, incompatible with low-loss fibre transmission. Here, we take a key step towards the generation of telecom wavelength multi-qubit entangled states using an InAs/InP quantum dot. After establishing that all essential criteria for generating cluster states using a ground state spin as the entangler are satisfied, we implement a scalable protocol to entangle the resident spin with sequentially emitted photons directly in the telecom C-band. We demonstrate a two-qubit (spin-photon) entanglement fidelity of $59.5\pm 8.7\%$ and a lower bound of three-qubit (spin-photon-photon) entanglement fidelity of $52.7\pm 11.4\%$. Our results close the performance gap between short-wavelength quantum dot systems and the existing telecom infrastructure, establishing a route towards practical large photonic cluster states for fibre-based quantum network applications.

Title: Simulating Quantum State Transfer between Distributed Devices using Noisy Interconnects
Authors: Marvin Bechtold, Johanna Barzen, Frank Leymann, Alexander Mandl
Abstract: Scaling beyond individual quantum devices via distributed quantum computing relies critically on high-fidelity quantum state transfers between devices, yet the quantum interconnects needed for this are currently unavailable or expected to be significantly noisy. These limitations can be bypassed by simulating ideal state transfer using quasiprobability decompositions (QPDs). Wire cutting, for instance, allows this even without quantum interconnects. Nevertheless, QPD methods face drawbacks, requiring sampling from multiple circuit variants and incurring substantial sampling overhead. While prior theoretical work showed that incorporating noisy interconnects within QPD protocols could reduce sampling overhead relative to interconnect quality, a practical implementation for realistic conditions was lacking. Addressing this gap, this work presents a generalized and practical QPD for state transfer simulation using noisy interconnects to reduce sampling overhead. The QPD incorporates a single tunable parameter for straightforward calibration to any utilized interconnect. To lower practical costs, the work also explores reducing the number of distinct circuit variants required by the QPD. Experimental validation on contemporary quantum devices confirms the proposed QPD's practical feasibility and expected sampling overhead reduction under realistic noise. Notably, the results show higher effective state transfer fidelity than direct transfer over the underlying noisy interconnect.

Abstract: Combining quantum computing techniques in the form of amplitude amplification with classical reinforcement learning has led to the so-called "hybrid agent for quantum-accessible reinforcement learning", which achieves a quadratic speedup in sample complexity for certain learning problems. So far, this hybrid agent has only been applied to stationary learning problems, that is, learning problems without any time dependency within components of the Markov decision process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of the hybrid agent to dynamic RL environments. To this end, we enhance the hybrid agent by introducing a dissipation mechanism and, with the resulting learning agent, perform an empirical comparison with a classical RL agent in an RL environment with a time-dependent reward function. Our findings suggest that the modified hybrid agent can adapt its behavior to changes in the environment quickly, leading to a higher average success probability compared to its classical counterpart.

Title: Laser cooling and qubit measurements on a forbidden transition in neutral Cs atoms
Authors: J. Scott, H. M. Lim, U. Singla, Q. Meece, J. T. Choy, S. Kolkowitz, T. M. Graham, M. Saffman
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate background-free, hyperfine-level-selective measurements of individual Cs atoms by simultaneous cooling to $5.3~\mu\rm K$ and imaging on the $6s_{1/2}\rightarrow 5d_{5/2}$ electric-quadrupole transition. We achieve hyperfine resolved detection with fidelity 0.9993(4) and atom retention of 0.9954(5), limited primarily by vacuum lifetime. Performing state measurements in a 3D cooling configuration enables repeated low loss measurements. A theoretical analysis of an extension of the demonstrated approach based on quenching of the excited state with an auxiliary field, identifies parameters for hyperfine-resolved measurements with a projected fidelity of $\sim 0.9995 $ in $\sim 60~\mu\rm s$.

Title: Generative flow-based warm start of the variational quantum eigensolver
Authors: Hang Zou, Martin Rahm, Anton Frisk Kockum, Simon Olsson
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) show promise for quantum simulations on near-term quantum devices, but are often limited by complex objective functions and expensive optimization procedures. Here, we propose Flow-VQE, a generative framework leveraging conditional normalizing flows with parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently generate high-quality variational parameters. By embedding a generative model into the VQE optimization loop through preference-based training, Flow-VQE enables quantum gradient-free optimization and offers a systematic approach for parameter transfer, accelerating convergence across related problems through warm-started optimization. We compare Flow-VQE to a number of standard benchmarks through numerical simulations on molecular systems, including hydrogen chains, water, ammonia, and benzene. We find that Flow-VQE outperforms baseline optimization algorithms, achieving computational accuracy with fewer circuit evaluations (improvements range from modest to more than two orders of magnitude) and, when used to warm-start the optimization of new systems, accelerates subsequent fine-tuning by up to 50-fold compared with Hartree--Fock initialization. Therefore, we believe Flow-VQE can become a pragmatic and versatile paradigm for leveraging generative modeling to reduce the costs of variational quantum algorithms.

Title: Beyond morphophoricity: $s$-tight IC measurements in geometric generalised probabilistic theories
Authors: Anna Szymusiak
Abstract: The analysed in this paper new class of $s$-tight IC measurements contains both morphophoric measurements, preserving the geometry of the states space, and tight IC measurements, introduced nearly 20 years ago by Scott in the quantum case as optimal for the task of linear quantum tomography. By looking at the mathematical side of these classes we discover their common feature, which is also preserved in the broader class of $s$-tight IC measurements: a particularly elegant form of the formula that can be seen as the generalised form of the Urgleichung known from the QBist approach to quantum theory. In particular, the tight IC measurements are identified as the ones for which this generalised Urgleichung takes an exceptionally simple form.

Title: Hamiltonian quantum gates -- energetic advantage from entangleability
Authors: Josey Stevens, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum gates controlled by classical electromagnetic fields form the basis of any realistic model of quantum computers. In this letter, we derive a lower bound on the field energy required to implement such gates and relate this energy to the expected gate error. We study the entangleability (ability to entangle qubits) of Hamiltonians and highlight how this feature of quantum gates can provide a means for more energetically efficient computation. Ultimately, we show that a universal quantum computer can be realized with vanishingly low energetic requirements but at the expense of arbitrarily large complexity.

Title: Topological Braiding of Bloch Eigenmodes Protected by Non-Abelian Quaternion Invariants
Authors: Xiao-Ming Wang, Jiaying Xu, Xulong Wang, Zhen Li, Guancong Ma
Abstract: Braiding has attracted significant attention in physics because of its important role in describing the fundamental exchange of particles. Infusing the braiding with topological protection will make it robust against imperfections and perturbations, but such topological braiding is believed to be possible only in interacting quantum systems, e.g., topological superconductors. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new strategy of topological braiding that emerges from non-Abelian topological insulators, a class of recently discovered multi-band topological phase. We unveil a mathematical connection between braiding and non-Abelian quaternion invariants, by which Bloch eigenmodes under parallel transport produce braid sequences protected by the non-Abelian band topology. The braiding is also associated with geometric phases quantized over half the Brillouin zone. This new type of non-Abelian topological braiding is experimentally realized in acoustic systems with periodic synthetic dimensions. The results show that the principle discovered here is a new strategy towards topological braiding and can be extended for other types of classical waves and non-interacting quantum systems.

Title: On-chip photon entanglement-assisted topology loading and transfer
Authors: Haoqi Zhao, Yichi Zhang, Isaac Nape, Shuang Wu, Yaoyang Ji, Chenjie Zhang, Yijie Shen, Andrew Forbes, Liang Feng
Abstract: Topological protection offers a robust solution to the challenges of noise and loss in physical systems. By integrating topological physics into optics, loading and encoding quantum states into topological invariants can provide resilience to information systems in the face of environmental disruptions. Here, we demonstrate on-chip loading and entanglement-assisted transfer of photon topology, where the topological structure is coherently encoded in a single-photon spin-textured quantum state, which can be transferred, through entanglement distribution, into a non-local quantum-correlated topology shared between two entangled photons. Throughout the transfer process, the topology remains protected against substantial background noise as well as isotropic and anisotropic disturbances, while quantum correlations persist. Our framework for loading and transferring topology is compatible with quantum teleportation when ancillary photons are introduced, thereby promising the development of distributed quantum systems with inherently secure and protected information channels. This approach serves as a step toward building robust quantum interconnects and advancing distributed quantum information technology mediated by topology.

Title: Circuit compression for 2D quantum dynamics
Authors: Matteo D'Anna, Yuxuan Zhang, Roeland Wiersema, Manuel S. Rudolph, Juan Carrasquilla
Abstract: The study of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics remains one of the most exciting research frontiers of physics, standing at the crossroads of our understanding of complex quantum phenomena and the realization of quantum advantage. Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically require deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and imperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum circuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for quantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising path forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational ansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli propagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that implement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and beyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to $30 \times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard Trotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To experimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on Quantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's dynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without optimization. Our circuit compression scheme brings us one step closer to a practical quantum advantage by allowing longer simulation times at reduced quantum resources and unlocks the exploration of large families of hardware-friendly ansätze.

Title: Improving GANs by leveraging the quantum noise from real hardware
Authors: Hongni Jin, Kenneth M. Merz Jr
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to generative adversarial networks (GANs) in which the standard i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior is replaced or hybridized with a quantum-correlated prior derived from measurements of a 16-qubit entangling circuit. Each latent sample is generated by grouping repeated shots per qubit into a binary fraction, applying the inverse Gaussian CDF to obtain a 16-dimensional Gaussian vector whose joint copula reflects genuine quantum entanglement, and then projecting into the high-dimensional space via a fixed random matrix. By pre-sampling tens of millions of bitstrings, either from a noiseless simulator or from IBM hardware, we build large pools of independent but internally quantum-correlated latents. We integrate this prior into three representative architectures (WGAN, SNGAN, BigGAN) on CIFAR-10, making no changes to the neural network structure or training hyperparameters. The hybrid latent representations incorporating hardware-derived noise consistently lower the FID relative to both the classical baseline and the simulator variant, especially when the quantum component constitutes a substantial fraction of the prior. In addition, we execute on the QPU in parallel to not only save computing time but also further decrease the FID up to 17% in BigGAN. These results indicate that intrinsic quantum randomness and device-specific imperfections can provide a structured inductive bias that enhances GAN performance. Our work demonstrates a practical pipeline for leveraging noisy quantum hardware to enrich deep-generative modeling, opening a new interface between quantum information and machine learning.

Title: Analyzing Common Electronic Structure Theory Algorithms for Distributed Quantum Computing
Authors: Grier M. Jones, Hans-Arno Jacobsen
Abstract: To move towards the utility era of quantum computing, many corporations have posed distributed quantum computing (DQC) as a framework for scaling the current generation of devices for practical applications. One of these applications is quantum chemistry, also known as electronic structure theory, which has been poised as a "killer application" of quantum computing, To this end, we analyze five electronic structure methods, found in common packages such as Tequila and ffsim, which can be easily interfaced with the Qiskit Circuit Cutting addon. Herein, we provide insights into cutting these algorithms using local operations (LO) to determine their aptitude for distribution. The key findings of our work are that many of these algorithms cannot be efficiently parallelized using LO, and new methods must be developed to apply electronic structure theory within a DQC framework.

Title: Deterministic Equations for Feedback Control of Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Alberto J. B. Rosal, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Feedback control in open quantum dynamics is crucial for the advancement of various coherent platforms. For a proper theoretical description, however, most feedback schemes rely on stochastic trajectories, which require significant statistical sampling and lack analytical insight. Currently, only a handful of deterministic feedback master equations exist in the literature. In this letter we derive a set of deterministic equations for describing feedback schemes based on generic causal signals. Our formulation is phrased in terms of sequentially applied quantum instruments, and is therefore extremely general, recovering various known results in the literature as particular cases. We then specialize this result to the case of quantum jumps and derive a new deterministic equation that allows for feedback based on the channel of the last jump, as well as the time since the last jump occurred. The strength of this formalism is illustrated with a detailed study of population inversion of a qubit using coherent drive and feedback, where our formalism allows all calculations to be performed analytically.

Title: A time operator and the time-of-arrival problem in quantum field theory
Authors: Daniele Colosi (ENES-Morelia-UNAM), Robert Oeckl (CCM-UNAM)
Abstract: The Newton-Wigner states and operator are widely accepted to provide an adequate notion of spatial localization of a particle in quantum field theory on a spacelike hypersurface. Replacing the spacelike with a timelike hypersurface, we construct one-particle states of massive Klein-Gordon theory that are localized on the hypersurface in the temporal as well as two spatial directions. This addresses the longstanding problem of a "time operator" in quantum theory. It is made possible by recent advances in quantization on timelike hypersurfaces and the introduction of evanescent particles. As a first application of time-localized states, we consider the time-of-arrival problem. Our results are in accordance with semiclassical expectations of causal propagation of massless and massive particles. As in the Newton-Wigner case, localization is not perfect, but apparent superluminal propagation is exponentially suppressed.

Title: Pedagogical approach to anomalous position and velocity
Authors: Younsik Kim, Suk Bum Chung, Changyoung Kim
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a pedagogical method in deriving the expressions for anomalous position and velocity. While we follow the steps used in optics in the derivation of the group velocity, we use Bloch wave functions instead of plane wave states. In comparison to the plane wave case, application of Bloch wave functions results in two additional terms in the expression of the group velocity: the Berry phase factor and anomalous position contributions. These two new terms with distinct origins eventually lead to the known anomalous velocity. Aiming for an intuitive understanding, we simulate the situation under an electric field using linear-combination-of-atomic-orbital states and visually demonstrate that the envelope function exhibits the transverse motion expected from an anomalous velocity.

Title: Gauging Non-Invertible Symmetries in (2+1)d Topological Orders
Authors: Mahesh K. N. Balasubramanian, Matthew Buican, Clement Delcamp, Rajath Radhakrishnan
Abstract: We present practical and formal methods for gauging non-invertible symmetries in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. Along the way, we generalize various aspects of invertible 0-form gauging, including symmetry fractionalization, discrete torsion, and the fixed point theorem for symmetry action on lines. Our approach involves two complementary strands: the fusion of topological interfaces and Morita theory of fusion 2-categories. We use these methods to derive constraints on gaugeable symmetries and their duals while unifying the prescription for gauging non-invertible 0-form and 1-form symmetries and various higher structures. With a view toward recent advances in creating non-Abelian topological orders from Abelian ones, we give a simple recipe for non-invertible 0-form gauging that takes large classes of the latter to the former. We also describe conditions under which iterated gauging of invertible 0-form symmetries is equivalent to a single-step gauging of a non-invertible symmetry. We conclude with a set of concrete examples illustrating these various phenomena involving gauging symmetries of the infrared limit of the toric code.

Title: Tensor network methods for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on fine grids
Authors: Ryan J. J. Connor, Callum W. Duncan, Andrew J. Daley
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its generalisations to dissipative and dipolar gases have been very useful in describing dynamics of cold atomic gases, as well as polaritons and other nonlinear systems. For some of these applications the numerically accessible grid spacing can become a limiting factor, especially in describing turbulent dynamics and short-range effects of dipole-dipole interactions. We explore the application of tensor networks to these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics), they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas experiments that are challenging for existing methods.

Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field in the background of the Einstein universe. We determine numerically the structure of the UV-divergent terms. We study analytically the IR term that originates in the long-range correlations arising from the field zero mode on the sphere. We compare with previous results for a scalar field in a dS or AdS background.

Title: Thermodynamic bound on current fluctuations in coherent conductors
Authors: Kay Brandner, Keiji Saito
Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the large-deviation functions of particle currents in coherent conductors. This bound depends only on the mean value of the relevant current and the total rate of entropy production required to maintain a non-equilibrium steady state, thus showing that both typical and rare current fluctuations are ultimately constrained by dissipation. Our analysis relies on the scattering approach to quantum transport and applies to any multi-terminal setup with arbitrary chemical potential and temperature gradients, provided the transmission coefficients between reservoirs are symmetric. This condition is satisfied for any two-terminal system and, more generally, when the dynamics of particles within the conductor are symmetric under time-reversal. For typical current fluctuations, we recover a recently derived thermodynamic uncertainty relation for coherent transport. To illustrate our theory, we analyze a specific model comprising two reservoirs connected by a chain of quantum dots, which shows that our bound can be saturated asymptotically.

Title: Ultralow-loss diamond nanomechanics enabled by van der Waals self-assembly
Authors: Guanhao Huang, Chang Jin, Sophie Weiyi Ding, Marko Lončar
Abstract: Nanomechanical systems are critical platforms for precision measurement, sensing, macroscopic quantum physics, and emerging quantum-information technologies. In these applications, high mechanical quality factors, often achieved using dissipation dilution, are important since they directly enhance measurement sensitivity and quantum coherence. However, surface stiction intrinsic to nanoscale structures severely limits their performance. Here, we transform this longstanding obstacle into a solution for tension-enabled dissipation dilution, via a novel van der Waals (vdW) self-assembly method. Leveraging intrinsic nanoscale surface interactions, we achieve controlled tensile stresses up to 1.3GPa in single-crystal diamond--an ideal but notoriously difficult material to strain-engineer--without introducing additional interface losses. We demonstrate mechanical quality factors exceeding 100 million at 5K, surpassing state-of-the-art systems at comparable aspect ratios. This versatile approach, applicable to other crystalline materials, opens up avenues using cryogenic nanomechanical systems for ultra-precise quantum sensing, tests of quantum gravity, and hybrid quantum systems.

Title: Probing aqueous interfaces with spin defects
Authors: Alfonso Castillo, Gustavo R. Perez-Lemus, Mykyta Onizhuk, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Understanding the physical and chemical properties of aqueous interfaces is important in diverse fields of science, ranging from biology and chemistry to materials science. In spite of crucial progress in surface sensitive spectroscopic techniques over the past decades, the microscopic properties of aqueous interfaces remain difficult to measure. Here we explore the use of noise spectroscopy to characterize interfacial properties, specifically of quantum sensors hosted in two-dimensional materials in contact with water. We combine molecular dynamics simulations of water/graphene interfaces and the calculations of the spin dynamics of an NV-like color center, and we investigate the impact of interfacial water and simple ions on the decoherence time of the defect. We show that the Hahn echo coherence time of the NV center is sensitive to motional narrowing and to the hydrogen bonding arrangement and the dynamical properties of water and ions at the interface. We present results as a function of the liquid temperature, strength of the water-surface interaction, and for varied mono-valent and di-valent ions, highlighting the broad applicability of near-surface qubits to gain insight into the properties of aqueous interfaces.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning in Transportation: A Case Study of Pedestrian Stress Modelling
Authors: Bara Rababa, Bilal Farooq
Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

Title: Floquet spin textures in optically pumped non-Hermitian surface states
Authors: Xiao-Xiao Zhang, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: Optical effects of quantum matter with interaction are key to physics and technology. The class of non-Hermitian (NH) phenomena is mostly explored in cold atoms, photonics, and metamaterials out of equilibrium. Effective NH systems due to interaction in equilibrium solids, however, provide a unique opportunity for realizing light-NH matter hybrids via periodic irradiation. Given NH topological surface states with magnetic disorder, here we reveal spectroscopically observable Floquet spin textures for this hybrid quantum matter: merged meron strings, dichroic skyrmions, and domain structure accompanying vortices in energy planes; Bloch lines and topologically twisted vortex rings distinct from Hopfions in energy-momentum space; topological selectiveness of linear polarization occurs besides circular dichroism. Spectroscopic energy evolution and chemical potential dependence are key ingredients of this open hybrid system. With spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, this scenario bears prime physical interest by reaching the crossroad between solid-state interaction effects, non-Hermiticity, and light-matter coupling.

Title: An Algorithm for Automated Extraction of Resonance Parameters from the Stabilization Method
Authors: Johanna Langner, Anjan Sadhukhan, Jayanta K. Saha, Henryk A. Witek
Abstract: The application of the stabilization method [A.~U.\ Hazi and H.~S.\ Taylor, Phys.~Rev.~A {\bf 1}, 1109 (1970)]) to extract accurate energy and lifetimes of resonance states is challenging: The process requires labor-intensive numerical manipulation of a large number of eigenvalues of a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian matrix, followed by a fitting procedure. In this article, we present \dosmax, an efficient algorithm implemented as an open-access \texttt{Python} code, which offers full automation of the stabilization diagram analysis in a user-friendly environment while maintaining high numerical precision of the computed resonance characteristics. As a test case, we use \dosmax to analyze the natural parity doubly-excited resonance states (${}^{1}\textnormal{S}^{\textnormal{e}}$, ${}^{3}\textnormal{S}^{\textnormal{e}}$, ${}^{1}\textnormal{P}^{\textnormal{o}}$, and ${}^{3}\textnormal{P}^{\textnormal{o}}$) of helium, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the developed methodology. The presented algorithm is applicable to a wide range of resonances in atomic, molecular, and nuclear systems.

Title: Surrogate Modeling via Factorization Machine and Ising Model with Enhanced Higher-Order Interaction Learning
Authors: Anbang Wang, Dunbo Cai, Yu Zhang, Yangqing Huang, Xiangyang Feng, Zhihong Zhang
Abstract: Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance. Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate models that exploit potential quantum advantages.

Title: The principle of least action for random graphs
Authors: Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the physical action $S$ for random graphs, by treating the number of neighbors at each vertex of the graph (degree), as a scalar field. For each configuration (run) of the graph we calculate the Lagrangian of the degree field by using a lattice quantum field theory(LQFT) approach. Then the corresponding action is calculated by integrating the Lagrangian over all the vertices of the graph. We implement an evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental quantum of time, resulting in different evolution paths based on the run that is chosen at each evolution step. We calculate the action along each of these evolution paths, which allows us to calculate the probability distribution of $S$. We find that the distribution approaches the normal(Gaussian) form as the graph becomes denser, by adding more edges between its vertices. The maximum of the probability distribution of the action corresponds to graph configurations whose spacing between the values of $S$ becomes zero $\Delta S=0$, corresponding to the least-action (Hamilton) principle, which gives the path that the physical system follows classically. In addition, we calculate the fluctuations(variance) of the degree field showing that the graph configurations corresponding to the maximum probability of $S$, which follow the Hamilton's principle, have a balanced structure between regular and irregular graphs.

Title: Energetically efficient, mediated mechanical system for precise control of hoisting operations
Authors: Mikel Palmero, Juan Gonzalo Muga, Ander Tobalina
Abstract: We introduce a mechanical control system for energy efficient and robust hoisting crane operations. The control system efficiently translates the harmonic motion of a spring loaded mediating system into the desired driving of the load, recyling most of the employed energy for subsequent operations. The control output is a shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol borrowed from quantum mechanics. The control system reduces the single operation consuption in realistic working regimes, but it is in cyclical processes where the energetical advantage becomes substantial. The design of the control system and the control output is flexible enough to allow additional optimization of the robustness against perturbations.

Title: Wilson Line and Disorder Invariants of Topological One-Dimensional Multiband Models
Authors: R. Moola, A. Mckenna, M. Hilke
Abstract: Topological invariants, such as the winding number, the Chern number, and the Zak phase, characterize the topological phases of bulk materials. Through the bulk-boundary correspondence, these topological phases have a one-to-one correspondence to topological edge states, which are robust to certain classes of disorder. For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the computation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however, in multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce the unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk topological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically to evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large number of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all topological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants, such as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments, we determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like configuration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave certain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending on their symmetry properties. Our approach is illustrated using different one-dimensional models, providing a robust framework for understanding topological properties in one-dimensional systems.

Title: Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method
Authors: Xiao Liang
Abstract: Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.

Title: Improved energies and wave function accuracy with Weighted Variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Huan Zhang, Robert J. Webber, Michael Lindsey, Timothy C. Berkelbach, Jonathan Weare
Abstract: Neural network parametrizations have increasingly been used to represent the ground and excited states in variational Monte Carlo (VMC) with promising results. However, traditional VMC methods only optimize the wave function in regions of peak probability. The wave function is uncontrolled in the tails of the probability distribution, which can limit the accuracy of the trained wavefunction approximation. To improve the approximation accuracy in the probability tails, this paper interprets VMC as a gradient flow in the space of wave functions, followed by a projection step. From this perspective, arbitrary probability distributions can be used in the projection step, allowing the user to prioritize accuracy in different regions of state space. Motivated by this theoretical perspective, the paper tests a new weighted VMC method on the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model for a periodic spin chain. Compared to traditional VMC, weighted VMC reduces the error in the ground state energy by a factor of 2 and it reduces the errors in the local energies away from the mode by large factors of $10^2$--$10^4$.

Title: String Breaking Dynamics and Glueball Formation in a $2+1$D Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Kaidi Xu, Umberto Borla, Sergej Moroz, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in the $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields, we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors.

Title: Classical Simulation of High Temperature Quantum Ising Models
Authors: Elizabeth Crosson, Samuel Slezak
Abstract: We consider generalized quantum Ising models, including those which could describe disordered materials or quantum annealers, and we prove that for all temperatures above a system-size independent threshold the path integral Monte Carlo method based on worldline heat-bath updates always mixes to stationarity in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ for an $n$ qubit system, and therefore provides a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function. This result holds whenever the temperature is greater than four plus twice the maximum interaction degree (valence) over all qubits, measured in units of the local coupling strength. For example, this implies that the classical simulation of the thermal state of a superconducting device modeling a frustrated quantum Ising model with maximum valence of 6 and coupling strengths of 1 GHz is always possible at temperatures above 800 mK. Despite the quantum system being at high temperature, the classical spin system resulting from the quantum-to-classical mapping contains strong couplings which cause the single-site Glauber dynamics to mix slowly, therefore this result depends on the use of worldline updates (which are a form of cluster updates that can be implemented efficiently). This result places definite constraints on the temperatures required for a quantum advantage in analog quantum simulation with various NISQ devices based on equilibrium states of quantum Ising models.

Title: Quantum-enhanced photocell based on GaN quantum dots
Authors: Aditya Dev, Sumit Chaudhary, Jay Reshamiya, Abhishek Chakraborty, Vishvendra Singh Poonia
Abstract: In this work, we propose an efficient quantum-enhanced solid-state photocell based on GaN quantum dots. We exploit the strong built-in electric field in GaN QDs and excitonic dipole-dipole coupling between adjacent QDs to break detailed balance, leading to enhanced device performance. This mechanism is significantly stronger than Fano interference, and our results demonstrate that such a photocell exhibits increased photovoltage and photocurrent compared to its classical counterparts. Numerical simulations further show that the efficiency remains positive and saturates at a finite value for multi-quantum dot systems. The proposed quantum photocell represents a promising step towards harnessing quantum effects in practical energy-harvesting devices.

Abstract: We establish the comprehensive theoretical framework for an exact description of the open system dynamics of permutationally invariant (PI) states in arbitrary $N$-qudit systems when this dynamics preserves the PI symmetry over time. Thanks to the powerful Schur-Weyl duality formalism, we unveil the internal links between the canonical time-local Lindblad-like master equation and the Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics of each permutationally-invariant degree of freedom (Schur subspaces). Our approach does not require one to compute the Schur transform as it operates directly within the restricted PI operator subspace of the Liouville space, whose dimension only scales polynomially with the number of qudits. We introduce the concept of $3\nu$-symbol matrix, where $\nu$ here denotes an integer partition, that proves to be very useful in this context.

Title: Distributed Scheduling of Quantum Circuits with Noise and Time Optimization
Authors: Debasmita Bhoumik, Ritajit Majumdar, Amit Saha, Susmita Sur-Kolay
Abstract: Quantum computers are currently noisy, particularly without error correction and fault tolerance. Methods like error suppression and mitigation are widely used to improve performance. Circuit cutting, which partitions a circuit into smaller subcircuits, can also reduce noise. In this paper, we propose an Integer Linear Program (ILP) based scheduler for optimizing subcircuit schedules on available hardware. The goal is to maximize overall fidelity and ensure each hardware does not exceed its predefined execution time. For 10-qubit circuits, our method achieves an average fidelity improvement of ~12.3% and ~21% with and without measurement error mitigation, respectively, even with minimal execution time. Additionally, we introduce a polynomial-time graph-theoretic scheduling method that matches the ILP scheduler's results when the number of subcircuits does not exceed the number of hardware units, each with minimal execution time. This noise and time-optimized scheduler represents a crucial step towards optimal quantum computing performance, especially with limited hardware access.

Title: Experimental signatures of Hilbert-space ergodicity: Universal bitstring distributions and applications in noise learning
Authors: Adam L. Shaw, Daniel K. Mark, Joonhee Choi, Ran Finkelstein, Pascal Scholl, Soonwon Choi, Manuel Endres
Abstract: Systems reaching thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous. For classical systems, this phenomenon is typically understood statistically through ergodicity in phase space, but translating this to quantum systems is a long-standing problem of interest. Recently a strong notion of quantum ergodicity has been proposed, namely that isolated, global quantum states uniformly explore their available state space, dubbed Hilbert-space ergodicity. Here we observe signatures of this process with an experimental Rydberg quantum simulator and various numerical models, before generalizing to the case of a local quantum system interacting with its environment. For a closed system, where the environment is a complementary subsystem, we predict and observe a smooth quantum-to-classical transition in that observables progress from large, quantum fluctuations to small, Gaussian fluctuations as the bath size grows. This transition exhibits universal properties on a quantitative level amongst a wide range of systems, including those at finite temperature, those with itinerant particles, and random circuits. For an open system, where the environment is uncontrolled, we predict the statistics of observables under largely arbitrary noise channels including those with correlated errors, allowing us to discriminate between candidate error models both for continuous Hamiltonian time evolution and for digital random circuits. This allows for computationally efficient experimental noise learning, and more broadly is a new avenue for quantitatively classifying the behavior of noisy quantum systems. Ultimately our results clarify the role of ergodicity in quantum dynamics, with fundamental and practical consequences.

Title: Thermodynamics of autonomous optical Bloch equations
Authors: Samyak Pratyush Prasad, Maria Maffei, Patrice A. Camati, Cyril Elouard, Alexia Auffèves
Abstract: Optical Bloch Equations (OBEs) are canonical equations describing the dynamics of a classically driven atom coupled to a thermal bath. Their thermodynamics is highly relevant to establish fundamental energetic bounds of key quantum processes. A consistent framework is available in the regime where the drives and baths can be treated classically, i.e. remains insensitive to the coupling with the atom. This regime, however, is not adapted to explore minimal energy costs, nor to measure atom-induced energy variations inside drives and baths -- a key ability to directly measure and optimize work and heat exchanges. This calls for a new framework accounting for atomic back-actions on drives and baths. Here we build such a framework by describing the atom, the drive and the bath as a joint autonomous system, the drive and the bath being parts of the same electromagnetic field. Our approach captures atom-field correlations at fundamental timescales, as well as the atomic back-action on the field, allowing us to define work-like (heat-like) flows as energy flows stemming from effective unitary dynamics induced by one system on the other (non-unitary correlating dynamics). Time-integrated work-like and heat-like flows are directly measurable in the field, as changes of the mean field and fluctuations, respectively. Our approach differs from standard analyses by identifying an additional unitary contribution in the atom's dynamics, the self-drive, and its energetic counterpart, the self-work, yielding a tighter expression of the second law. We relate this tightening to the extra knowledge about the field state, as well as the potential of the interacted driving field to be recycled. Our autonomous framework deepens the current understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and its potential for energy management at quantum scales.

Title: Fourier Series Guided Design of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting
Authors: Sandra Leticia Juárez Osorio, Mayra Alejandra Rivera Ruiz, Andres Mendez-Vazquez, Eduardo Rodriguez-Tello
Abstract: In this study, we apply 1D quantum convolution to address the task of time series forecasting. By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.

Title: Numerical solution of nonlinear Schrödinger equation by a hybrid pseudospectral-variational quantum algorithm
Authors: Nikolas Köcher, Hendrik Rose, Jörg Schumacher, Stefan Schumacher
Abstract: The time-dependent one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is solved numerically by a hybrid pseudospectral-variational quantum algorithm that connects a pseudospectral step for the Hamiltonian term with a variational step for the nonlinear term. The Hamiltonian term is treated as an integrating factor by forward and backward Fourier transformations, which are here carried out classically. This split allows us to avoid higher-order time integration schemes, to apply a first-order explicit time stepping for the remaining nonlinear NLSE term in a variational algorithm block, and thus to avoid numerical instabilities. We demonstrate that the analytical solution is reproduced with a small root mean square error for a long time interval over which a nonlinear soliton propagates significantly forward in space while keeping its shape. We analyze the accuracy of the quantum algorithm and compare it with classical approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of algorithm parameters on the accuracy of the results, including the temporal step width and the depth of the quantum circuit.

Title: Transmission of quantum information through quantum fields in curved spacetimes
Authors: Michael Kasprzak, Erickson Tjoa
Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly covariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.

Title: Stability and Loop Models from Decohering Non-Abelian Topological Order
Authors: Pablo Sala, Ruben Verresen
Abstract: Decohering topological order (TO) is central to the many-body physics of open quantum matter and decoding transitions. We identify relevant statistical mechanical models for decohering non-Abelian TO, which have been crucial for understanding the error threshold of Abelian stabilizer codes. The decohered density matrix can be described by loop models, whose topological loop weight $N$ is given by the quantum dimension of the decohering anyon -- reducing to the Ising model if $N=1$. In particular, the Rényi-$n$ moments of the decohered state correspond to $n$ coupled O$(N)$ loop models, and we exactly diagonalize the density matrix at maximal error rate. This allows us to relate the fidelity between two logically distinct ground states to properties of random O$(N)$ loop and spin models. Utilizing the literature on loop models, we find a remarkable stability to quantum channels which proliferate non-Abelian anyons with large quantum dimension, with the possibility of critical phases for smaller dimensions. We confirm our framework with exact results for Kitaev quantum double models, and with numerical simulations for the non-Abelian phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter is an example of a non-fixed-point wavefunction with non-bosonic and non-integral anyon dimensions. Our work opens up the possibility of non-Abelian TO being robust against maximally proliferating certain anyons, which can inform error-correction studies of these topological memories.

Title: Double-bracket quantum algorithms for quantum imaginary-time evolution
Authors: Marek Gluza, Jeongrak Son, Bi Hong Tiang, René Zander, Raphael Seidel, Yudai Suzuki, Zoë Holmes, Nelly H. Y. Ng
Abstract: Efficiently preparing approximate ground-states of large, strongly correlated systems on quantum hardware is challenging and yet nature is innately adept at this. This has motivated the study of thermodynamically inspired approaches to ground-state preparation that aim to replicate cooling processes via imaginary-time evolution. However, synthesizing quantum circuits that efficiently implement imaginary-time evolution is itself difficult, with prior proposals generally adopting heuristic variational approaches or using deep block encodings. Here, we use the insight that quantum imaginary-time evolution is a solution of Brockett's double-bracket flow and synthesize circuits that implement double-bracket flows coherently on the quantum computer. We prove that our Double-Bracket Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (DB-QITE) algorithm inherits the cooling guarantees of imaginary-time evolution. Concretely, each step is guaranteed to i) decrease the energy of an initial approximate ground-state by an amount proportion to the energy fluctuations of the initial state and ii) increase the fidelity with the ground-state. We provide gate counts for DB-QITE through numerical simulations in Qrisp which demonstrate scenarios where DB-QITE outperforms quantum phase estimation. Thus DB-QITE provides a means to systematically improve the approximation of a ground-state using shallow circuits.

Title: Surveying optically addressable spin qubits for quantum information and sensing technology
Authors: Calysta A. Tesiman, Mark Oxborrow, Max Attwood
Abstract: Quantum technologies offer ways to solve certain tasks more quickly, efficiently, and with greater precision than their classical counterparts. Yet substantial challenges remain in the construction of sufficiently error-free and scalable quantum platforms needed to unlock any real benefits to society. Acknowledging that this hardware can take vastly different forms, our review here focuses on so-called spintronic (\textit{i.e.}~spin-electronic) materials that use electronic or nuclear spins to embody qubits. Towards helping the reader to spot trends and pick winners, we have surveyed the various families of optically addressable spin qubits and attempted to benchmark and identify the most promising ones in each. We go on to reveal further trends that demonstrate how qubit lifetimes depend on the material's synthesis, the concentration/distribution of its embedded qubits, and the experimental conditions.

Title: A symmetry-protected topological optical lattice clock
Authors: Tianrui Xu, Anjun Chu, Kyungtae Kim, James K. Thompson, Jun Ye, Tilman Esslinger, Ana Maria Rey
Abstract: We theoretically propose a tunable implementation of symmetry-protected topological phases in a synthetic superlattice, taking advantage of the long coherence time and exquisite spectral resolutions offered by gravity-tilted optical lattice clocks. We describe a protocol similar to Rabi spectroscopy that can be used to probe the distinct topological properties of our system. We then demonstrate how the sensitivity of clocks and interferometers can be improved by the protection to unwanted experimental imperfections offered by the underlying topological robustness. The proposed implementation opens a path to exploit the unique opportunities offered by symmetry-protected topological phases in state-of-the-art quantum sensors.

Title: Belavkin-Staszewski Quantum Markov Chains
Authors: Andreas Bluhm, Ángela Capel, Pablo Costa Rico, Anna Jenčová
Abstract: It is well-known that the conditional mutual information of a quantum state is zero if, and only if, the quantum state is a quantum Markov chain. Replacing the Umegaki relative entropy in the definition of the conditional mutual information by the Belavkin-Staszewski (BS) relative entropy, we obtain the BS-conditional mutual information, and we call the states with zero BS-conditional mutual information Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains. In this article, we establish a correspondence which relates quantum Markov chains and BS-quantum Markov chains. This correspondence allows us to find a recovery map for the BS-entropy in the spirit of the Petz recovery map. Furthermore, we show that, over the set of BS-quantum Markov chains, this correspondence constitutes an entanglement-breaking map. Moreover, we prove a structural decomposition of the Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains and also study states for which the BS-conditional mutual information is only approximately zero. We subsequently extend the aforementioned correspondence, structural decomposition and recovery map to arbitrary pairs of states and conditional expectations. As an application of the correspondence, we find the first family of states with non-vanishing conditional mutual information for which it decays superexponentially fast with the size of the middle system.

Title: Optimized Spectral Purity of Heralded Single Photons at the Telecom O-Band
Authors: Wu-Hao Cai, Soyoung Baek, Rui-Bo Jin, Fumihiro Kaneda
Abstract: We report on optimizing the spectral purity of heralded single photons in the telecom O-band, where single photons can be propagated with low loss and low dispersion in a standard telecom optical fiber. We numerically searched for various group-velocity-matching conditions and corresponding optimal poling structures of a potassium titanyl phosphate crystal for spontaneous parametric downconversion. Our poling optimization results using phase-matching coherence-length and sub-coherence-length modulation schemes show > 99.4% spectral purity with pump wavelengths ranging from 603.8 nm to 887.3 nm. Some optimized configurations are feasible with off-the-shelf lasers and single-photon detectors. Moreover, by investigating noise photon spectra for different poling optimization methods, we show that, in practice, appropriate, gentle spectral filtering helps achieve high purity. This study will pave the way for developing practical quantum sources for quantum information applications at the telecom O-band.

Title: Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases
Authors: M. A. Rajabpour, M. A. Seifi Mirjafarlou, Reyhaneh Khasseh
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-Rényi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.

Title: Formal Integration of Electron Scattering Processes via Separation of Dynamical and Geometric Contributions
Authors: Lorenzo Bagnasacco, Fabio Taddei, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: By decoupling the geometric from the dynamical contributions in the scattering processes, we develop a method to compute the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.

Title: Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus
Authors: Einat Buznach, Debanjan Chowdhury, Jonathan Ruhman
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.

Title: Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array
Authors: Gonzalo Martín-Vázquez, Taneli Tolppanen, Matti Silveri
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.

Title: Enhanced quantum frequency estimation by nonlinear scrambling
Authors: Victor Montenegro, Sara Dornetti, Alessandro Ferraro, Matteo G. A. Paris
Abstract: Frequency estimation, a cornerstone of basic and applied sciences, has been significantly enhanced by quantum sensing strategies. Despite breakthroughs in quantum-enhanced frequency estimation, key challenges remain: static probes limit flexibility, and the interplay between resource efficiency, sensing precision, and potential enhancements from nonlinear probes remains not fully understood. In this work, we show that dynamically encoding an unknown frequency in a nonlinear quantum electromagnetic field can significantly improve frequency estimation. To provide a fair comparison of resources, we define the energy cost as the figure of merit for our sensing strategy. We further show that specific higher-order nonlinear processes lead to nonlinear-enhanced frequency estimation. This enhancement results from quantum scrambling, where local quantum information spreads across a larger portion of the Hilbert space. We quantify this effect using the Wigner-Yanase skew information, which measures the degree of noncommutativity in the Hamiltonian structure. Our work sheds light on the connection between Wigner-Yanase skew information and quantum sensing, providing a direct method to optimize nonlinear quantum probes.

Title: Estimating Bell Diagonal States with Separable Measurements
Authors: Noah Kaufmann, Maria Quadeer, David Elkouss
Abstract: Quantum network protocols depend on the availability of shared entanglement. Given that entanglement generation and distribution are affected by noise, characterization of the shared entangled states is essential to bound the errors of the protocols. This work analyzes the estimation of Bell diagonal states within quantum networks, where operations are limited to local actions and classical communication. We demonstrate the advantages of Bayesian mean estimation over direct inversion and maximum likelihood estimation, providing analytical expressions for estimation risk and supporting our findings with numerical simulations.

Title: Simultaneous optical phase and loss estimation revisited: measurement and probe incompatibility
Authors: Matheus Eiji Ohno Bezerra, Francesco Albarelli, Rafal Demkowicz-Dobrzanski
Abstract: Quantum multiparameter metrology is hindered by incompatibility issues, such as finding a single probe state (probe incompatibility) and a single measurement (measurement incompatibility) optimal for all parameters. The simultaneous estimation of phase shift and loss in a single optical mode is a paradigmatic multiparameter metrological problem in which such tradeoffs are present. We consider two settings: single-mode or two-mode probes (with a reference lossless mode), and for each setting we consider either Gaussian states or arbitrary quantum states of light restricted only by a maximal number of photons allowed. We find numerically that, as the number of photons increases, there are quantum states of light for which probe incompatibility disappears both in the single- and two-mode scenarios. On the other hand, for Gaussian states, probe incompatibility is present in the single-mode case and may be removed only in the two-mode setting thanks to the entanglement with the reference mode. Finally, we provide strong arguments that the fundamental incompatibility aspect of the model is measurement incompatibility, which persists for all the scenarios considered, and unlike probe-incompatibility cannot be overcome even in the large photon number limit.

Title: Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination
Authors: Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining a tighter characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric Rényi and Petz Rényi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.

Title: Verifiable End-to-End Delegated Variational Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Matteo Inajetovic, Petros Wallden, Anna Pappa
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as promising candidates for solving complex optimization and machine learning tasks on near-term quantum hardware. However, executing quantum operations remains challenging for small-scale users because of several hardware constraints, making it desirable to delegate parts of the computation to more powerful quantum devices. In this work, we introduce a framework for delegated variational quantum algorithms (DVQAs), where a client with limited quantum capabilities delegates the execution of a VQA to a more powerful quantum server. In particular, we introduce a protocol that enables a client to delegate a variational quantum algorithm to a server while ensuring that the input, the output and also the computation itself remain secret. Additionally, if the protocol does not abort, the client can be certain that the computation outcome is indeed correct. This work builds on the general verification protocol introduced by Fitzimons and Kashefi (2017), tailoring it to VQAs. Our approach first proposes a verifiable Protocol for delegating the quantum computation required at each optimization step of a VQA, and then combines the iterative steps into an error-resilient optimization process that offers end-to-end verifiable algorithm execution. We also simulate the performance of our protocol tackling the Transverse Field Ising Model. Our results demonstrate that secure delegation of variational quantum algorithms is a realistic solution for near-term quantum networks, paving the way for practical quantum cloud computing applications.

Title: A partition function framework for estimating logical error curves in stabilizer codes
Authors: Leon Wichette, Hans Hohenfeld, Elie Mounzer, Linnea Grans-Samuelsson
Abstract: Based on the mapping between stabilizer quantum error correcting codes and disordered statistical mechanics models, we define a ratio of partition functions that measures the success probability for maximum partition function decoding, which at the Nishimori temperature corresponds to maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. We show that this ratio differs from the similarly defined order probability and describe the decoding strategy whose success rate is described by the order probability. We refer to the latter as a probabilistic partition function decoding and show that it is the strategy that at zero temperature corresponds to maximum probability (MP) decoding. Based on the difference between the two decoders, we discuss the possibility of a maximum partition function decodability boundary outside the order-disorder phase boundary. At zero temperature, the difference between the two ratios measures to what degree MP decoding can be improved by accounting for degeneracy among maximum probability errors, through methods such as ensembling. We consider in detail the example of the toric code under bitflip noise, which maps to the Random Bond Ising Model. We demonstrate that estimation of logical performance through decoding probability and order probability is more sample efficient than estimation by counting failures of the corresponding decoders. We consider both uniform noise and noise where qubits are given individual error rates. The latter noise model lifts the degeneracy among maximum probability errors, but we show that ensembling remains useful as long as it also samples less probable errors.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning for Predicting Anastomotic Leak: A Clinical Study
Authors: Vojtěch Novák, Ivan Zelinka, Lenka Přibylová, Lubomír Martínek, Vladimír Benčurik
Abstract: Anastomotic leak (AL) is a life-threatening complication following colorectal surgery, and its accurate prediction remains a significant clinical challenge. This study explores the potential of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) for AL prediction, presenting a rigorous benchmark against hyperparameter-tuned classical models including logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, and boosting algorithms. Using a clinical dataset of 200 patients and four key predictors identified through statistical analysis, we evaluated QNNs with ZZFeatureMap encoding and EfficientSU2 and RealAmplitudes ansätze simulated under realistic hardware noise models. Our framework emphasizes robustness, with performance metrics averaged over 10 independent optimization runs using multiple algorithms. The EfficientSU2-BFGS combination achieved the highest mean AUC of $0.7966 \pm 0.0237$, while RealAmplitudes with CMA-ES excelled in Average Precision ($0.5041 \pm 0.1214$), critical for imbalanced medical datasets. We establish a direct link between optimizer convergence and model efficacy, where effective variational parameter optimization translates to improved classification metrics. Interpretability analysis suggests QNNs may capture complex, non-linear feature relationships not evident in classical linear models. This work highlights QNNs' potential as screening tools while underscoring the need for model selection based on specific clinical goals, pending validation on larger datasets.

Title: Effective criteria for entanglement witnesses in small dimensions
Authors: Łukasz Grzelka, Łukasz Skowronek, Karol Życzkowski
Abstract: We present an effective set of necessary and sufficient criteria for block-positivity of matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{C}$. The approach is based on Sturm sequences and quartic polynomial positivity conditions presented in recent literature. The procedure allows us to test whether a given $4\times 4$ complex matrix corresponds to an entanglement witness, and it is exact when the matrix coefficients belong to the rationals, extended by $\mathrm{i}$. The method can be generalized to $\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\mathcal{H}_d$ systems for $d>2$ to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity. We also outline an alternative approach to the problem relying on Gröbner bases.

Title: Optimizing brightness of SPDC source in Laguerre-Gaussian modes using type-0 periodically-poled nonlinear crystal
Authors: Jungmo Lee, Kyungdeuk Park, Dongkyu Kim, Yonggi Jo, Dong-Gil Im, Yong Sup Ihn
Abstract: Photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) can exhibit entanglement in the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode basis, which enables high-dimensional free-space quantum communication by exploiting the high-dimensional space spanned by the LG modes. For such free-space quantum communication, the brightness of the quantum light source plays an important role due to the atmospheric turbulence and photon loss. A variety of studies have analyzed the SPDC brightness by decomposing biphoton states into LG modes, but they have often relied on a degenerate state, a narrow spectral bandwidth approximation, or a thin crystal approximation. However, these approaches are unsuitable for non-degenerate type-0 SPDC with a periodicallypoled nonlinear crystal, which offers higher brightness due to its superior nonlinear coefficients. In this study, we examine the spectrum of photon pairs in specific LG modes generated by a type-0 ppKTP crystal whileavoiding the constraints imposed by the aforementioned assumptions. In addition, we investigate the optimal focal parameters of the pump, signal, and idler to maximize the brightness for a given LG mode. Our findings show that it is not feasible to simultaneously optimize the brightness for different LG modes with a single pump focal parameter. The results of this study provide a comprehensive framework for developing highbrightness quantum light sources and contribute to the advancement of high-dimensional free-space quantum communication.

Title: Learning to Maximize Quantum Neural Network Expressivity via Effective Rank
Authors: Juan Yao
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ansätze for solving variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance. Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge, impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the effective rank, denoted as $\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of expressivity. Specifically, $\kappa$ captures the number of effectively independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture, input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that $\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an $n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights, and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design space, we employ $\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes $\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine learning.

Title: Strategies for generating separable photon triplets in waveguides and ring resonators
Authors: Gisell Lorena Osorio, Milica Banic, Nicolás Quesada
Abstract: Photon triplet sources exhibit non-Gaussian features, a key property for applications in quantum computing and quantum information. However, spectral correlations can limit the performance and detection efficiency of these systems. Motivated by this, we present a theoretical analysis of the spectral correlations of photon triplets generated through spontaneous third-order parametric down-conversion in photonic devices, and discuss strategies to quantify and minimize them. We propose two strategies to minimize spectral correlations: dispersion engineering in waveguides and pump engineering in resonators. We apply these strategies in two realistic source designs, namely a high-index-contrast optical fiber taper and a silicon nitride microring resonator. Finally, we discuss detection strategies for probing non-Gaussian features of the triplet state. We find that it is feasible to achieve few-mode generation of photon triplets using state-of-the-art experimental systems, a crucial step toward practical applications of photon triplet sources in quantum technologies.

Title: Enhancing Expressivity of Quantum Neural Networks Based on the SWAP test
Authors: Sebastian Nagies, Emiliano Tolotti, Davide Pastorello, Enrico Blanzieri
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models, potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity, suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.

Abstract: Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Our work takes the first step towards exploring unique topological properties in infinite anisotropic topological models based on the promising FSL simulator.

Title: Certification of high stellar ranks of quantum states of light with a pair of click detectors
Authors: Jaromír Fiurášek
Abstract: Stellar rank of quantum states of light quantifies the amount of non-Gaussian resources required for their generation. One popular and practical approach to certification of stellar rank is based on measurement of click statistics with an array of binary detectors that can only distinguish the presence and absence of photons. Specifically, it was shown that measurements with an array of m+1 detectors allows one to certify stellar rank of approximate Fock state |m>, even when the state is subjected to losses or certain noise. Here we address the question how many click detectors are in principle required to certify high stellar ranks. We show that two click detectors arranged in a Hanbury Brown-Twiss setup suffice. Interestingly, detection of higher stellar rank is greatly facilitated by making the total detection efficiency of the detectors sufficiently low but well calibrated. Losses affect the response of the detection scheme in a way that can be exploited to certify stellar rank of high Fock states. We explicitly construct the corresponding stellar rank witnesses and discuss dependence of the stellar rank thresholds on parameters of the considered setup. Our results reveal that it is possible to certify high stellar ranks even with a minimalistic scheme that provides only very coarse grained information about the photon number statistics of the characterized state.

Title: Modeling and Characterization of Arbitrary Order Pulse Correlations for Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Ainhoa Agulleiro, Fadri Grünenfelder, Margarida Pereira, Guillermo Currás-Lorenzo, Hugo Zbinden, Marcos Curty, Davide Rusca
Abstract: In quantum key distribution (QKD) implementations, memory effects caused by the limited bandwidth of modulators and/or other active devices can leak information about previous setting choices. Security proofs addressing this imperfection require the characterization of pulse correlations, which, in principle, can be of an arbitrary order, even unbounded. Experimentally, this is very hard (if not impossible) to achieve. Here, we solve this pressing problem by introducing a simple linear model to explain pulse correlations. In so doing, we can derive upper bounds on the correlation strength of arbitrary order from the study of the step response of the system. Importantly, this is what is needed to ensure the security of QKD in the presence of pulse correlations of unbounded length. We experimentally characterize short-range correlations and apply the proposed method to account for long-range correlations to an infinite order.

Title: Computed tomography of propagating microwave photons
Authors: Qi-Ming Chen, Aarne Keränen, Aashish Sah, Mikko Möttönen
Abstract: Propagating photons serve as essential links for distributing quantum information and entanglement across distant nodes. Knowledge of their Wigner functions not only enables their deployment as active information carriers but also provides error diagnostics when photons passively leak from a quantum processing unit. While well-established for standing waves, characterizing propagating microwave photons requires post-processing of room-temperature signals with excessive amplification noise. Here, we demonstrate amplification-free Wigner function tomography of propagating microwave photons using a superconductor--normal-metal--superconductor bolometer based on the resistive heating effect of absorbed radiation. By introducing two-field interference in power detection, the bolometer acts as a sensitive and broadband quadrature detector that samples the input field at selected angles at millikelvin with no added noise. Adapting the principles of computed tomography (CT) in medical imaging, we implement Wigner function CT by combining quadrature histograms across different projection angles and demonstrate it for Gaussian states at the single-photon level. Compressed sensing and neural networks further reduce the projections to three without compromising the reconstruction quality. These results address the long-standing challenge of characterizing propagating microwave photons in a superconducting quantum network and establish a new avenue for real-time quantum error diagnostics and correction.

Title: Non-classicality of two-qubit quantum collision model: non-Markovian effects
Authors: Jai Lalita, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit quantum system in contact with an environment modeled by a microscopic collision model with added ancilla-ancilla collisions in the non-Markovian regime. Two schemes of the two-qubit collision model with carried-forward correlations are introduced. In one scheme, a single stream of ancillae interacts with only one of the qubits of the two-qubit system; in the other, both the qubits interact with two independent sequences of ancillae, which could be at the same or different temperatures. The system's non-Markovian evolution is examined using the trace distance measure, and the non-classicality of the system is studied using the Wigner function, non-classical volume, and concurrence. Also, interesting steady-state behavior is observed when both the independent ancillae are kept at the same temperature.

Title: Entanglement and Bell inequality violation in vector diboson systems produced in decays of spin-0 particles
Authors: Alexander Bernal, Paweł Caban, Jakub Rembieliński
Abstract: We discuss entanglement and the violation of the CGLMP inequality in a system of two vector bosons produced in the decay of a spin-0 particle. We assume the most general CPT conserving, Lorentz-invariant coupling of the spin-0 particle with the daughter bosons. We compute the most general two-boson density matrix obtained by averaging over kinematical configurations with an appropriate probability distribution (which can be obtained when both bosons subsequently decay into fermion-antifermion). We show that the two-boson state is entangled and violates the CGLMP inequality for all values of the (anomalous) coupling constants and that in this case the state is entangled iff it can violate the CGLMP inequality. As an exemplary process of this kind we use the decay $H\to ZZ$ with anomalous coupling.

Title: A universal black-box quantum Monte Carlo approach to quantum phase transitions
Authors: Nic Ezzell, Lev Barash, Itay Hen
Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite-temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility, applicable to essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. Combined with recent advancements in Monte Carlo, our approach enables a black-box framework for studying quantum phase transitions--without requiring prior knowledge of an order parameter or the manual design of model-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules. We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying a single implementation to the transverse-field Ising model, the XXZ model, and an ensemble of models related by random unitaries.

Title: Decoherence and wavefunction deformation of $D_4$ non-Abelian topological order
Authors: Pablo Sala, Jason Alicea, Ruben Verresen
Abstract: The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wavefunction deformations and quantum channels acting on $D_4$ TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with $D_4$ symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O$(2)$ loop model in the pure state case, and $n$ coupled O$(2)$ loop models for Rényi-$n$ quantities in the decoherence case -- corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension $2$. In particular, we find that the purity ($n=2$) remains deep in the $D_4$ TO for any decoherence strength, while the $n \to \infty$ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wavefunction deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ($n\to 1$) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these stat-mech models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the $D_4$ TO in addition to critical phases with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion this http URL opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders, and which in an ungauged formulation examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.

Title: One-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological crystalline insulator under space-time inversion symmetry
Authors: Ling Lin, Yongguan Ke, Chaohong Lee
Abstract: We explore a large family of one-dimensional (1D) topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ invariants protected by space-time inversion symmetry. This finding stands in marked contrast to the conventional classification of 1D band topology protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quantized polarization (Berry-Zak phase). Such kind of enriched topological phases relies on imposing restriction on tunneling forms. By considering the nontrivial relative polarization among sublattices (orbitals), we introduce the inversion winding number as a topological invariant for characterizing and categorizing band topology. The bulk-edge correspondence with regard to the inversion winding number is discussed. Leveraging real-space analysis, we discover disorder-induced topological Anderson insulators and propose to experimentally distinguish band topology through relative polarization of edge states or bulk states. Our comprehensive findings present a paradigmatic illustration for the ongoing investigation and classification of band topology in TCIs.

Title: Dynamic transition of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model: multi-particles and inter-particle interaction effects
Authors: Wen Liang, Zhenhua Yu
Abstract: How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes. Previous analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the case that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method. We find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and is suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.

Title: Out-of-time-order correlator computation based on discrete truncated Wigner approximation
Authors: Tatsuhiko Shirai, Takashi Mori
Abstract: We propose a method based on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) for computing out-of-time-order correlators. This method is applied to long-range interacting quantum spin systems where the interactions decay as a power law with distance. As a demonstration, we use a squared commutator of local operators and its higher-order extensions that describe quantum information scrambling under Hamilton dynamics. Our results reveal that the DTWA method accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of the average spreading of quantum information (i.e., the squared commutator) across all time regimes in strongly long-range interacting systems. We also identify limitations in the DTWA method when capturing dynamics in weakly long-range interacting systems and the fastest spreading of quantum information. Then we apply the DTWA method to investigate the system-size dependence of the scrambling time in strongly long-range interacting systems. We reveal that the scaling behavior of the scrambling time for large system sizes qualitatively changes depending on the interaction range. This work provides and demonstrates a new technique to study scrambling dynamics in long-range interacting quantum spin systems.

Title: Hybrid integrated ultra-low linewidth coil stabilized isolator-free widely tunable external cavity laser
Authors: David A. S. Heim, Debapam Bose, Kaikai Liu, Andrei Isichenko, Daniel J. Blumenthal
Abstract: Precision applications including quantum computing and sensing, mmWave/RF generation, and metrology, demand widely tunable, ultra-low phase noise lasers. Today, these experiments employ table-scale systems with bulk-optics and isolators to achieve requisite noise, stability, and tunability. Photonic integration will enable scalable, reliable and portable solutions. Here we report a hybrid-integrated external cavity widely tunable laser stabilized to a 10-meter-long integrated coil-resonator, achieving record-low 3 - 7 Hz fundamental linewidth across a 60 nm tuning range and 27 - 60 Hz integral linewidth with 1.8E-13 Allan deviation at 6.4 ms across 40 nm, delivering orders of magnitude frequency noise and integral linewidth reduction over state of the art. Stabilization is achieved without an optical isolator, leveraging resilience to optical feedback of 30 dB beyond that of commercial DFB lasers. The laser and reference cavity are fabricated in the same Si3N4 CMOS-compatible process, unlocking a path towards fully integrated visible to ShortWave-IR frequency stabilized lasers.

Title: Role of mechanical effects on the excitation spectra of microwave-dressed Rydberg states in a cold atomic cloud
Authors: H. Failache, J.A. Muniz, L. Velazco, D. Talento, A. Lezama
Abstract: We explore the excitation spectra of cold 87Rb atoms to the 55D_3/2 Rydberg state in the presence of microwave (MW) radiation as a function of MW frequency. The spectra reveal several features around the transition-frequencies between adjacent Rydberg states. We argue that some of these features are indicative of variations in the Rydberg excitation probability while others result from the removal of atoms from the cold cloud as a consequence of a MW induced strong dipole-dipole inter-atomic force. Our claim is supported by experimental observations and theoretical modeling.

Title: Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures
Authors: Xiao Chai, Eber Nolasco-Martinez, Xuanwei Liang, Jeremy L. Tanlimco, E. Quinn Simmons, Eric Zhu, Roshan Sajjad, Hector Mas, S. Nicole Halawani, Alec Cao, David M. Weld
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate a novel Floquet-engineered platform for compact, continuously trapped atom interferometry which is intrinsically robust against trap noise and beamsplitter pulse duration. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.

Title: Dynamically-decoupled hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy of optical clock transitions
Authors: T. Zanon-Willette, D. Wilkowski, B. Darquié, N.V. Vitanov
Abstract: Hyper-Ramsey protocols have been successfully implemented on ultra-narrow optical clock transitions to reduce systematic frequency-shifts induced by AC-Stark shift and amplitude pulse variation. However, the compensation remains imperfect against laser probe intensity fluctuation, decoherence and unsuited for external quasi-static or low frequency noise perturbations. Here, we address these limitations by employing dynamical-decoupling methods composed by multiple rotary Hahn-echo pulses toggling probe frequency detunings between opposite signs during interrogating laser pulses. Time-optimized Uhrig sequences of refocusing pulses produce highly contrasted and robust hyper-Ramsey interferences against low-frequency noise distortions caused by environmental factors and imperfections in the probe parameters. Dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks pave the way to universal noise-resilient quantum sensors, unveiling fault-tolerant quantum metrology to track fundamental symmetries and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Title: Microsecond-scale high-survival and number-resolved detection of ytterbium atom arrays
Authors: Alessandro Muzi Falconi, Riccardo Panza, Sara Sbernardori, Riccardo Forti, Ralf Klemt, Omar Abdel Karim, Matteo Marinelli, Francesco Scazza
Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.
