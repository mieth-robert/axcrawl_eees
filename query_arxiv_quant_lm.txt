Title: Advances in non-Hermitian dynamics of quadratic bosonic systems
Authors: Huawei Zhao, Xinlei Liu, Xinyao Huang, Guofeng Zhang
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a rapidly advancing field of research, revealing a range of novel phenomena and potential applications. Traditional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically simulated by constructing asymmetric couplings or by introducing dissipation and gain to realize non-Hermitian systems. The quadratic bosonic system (QBS) with squeezing interaction is intrinsically Hermitian; however, its dynamical evolution matrix in both real and momentum spaces is non-Hermitian. Based on this, applying a field-operator transformation xp to the dynamical evolution matrix yields quadrature nonreciprocal transmission between the x and p operators. This nonreciprocal characteristic can be utilized in signal amplifiers. On the other hand, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework in momentum space, one can observe non-Hermitian topological phenomena such as point-gap topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect, both induced by spectra with nonzero winding numbers. Additionally, QBS can be employed to realize non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm cages and to extend non-Bloch band theory. Previous studies in non-Hermitian physics have largely concentrated on classical systems. The influence of non-Hermitian properties on quantum effects remains a key issue awaiting exploration and has evolved into a research direction at the interface of non-Hermitian and quantum physics.

Title: Towards Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution with Photonic Devices
Authors: Corentin Lanore, Xavier Valcarce, Jean Etesse, Anthony Martin, Jean-Daniel Bancal
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols enable two distant parties to communicate with information-theoretically proven secrecy. However, these protocols are generally vulnerable to potential mismatches between the physical modeling and the implementation of their quantum operations, thereby opening opportunities for side channel attacks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD addresses this problem by reducing the degree of device modeling to a black-box setting. The stronger security obtained in this way comes at the cost of a reduced noise tolerance, rendering experimental demonstrations more challenging: so far, only one experiment based on trapped ions was able to successfully generate a secret key. Photonic platforms have however long been preferred for QKD thanks to their suitability to optical fiber transmission, high repetition rates, readily available hardware, and potential for circuit integration. In this work, we assess the feasibility of DIQKD on a photonic circuit recently identified by machine learning techniques. For this, we introduce an efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound the conditional von Neumann entropy and develop a finite-statistics analysis that takes into account full outcome statistics. Our analysis shows that the proposed optical circuit is sufficiently resistant to noise to make an experimental realization realistic.

Title: Vanishing correlations in (bi)stochastic controlled circuits
Authors: Pavel Kos, Bruno Bertini, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: We study the dynamics of circuits composed of stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates. This type of dynamics arises from quantum circuits with random controlled gates, as well as in stochastic circuits and deterministic classical cellular automata. We prove that stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates lead to two-point spatio-temporal correlation functions that vanish everywhere except when the two operators act on the same site. More generally, for multi-point correlations the two rightmost operators must act on the same site. We argue that autocorrelation, while hard to compute, typically decays exponentially towards a value that is exponentially small in the system size. Our results reveal a broad class of quantum systems that exhibit surprisingly simple correlation structures despite their complex microscopic dynamics.

Title: Vacuum Torque Without Anisotropy: Switchable Casimir Torque Between Altermagnets
Authors: Zixuan Dai, Qing-Dong Jiang
Abstract: Casimir torque is conventionally associated with explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, arising from material dielectric anisotropy, geometric asymmetry, or externally applied fields that themselves break rotational invariance. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism: an axially symmetric magnetic field can generate a Casimir torque by inducing an axially asymmetric Casimir energy - and can even reverse the torque's sign. Focusing on two-dimensional altermagnets, we show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane - while preserving in-plane rotational symmetry - activates an orientation-dependent vacuum interaction through the combined crystalline symmetry $\mathrm{C_n T}$ inherent to altermagnetic order. The resulting torque emerges continuously and scales quadratically with the magnetic field strength. We further analyze its temperature and distance dependence, revealing scaling behaviors that are qualitatively different from those found in uniaxial bulk materials. Our results identify time-reversal symmetry breaking as a powerful route for engineering both the sign and strength of Casimir torque and establish altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring phenomena driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations.

Title: Pauli Propagation for Imaginary Time Evolution
Authors: Rafael Gómez-Lurbe, Armando Pérez
Abstract: We extend the Pauli Propagation framework to simulate imaginary time evolution. By deriving explicit update rules for the propagation of Pauli operators under imaginary time evolution generated by Pauli strings, we introduce an imaginary time Pauli Propagation (ITPP) algorithm for approximating imaginary time dynamics directly in the Pauli basis. This approach enables the computation of thermal and ground-state properties while retaining the key computational advantages of Pauli Propagation. Benchmarking ITPP on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model demonstrates that truncation provides a controlled trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, while also revealing challenges associated with operator growth under imaginary time evolution. Finally, combining imaginary time and real-time Pauli Propagation naturally suggests a pathway toward simulating open quantum system dynamics within a unified framework.

Title: Quantum state exclusion with many copies
Authors: Debanjan Roy, Tathagata Gupta, Pratik Ghosal, Samrat Sen, Somshubhro Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is the task of identifying at least one state from a known set that was not used in the preparation of a quantum system. In particular, a given set of quantum states is said to admit state exclusion if there exists a measurement such that, for each state in the set, some measurement outcome rules it out with certainty. However, state exclusion is not always possible in the single-copy setting. In this paper, we investigate whether access to multiple identical copies enables state exclusion. We prove that for any set of three or more pure states, state exclusion becomes possible with a finite number of copies. We further show that the required number of copies may be arbitrarily large -- in particular, for every natural number $N$, we construct sets of states for which exclusion remains impossible with $N$ or fewer copies.

Title: Quantum Super-resolution by Adaptive Non-local Observables
Authors: Hsin-Yi Lin, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Shinjae Yoo
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) seeks to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) data from low-resolution (LR) observations. Classical deep learning methods have advanced SR substantially, but require increasingly deeper networks, large datasets, and heavy computation to capture fine-grained correlations. In this work, we present the \emph{first study} to investigate quantum circuits for SR. We propose a framework based on Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with \emph{Adaptive Non-Local Observable} (ANO) measurements. Unlike conventional VQCs with fixed Pauli readouts, ANO introduces trainable multi-qubit Hermitian observables, allowing the measurement process to adapt during training. This design leverages the high-dimensional Hilbert space of quantum systems and the representational structure provided by entanglement and superposition. Experiments demonstrate that ANO-VQCs achieve up to five-fold higher resolution with a relatively small model size, suggesting a promising new direction at the intersection of quantum machine learning and super-resolution.

Title: Spin-$s$ $U(1)$-eigenstate preparation
Authors: Nabi Zare Harofteh, Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We formulate a deterministic algorithm for preparing a general $U(1)$-eigenstate of a spin-$s$ chain of length $n$. These states consist of linear combinations of computational basis states $|\vec{m}\rangle$ of $n$ qudits, each with $(2s+1)$ levels and $s= 1/2, 1, 3/2, \ldots$, whose ditstrings $\vec{m}$ have a fixed digit sum. Exploiting a Gray code for bounded integer compositions, whose consecutive ditstrings obey the Gray property, the quantum state is prepared by applying corresponding ``Gray gates.'' We use this algorithm to prepare exact eigenstates of integrable spin-$s$ XXX Hamiltonians.

Title: Active interference suppression in frequency-division-multiplexed quantum gates via off-resonant microwave tones
Authors: Haruki Mitarai, Yukihiro Tadokoro, Hiroya Tanaka
Abstract: An increase in the number of control lines between the quantum processors and the external electronics constitutes a major bottleneck in the realization of large-scale quantum computers. Frequency-division multiplexing is expected to enable multiple qubits to be controlled through a single microwave cable; however, interference from off-resonant microwave tones hinders precise qubit control. Here, we propose an active interference suppression method for frequency-division-multiplexed simultaneous gate operations. We demonstrate that deliberate incorporation of off-resonant microwave tones improves the accuracy of single-qubit gates. Specifically, we find that by incorporating off-resonant orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal microwave tones, the gate infidelity decreases proportionally to the inverse square of the number of microwave tones. Furthermore, we show that fast oscillations neglected under the rotating wave approximation degrade gate fidelity, and that this degradation can be mitigated through optimized frequency allocation. Our approach is simple yet effective for improving the performance of frequency-division-multiplexed quantum gates.

Title: Programming Quantum Measurements of Time inside a Complex Medium
Authors: Dylan Danese, Vatshal Srivastav, Will McCutcheon, Saroch Leedumrongwatthanakun, Mehul Malik
Abstract: The temporal degree-of-freedom of light is incredibly powerful for modern quantum technologies, enabling large-scale quantum computing architectures and record key-rates in quantum key distribution. However, the generalized measurement of large and complex quantum superpositions of the time-of-arrival of a photon remains a unique experimental challenge. Conventional methods based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, requiring multiple cascaded devices and active phase stabilization. In addition, these are limited by construction to a restricted set of phase-only superposition measurements. Here we show how the coupling of spatial and temporal information inside a single multi-mode fiber can be harnessed to program completely generalized measurements for high-dimensional superpositions of photonic time-bin. Using the multi-spectral transmission matrix of the fiber, we find special sets of spatial modes that experience distinct dispersive delays through the fiber. By exciting coherent superpositions of these spatial modes, we engineer the equivalent of large, unbalanced multi-mode interferometers inside the fiber and use them to perform high-quality measurements of arbitrary time-bin superpositions in up to dimension 11. The single fiber functions as a scalable, common-path interferometer for time-bin qudits that significantly eases the experimental overheads of standard approaches based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers, serving as an essential tool for quantum technologies that harness the temporal properties of light.

Title: Quantum Interference Needs Convention: Overlap-Determinability and Unified No-Superposition Principle
Authors: Jeongho Bang, Kyoungho Cho, Ki Hyuk Yee
Abstract: Quantum superposition is often phrased as the ability to add state vectors. In practice, however, the physical quantity is a ray (a rank-one projector), so each input specifies only a projector and leaves a gauge freedom in the phases of its vector representatives. This becomes a real operational barrier when one asks for a device that, given two independently prepared unknown pure states, outputs a coherent state proportional to a prescribed linear combination. We identify the missing ingredient as not probabilistic but phase-like. One needs a physical scenario that fixes a single phase convention on the relevant set of rays, so that the overlaps become well defined complex numbers. Thus, we formalize this through phase conventions and a single notion -- dubbed as "overlap-determinability." Our main theorem gives an exact equivalence: A nonzero completely positive trace-nonincreasing map that probabilistically produces superposition on a domain exists if and only if that domain is overlap-determinable. This unifies modern no-superposition results and characterizes the exceptional yes-go protocols, which succeed precisely when side information supplies the required missing resource. We then show that granting universal access to such convention-fixed overlaps destabilizes the familiar foundational and computational constraints. It enables forbidden transformations akin to quantum cloning and yields super-luminal signaling. It would also permit reflections about unknown states, leading to exponentially fast overlap amplification and a collapse of Grover's search lower bound to a logarithmic query complexity.

Title: Scaling Enhancement in Distributed Quantum Sensing via Causal Order Switching
Authors: Binke Xia, Zhaotong Cui, Jingzheng Huang, Yuxiang Yang, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: Sensing networks underpin applications from fundamental physics to real-world engineering. Recently, distributed quantum sensing (DQS) has been investigated to boost the sensing performance, yet current schemes typically rely on entangled probes that are fragile to noise and difficult to scale. Here, we propose a DQS protocol that incorporates a causal-order switch into a cyclic network, enabling a single probe to sequentially query N independent sensors in a coherent superposition or a probabilistic mixture of opposite causal orders. By exploiting the noncommutativity between propagation and sensing processes, our scheme achieves a 1/N^2-scaling precision limit without involving entangled probes. Importantly, our approach utilizes a classical mixture of causal orders rather than a quantum switch, making it more feasible for practical realization. We experimentally implement this scheme for distributed beam tilts sensing in a free-space quantum optical network comprising up to 9 sensors, achieving picoradian-scale precision in estimating tilt angle. Our results demonstrate a robust and scalable DQS protocol that surpasses the conventional 1/N Heisenberg scaling in precision, advancing the practical deployment of quantum sensing networks.

Title: Adaptive Fidelity Estimation for Quantum Programs with Graph-Guided Noise Awareness
Authors: Tingting Li, Ziming Zhao, Jianwei Yin
Abstract: Fidelity estimation is a critical yet resource-intensive step in testing quantum programs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where the required number of measurements is difficult to predefine due to hardware noise, device heterogeneity, and transpilation-induced circuit transformations. We present QuFid, an adaptive and noise-aware framework that determines measurement budgets online by leveraging circuit structure and runtime statistical feedback. QuFid models a quantum program as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and employs a control-flow-aware random walk to characterize noise propagation along gate dependencies. Backend-specific effects are captured via transpilation-induced structural deformation metrics, which are integrated into the random-walk formulation to induce a noise-propagation operator. Circuit complexity is then quantified through the spectral characteristics of this operator, providing a principled and lightweight basis for adaptive measurement planning. Experiments on 18 quantum benchmarks executed on IBM Quantum backends show that QuFid significantly reduces measurement cost compared to fixed-shot and learning-based baselines, while consistently maintaining acceptable fidelity bias.

Title: On Distributed Quantum Computing with Distributed Fan-Out Operations
Authors: Seng W. Loke
Abstract: We compare different circuits implementing distributed versions of quantum computations, using entangled pairs only, and using distributed fan-out operations (using GHZ states). We highlight the advantages of using distributed fan-out operations in terms of reductions in circuit depth and (possibly) entanglement resources. We note that distributed fan-out operations (or notably, distributed GHZ states) could be a ``primitive'' building block for distributed quantum operations in the same way as entangled pairs are, if distributed GHZ states could be realized efficiently.

Title: Blended Dynamics and Emergence in Open Quantum Networks
Authors: Qinghao Wen, Zihao Ren, Lei Wang, Hyungbo Shim, Guodong Shi
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a blended dynamics framework for open quantum networks with diffusive couplings. The network consists of qubits interconnected through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and consensus-like diffusive interactions. Such networks commonly arise in spontaneous emission processes and non-Hermitian quantum computing, and their evolution follows a Lindblad master equation. Blended dynamics theory is well established in the classical setting as a tool for analyzing emergent behaviors in heterogeneous networks with diffusive couplings. Its key insight is to blend the local dynamics rather than the trajectories of individual nodes. Perturbation analysis then shows that, under sufficiently strong coupling, all node trajectories tend to stay close to those of the blended system over time. We first show that this theory extends naturally to the reduced-state dynamics of quantum networks, revealing classical-like clustering phenomena in which qubits converge to a shared equilibrium or a common trajectory determined by the quantum blended reduced-state dynamics. We then extend the analysis to qubit coherent states using quantum Laplacians and induced graphs, proving orbit attraction of the network density operator toward the quantum blended coherent dynamics, establishing the emergence of intrinsically quantum and dynamically clustering behaviors. Finally, numerical examples validate the theoretical results.

Title: Testing the equivalence to thermal states via extractable work under LOCC
Authors: Toshihiro Yada, Nobuyuki Yoshioka, Takahiro Sagawa
Abstract: Understanding the thermal behavior of quantum many-body pure states is one of the most fundamental issues in quantum thermodynamics. It is widely known that typical pure states yield vanishing work, just as thermal states do, when one restricts to local operations that cannot access correlations among subsystems. However, it remains unclear whether this equivalence to thermal states persists under LOCC (local operations and classical communication), where classically accessible correlations can be exploited for work extraction. In this work, we establish criteria for determining whether many-body pure states remain equivalent to thermal states even under LOCC, and show that this thermal equivalence is governed by their multipartite quantum correlation structure. We show that states with asymptotically maximal multipartite entanglement, such as Haar-random states, cannot yield extensive work under LOCC, whereas some states with limited multipartite entanglement, such as constant-degree graph states, allow extensive work extraction despite being locally indistinguishable from thermal states. Thus, our work provides a refined operational notion of thermal equivalence beyond the traditional local regime, which is becoming increasingly important due to the recent expansion of experimentally accessible operations.

Title: Routing Qubits on Noisy Networks
Authors: Claudia Benedetti, Giovanni Ragazzi, Simone Cavazzoni, Paolo Bordone, Matteo G. A. Paris
Abstract: Robust quantum routing is essential for scalable quantum technologies. This paper investigates the resilience of routing protocols in network architectures designed for perfect, high-fidelity transfer of both classical and quantum information under ideal conditions. We encode information in the position of a quantum walker on a graph, modelling the routing of a generic qubit state from a single input to multiple (orthogonal) outputs. We analyse and assess routing performance in various regimes, evaluating their robustness against static and dynamical noise.

Authors: Kenny Campbell, Ahmed Lawey, Mohsen Razavi
Abstract: We analyse the performance of different error handling methods in the quantum data centre paradigm of distributed quantum computing. We compare the impact of quantum error detection, using the three-qubit repetition code and the [[4, 1, 2]] Leung-Nielsen-Chuang-Yamamoto code, on remote gates with that of conventional entanglement distillation techniques. Detailed classical simulation is used to obtain results for realistic near-term hardware.

Title: Exotic collective behaviors of giant quantum emitters in two-dimensional baths
Authors: Qing-Yang Qiu, Wen Huang, Lei Du, Xin-You Lü
Abstract: Nonlocal light-matter interactions with giant atoms in high-dimensional environments are not only fundamentally intriguing for testing quantum electrodynamics beyond the dipole approximation but also crucial for building high-dimensional quantum networks and engineering multipartite entangled states. Given the enigmatic and largely uncharted collective signatures exhibited by multiple giant atoms within two-dimensional optical baths, we delve into their nonperturbative collective dynamics within the single-excitation subspace, focusing on the case where they are coupled to a common two-dimensional photonic reservoir and employing a resolvent operator approach. We demonstrate that precisely engineered atomic arrangements lead to unconventional quantum dynamics, featuring non-Markovianity-induced beats and long-lived bound states in the continuum, thereby providing a versatile platform for implementing two-dimensional quantum memory. Phenomenologically, we observe the emergence of exotic photon emission patterns in both two- and three-dimensional (3D) baths. The emission directions are shown to be precisely controllable on demand through exact phase engineering of the coupling parameters, enabling a highly efficient chiral light-matter interface. Moreover, our generalization to a 3D bath reveals that coherent dipole-dipole interactions can survive despite the coupling to a continuum of modes, a finding that challenges conventional wisdom regarding decoherence.

Title: Multiparameter estimation for the superresolution of two incoherent sources
Authors: Antonin Grateau, Alexander Boeschoten, Tanguy Favin-Lévêque, Isael Herrera, Nicolas Treps
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous estimation of the three parameters characterizing a pair of incoherent optical sources in the sub-Rayleigh regime, enabling super-resolved scene characterization. Using spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) with two demultiplexers--one deliberately shifted--we determine separations well below the diffraction limit and achieve sensitive joint estimation of separation, centroid, and relative brightness over a broad range of scene configurations in a single experimental setting. We benchmark our performance using Fisher-information-based Cramér-Rao bounds, and discuss the corresponding quantum limits. We investigate two complementary scenarios: a realistic case with slightly non-identical sources, and an idealized case of indistinguishable sources.

Title: Impossible Counterfactuals, Discrete Hilbert Space and Bell's Theorem
Authors: Tim Palmer
Abstract: Negating the Measurement Independence assumption (MI) is often referred to as the `third way' to account for the experimental violation of Bell's inequality. However, this route is generally viewed as ludicrously contrived, implying some implausible conspiracy where experimenters are denied the freedom to choose measurement settings as they like. Here, a locally realistic model of quantum physics is developed (Rational Mechanics - RaQM - based on a gravitational discretisation of Hilbert Space) which violates MI without denying free will. Crucially, RaQM distinguishes experimenters' ability to freely choose measurement settings to some nominal accuracy, from an inability to choose exact settings, which were never under their control anyway. In RaQM, Hilbert states are necessarily undefined in bases where squared amplitudes and/or complex phases are irrational numbers. Such `irrational' bases correspond to conceivable but necessarily impossible counterfactual measurements, and are shown to play a ubiquitous role in the analysis of both single- and entangled-particle quantum physics. It is concluded that violation of Bell inequalities can be understood with none of the strange processes historically associated with it. Instead, using concepts from (non-classical) $p$-adic number theory, we relate RaQM to Bohm and Hiley's concept of a holistic Machian-like Undivided Universe. If this interpretation of Bell's Theorem is correct, building more and more energetic particle accelerators to probe smaller and smaller scales, in the search for a theory which synthesises quantum and gravitational physics and hence a Theory of Everything, may be a fruitless exercise.

Title: Resonant Excitation Induced Vibronic Mollow Triplets
Authors: Devashish Pandey, Corne Koks, Martijn Wubs, Nicolas Stenger, Jake Iles-Smith
Abstract: The Mollow triplet is the definitive spectral signature of an optically dressed quantum emitter. We predict that for emitters coupled to localized phonons, this signature is not confined to the zero-phonon line. Under a strong resonant drive, we show that Mollow triplets are strikingly replicated on the associated phonon sidebands -a surprising result, given that phonon sidebands are typically viewed as incoherent, inelastic scattering pathways. These vibronic Mollow triplets are a direct fingerprint of dynamically generated dressed states that hybridize the emitter's electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. We develop a scalable analytical formalism to model this effect in complex, multi-mode molecular systems, such as dibenzoterrylene. Our work provides the precise driving conditions for observing these novel spectral features, establishing a new signature of coherence in vibronically coupled systems.

Title: Multipartite entanglement in the quantum tetrahedron
Authors: Robert Amelung, Hanno Sahlmann
Abstract: The space $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ of SU(2)-invariant four-valent tensors, also known as intertwiners, can be understood as the quantum states of a tetrahedron in Euclidean space with fixed areas. In loop quantum gravity, they are states of the smallest "atom of space" with non-zero volume. At the same time they correspond to four-party tensor product states invariant under global rotations. We consider the multipartite entanglement of states in $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ using the recently proposed entropic fill. Numerically evaluating entropic fill in the case of equal spins between $1/2$ and $11$, we find that the distributions of entanglement are very different for intertwiners as compared to generic tensors, and for coherent intertwiners as compared to generic ones. The peak in the distribution seems to be at the highest entanglement for generic intertwiners and at the lowest for generic tensors, but in terms of average entanglement, the roles are switched: average entanglement is highest in arbitrary tensors and lower in intertwiners, at least in the regime of large $j$. We also find that entanglement depends on the geometric data of coherent intertwiners in a complicated way.

Title: Low-frequency fiber-optic vibration sensing with a Floquet-engineered optical lattice clock
Authors: Mojuan Yin, Ruohui Wang, Rui Zhou, Xueguang Qiao, Shougang Zhang
Abstract: We propose a Floquet-engineered optical lattice clock based demodulation scheme to enhance the low-frequency performance of wound fiber-optic vibration sensors. Vibration-induced phase variations in the sensing fiber are demodulated by the Floquet-engineered Rabi spectra of the clock transition. The lattice depth with the fiber length and the Floquet-engineered Rabi spectra under the vibration from 200 Hz down to 0.5 Hz are simulated. With a fiber length of 4 km and transmission loss of 2 dB/km, a phase change sensitivity higher than 6 * 10^3 rad per g is achieved at both vibration frequencies of 200 Hz and 0.5 Hz.

Title: Cavity-QED tools for MBQC with optical binomial-codes
Authors: G. P. Teja, Radim Filip
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) offers a promising paradigm for photonic quantum computing, but its implementation requires the generation of specific non-Gaussian resource states. While continuous-variable encodings such as the highly complex (GKP) states have been widely studied, the much simpler binomial codes offer an experimentally accessible alternative, though they demand a distinct set of operational tools. Here, we present a toolkit for MBQC using optical binomial codes, detailing a cavity-QED protocol for conditional generation of cluster states and the implementation of Pauli measurements. Our work proposes the first steps for existing optical atom-cavity architectures to lay the groundwork for their use in quantum computation.

Title: Two-Qubit Spin-Boson Model in the Strong Coupling Regime: Coherence, Non-Markovianity, and Quantum Thermodynamics
Authors: Hasan Mehdi Rizvi, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-qubit open quantum system, in particular the two-qubit spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime, coupled to two thermal bosonic baths under non-Markovian and non-equilibrium conditions. Two complementary approaches, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and Reaction Coordinate Mapping (RCM), are employed to examine various coupling regimes between the qubits and their respective baths. The dynamical features of the model and the impact of the tunneling amplitude on quantum coherence of the system are probed using the $l_1$-norm of coherence. The model is further shown to have non-Markovian evolution. The nontrivial task of calculating entropy production in the strong-coupling regime is performed using auxiliary density operators in HEOM. Motivated by the realization of a quantum thermal device in the strong-coupling regime, the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of the system is investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the heat and spin currents and the tunneling amplitude is probed.

Title: Explaining the advantage of quantum-enhanced physics-informed neural networks
Authors: Nils Klement, Veronika Eyring, Mierk Schwabe
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the backbone of simulations of many natural phenom- ena, for example in climate modeling, material science, and even financial markets. The application of physics-informed neural networks to accelerate the solution of PDEs is promising, but not compet- itive with numerical solvers yet. Here, we show how quantum computing can improve the ability of physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations. For this, we develop hybrid networks consisting of quantum circuits combined with classical layers and systematically test them on various non linear PDEs and boundary conditions in comparison with purely classical networks. We demonstrate that the advantage of using quantum networks lies in their ability to achieve an accurate approximation of the solution in substantially fewer training epochs, particularly for more complex problems. These findings provide the basis for targeted developments of hybrid quantum neural networks with the goal to significantly accelerate numerical modeling.

Title: Bose condensation and Bogoliubov excitation in resonator-embedded superconducting qubit network

Abstract: Superconducting qubit networks (SQNs) embedded in a low-dissipative resonator is a promising device allowing one not only to establish the collective quantum dynamics on a macroscopic scale but also to greatly enhance the sensitivity of detectors of microwave photons. A quantum ac Stark effect provided by coupling between an SQN and microwave photons of a resonator, leads to a strong nonlinear interaction between photons. Here, we present a two-tone spectroscopy experiment in which a set of 10 superconducting flux qubits is coupled to the input R- resonator and the output T- transmission line. An external microwave pump field close to the resonance frequency populates macroscopically the resonator mode as a Bose-Einstein condensate, while a second probe beam scans the resonances referred also as Bogoliubov-like excitations. The corresponding excitation frequency measured from the transmission coefficient, |S21(f)| displays an abrupt change of the resonant dip position once the power of the pump field overcomes a critical value Pcr. This sharp shift occurs in a narrow region of pump frequencies, and can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. It is a signature of bistability of the photon number inside the resonator, in agreement with theory.

Title: Entanglement summoning from entanglement sharing
Authors: Lana Bozanic, Alex May, Stanley Miao
Abstract: In an entanglement summoning task, a set of distributed, co-operating parties attempt to fulfill requests to prepare entanglement between distant locations. The parties share limited communication resources: timing constraints may require the entangled state be prepared before some pairs of distant parties can communicate, and a restricted set of links in a quantum network may further constrain communication. Building on earlier work, we continue the characterization of entanglement summoning. We give an if and only if condition on entanglement summoning tasks with only bidirected causal connections, and provide a set of sufficient conditions addressing the most general case containing both oriented and bidirected causal connections. Our results rely on the recent development of entanglement sharing schemes.

Title: A nearly linear-time Decoded Quantum Interferometry algorithm for the Optimal Polynomial Intersection problem
Authors: Ansis Rosmanis
Abstract: Recently, Jordan et al. (Nature, 2025) introduced a novel quantum-algorithmic technique called Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) for solving specific combinatorial optimization problems associated with classical codes. They presented a constraint-satisfaction problem called Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) and showed that, for this problem, a DQI algorithm running in polynomial time can satisfy a larger fraction of constraints than any known polynomial-time classical algorithm. In this work, we propose several improvements to the DQI algorithm, including sidestepping the quadratic-time Dicke state preparation. Given random access to the input, we show how these improvements result in a nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for the OPI problem. Concurrently and independently with this work, Khattar et al. (arXiv:2510:10967) also construct a nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for OPI using slightly different techniques.

Title: Purcell enhanced electroluminescence of a unipolar light emitting quantum device at 10 micron
Authors: Marta Mastrangelo, Djamal Gacemi, Axel Evirgen, Salvatore Pes, Alexandre Larrue, Pascal Filloux, Isabelle Sagnes, Abdelmounaim Harouri, Angela Vasanelli, Carlo Sirtori
Abstract: Efficient generation of radiation in the mid- and far- infrared relies primarily on lasers and coherent nonlinear optical phenomena driven by lasers. This wavelength range lacks of luminescent devices because the spontaneous emission rate becomes much longer than the nonradiative energy relaxation processes and therefore emitters have to count on stimulated emission produced by linear or non-linear optical gain. However, spontaneous emission is not a fundamental property of the emitter. By engineering metamaterials composed of arrays of nano-emitters into microcavities coupled to patch antennas, we have demonstrated mid-infrared electroluminescent devices emitting a collimated beam with excellent spatial properties and a factor 100 increase in the collected power, compared to standard devices. Our results illustrate that by reshaping the photonic environment around emitting dipoles, as in the Purcell effect, it is possible to enhance the spontaneous emission and conceive efficient optoelectronic light emitting devices that operate close to the thermodynamical equilibrium as LEDs in the visible range.

Title: Precision Enhancement in Transient Quantum Thermometry:Cold-Probe Bias and Its Removal
Authors: Debarupa Saha, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: We unveil a temperature bias of the probe in transient quantum thermometry under Markovian dynamics. Specifically, for qubit thermometers evolving under Markovian dynamics, we show that enhanced precision beyond the steady state limit can be achieved if and only if the probe is initially colder than the thermal state corresponding to the bath temperature to be estimated. In contrast, this temperature bias can be lifted when the probe dynamics is non-Markovian. In the non-Markovian regime, both hot and cold probes can simultaneously attain the same transient maximum precision, well above the steady-state value.

Abstract: We present QDK/Chemistry, a software toolkit for quantum chemistry workflows targeting quantum computers. The toolkit addresses a key challenge in the field: while quantum algorithms for chemistry have matured considerably, the infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution remains fragmented. QDK/Chemistry provides this infrastructure through a modular architecture that separates data representations from computational methods, enabling researchers to compose workflows from interchangeable components. In addition to providing native implementations of targeted algorithms in the quantum-classical pipeline, the toolkit builds upon and integrates with widely used open-source quantum chemistry packages and quantum computing frameworks through a plugin system, allowing users to combine methods from different sources without modifying workflow logic. This paper describes the design philosophy, current capabilities, and role of QDK/Chemistry as a foundation for reproducible quantum chemistry experiments.

Title: Superluminal Transformations and Indeterminism
Authors: Amrapali Sen, Flavio Del Santo
Abstract: Quantum theory is widely regarded as fundamentally indeterministic, yet classical frameworks can also exhibit indeterminism once infinite information is abandoned. At the same time, relativity is usually taken to forbid superluminal signalling, yet Lorentz symmetry formally admits superluminal transformations (SpTs). Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quantum one. Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers. Thus, any apparent indeterminism arising from superluminal transformations reflects only probabilities arising from subjective ignorance, unlike the objective nature of probabilities in quantum theory, indicating that the claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not quantum.

Title: Quantum Interactive Oracle Proofs
Authors: Baocheng Sun, Thomas Vidick
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum Interactive Oracle Proofs (qIOPs), a generalization of both quantum Probabilistically Checkable Proofs and quantum Interactive Proofs, as well as a quantum analogue of classical Interactive Oracle Proofs. In the model of quantum Interactive Oracle Proofs, we allow multiple rounds of quantum interaction between the quantum prover and the quantum verifier, but the verifier has limited access to quantum resources. This includes both queries to the prover's messages and the complexity of the quantum circuits applied by the verifier. The question of whether QMA admits a quantum interactive oracle proof system is a relaxation of the quantum PCP Conjecture. We show the following two main constructions of qIOPs, both of which are unconditional: - We construct a qIOP for QMA in which the verifier shares polynomially many EPR pairs with the prover at the start of the protocol and reads only a constant number of qubits from the prover's messages. - We provide a stronger construction of qIOP for QMA in which the verifier not only reads a constant number of qubits but also operates on a constant number of qubits overall, including those in their private registers. However, in this stronger setting, the communication complexity becomes exponential. This leaves open the question of whether strong qIOPs for QMA, with polynomial communication complexity, exist. As a key component of our construction, we introduce a novel single prover many-qubits test, which may be of independent interest.

Title: Meeting the Needs of the Global Quantum Science Community: A Call to Action
Authors: Tzula B. Propp, Brandy Todd, Sara A. Metwalli, Alina Helena S. Gallardo, Michael Dascal, Denise Ruffner, Klaus D. Jöns, Shaeema Zaman, Judith Kreukels, Marilù Chiofalo, Lydia Sanmartí-Vila
Abstract: 2025 marks one hundred years since the discovery of quantum mechanics. In the century since then, quantum science has blossomed into a global community composed of academics, engineers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The world is currently in the middle of the so-called second quantum revolution, with increased public awareness of quantum science and technology, and growing investment in both quantum hardware and software applications. However, representation remains low among historically marginalized groups: women, LGBTQ+, BIPOC, and people from the global south make up disproportionately few physicists. There are numerous efforts to improve diversity within quantum science, including through workforce development. But many of the changes enacted at the highest levels have failed to result in real change, as highlighted and discussed in the recent Women For Quantum Manifesto of Values. Here, we seek to echo and amplify the need for real change in the quantum ecosystem, emphasizing intersectionality and a feminist approach that centers the most vulnerable members of the quantum community: young students and researchers, especially those communities historically marginalized from quantum science. This report is our attempt to help quantum communities meet this need; we have conducted a survey of quantum scientists all over the world, and here we include both a preliminary report of our findings and policy suggestions we have built to address them. The primary results of our survey are that, 1) marginalized quantum scientists are experiencing hardships and challenges more than their more privileged peers across all metrics, 2) that this fact is hurting retention of diverse, talented quantum scientists in our field, and 3) quantum EDI is an investment in talent retention and resilience building, which are essential for a thriving, globally competitive quantum ecosystem.

Title: The burden of Fundamentality: Metaphysical ambiguities and the issue of Superdeterminism
Authors: Gabriele Cafiero, Luca Molinari, Jonte R. Hance
Abstract: In this paper we approach the problem of superdeterminism from a novel point of view, highlighting its character as a more metaphysical than scientific proposition. First, we introduce a distinction between two types of superdeterministic theories, naïve (NSD) and metaphysical (MSD), and argue how NSD presents significant epistemic flaws. We show how NSD justifies itself through claims to fundamentality, thus connoting itself as a metaphysical theory rather than a scientific one. We finally illustrate that the most developed MSD model so far, Invariant Set Theory, implicitly proposes a confused form of priority monism. Our paper thus reinforces the thesis that theories should demonstrate rather than assume fundamentality and that it is methodologically flawed for a theory to assume its own fundamentality for the sole purpose of defending against criticisms.

Title: High-Resolution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance
Authors: Colin J. Stephen, Anton Tcholakov, Maik Icker, Stuart M. Graham, Xiaoming Zhao, Robert Day, Jeanette Chattaway, T. John S. Dennis, Wolfgang Harneit, Gavin W. Morley
Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a valuable tool for physics, chemistry, biology and medicine, providing complementary spectroscopic information to NMR. It has long been known that EPR at high magnetic fields offers greater spectral resolution, but limitations in the THz instrumentation have prevented the full realization of these opportunities. Here we describe an EPR spectrometer at the high magnetic field of 14 T using 396 GHz excitation, which adapts techniques from liquid-state NMR to obtain sharp EPR resonances with a width of 210 ppb (full-width half-maximum). We use this to measure resonance positions, and hence g-factors, with a precision that reaches $\pm$16 ppb. Our use of in-situ liquid-state NMR of our solvent within the same sample improves the accuracy of these measurements: it allows us to reference our EPR measurement back to dilute gas 3He NMR for which quantum calculations are accurate. We measure the g-factor of N@C60 in deuterated toluene as g = 2.002 099 09 (3), where the 3 in brackets means that the uncertainty on the last digit is $\pm$3.

Title: Entanglement scaling and dynamics in the Sauter-Schwinger effect
Authors: S. Mahesh Chandran, Karthik Rajeev
Abstract: In quantum field theory, entanglement entropy under spatial bipartitioning serves as a powerful information-theoretic probe of quantum correlations. In this work, we present the first comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical evolution and geometric scaling of entanglement entropy in a nonperturbative, strong-field QED setting -- specifically, in the context of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena.

Title: Differentiable quantum-trajectory simulation of Lindblad dynamics for QGP transport-coefficient inference
Authors: Lukas Heinrich, Tom Magorsch
Abstract: We study parameter estimation for the transport coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma by differentiating open-quantum-system-based Monte Carlo simulations of quarkonium suppression. The underlying simulator requires solving a Lindblad equation in a large Hilbert space, which makes parameter estimation computationally expensive. We approach the problem using gradient-based optimization. Specifically, we apply the score-function gradient estimator to differentiate through discrete jump sampling in the Monte Carlo wave-function algorithm used to solve the Lindblad equation. The resulting stochastic gradient estimator exhibits sufficiently low variance and can still be estimated in an embarrassingly parallel manner, enabling efficient scaling of the simulations. We implement this gradient estimator in the existing open-source quarkonium suppression code QTraj. To demonstrate its utility for parameter estimation, we infer the two transport coefficients $\hat{\kappa}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ using gradient-based optimization on synthetic nuclear modification factor data.

Title: A Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Criterion for Metallic Superconductivity
Authors: Jaehwahn Kim, Davis A. Rens, Waqas Khalid, Hyunchul Kim
Abstract: A central unresolved question in the theory of superconductivity is why only a small subset of metallic elements exhibit a superconducting state, whereas many others remain strictly normal. Neither the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) framework nor its extensions involving charge density wave (CDW) or pair density wave (PDW) order provide a predictive or material-selective criterion capable of distinguishing superconducting metals from non-superconducting ones. In particular, the persistent absence of superconductivity in simple noble metals with well-defined Fermi surfaces poses a challenge for all traditional approaches. Here we address this problem using the Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Ginzburg Landau (GL) framework introduced in our previous work. In this formulation, a coarse-grained MEL charge field $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}(\mathbf{r})$ with momentum dependent stiffness $\alpha(q)$ is coupled to the superconducting (SC) order parameter $\psi(\mathbf{r})$. We show that metallic superconductivity emerges only when the system satisfies a specific ``MEL enhancement window,'' characterized by a negative minimum of $\alpha(q)$ at either a finite modulation wave vector $q^{\ast}$ or at $q=0$, together with sufficiently strong coupling between $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}$ and $\psi$. This unified criterion naturally partitions metallic elements into three universal classes: (i) MEL-enhanced superconductors with a finite-$q^{\ast}$ charge mode, (ii) conventional BCS superconductors as the homogeneous $q^{\ast}=0$ limit of the MEL framework, and (iii) metals for which $\alpha(q)$ remains positive for all $q$, suppressing all MEL modes and preventing any superconducting instability. By applying this criterion to simple metallic elements, we identify why some metals develop superconductivity while others do not, possibly resolving a selection problem long open within the BCS paradigm.

Title: Self-Aligned Heterogeneous Quantum Photonic Integration
Authors: Kinfung Ngan, Yeeun Choi, Chun-Chieh Chang, Dongyeon Daniel Kang, Shuo Sun
Abstract: Integrated quantum photonics holds significant promise for scalable photonic quantum information processing, quantum repeaters, and quantum networks, but its development is hindered by the mismatch between materials hosting high-quality quantum emitters and those compatible with mature photonic technologies. Heterogeneous integration offers a potential solution to this challenge, yet practical implementations have been limited by inevitable insertion losses at material interfaces. Here, we present a self-aligned heterogeneous quantum photonic integration approach that can deterministically achieve near-unity coupling efficiency at the interface. To showcase our approach, we demonstrate Purcell enhancement of a silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond induced by a heterogeneous photonic crystal cavity defined by titanium dioxide (TiO2), as well as optical spin control and readout via a TiO2 photonic circuit. We further show that, when combined with inverse photonic design, our approach enables efficient and broadband collection of single photons from a color center into a heterogeneous waveguide. Our approach is not restricted to SiV centers or TiO2; it can be broadly applied to integrate diverse solid-state quantum emitters with thin-film photonic devices where conformal deposition is possible. Together, these results establish a practical route to scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits that combine high-quality quantum emitters with technologically mature photonic platforms.

Title: Kerr-enhanced amplification of three-wave mixing and emergent masing regimes
Authors: Ragheed Alhyder, Rishabh Sahu, Johannes M. Fink, Mikhail Lemeshko, Georgios M. Koutentakis
Abstract: Integrated optical microresonators exploiting either second-order ($\chi^{(2)}$) or third-order ($\chi^{(3)}$) nonlinearities have become key platforms for frequency conversion, low-noise microwave photonics, and quantum entanglement generation. Here, we present an analytic theory of Kerr-enhanced three-wave mixing amplification in an electro-optic microresonator with both $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate that Kerr dressing hybridizes the optical sidebands, renormalizing the $\chi^{(2)}$ couplings and detunings. As a result the system exhibits gain in regions where analogous bare $\chi^{(2)}$ or $\chi^{(3)}$ amplifiers are subthreshold. Time-domain Langevin simulations confirm this threshold reduction, mapping a practical design window for experiments.

Title: Anomalous Localization and Mobility Edges in Non-Hermitian Quasicrystals with Disordered Imaginary Gauge Fields
Authors: Guolin Nan, Zhijian Li, Feng Mei, Zhihao Xu
Abstract: We study anomalous localization in a one-dimensional non-Hermitian quasicrystal with a spatially disordered imaginary gauge field. The system is a generalized Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) chain with asymmetric nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings generated by a Bernoulli imaginary gauge field and a quasiperiodic onsite potential. In the standard non-Hermitian AAH limit, the system undergoes a transition from a fully erratic non-Hermitian skin effect (ENHSE) phase to a fully localized phase. We show that the fractal dimension cannot distinguish these phases, whereas the Lyapunov exponent and center-of-mass fluctuations provide sharp diagnostics. This transition is accompanied by a complex-to-real spectral change under periodic boundary conditions and a topological change of the spectral winding number. With next-nearest-neighbor hopping, we uncover an anomalous mobility edge separating Anderson-localized states from ENHSE states, rather than extended states. This mobility edge is captured by an energy-dependent winding number that vanishes in the localized regime. Finally, we propose a dynamical probe based on wave-packet expansion: for typical disorder realizations, the dynamics shows winding-controlled drift and disorder-selected pinning or boundary-wrapping recurrence, while disorder averaging restores Hermitian-like transport. These results offer practical spectral, topological, and dynamical diagnostics of anomalous localization and mobility edges in non-Hermitian quasicrystals.

Title: Stimulated cooling in non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate

Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of stimulated cooling in the non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of weakly interacting exciton-polaritons from approximately room temperature down to 20K. By resolving the condensate in energy-momentum space and performing interferometric measurements, we distinguish the condensate from thermalized particles yet occupying excited states macroscopically. In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 065301 (2022)], we observe segmentation of the particle density along the excited states into two fractions both following Bose-Einstein distribution, albeit with different effective temperatures and chemical potentials. Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states.

Title: Trimer Dynamics in Floquet-driven arrays of Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Edoardo Tiburzi, Lorenzo Maffi, Luca Dell'Anna, Marco Di Liberto
Abstract: We analyze the WAHUHA Floquet protocol recently applied to arrays of Rydberg atoms and derive beyond-leading-order corrections in the high-frequency expansion of the effective spin theory. We find that an appropriate choice of the pulses times can enforce an approximate symmetry corresponding to the conservation of the total magnetization. The interaction channels emerging from higher-order Floquet terms affect three-body bound states (\emph{trimers}), which gain a significant mobility. We estimate the corresponding enhancement in 1D spin chains and conclude that their dynamics is within experimental reach. Detrimental effects due to the proliferation of particles outside of the trimer magnetization sector are found to occur and spread on time-scales slower than the trimer propagation. Moreover, these can be suppressed in higher dimensional lattices, e.g. in 2D triangular lattices, as the lattice geometry brings these processes off resonance. Our results establish a concrete route to realizing mobile multiparticle bound states in Floquet-engineered Rydberg platforms.

Title: Finite de Finetti for convex bodies and Polynomial Optimization
Authors: Julius A. Zeiss, Gereon Koßmann, René Schwonnek, Martin Plávala
Abstract: Leveraging a recently proposed notion of relative entropy in general probabilistic theories (GPT), we prove a finite de Finetti representation theorem for general convex bodies. We apply this result to address a fundamental question in polynomial optimization: the existence of a convergent outer hierarchy for problems with inequality constraints and analytical convergence guarantees. Our strategy generalizes a quantitative monogamy-of-entanglement argument from quantum theory to arbitrary convex bodies, establishing a uniform upper bound on mutual information in multipartite extensions. This leads to a finite de Finetti theorem and, subsequently, a convergent conic hierarchy for a wide class of polynomial optimization problems subject to both equality and inequality constraints. We further provide a constructive rounding scheme that yields certified interior points with controlled approximation error. As an application, we express the optimal GPT value of a two-player non-local game as a polynomial optimization problem, allowing our techniques to produce approximation schemes with finite convergence guarantees.

Title: A no free lunch theorem for untrained quantum circuits in machine learning
Authors: Steven Herbert
Abstract: This paper proves that if an untrained quantum circuit is used as a resource in a machine learning workflow, then on average no quantum circuit is better than any other that can achieve the same set of computational effects. This is the titular no free lunch theorem. The paper also proves a supporting theorem that even if the idealisations of the no free lunch theorem are omitted, the average quantum advantage remains negligible at best. These results cast serious doubt on several proposals to use untrained quantum circuits in machine learning workflows: at best such claims should be substantiated empirically, as this paper proves there is no a priori theoretical reason to suppose that introducing an untrained quantum circuit will increase performance.

Authors: Karl Svozil
Abstract: The transition from unitary, reversible von Neumann-Everett quantum processes to non-unitary, irreversible processes and measurements is explored through infinite tensor products interpreted as nested, chained, or iterated Wigner's friend scenarios. Infinite tensor products can disrupt unitary equivalence through sectorization and factorization, drawing parallels to concepts from real analysis, recursive mathematics, and statistical physics.

Title: Validating Quantum State Preparation Programs (Extended Version)
Authors: Liyi Li, Anshu Sharma, Zoukarneini Difaizi Tagba, Sean Frett, Alex Potanin
Abstract: One of the key steps in quantum algorithms is to prepare an initial quantum superposition state with different kinds of features. These so-called state preparation algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to develop correctly and effectively. This paper presents Pqasm: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant, allowing us to certify our Pqasm tool to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors. The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition. The reduction allows the development of an effective testing framework for testing quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer - considered to be a hard problem with no clear solution until this point. We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to test state preparation programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using Pqasm; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.

Title: Group Order is in QCMA
Authors: François Le Gall, Harumichi Nishimura, Dhara Thakkar
Abstract: In this work, we show that verifying the order of a finite group given as a black-box is in the complexity class QCMA. This solves an open problem asked by Watrous in 2000 in his seminal paper on quantum proofs and directly implies that the Group Non-Membership problem is also in the class QCMA, which further proves a conjecture proposed by Aaronson and Kuperberg in 2006. Our techniques also give improved quantum upper bounds on the complexity of many other group-theoretical problems, such as group isomorphism in black-box groups.

Title: Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
Authors: Manali Malakar, Alessandro Silva
Abstract: We investigate quantum work statistics within the standard two-point measurement (TPM) scheme in continuously monitored quantum systems, including the effects of generalized unitary evolution, possibly controlled by quantum circuit models, and multiple generalized measurements as well as post-selection of no-click trajectories. We derive an explicit expression for the work generating function that naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, we find signatures of the measurement-induced transition observed in the no-click limit in the moments of the work distribution.

Title: A Unified Approach to Quantum Contraction and Correlation Coefficients
Authors: Ian George, Marco Tomamichel
Abstract: In classical information theory, the maximal correlation and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficient establish limits on distributed and sequential processing. Two distinct quantum maximal correlation coefficients have been proposed, but they do not extend all the classical results. Building on work of Petz, we use the family of non-commutative $L^{2}(p)$ spaces that extend the data processing inequality for variance to quantum theory to extend the classical results to quantum theory. We introduce families of quantum maximal correlation coefficients and identify quantum $\chi^{2}$-divergences as non-commutative generalizations of the variance of the likelihood ratio. We establish a family of maximal correlation coefficients that must all be ordered on a single copy level for an arbitrary number of copies of one state to be able to be converted to a single copy of another target state under local operations. We prove the equivalent characterizations of perfect classical correlation extraction via local operations in quantum theory. We clarify the relationship between maximal correlation and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients by proving they are the same operator norms evaluated on distinct maps. Then we establish new equivalent conditions to the saturation of the data processing inequality for $\chi^{2}$-divergences. This implies previous saturation results for the $\chi^{2}$ and sandwiched Rényi divergences. Finally, we establish the quantum maximal correlation coefficients and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients are often efficiently computable. This results in a generic method for efficiently computing mixing times of time-homogeneous quantum Markov chains with a unique full rank fixed point.

Title: Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra
Authors: Naruo Ohga, Takuya Hatomura
Abstract: Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems, and it effectively incorporates nonlocal information. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable and, in principle, it can replace any previous use of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.

Title: Numerical Optimization Strategies for the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz in Noisy Quantum Environments
Authors: S. Illésová, V. Novák, T. Bezděk, C. Possel, M. Beseda
Abstract: The prevalence of variational methods in near-term quantum computing makes optimizer choice critical, yet selection is frequently intuition-based. We therefore present a systematic benchmark of eight classical optimization algorithms for variational quantum chemistry using the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. Performance is evaluated on H$_2$, H$_4$, and LiH in both full and active-space representations under noiseless and finite-shot sampling noise. Sampling noise substantially reshapes cost landscapes, induces wandering near minima, and flips optimizer rankings: gradient-based methods perform best in noiseless simulations, whereas population-based optimizers, particularly CMA-ES, show greater robustness under finite-shot noise. Optimizer performance is strongly problem dependent: Hartree-Fock initialization aids small systems, but its advantage diminishes with system size. Also, we observe that finite shot sampling frequently violates the lower bound given by the variational principle, a principle that cannot be strictly held in the presence of noise. By exploiting the guaranteed convergence of Evolution Strategies to a steady state distribution defined by the noise floor, we utilize the symmetry of these violations to achieve energy estimation precision beyond the intrinsic sampling limit.

Title: QMetro++ -- Python optimization package for large scale quantum metrology with customized strategy structures
Authors: Piotr Dulian, Stanisław Kurdziałek, Rafał Demkowicz-Dobrzański
Abstract: QMetro++ is a Python package that provides a set of tools for identifying optimal estimation protocols that maximize quantum Fisher information (QFI). Optimization can be performed for arbitrary configurations of input states, parameter-encoding channels, noise correlations, control operations, and measurements. The use of tensor networks and an iterative see-saw algorithm allows for an efficient optimization even in the regime of a large number of channel uses ($N\approx100$). Additionally, the package includes implementations of the recently developed methods for computing fundamental upper bounds on QFI, which serve as benchmarks for assessing the optimality of numerical optimization results. All functionalities are wrapped up in a user-friendly interface which enables the definition of strategies at various levels of detail.

Title: Quantum trajectories and reduced dynamics in time-correlated environments
Authors: Pietro De Checchi, Federico Gallina, Barbara Fresch, Giulio G. Giusteri
Abstract: The stochastic Schrödinger equation (SSE) provides a trajectory-level route to simulate the dynamics of open quantum systems with applications ranging from molecular processes to quantum technologies. We study a colored-noise extension of the SSE based on an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise drive, and benchmark its ensemble-averaged dynamics against the standard white-noise SSE and against a fluctuating OU random Hamiltonian. When the environment exhibits a finite correlation time, averaging over pure-state trajectories yields master equations that are generally open-form and not of Lindblad type, yet remain positive by construction. By considering the differential of the OU process, we define an effective correlated noise, whose properties we analyze and use to formulate an SSE unraveling of its associated open-form quantum master equation. We show that the averaged dissipator separates into a Lindblad contribution stemming from the white-noise component, and additional correlation terms arising from the fluctuations of the OU Hamiltonian. To obtain a practical closed description and physical intuition, we introduce a Redfield-inspired perturbative closure for these correlation terms, providing an effective master equation for the colored SSE. For a two-level system, the resulting dynamics exhibit long-lived coherences, nontrivial stationary (including oscillatory) states, and multi-timescale relaxation, rationalized through the components of a time-dependent Redfield tensor.

Title: Today's Experiments Suffice to Indirectly Verify the Quantum Essence of Gravity
Authors: Martin Plávala
Abstract: The gravity-mediated entanglement experiments employ concepts from quantum information to argue that if entanglement due to gravitational interaction is observed, then gravity cannot be described by a classical system. However, the proposed experiments remain beyond out current technological capability, with optimistic projections placing the experiment outside of short-term future. Here we argue that current matter-wave interferometers are sufficient to indirectly prove that gravitational interaction creates entanglement between two systems. Specifically, we prove that if we experimentally verify the Schrödinger equation for a single delocalized system interacting gravitationally with an external mass, then, under one of two reasonable assumptions, the time evolution of two delocalized systems will lead to gravity-mediated entanglement.

Title: Wireless Josephson parametric amplifier above 20 GHz
Authors: Z. Hao, J. Cochran, Y.-C. Chang, H. M. Cole, S. Shankar
Abstract: Operating superconducting qubits at elevated temperatures offers increased cooling power and thus system scalability, but requires suppression of thermal photons to preserve coherence and readout fidelity. This motivates migration to higher operation frequencies, which demands high-frequency amplification with near-quantum-limited noise characteristics for qubit readout. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a wireless Josephson parametric amplifier (WJPA) operating above 20~GHz. The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.

Title: Analytical phase boundary of a quantum driven-dissipative Kerr oscillator from classical stochastic instantons
Authors: Théo Sépulcre
Abstract: The framework of Keldysh path integral concisely describes quantum systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such as the two-photon driven Kerr oscillator. Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.

Title: Generation of Quantum Entanglement in Autonomous Thermal Machines: Effects of Non-Markovianity, Hilbert Space Structure, and Quantum Coherence
Authors: Achraf Khoudiri, Khadija El Anouz, Abderrahim El Allati
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of entanglement generation in an external quantum system via interaction with a quantum autonomous thermal machine (QATM) under non-Markovian dynamics. The QATM, composed of two qubits each coupled to independent thermal reservoirs, interacts with an external system of two additional qubits. By analyzing the Hilbert space structure, energy level configurations, and temperature gradients, we define a common interaction between the QATM qubits and the external system qubits, which allows the definition of two thermodynamic cycles (A and B) governed by virtual temperatures and energy-conserving transitions. We demonstrate that the QATM can act as a structured reservoir capable of inducing non-Markovian memory effects, as highlighted by negative entropy production rates. Using mutual information and concurrence, we show that entanglement is generated only under cycle A, which is associated with stronger non-Markovian behavior and higher coherence correlations. Our results demonstrate that temperature differences, Hilbert space structure, and coherence serve as quantum resources for controlling and enhancing entanglement in quantum thermodynamic settings, with parameters consistent with experimental superconducting qubit platforms.

Title: Pretty Good Bounds on the worst-case Pretty Good Measurement
Authors: Sergio Escobar, Austin Pechan
Abstract: We derive a new lower bound on the success probability of the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM) for worst-case quantum state discrimination among $m$ quantum states. Our bound is strictly tighter than the previously known Gram-matrix-based bound for $m\geq 4$. The proof adapts techniques from Barnum and Knill's analysis of the average-case PGM, applied here to the worst-case scenario. By comparing the PGM to the sequential measurement algorithm, we obtain a guarantee showing that, in the low-fidelity regime, the PGM's success probability decreases quadratically with respect to the maximum pairwise overlap, rather than linearly as in earlier bounds.

Abstract: In recent years, the presence of local potentials has significantly enriched and diversified the entanglement patterns in monitored free fermion systems. In our approach, we employ the stochastic Schrödinger equation to simulate a one-dimensional spinless fermion system under continuous measurement and local potentials. By averaging the steady-state entanglement entropy over many quantum trajectories, we investigate its dependence on measurement and localization parameters. We used a phenomenological model to interpret the numerical results, and the results show that the introduction of local potentials does not destroy the universality class of the entanglement phase transition, and that the phase boundary is jointly characterized by the measurement process and the localization mechanism. This work offers a new perspective on the characterization of the entanglement phase boundary arising from the combined effects of measurement and localization, and provides criteria for detecting this novel phase transition in cold atom systems, trapped ions, and quantum dot arrays.

Title: Optimal phase change for a generalized Grover's algorithm
Authors: Christopher Cardullo, Min Kang
Abstract: We study the generalized Grover's algorithm with an arbitrary amplitude vector to find the optimal phase change for maximizing the gain in probability for the target of each iteration. In the classic setting of Grover's algorithm with a real initial amplitude vector, we find that a phase change of $\pi$ stays optimal until the probability of observing the target is quite close to 1. We provide a formula for identifying this cut-off point based on the size of the data set. When the amplitude is truly complex, we find that the optimal phase change depends non-trivially on the complexity of the amplitude vector. We provide an optimization formula to identify the required optimal phase change.

Title: On the Noisy Road to Open Quantum Dynamics: The Place of Stochastic Hamiltonians
Authors: Pietro De Checchi, Federico Gallina, Barbara Fresch, Giulio G. Giusteri
Abstract: Stochastic evolution underpins several approaches to the dynamics of open quantum systems, such as random modulation of Hamiltonian parameters, the stochastic Schrodinger equation (SSE), and the stochastic Liouville equation (SLE). These approaches replace the explicit system-environment coupling with an effective system-only dynamics, where dissipative behavior emerges from ensemble averaging. Stochastic Hamiltonians, in particular, have long served as phenomenological tools in physical chemistry to include environmental effects without recourse to an explicit microscopic derivation. In this work, we aim at a self-contained and accessible presentation of these approaches to further elaborate on their common roots in essential concepts of stochastic calculus and to delineate the conditions under which they are equivalent. We also discuss how different formulations naturally lead to different numerical time-integration schemes, better suited for either classical simulation platforms, based on finite-difference approximations, or quantum algorithms, that employ random unitary maps. Our analysis aims at providing a unified perspective and actionable recipes for classical and quantum implementations of stochastic evolution in the simulation of open quantum systems.

Title: Analytically Continuing the Randomized Measurement Toolbox
Authors: Akash Vijay, Ayush Raj, Jonah Kudler-Flam, Benoît Vermersch, Andreas Elben, Laimei Nie
Abstract: We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.

Title: Extreme non-negative Wigner functions
Authors: Zacharie Van Herstraeten, Jack Davis, Nuno C. Dias, João N. Prata, Nicolas J. Cerf, Ulysse Chabaud
Abstract: Providing an operational characterization of the Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e., the set of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function, is a longstanding open problem. For pure states, the only WPS are Gaussian states, but the situation is considerably more subtle for mixed states. Here, we approach the problem using convex geometry, reducing the question to the characterization of the extreme points of the set of WPS. We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states. Our results build upon new mathematical properties of the set of WPS derived in a companion paper and unveil the remarkable structure of mixed states with non-negative Wigner functions.

Title: On the mixed UDA states and additivity
Authors: Xinyu Qiu, Lin Chen, Genwei Li, Delin Chu
Abstract: Mixed states that are uniquely determined among all (UDA) states are vital in efficient quantum tomography. We show the necessary and sufficient conditions by which some multipartite mixed states are UDA by their $k$-partite reduced density matrices. The case for $k=2$ is mostly studied, which requires minimal local information and shows practical benefits. Based on that, we establish a systematic method for determining UDA states and provide a complete characterization of the additivity of UDA bipartite and three-qubit product states. We show the application of mixed UDA states and their characterization from the perspectives of tomography and other tasks.

Title: Absolutely Maximal Contextual Correlations
Authors: Nripendra Majumdar, S. Aravinda
Abstract: The foundational work by Bell led to an interest in understanding non-local correlations that arise from entangled states shared between distinct, spacelike-separated parties, which formed a foundation for the theory of quantum information processing. We investigate the question of maximal correlations analogous to the maximally entangled states defined in the entanglement theory of multipartite systems. To formalize this, we employ the sheaf-theoretic framework for contextuality, which generalizes non-locality. This provides a new metric for correlations called contextual fraction (CF), which ranges from 0 (non-contextual) to 1 (maximally contextual). Using this, we have defined the absolutely maximal contextual correlations (AMCC), which are maximally contextual and have maximal marginals, which captures the notion of absolutely maximal entangled (AME) states. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box serves as the bipartite example, and we construct various extensions of such correlations in the tripartite case. An infinite family of various forms of AMCC is constructed using the parity check method and the constraint satisfiability problem (CSP) scheme. We also demonstrate the existence of maximally contextual correlations, which do not exhibit maximal marginals, and refer to them as non-AMCC. The results are further applied to secret sharing and randomness extraction using AMCC correlations.

Title: Duality and measurement: the Copenhagen reconciliation
Authors: Vincenzo Chilla
Abstract: Duality, not monism, constitutes the hermeneutic lens that characterizes the original Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Therefore, evoking the principles of correspondence and complementarity, in this work we re-assert a dual-aspect reading of quantum theory, structured through a multi-perspective schema encompassing its ontological, analytical, epistemological, causal, and information dimensions. We then show how this schema dissolves the so-called 'measurement problem', along with the associated 'knowledge-information' and 'macro-micro' dichotomies, issues historically raised within later monistic or universalist philosophical settings that ultimately depart from the traditional Copenhagen spirit.

Title: Block Encoding Linear Combinations of Pauli Strings Using the Stabilizer Formalism
Authors: Niclas Schillo, Andreas Sturm, Rüdiger Quay
Abstract: The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) provides a powerful framework with the potential for quantum speedups across a wide range of applications. Its core input model is the block encoding framework, in which non-unitary matrices are embedded into larger unitary matrices. Because the gate complexity of the block-encoding subroutine largely determines the overall cost of QSVT-based algorithms, developing new and more efficient block encodings is crucial for achieving practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for constructing quantum circuits that block encode linear combinations of Pauli strings. Our approach relies on two key components. First, we apply a transformation that converts the Pauli strings into pairwise anti-commuting ones, making the transformed linear combination unitary and thus directly implementable as a quantum circuit. Second, we employ a correction transformation based on the stabilizer formalism which uses an ancilla register to restore the original Pauli strings. Our method can be implemented with an ancilla register whose size scales logarithmically with the number of system qubits. It can also be extended to larger ancilla registers, which can substantially reduce the overall quantum circuit complexity. We present four concrete examples and use numerical simulations to compare our method's circuit complexity with that of the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) approach. We find that our method achieves circuit complexities comparable to or better than LCU, with possible advantages when the structure of the target operators can be exploited. These results suggest that our approach could enable more efficient block encodings for a range of relevant problems extending beyond the examples analyzed in this work.

Title: Linear and Non-Linear Response of Quadratic Lindbladians
Authors: Spenser Talkington, Martin Claassen
Abstract: Quadratic Lindbladians encompass a rich class of dissipative electronic and bosonic quantum systems, which have been predicted to host new and exotic physics. In this study, we develop a Lindblad-Keldysh spectroscopic response formalism for open quantum systems that elucidates their steady-state response properties and dissipative phase transitions via finite-frequency linear and non-linear probes. As illustrative examples, we utilize this formalism to calculate the (1) density and dynamic spin susceptibilities of a boundary driven XY model at and near criticality, (2) linear and non-linear optical responses in Bernal bilayer graphene coupled to dissipative leads, and (3) steady state susceptibilities in a bosonic optical lattice. We find that the XY model spin density wavelength diverges with critical exponent 1/2, and there are gapless dispersive modes in the dynamic spin response that originate from the underlying spin density wave order; additionally the dispersing modes of the weak and ultra-strong dissipation limits exhibit a striking correspondence since the boundary dissipators couple only weakly to the bulk in both cases. In the optical response of the Bernal bilayer, we find that the diamagnetic response can decrease with increasing occupation, as opposed to in closed systems where the response increases monotonically with occupation; we study the effect of second harmonic generation and shift current and find that these responses, forbidden in centrosymmetric closed systems, can manifest in these open systems as a result of dissipation. We compare this formalism to its equilibrium counterpart and draw analogies between these non-interacting open systems and strongly interacting closed systems.

Title: Krylov complexity of purification
Authors: Rathindra Nath Das, Takato Mori
Abstract: In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, eight-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensembles, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.

Title: An Explicit Wavefunction of the Interacting Non-Hermitian Spin-1/2 1D System
Authors: Yue Wang, Xiangyu Zhang, Zhesen Yang, Congjun Wu
Abstract: We present an explicit Bethe-ansatz wavefunction to a 1D spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ interacting fermion system, manifesting a many-body resonance resulting from the interplay between interaction and non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupling. In the dilute limit, the Bethe-ansatz wavefunction is factorized into Slater determinants and a Jastrow factor. An effective thermodynamic distribution is constructed with an effective Hamiltonian including a repulsion resulting from Pauli's exclusion principle and a distinctive zigzag potential arising from the resonance. The competition between these effects leads to a transition from a uniformly distributed configuration to a phase separation. Clustering of particles with identical spins is observed in the latter phase, demonstrating that the many-body resonance effect is enhanced by the repulsive interaction.

Title: Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly
Authors: Jing-Ren Zhou, Zheng-Cheng Gu
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface ${F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.

Title: Generating Compilers for Qubit Mapping and Routing
Authors: Abtin Molavi, Amanda Xu, Ethan Cecchetti, Swamit Tannu, Aws Albarghouthi
Abstract: To evaluate a quantum circuit on a quantum processor, one must find a mapping from circuit qubits to processor qubits and plan the instruction execution while satisfying the processor's constraints. This is known as the qubit mapping and routing (QMR) problem. High-quality QMR solutions are key to maximizing the utility of scarce quantum resources and minimizing the probability of logical errors affecting computation. The challenge is that the landscape of quantum processors is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving. Given this diversity, dozens of papers have addressed the QMR problem for different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error correction schemes by a developing a new algorithm for a particular context. We present an alternative approach: automatically generating qubit mapping and routing compilers for arbitrary quantum processors. Though each QMR problem is different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a compact domain-specific language for specifying QMR problems and a powerful parametric algorithm that can be instantiated for any QMR specification. Our thorough evaluation on case studies of important QMR problems shows that generated compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of runtime and solution quality.

Title: SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains
Authors: Yueshui Zhang, Ying-Hai Wu, Meng Cheng, Hong-Hao Tu
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.

Title: Uniform-in-temperature locality estimates for weakly interacting quantum systems
Authors: Arka Adhikari, Joscha Henheik, Marius Lemm, Tom Wessel
Abstract: The locality of thermal quantum states has emerged as a key input for applications to thermalization, response theory, and efficient simulability. Locality is either captured by the decay of correlations or by local indistinguishability, which allows to approximate local expectation values by those of local thermal states. Most techniques for deriving locality bounds deteriorate at small temperature, a physically highly relevant regime and so it is of interest to identify conditions for uniform-in-temperature bounds. Here we prove that a class of weakly interacting quantum Hamiltonians satisfies exponential decay of correlations and local indistinguishability uniformly in the temperature. The proof uses a low-temperature cluster expansion and a quantum version of a probabilistic swapping trick developed by the first author and Cao (Ann. Probab. 53, 2025) in the context of lattice gauge theories.

Title: Bridging Quantum Computing and Nuclear Structure: Atomic Nuclei on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer
Authors: Sota Yoshida, Takeshi Sato, Takumi Ogata, Masaaki Kimura
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear many-body systems on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting ground states of oxygen, calcium, and nickel isotopes. By combining a hard-core-boson representation of the nuclear shell model with a pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles ansatz, we achieve sub-percent relative error in the ground-state energies compared to noise-free statevector simulations. Our approach leverages symmetry-aware state preparation and particle-number post-selection to efficiently capture pairing correlations characteristic of systems with same-species nucleons. These findings highlight the viability of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear physics applications and provide a foundation for scaling to more complex nuclear systems.

Title: Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory
Authors: Rui Xian Siew, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Tanmoy Bhattacharya
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills (YM) theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory (CFT) describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory (QFT) that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.
