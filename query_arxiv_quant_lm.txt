Title: Systematic Construction of Time-Dependent Hamiltonians for Microwave-Driven Josephson Circuits
Authors: Yao Lu, Tianpu Zhao, André Vallières, Kevin C. Smith, Daniel Weiss, Xinyuan You, Yaxing Zhang, Suhas Ganjam, Aniket Maiti, John W.O. Garmon, Shantanu Mundhada, Ziwen Huang, Ian Mondragon-Shem, Steven M. Girvin, Jens Koch, Robert J. Schoelkopf
Abstract: Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing.

Title: Quantum Universality in Composite Systems: A Trichotomy of Clifford Resources
Authors: Alejandro Borda, Julian Rincon, César Galindo
Abstract: The efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits constitutes a fundamental barrier to quantum advantage, typically overcome by injecting explicit non-Clifford "magic" resources. We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that "coprime architectures" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary.

Title: Coexistence of Anderson Localization and Quantum Scarring in Two Dimensions
Authors: Fartash Chalangari, Anant Vijay Varma, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Esa Räsänen
Abstract: We study finite two-dimensional disordered systems with periodic confinement. At low energies, eigenstates exhibit strong Anderson localization, while at higher energies a subset of states forms variational scars with anisotropic intensity patterns that violate random wave expectations. Scaling theory predicts that all states localize in two dimensions, yet energy-dependent localization lengths and finite system size allow these regimes to coexist. We demonstrate that this coexistence produces distinct, robust signatures in both spatial intensity patterns and spectral statistics that are directly observable in mesoscopic electronic, photonic, and cold atom systems.

Title: Higher-Dimensional Information Lattice: Quantum State Characterization through Inclusion-Exclusion Local Information
Authors: Ian Matthias Flór, Claudia Artiaco, Thomas Klein Kvorning, Jens H. Bardarson
Abstract: We generalize the information lattice, originally defined for one-dimensional open-boundary chains, to characterize quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries. In one dimension, the information lattice provides a position- and scale-resolved decomposition of von Neumann information. Its generalization is nontrivial because overlapping subsystems can form loops, allowing multiple regions to encode the same information. This prevents information from being assigned uniquely to any one of them. We address this by introducing a higher-dimensional information lattice in which local information is defined through an inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion local information is assigned to the lattice vertices, each labeled by subsystem position and scale. We implement this construction explicitly in two dimensions and apply it to a range of many-body ground states with distinct entanglement structures. Within this position- and scale-resolved framework, we extract information-based localization lengths, direction-dependent critical exponents, characteristic edge mode information, long-range information patterns due to topological order, and signatures of non-Abelian fusion channels. Our work establishes a general information-theoretic framework for isolating the universal scale-resolved features of quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries.

Title: Using bosons to improve resource efficiency of quantum simulation of vibronic molecular dynamics
Authors: Henry L. Nourse, Vanessa C. Olaya-Agudelo, Ivan Kassal
Abstract: Simulating chemical dynamics is computationally challenging, especially for nonadiabatic dynamics, where numerically exact classical simulations scale exponentially with system size, becoming intractable for even small molecules. On quantum computers, chemical dynamics can be simulated efficiently using either universal, qubit-only devices or specialized mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) simulators, which natively host electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Here, we compare the quantum resources required for a qubit-only approach to achieve the same accuracy as an MQB device at simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. We find that MQB simulations require orders-of-magnitude fewer quantum operations than qubit-only simulations, with a one-gate MQB circuit requiring a qubit-equivalent circuit volume of over 400,000 when simulating an isolated molecule, which increases to over ten million when environmental effects are included. These estimates assume perfect qubits and gates, and would increase by additional orders of magnitude if error correction were used for fault tolerance. When errors are small, the advantage of MQB simulators becomes even larger as system size increases. Our results highlight the enormous resource advantages of representing non-qubit chemical degrees of freedom natively, rather than encoding them into qubits.

Title: Optical spin tomography in a telecom C-band quantum dot
Authors: Junyang Huang, Ginny Shooter, Petros Laccotripes, Andrea Barbiero, David A. Ritchie, Andrew J. Shields, Tina Müller, R. Mark Stevenson
Abstract: A central challenge for scalable quantum networks is the realization of coherent interfaces between stationary qubits and telecom-band photonic qubits for long-distance entanglement distribution. Semiconductor quantum dots emitting at telecom wavelengths present a promising spin-photon platform, and a precise understanding of the properties of the confined spin is crucial for optimizing its interplay with the photonic qubit. Here, we simultaneously benchmark the electron and hole g-factors and coherence properties of a droplet epitaxy QD, solely from time and polarization resolved photon correlations. These measurements identify the hole as the preferable qubit for spin-photon entanglement in quantum network nodes. We then perform full state tomography of the confined hole ground state to reveal subtle anisotropies in the spin precession, providing essential diagnostics for minimizing phase errors critical for deterministic multiphoton entanglement generation.

Title: Heralded Linear Optical Generation of Dicke States
Authors: Minhyeok Kang, Jaehee Kim, William J. Munro, Seungbeom Chin, Joonsuk Huh
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and a key resource for quantum information processing. Among multipartite entangled states, Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ are distinguished by their permutation symmetry, which provides robustness against particle loss and enables applications for quantum communication and computation. Although Dicke states have been realized in various platforms, most optical implementations rely on postselection, which destroys the state upon detection and prevents its further use. A heralded optical scheme is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present a linear-optical heralded scheme for generating arbitrary Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ with $3n+k$ photons through the framework of the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture. By mapping the scheme design into the graph-finding problem, and exploiting the permutation symmetry of Dicke states, we overcome the structural complexity that has hindered previous approaches. Our results provide a resource-efficient pathway toward practical heralded preparation of Dicke states for quantum technologies.

Title: Quantum-classical algorithm for Ewald summation based computation of long-range electrostatics
Authors: Mansur Ziiatdinov, Igor Novikov, Farid Ablayev, Valeri Barsegov
Abstract: Numerical exploration of large-size real biological systems requires computational power far exceeding that of modern classical computers. In computational molecular science, calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions between charged atoms - the strongest interactions in condensed phases, is a major bottleneck. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm for fast yet accurate computation of Coulomb electrostatic energy for a system of point charges. The algorithm employs the Ewald method based decomposition of electrostatic energy E into several energy terms, of which "the Fourier component" of E is computed in the algorithm proposed on a quantum device, utilizing the power of Quantum Fourier Transform. We demonstrate the algorithm's quantum advantage for a range of systems of point charges in the three-dimensional space when the number of charges (system size) N exceeds the number of grid points M, and show that the numerical error is rather small <0.1%. The algorithm can be implemented in running the all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations on a quantum computer, thereby expanding the scope of applications of QFT methods in computational physics, chemistry, and biology.

Title: Tutorial on Superconducting Quantum Circuits: From Basics to Applications
Authors: Denys Derlian Carvalho Brito, Fernando Valadares, André Jorge Carvalho Chaves
Abstract: As superconducting circuits emerge as a leading platform for scalable quantum information processing, building comprehensive bridges from the foundational principles of macroscopic quantum phenomena to the architecture of modern quantum devices is increasingly essential for introducing new researchers to the field. This tutorial provides a self-contained, pedagogical introduction to superconducting quantum circuits at the undergraduate level. Beginning with an overview of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, the tutorial systematically develops the quantization of microwave circuits into the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime. This work serves as a foundational guide and first point of contact, equipping students and researchers with the conceptual and mathematical tools necessary to understand and engineer superconducting quantum hardware.

Title: AI-Accelerated Qubit Readout at the Single-Photon Level for Scalable Atomic Quantum Processors
Authors: Yaoting Zhou, Weisen Wang, Zhuangzhuang Tian, Bin Huang, Huancheng Chen, Donghao Li, Zhongxiao Xu, Li Chen, Heng Shen
Abstract: Quantum state readout with minimal resources is crucial for scalable quantum information processing. As a leading platform, neutral atom arrays rely on atomic fluorescence imaging for qubit readout, requiring short exposure, low photon count schemes to mitigate heating and atom loss while enabling mid-circuit feedback. However, a fundamental challenge arises in the single-photon regime where severe overlap in state distributions causes conventional threshold discrimination to fail. Here, we report an AI-accelerated Bayesian inference method for fluorescence readout in neutral atom arrays. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to achieve reliable state detection at the single-photon level under short exposure. Specifically, we introduce a weakly anchored Bayesian scheme that requires calibration of only one state, addressing asymmetric calibration challenges common across quantum platforms. Furthermore, acceleration is achieved via a permutation-invariant neural network, which yields a 100-fold speedup by compressing iterative inference into a single forward pass. The approach achieves relative readout fidelity above 99% and 98% for histogram overlaps of 61% and 72%, respectively, enabling reliable extraction of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference results unattainable with conventional threshold based methods. This framework supports scalable, real-time readout of large atom arrays and paves the way toward AI-enhanced quantum technology in computation and sensing.

Title: Precise quantum control of unidirectional field-free molecular orientation
Authors: Qian-Qian Hong, Zhe-Jun Zhang, Chuan-Cun Shu, Jun He, Daoyi Dong, Dajun Ding
Abstract: The capability to control molecular rotation for field-free orientation, which arranges molecules in specific spatial directions without external fields, is crucial in physics, chemistry, and quantum information science. However, conventional methods typically lead to transient orientations characterized by periodic directional reversals and necessitate the generation of coherent superpositions across a broad spectrum of rotational states of ultracold molecules. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for achieving unidirectional field-free orientation by selectively manipulating two specific rotational states of symmetric top molecules. By leveraging the interplay between coherent superpositions and the precise selection of initial states, we demonstrate that both the maximum achievable orientation and its direction can be effectively controlled. To attain the desired two-state orientation, we present a quantum control strategy that utilizes a single control pulse, significantly simplifying the complexities of conventional multistate or multipulse schemes. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach for methyl iodide (CH$_3$I) molecules, even when accounting for molecular centrifugal this http URL results highlight the critical roles of initial-state selection and quantum coherence in achieving long-lasting, high unidirectional molecular orientation, opening new directions in stereochemistry, precision spectroscopy, and quantum computing.

Title: Quantum Homotopy Algorithm for Solving Nonlinear PDEs and Flow Problems
Authors: Sachin S. Bharadwaj, Balasubramanya Nadiga, Stephan Eidenbenz, Katepalli R. Sreenivasan
Abstract: Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Title: Measurement-driven Quantum Approximate Optimization
Authors: Tobias Stollenwerk, Stuart Hadfield
Abstract: Algorithms based on non-unitary evolution have attracted much interest for ground state preparation on quantum computers. One recently proposed method makes use of ancilla qubits and controlled unitary operators to implement weak measurements related to imaginary-time evolution. In this work we specialize and extend this approach to the setting of combinatorial optimization. We first generalize the algorithm from exact to approximate optimization, taking advantage of several properties unique to classical problems. In particular we show how to select parameters such that the success probability of each measurement step is bounded away from $1/2$. We then show how to adapt our paradigm to the setting of constrained optimization for a number of important classes of hard problem constraints. For this we compare and contrast both penalty-based and feasibility-preserving approaches, elucidating the significant advantages of the latter approach. Our approach is general and may be applied to easy-to-prepare initial states as a standalone algorithm, or deployed as a quantum postprocessing stage to improve performance of a given parameterized quantum circuit. We then propose a more sophisticated variant of our algorithm that adaptively applies a mixing operator or not, based on the measurement outcomes seen so far, as to speeds up the algorithm and helps the system evolution avoid slowing down or getting stuck suboptimally. In particular, we show that mixing operators from the quantum alternating operator ansatz can be imported directly, both for the necessary eigenstate scrambling operator and for initial state preparation, and discuss quantum resource tradeoffs.

Title: Device-Independent Anonymous Communication in Quantum Networks
Authors: Srijani Das, Manasi Patra, Tuhin Paul, Anish Majumdar, Ramij Rahaman
Abstract: Anonymity is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that hides the identities of both senders and receivers during message transmission over a network. Classical protocols cannot provide information-theoretic security for such task, and existing quantum approaches typically depend on classical subroutines and multiple private channels, thereby weakening their security in fully adversarial settings. In this work, we introduce the first fully quantum protocol for anonymous communication in realistic quantum networks with a device-independent security proof.

Title: Classical reservoir approach for efficient molecular ground state preparation
Authors: Zekun He, Dominika Zgid, A. F. Kemper, J. K. Freericks
Abstract: Ground state preparation is a central application of quantum algorithms for electronic structure. We introduce the classical reservoir approach, a low cost variational ansatz tailored to near-term hardware, requiring only nearest-neighbor interactions on a machine with square-lattice connectivity. Unlike traditional methods built from the classically efficient Hartree Fock theory, our ansatz operates in localized molecular orbitals to study previously unexplored regions of the variational parameter space. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate chemical accuracy across diverse systems and bond lengths; notably, significantly reduced circuit depths are attainable when relaxed error thresholds (e.g., tens of E_h) are permissible. We benchmark the method on hydrogen chains, N_2, O_2, CO, BeH_2, and H_2O, the latter corresponding to an effective 24 qubit calculation.

Title: Holonomic multi-controlled gates for single-photon states
Authors: Carlo Danieli, Valentina Brosco, Claudio Conti, Laura Pilozzi
Abstract: Controlled and multi-controlled quantum gates, whose action on a target qubit depends on the state of multiple control qubits, represent a fundamental logical building block for complex quantum algorithms. We propose a scheme for realizing this class of gates based on non-Abelian holonomies in modulated photonic waveguide networks. Our approach relies on linear photonic cicuits formed by two star networks coupled via a two-path circuit. A star network with M peripheral waveguides coupled to a single central site, or M-pod, naturally generalizes the tripod structure used in non-Abelian Thouless pumping and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). In the present work, we first analyze the minimal case of two connected tripods and design adiabatic driving loops that implement single-qubit, CNOT, and SWAP gates. We then show how extending the approach to larger M-pod structures enables the realization of multiply controlled operations, which we exemplify by designing Toffoli and the OR gate on two coupled pentapods. Finally, we demonstrate that networks of connected tripods can implement the Deutsch quantum query algorithm.

Title: Photoexcitation of moiré-trapped interlayer excitons via chiral phonons
Authors: A. Borel, T. V. Ivanova, J. Cervantes-Villanueva, P. Thor, H. Baek, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, A. Molina-Sanchez, B. D. Gerardot, M. Brotons-Gisbert
Abstract: Moiré superlattices in transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductor heterobilayers enable the quantum confinement of interlayer excitons with large out-of-plane permanent electric dipoles and spin-valley control. Here, we report a novel phonon-assisted excitation mechanism of individual moiré-trapped interlayer excitons in 2H-stacked MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers via chiral $E^{\prime\prime}$ in-plane optical phonons at the {\Gamma}-point. This excitation pathway preserves valley-selective optical selection rules and enables deterministic generation of individual interlayer excitons with defined helicity, emitting within a spectrally narrow energy spread. Through photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy in both the ensemble and quantum emitter regimes, we identify a fixed phonon energy of $\sim$23 meV mediating the process. First-principles calculations corroborate the symmetry and energy of the relevant phonon mode and its coupling to interlayer excitons, providing microscopic support for the observed valley-selective phonon-assisted excitation mechanism. Our results highlight the utility of chiral phonons as a tool for controlled excitation of quantum emitters in TMD moiré systems, opening new opportunities for valleytronic and quantum photonic applications.

Title: Thermodynamic sampling of materials using neutral-atom quantum computers
Authors: Bruno Camino, Mao Lin, John Buckeridge, Scott M. Woodley
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum hardware has emerged as a promising platform for programmable many-body physics. In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $\alpha_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = \alpha_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $\Delta_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $\Delta\mu$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations.

Title: Information-Scrambling-Enhanced Quantum Sensing Beyond the Standard Quantum Limit
Authors: Yangyang Ge, Haoyu Zhou, Wen Zheng, Xiang-Min Yu, Wei Fang, Zhenchuan Zhang, Wanli Huang, Xiang Deng, Haoyang Cai, Xianke Li, Kun Zhou, Hanxin Che, Tao Zhang, Lichang Ji, Yu Zhang, Jie Zhao, Shao-Xiong Li, Xinsheng Tan, Yang Yu
Abstract: Quantum sensing promises measurement precision beyond classical limits, but its practical realization is often hindered by decoherence and the challenges of generating and stabilizing entanglement in large-scale systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable, scrambling-enhanced quantum sensing protocol, referred to as butterfly metrology, implemented on a cross-shaped superconducting quantum processor. By harnessing quantum information scrambling, the protocol converts local interactions into delocalized metrologically useful correlations, enabling robust signal amplification through interference of the scrambled and polarized quantum states. We validate the time-reversal ability via Loschmidt echo measurements and quantify the information scrambling through out-of-time-ordered correlators, establishing the essential quantum resources of our protocol. Our measurements reveal that the sensing sensitivity surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) with increasing qubit number, reaching 3.78 in a 9-qubit configuration, compared to the SQL of 3.0. The scheme further exhibits inherent robustness to coherent control errors and probed signal noise. This work demonstrates a readily scalable path toward practical quantum sensing advantages with prevalent experimental platforms.

Title: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with Fixed Number of Parameters
Authors: Sebastián Saavedra-Pino, Ricardo Quispe-Mendizábal, Gabriel Alvarado Barrios, Enrique Solano, Juan Carlos Retamal, Francisco Albarrán-Arriagada
Abstract: We introduce a novel quantum optimization paradigm: the Fixed-Parameter-Count Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (FPC-QAOA). It is a scalable variational framework that maintains a constant number of trainable parameters regardless of the number of qubits, Hamiltonian complexity, or circuit depth. By separating schedule function optimization from circuit digitization, FPC-QAOA enables accurate schedule approximations with minimal parameters while supporting arbitrarily deep digitized adiabatic evolutions, constrained only by NISQ hardware capabilities. This separation allows depth to scale without expanding the classical search space, mitigating overparameterization and optimization challenges typical of deep QAOA circuits, such as barren plateaus-like behaviors. We benchmark FPC-QAOA on random MaxCut instances and the Tail Assignment Problem, achieving performance comparable to or better than standard QAOA with nearly constant classical effort and significantly fewer quantum circuit evaluations. Experiments on the IBM Kingston superconducting processor with up to 50 qubits confirm robustness and hardware efficiency under realistic noise. These results position FPC-QAOA as a practical and scalable paradigm for variational quantum optimization on near-term quantum devices.

Title: Interaction-Resilient Scalable Fluxonium Architecture with All-Microwave Gates
Authors: Andrei A. Kugut (1 and 2), Grigoriy S. Mazhorin (1 and 2), Ilya A. Simakov (1 and 2) ((1) National University of Science and Technology "MISIS'', (2) Russian Quantum Center)
Abstract: Fluxonium qubits demonstrate exceptional potential for quantum processing; yet, realizing scalable architectures using them remains challenging. We propose a fluxonium-based square-grid design with fast $\sim63$~ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates, achieving coherent errors below $10^{-4}$, activated via microwave-driven transmon couplers. A central difficulty in such large-scale systems with all-microwave gates and, therefore, strong static couplings, is suppressing parasitic interactions that extend beyond nearest neighbors to include next-nearest elements. We address this issue by introducing several design strategies: the frequency allocation of both qubits and couplers, the localization of coupler wavefunctions, and a differential oscillator that suppresses residual long-range interactions. In addition, the architecture natively supports fast $\sim70$~ns CZZ gates -- three-qubit operations composed of two CZ gates sharing a common qubit -- which reduce the incoherent error by $\sim 35\%$ compared to performing the corresponding CZs sequentially. Together, these advances establish an interaction-resilient platform for large-scale fluxonium processors and can be adapted to a variety of fluxonium layouts.

Title: All-optical control and multiplexed readout of multiple superconducting qubits

Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits operate at millikelvin temperatures, typically requiring independent microwave cables for each qubit for connecting room-temperature control and readout electronics. However, scaling to large-scale processors hosting hundreds of qubits faces a severe input/output (I/O) bottleneck, as the dense cable arrays impose prohibitive constraints on physical footprint, thermal load, wiring complexity, and cost. Here we demonstrate a complete optical I/O architecture for superconducting quantum circuits, in which all control and readout signals are transmitted exclusively via optical photons. Employing a broadband traveling-wave Brillouin microwave-to-optical transducer, we achieve simultaneous frequency-multiplexed optical readout of two qubits. Combined with fiber-integrated photodiode arrays for control signal delivery, this closed-loop optical I/O introduces no measurable degradation to qubit coherence times, with an optically driven single-qubit gate fidelity showing only a 0.19% reduction relative to standard microwave operation. These results establish optical interconnects as a viable path toward large-scale superconducting quantum processors, and open the possibility of networking multiple superconducting quantum computers housed in separate dilution refrigerators through a centralized room-temperature control infrastructure.

Title: 3D cavity-based graphene superconducting quantum circuits in two-qubit architectures
Authors: Kuei-Lin Chiu, Avishma J. Lasrado, Cheng-Han Lo, Yen-Chih Chen, Shih-Po Shih, Yen-Hsiang Lin, Chung-Ting Ke
Abstract: We construct a series of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits and integrate them into 3D cavities. For a single-qubit device, we demonstrate flux-tunable qubit transition, with a measured $T_1$ $\approx$ 48 ns and a lower bound estimate of $T_2^\ast$ $\approx$ 17.63 ns. By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.

Title: Squeezed quantum multiplets: properties and phase space representation
Authors: Juan Pablo Paz, Corina Révora, Christian Tomás Schmiegelow
Abstract: We define and study the properties of ``squeezed quantum multiplets''. Ordinary multiplets are sets of $D$-orthonormal quantum states formed by superpositions of states squeezed along $D$ equally spaced directions in quadrature space. More generally, we also discuss superpositions of ``higher-order squeezed states'', including tri-squeezed and quad-squeezed states. All these states involve superpositions of multiples of $p$ photons. We compare states in ordinary ($p=2$) multiplets and higher-order ones ($p>2$) in the most relevant cases, showing that ordinary squeezed multiplets and higher-order ones share some important similarities, as well as some differences. Finally, we present analytical expressions for phase-space distributions (Wigner and characteristic functions) representing ordinary squeezed multiplets. We use this to show that some squeezed multiplets are highly sensitive to perturbations in all phase-space directions, making them interesting for metrological applications.

Title: Random dilation superchannel
Authors: Satoshi Yoshida, Ryotaro Niwa, Mio Murao
Abstract: We present a quantum circuit that implements the random dilation superchannel, transforming parallel queries of an unknown quantum channel into parallel queries of a randomly chosen dilation isometry of the input channel. This is a natural generalization of a random purification channel, that transforms copies of an unknown mixed state to copies of a randomly chosen purification state. Our construction is based on the quantum Schur transform and the quantum Fourier transform over the symmetric group. By using the efficient construction of these quantum transforms, we can implement the random dilation superchannel with the circuit complexity $O(\mathrm{poly}(n, \log d_I, \log d_O))$, where $n$ is the number of queries and $d_I$ and $d_O$ are the input and output dimensions of the input channel, respectively. As an application, we show an efficient storage-and-retrieval of an unknown quantum channel, which improves the program cost exponentially in the retrieval error $\varepsilon$. For the case where the Kraus rank $r$ is the least possible (i.e., $r = d_I/d_O$), we show quantum circuits transforming $n$ parallel queries of an unknown quantum channel $\Lambda$ to $\Theta(n^\alpha)$ parallel queries of $\Lambda$ for any $\alpha<2$ approximately, and its Petz recovery map for the reference state given by the maximally mixed state probabilistically and exactly. We also show that our results can be further extended to the case of quantum superchannels.

Title: Characterizing quantum synchronization in the van der Pol oscillator via tomogram and photon correlation
Authors: Kingshuk Adhikary, K. M. Athira, M. Rohith
Abstract: We access the quantum synchronization (QS) in the steady state of a driven quantum van der Pol oscillator (vdPo) using two distinct figures of merit: (i) the nonclassical area $\delta$ and (ii) the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$, which are both viable in experimental architectures. The nonclassical area quantifier rooted in homodyne tomography, allows us to assess the nonclassical nature of the vdPo's state directly from the tomogram without requiring full state reconstruction or the Wigner function negativity. Within a well-defined parameter regime of drive strength and detuning, both $\delta$ and $g^{(2)}(0)$ exhibit pronounced signatures of synchronization that complements the phase coherence between the drive and the vdPo. We derive an analytical expression for the steady-state density matrix and the corresponding tomogram of the system, valid for arbitrary strengths of the harmonic drive. Analysis of the quantum tomogram uncovers clear phase-locking behavior, enabling the identification of the synchronization region (Arnold tongue) directly in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. Furthermore, the behaviour of $g^{(2)}(0)$ provides a statistical perspective that reinforces the tomographic signatures of QS. By analyzing the interplay between these metrics, we can gain more profound insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern QS in such systems.

Title: Quantum computation of mass gap in an asymptotically free theory
Authors: Paulo F. Bedaque, Edison M. Murairi, Gautam Rupak, Valery S. Simonyan
Abstract: In relativistic field theories, the mass spectrum is given by the difference between the energy of the vacuum and the excited states. Near the continuum limit, the cancellation between these two values leads to loss of precision. We propose a method to extract the mass gap directly using quantum computers and apply it to a particular version of the nonlinear $\sigma$-model with the correct continuum limit and perform calculations in quantum hardware (at strong coupling) and simulation in classical computers (at weak coupling).

Title: A Note on Publicly Verifiable Quantum Money with Low Quantum Computational Resources
Authors: Fabrizio Genovese, Lev Stambler
Abstract: In this work we present a publicly verifiable quantum money protocol which assumes close to no quantum computational capabilities. We rely on one-time memories which in turn can be built from quantum conjugate coding and hardware-based assumptions. Specifically, our scheme allows for a limited number of verifications and also allows for quantum tokens for digital signatures. Double spending is prevented by the no-cloning principle of conjugate coding states. An implementation of the concepts presented in this work can be found at this https URL.

Title: Optimizing Quantum State Transformation Under Locality Constraint
Authors: Sasan Sarbishegi, Maryam Sadat Mirkamali
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general numerical framework for both deterministic and probabilistic quantum state transformations, under locality constraints. For a given arbitrary bipartite initial state and a desired bipartite target state, we construct an optimized local quantum channel that transforms the initial state into the target state with high fidelity. To achieve this goal, local quantum channels are parametrized on a complex Stiefel manifold and optimized using gradient-based methods. We demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances entanglement distillation for weakly entangled states via two complementary strategies: optimized local state transformation and probabilistic local transformation. These results establish our method as a powerful and versatile tool for a broad class of quantum information processing tasks.

Title: Q-RUN: Quantum-Inspired Data Re-uploading Networks
Authors: Wenbo Qiao, Shuaixian Wang, Peng Zhang, Yan Ming, Jiaming Zhao
Abstract: Data re-uploading quantum circuits (DRQC) are a key approach to implementing quantum neural networks and have been shown to outperform classical neural networks in fitting high-frequency functions. However, their practical application is limited by the scalability of current quantum hardware. In this paper, we introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network (Q-RUN), which retains the Fourier-expressive advantages of quantum models without any quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks. Compared to the fully connected layers and the state-of-the-art neural network layers, Q-RUN reduces model parameters while decreasing error by approximately one to three orders of magnitude on certain tasks. Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures. This work illustrates how principles from quantum machine learning can guide the design of more expressive artificial intelligence.

Title: Controlled pairing symmetries in a Fermi-Hubbard ladder with band flattening
Authors: J. P. Mendonça, S. Biswas, M. Dziurawiec, U. Bhattacharya, K. Jachymski, M. Aidelsburger, M. Lewenstein, M. M. Maśka, T. Grass
Abstract: Band flattening has been identified as key ingredient to correlation phenomena in Moiré materials and beyond. Here, we examine strongly repulsive fermions on a ladder -- a minimal platform for unconventional $d$-wave pairing -- and show that flattening of the lower band through an additional diagonal hopping term produces non-Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by the violation of Luttinger's theorem, as well as axial $d$-wave pairing correlations. Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing. This offers broadly relevant insights for correlated flat-band systems, ranging from ultracold atoms to strongly interacting electrons in solids.

Title: Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states
Authors: Hao Chen, Titus Neupert, Juraj Hasik
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.

Title: Probing Stringy Horizons with Pole-Skipping in Non-Maximal Chaotic Systems
Authors: Ping Gao, Hong Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we study pole-skipping in non-maximally quantum chaotic systems. Using Rindler conformal field theories and the large-$q$ SYK chain as illustrative examples, we argue that the pole-skipping points of few-body operators organize into trajectories in the complex frequency-momentum plane, with the leading trajectory encoding the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime.

Title: Horizons and Soft Quantum Information
Authors: Daine L. Danielson, Gautam Satishchandran
Abstract: It was recently shown that black holes decohere any quantum superpositions in their vicinity. This decoherence is mediated by soft radiation through the horizon, and can be understood as the result of the fact that quantum states in the exterior source distinguishable states of long-range fields in the interior. To study this phenomenon and others, we extend Tomita-Takesaki theory to accommodate states of soft radiation such as arise in the electromagnetic and gravitational memory effects, and provide a general framework for computing the distinguishability of general coherent states. Applying these tools, we use the methods of unambiguous state discrimination and approximate quantum error correction to prove some new relations regarding the distinguishability of quantum states, and the quantum information content of soft radiation, and thereby show that a black hole (or any horizon) decoheres its environment as though its interior were full of optimal observers.

Title: Towards City-Scale Quantum Timing: Wireless Synchronization via Quantum Hubs
Authors: Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna, Rula Ammuri, Saif Al-Kuwari, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: This paper presents a novel wireless quantum synchronization framework tailored for city-scale deployment using entangled photon pairs and passive corner cube retroreflector (CCR) arrays. A centralized quantum hub emits entangled photons, directing one toward a target device and the other toward a local reference unit. The target, equipped with a planar CCR array, reflects the incoming photon without active circuitry, enabling secure round-trip quantum measurements for sub-nanosecond synchronization and localization. We develop a comprehensive analytical model that captures key physical-layer phenomena, including Gaussian beam spread, spatial misalignment, atmospheric turbulence, and probabilistic photon generation. A closed-form expression is derived for the single-photon detection probability under Gamma-Gamma fading, and its distribution is used to model photon arrival events and synchronization error. Moreover, we analyze the impact of background photons, SPAD detector jitter, and quantum generation randomness on synchronization accuracy and outage probability. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical models and reveal key trade-offs among beam waist, CCR array size, and background light. The proposed architecture offers a low-power, infrastructure-free solution for secure timing in next-generation smart cities.

Title: The Benefits and Challenges of a Quantum Computing Concept Inventory
Authors: Lachlan McGinness
Abstract: A Quantum Computing Concept Inventory is needed for the acceleration of uptake of best practice in quantum computing education required to support the quantum computing workforce for the next two decades. Eight experts in quantum computing, quantum ommunication or quantum sensing were interviewed to determine if there is substantial non-mathematical content to warrant such an inventory and determine a preliminary list of key concepts that should be included in such an inventory. Developing such an inventory is a challenging task requiring significant international 'buy-in' and creativity to produce jargon-free valid questions which are accessible to students who are yet to study quantum mechanics.

Title: Quantum Ising Model on $(2+1)-$Dimensional Anti$-$de Sitter Space using Tensor Networks
Authors: Simon Catterall, Alexander F. Kemper, Yannick Meurice, Abhishek Samlodia, Goksu Can Toga
Abstract: We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.

Title: Black hole as a multipartite entangler: multi-entropy in AdS${}_3$/CFT${}_2$
Authors: Takanori Anegawa, Shota Suzuki, Kotaro Tamaoka
Abstract: We study multipartite entanglement in typical pure states holographically dual to pure BTZ black holes, using multi-entropy and its ``genuine'' version. In the bulk, these quantities are computed by minimal geodesic networks (so-called Steiner trees). We find that at sufficiently high temperature, the genuine tripartite multi-entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling in sharp contrast to vacuum AdS$_3$, where the genuine contribution is universal and size-independent. Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$. As a byproduct, we also observe an intriguing ``area-law'' contribution to multi-entropy that is relevant to vacuum AdS${}_3$.

Title: Hamiltonian-Informed Point Group Symmetry-Respecting Ansatz for Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Runhong He, Arapat Ablimit, Xin Hong, Qiaozhen Chai, Junyuan Zhou, Ji Guan, Guolong Cui, Shenggang Ying
Abstract: Solving molecular energy levels via the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm represents one of the most promising applications for demonstrating practically meaningful quantum advantage in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. To strike a balance between ansatz complexity and computational stability in VQE calculations, we propose the HiUCCSD, a novel symmetry-respecting ansatz engineered from the intrinsic information of the Hamiltonian. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of HiUCCSD within the scope of Abelian point groups. Furthermore, we compare the performance of HiUCCSD and the established SymUCCSD via VQE and Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter (ADAPT)-VQE numerical experiments on ten molecules with distinct point groups. The results show that HiUCCSD achieves equivalent performance to SymUCCSD for Abelian point group molecules, while avoiding the potential performance failure of SymUCCSD in the case of non-Abelian point group molecules. Across the studied molecular systems, HiUCCSD cuts the parameter count by 18%-83% for VQE and reduces the excitation operator pool size by 27%-84% for ADAPT-VQE, as compared with the UCCSD ansatz. With enhanced robustness and broader applicability, HiUCCSD offers a new ansatz option for advancing large-scale molecular VQE implementation.

Title: Quantum Origin of Classical Background Fields from Coherent States: A First-Principles Formulation in QED
Authors: Keita Seto
Abstract: Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field. Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime. Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches. Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.

Title: Bridging Microscopic Constructions and Continuum Topological Field Theory of Three-Dimensional Non-Abelian Topological Order
Authors: Yizhou Huang, Zhi-Feng Zhang, Qing-Rui Wang, Peng Ye
Abstract: Here we provide a microscopic lattice construction of excitations, fusion, and shrinking in a non-Abelian topological order by studying the three-dimensional quantum double model. We explicitly construct lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, systematically derive their fusion and shrinking rules, and demonstrate that non-Abelian shrinking channels can be controllably selected through internal degrees of freedom of loop operators. Most importantly, we show that the lattice shrinking rules obey the fusion--shrinking consistency relations predicted by twisted $BF$ field theory, providing solid evidence for the validity of field-theoretical principles developed over the past years. In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems.

Title: Coupled-wire construction of non-Abelian higher-order topological phases
Authors: Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.

Title: Controlling photothermal forces and backaction in nano-optomechanical resonators through strain engineering
Authors: Menno H. Jansen, Cauê M. Kersul, Ewold Verhagen
Abstract: In micro- and nanoscale optomechanical systems, radiation pressure interactions are often complemented or impeded by photothermal forces arising from thermal strain induced by optical heating. We show that the sign and magnitude of the photothermal force can be engineered through deterministic nanoscale structural design, by considering the overlap of temperature and modal strain profiles. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a specific system: a nanobeam zipper cavity by changing the geometry of its supporting tethers. A single design parameter, corresponding to a nanoscale geometry change, controls the magnitude of the photothermal backaction and even its sign. These insights will allow engineering the combined photothermal and radiation pressure forces in nano-optomechanical systems, such that backaction-induced linewidth variations are deterministically minimized if needed, or maximized for applications that require cooling or amplification at specific laser detuning.

Title: Quantum entanglement between partons in a strongly coupled quantum field theory
Authors: Wenyu Zhang, Wenyang Qian, Yiyu Zhou, Yang Li, Qun Wang
Abstract: We perform a first-principles, non-perturbative investigation of quantum entanglement between partonic constituents in a strongly coupled 3+1-dimensional scalar Yukawa theory, using light-front Hamiltonian methods with controlled Fock-space truncations. By explicitly constructing reduced density matrices for (mock) nucleon, pion, and anti-nucleon subsystems from light-front wave functions, we compute key entanglement witnesses, including von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and linear entropy, in both quenched (no sea pairs) and unquenched frameworks. We find that the entanglement entropy is closely related to the Shannon entropy of the transverse momentum dependent distribution, establishing a link between quantum information and parton structure. In contrast, the unquenched theory reveals genuinely non-classical correlations: the entanglement entropy cannot be reduced to any Shannon entropy of normalized parton distributions, demonstrating that the full hadronic wave function encodes quantum information beyond classical probabilities. Our findings highlight the role of entanglement as a fundamental probe of non-perturbative dynamics in relativistic quantum field theory and lay the groundwork for extending these concepts to QCD and future collider phenomenology.

Title: Observation of the Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Pilot-Wave Hydrodynamics
Authors: Georgi Gary Rozenman, Kyle I. McKee, Arnaud Lazarus, Valeri Frumkin, John W M Bush
Abstract: We report the results of an experimental study of an analog of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect achieved with the hydrodynamic pilot-wave system. A walking droplet is confined to an annular cavity that encircles a shielded vortex, but lies outside its range of direct influence. While there is no vortex-induced flow in the immediate vicinity of the droplets, the vortex modifies the droplet's spatially extended pilot-wave field that guides its motion, producing a vortex-dependent bias in the droplet's orbital speed. High-speed tracking and delay-embedding reconstructions yield Wigner-like phase-space distributions for this hydrodynamic system that exhibits a rigid, flux-dependent translation, providing a force-free, gauge-like realization of an AB-type phase.

Title: Hamilton-Jacobi as model reduction, extension to Newtonian particle mechanics, and a wave mechanical curiosity
Authors: Amit Acharya
Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics is approached as a model reduction of conservative particle mechanics where the velocity degrees-of-freedom are eliminated. This viewpoint allows an extension of the association of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation from conservative systems to general Newtonian particle systems involving non-conservative forces, including dissipative ones. A geometric optics approximation leads to a dissipative Schrödinger equation, with the expected limiting form when the associated classical force system involves conservative forces.

Title: Universality of equilibration dynamics after quantum quenches
Authors: Vincenzo Alba, Sanam Azarnia, Gianluca Lagnese, Federico Rottoli
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix (entanglement spectrum) after a global quantum quench. We show that in an appropriate scaling limit the lower part of the entanglement spectrum exhibits ``universality''. In the scaling limit and at asymptotically long times the distribution of the entanglement spectrum depends on two parameters that can be determined from the Rényi entropies. We show that two typical scenarios occur. In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas. We benchmark our analytical results in free-fermion chains, such as the transverse field Ising chain and the XX chain, in the rule 54 chain, and in Bethe ansatz solvable spin models.

Title: Auxiliary-assisted energy distillation from quantum batteries
Authors: Paranjoy Chaki, Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Kornikar Sen, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: We discuss the idea of extracting energy from a quantum battery, applying a projective measurement on an auxiliary system. The battery is initially connected to the auxiliary system and allowed to interact with it. After some time, we execute a measurement on the auxiliary system which probabilistically projects the setup to a particular state, and the corresponding state of the battery is the final state. We consider the sum of the product of the energy difference between the initial and final states of the battery with the probability of getting that final state, where the sum is taken over all the preferable outcomes, that is, the outcomes which reduce the energy of the battery. We define the maximum value of this quantity as the distillable energy, where the maximization is taken over the time of interaction and auxiliary state and measurement basis parameters. Restricting ourselves to a particular uncountable set of states, we find that distillable energy is always higher than the ergotropy of the battery, irrespective of the presence or absence of entanglement between battery and auxiliary. We also compare the distillable energy with the energy extracted using the interaction between the battery and the auxiliary, without any measurements. In comparison with the measurement-free scenario, we show that while measurement-based protocols do not provide any enhancement in the amount of extractable energy, they do yield a distinct advantage in terms of power, most notably in the case of distillable power, surpassing the power obtained without measurements.

Title: The Spectral Amplitude Principle for Dynamics of Quantum Neural Networks
Authors: Yi-hang Xu, Dan-Bo Zhang, Junchi Yan
Abstract: The mechanism governing the training dynamics of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) remains under-explored. In classical Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), training is dominated by "Spectral Bias," i.e. prioritizing learning low-frequency components and struggle for high-frequency details. In this work, we theoretically and empirically identify a distinct mechanism in QNNs, which we term Spectral Amplitude Priority. By analyzing the frequency-domain gradients and residual dynamics via the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK), we prove that QNN training is governed primarily by the magnitude of spectral components rather than their frequency indices. Consequently, QNNs can efficiently capture high-frequency functions-provided they have significant amplitude-thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of their classical counterparts. We validate this principle on both synthetic high-frequency functions and quantum-advantage tasks. The results show that QNNs significantly outperform DNNs in high-frequency tasks, offering an explanation for QNNs' superior expressivity in complex spectral landscapes.

Title: Agnostic Process Tomography
Authors: Chirag Wadhwa, Laura Lewis, Elham Kashefi, Mina Doosti
Abstract: Characterizing a quantum system by learning its state or evolution is a fundamental problem in quantum physics and learning theory with a myriad of applications. Recently, as a new approach to this problem, the task of agnostic state tomography was defined, in which one aims to approximate an arbitrary quantum state by a simpler one in a given class. Generalizing this notion to quantum processes, we initiate the study of agnostic process tomography: given query access to an unknown quantum channel $\Phi$ and a known concept class $\mathcal{C}$ of channels, output a quantum channel that approximates $\Phi$ as well as any channel in the concept class $\mathcal{C}$, up to some error. In this work, we propose several natural applications for this new task in quantum machine learning, quantum metrology, classical simulation, and error mitigation. In addition, we give efficient agnostic process tomography algorithms for a wide variety of concept classes, including Pauli strings, Pauli channels, quantum junta channels, low-degree channels, and a class of channels produced by $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits. The main technical tool we use is Pauli spectrum analysis of operators and superoperators. We also prove that, using ancilla qubits, any agnostic state tomography algorithm can be extended to one solving agnostic process tomography for a compatible concept class of unitaries, immediately giving us efficient agnostic learning algorithms for Clifford circuits, Clifford circuits with few T gates, and circuits consisting of a tensor product of single-qubit gates. Together, our results provide insight into the conditions and new algorithms necessary to extend the learnability of a concept class from the standard tomographic setting to the agnostic one.

Title: Practical limitations of the switching theorem for adiabatic state preparation
Authors: Thomas D. Cohen, Andrew Li, Hyunwoo Oh, Maneesha Sushama Pradeep
Abstract: The viability of adiabatic quantum computation depends on the slow evolution of the Hamiltonian. The adiabatic switching theorem provides an asymptotic series for error estimates in $1/T$, based on the lowest non-zero derivative of the Hamiltonian and its eigenvalues at the endpoints. Modifications at the endpoints in practical implementations can modify this scaling behavior, suggesting opportunities for error reduction by altering endpoint behavior while keeping intermediate evolution largely unchanged. Such modifications can significantly reduce errors for long evolution times, but they may also require exceedingly long timescales to reach the hyperadiabatic regime, limiting their practicality. This paper explores the transition between the adiabatic and hyperadiabatic regimes in simple low-dimensional Hamiltonians, highlighting the impact of modifications of the endpoints on approaching the asymptotic behavior described by the switching theorem.

Title: How Far do Lindbladians Go?
Authors: Jihong Cai, Advith Govindarajan, Marius Junge
Abstract: We study controllability of finite-dimensional open quantum systems under a general Markovian control model combining full coherent (unitary) control with tunable dissipative channels. Assuming the Hamiltonian controls is a Hörmander system that generate $\mathfrak{su}(n)$, we ask how little dissipation suffices to make the full state space $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})$ controllable. We show that minimal non-unital noise can break unitary-orbit invariants and, in many cases, a very small set of jump operators yields transitivity on $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})$. For multi-qubit systems we prove explicit transitivity results for natural resources such as a single-qubit amplitude-damping jump together with a dephasing channel, and we identify obstructions when only self-adjoint jump operators are available (yielding only unital evolutions). We further develop a geometric viewpoint and ask the ``lifting'' question: when can a path of densities be obtained from applying a time-dependent family of Lindbladian to an initial state? For this, we have to analyze the tangent structure of the ``manifold with corners'' and how this tangent structure reflects Lindbldian evolution. Building on this framework, we derive reachability criteria and no-go results based on a norm-decrease alignment condition, including a geometric obstruction arising from the incompatibility between admissible tangent directions and dissipative contraction.

Title: Exponential advantage in quantum sensing of correlated parameters
Authors: Sridhar Prabhu, Vladimir Kremenetski, Saeed A. Khan, Ryotatsu Yanagimoto, Peter L. McMahon
Abstract: Conventionally in quantum sensing, the goal is to estimate one or more unknown parameters that are assumed to be deterministic - that is, they do not change between shots of the quantum-sensing protocol. We instead consider the setting where the parameters are stochastic: each shot of the quantum-sensing protocol senses parameter values that come from independent random draws. In this work, we explore three examples where the stochastic parameters are correlated and show how using entanglement provides a benefit in classification or estimation tasks: (1) a two-parameter classification task, for which there is an advantage in the low-shot regime; (2) an $N$-parameter estimation task and a classification variant of it, for which an entangled sensor requires just a constant number (independent of $N$) shots to achieve the same accuracy as an unentangled sensor using exponentially many (${\sim}2^N$) shots; (3) classifying the magnetization of a spin chain in thermal equilibrium, where the individual spins fluctuate but the total spin in one direction is conserved - this gives a practical setting in which stochastic parameters are correlated in a way that an entangled sensor can be designed to exploit. We also present a theoretical framework for assessing, for a given choice of entangled sensing protocol and distributions to discriminate between, how much advantage the entangled sensor would have over an unentangled sensor. Our work motivates the further study of sensing correlated stochastic parameters using entangled quantum sensors - and since classical sensors by definition cannot be entangled, our work shows the possibility for entangled quantum sensors to achieve an exponential advantage in sample complexity over classical sensors, in contrast to the typical quadratic advantage.

Title: Resource-efficient Variational Compilation of Block-Encodings
Authors: Leon Rullkötter, Sebastian Weber, Vamshi Mohan Katukuri, Christian Tutschku, Bharadwaj Chowdary Mummaneni
Abstract: Block-encoding operators are one of the essential components in quantum algorithms based on Quantum Signal Processing. Their gate complexity largely determines the overall gate complexity of the full algorithm. Using variational methods, we compile single-ancilla block-encoding unitaries with near-optimal resource requirements for a large range of input matrices. We find that the number of variational parameters in the parameterized quantum circuit approaches the number of free parameters in the input matrices, depending on whether they are real, complex and/or hermitian. Additionally, symmetries present in the input matrix can be incorporated into the ansatz circuit, reducing the parameter count further and enhancing optimizability. While performing a variational compilation of block-encodings ceases to be computationally feasible for large system sizes, the constructed operators can be used as components of larger block-encodings via a linear combination of block-encodings.

Title: Shallow quantum circuit for generating extremely low-entangled approximate state designs
Authors: Wonjun Lee, Minki Hhan, Gil Young Cho, Hyukjoon Kwon
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. We discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, from which almost all quantum states can be efficiently certified by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and classical post-processing time.

Title: Interference between lossy quantum evolutions activates information backflow
Authors: Sutapa Saha, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: Quantum evolutions are often non-unitary and in such cases, they are frequently regarded as lossy. Such lossiness, however, does not necessarily persist throughout the evolution, and there can often be intermediate time-spans during which information ebbs in the environment to re-flood the system -- an event known as information backflow. This phenomenon serves as a well-established and sufficient indicator of non-Markovian behavior of open quantum dynamics. Nevertheless, not all non-Markovian dynamics exhibit such backflow. We find that when interference is allowed between two quantum evolutions that individually generate non-Markovianity and yet do not exhibit information backflow, it becomes possible to retrieve information from the environment. Furthermore, we show that this setup involving coherently-controlled quantum operation trajectories provides enhanced performance and is more robust compared to an alternate coherently-controlled arrangement of the quantum switch.

Title: $\bf A^2$-robust superradiant phase transition in hybrid qubit-cavity optomechanics
Authors: Gang Liu, Wei Xiong
Abstract: The $\mathbf{A}^2$ term presents a fundamental challenge to realizing the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system enabling SPT regardless of the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term. The system consist of a qubit, a mechanical mode, and an optical cavity, where the qubit and mechanical mode constitute a quantum Rabi model, while the mechanical mode and cavity form an optomechanical system. Crucially, the auxiliary cavity introduces a switchable $\mathbf{A}^2$ term that effectively counteracts or even fully eliminates the original $\mathbf{A}^2$ effect. This allows controllable observation of SPT, diagnosed via the second-order equal-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ of phonons. Furthermore, the auxiliary cavity exponentially reduces the critical coupling strength, significantly relaxing experimental requirements. In addition, we show that phonons in the normal phase display bunching, but coherent in the superradiant phase. Interestingly, higher-order squeezing is found in both phases, with near-perfect higher-order squeezing achieved at the SPT point, establishing it as a probe for SPT behavior. Our work demonstrates that hybridizing optomechanics and cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a promising route to accessing SPT physics in the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term.

Title: Exponentially Enhanced Tripartite Coupling in Quantum Nonlinear Magnonics
Authors: Xue-Chun Chen, Zi-Jie Wang, Sheng-Bo Zheng, Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong
Abstract: Strong and controllable tripartite interactions play a pivotal role in quantum information and nonlinear quantum optics, yet challenging to realize. In this work, we propose a hybrid system consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to Kerr magnons (magnons with Kerr nonlinearity) in two yttrium-iron-garnet spheres. By adiabatically eliminating the ground state of the NV qutrit in the dispersive regime, an effective tripartite interaction among magnons and an NV qubit encoded in its excited states is obtained. In the strong driving limit, Kerr magnons can be linearized and give rise to degenerate parametric amplification for squeezing magnons. As a result, both the tripartite interaction and cooperativity are exponentially enhanced twice, which is about $\exp(\xi)$ times than schemes only involving single-squeezing. Hence, our proposal is more experimentally feasible because modest squeezing parameter is sufficient. With this amplified tripartite coupling strength, the system dynamics are greatly accelerated, leading to fast generation of tripartite entanglement. In addition, noise-resilient perfect magnon blockade can be achieved, well predicted by both the analytical approach and numerical simulation with quantum master equation. Our results suggest that the NV center represents a promising interface for engineering many-body interactions in quantum magnonics, offering a versatile platform for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena such as entanglement and correlations.

Title: Hybrid-Integrated InGaAs/InP SPAD Arrays for Quantum Communications
Authors: Joseph A. Dolphin, Rosemary O. E. Scowen, Louise M. Wells, David J. P. Ellis, Abbie L. Lowe, Benjamin Ramsay, J. Iwan Davies, Andrew J. Shields, Taofiq K. Paraiso, R. Mark Stevenson
Abstract: Photonic integration is a promising route to miniaturise the hardware of quantum key distribution (QKD), yet the monolithic integration of single photon detectors remains a significant challenge. QKD receiver chips integrating superconducting detectors have been demonstrated, but their requirement for cryogenic cooling restricts their practical applications. High-frequency gated single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) provide a mature non-cryogenic alternative and their fabrication into compact arrays would enable scalable hybrid integration. However, this faces several challenges related to efficient GHz array gating, inter-pixel crosstalk, and scalable waveguide coupling, which to date remain unaddressed. Here, we overcome the key challenges and develop GHz-gated InGaAs/InP SPAD arrays with performance viable for QKD and negligible inter-pixel crosstalk. We combine the arrays with low-loss silica waveguide chips to produce compact hybrid QKD receivers and perform BB84 protocol experiments, achieving secure key rates over 2 Mbps at short distances and 15 kbps over 100 km of fibre. Our work provides a method for flexible and scalable integration of waveguide-coupled SPADs for quantum information processing applications.

Title: Ergotropic advantage in a measurement-fueled quantum heat engine
Authors: Sidhant Jakhar, Ramandeep S. Johal
Abstract: This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the proposal of Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] where the role of a hot reservoir in a four-stroke cycle was replaced by a quantum measurement apparatus, the other steps being two quantum adiabatic strokes and thermalization with a cold reservoir. We propose a five-stroke cycle, where an ergotropy extracting stroke is introduced following the measurement stroke, and study the effect of measurements of different spin components on the performance of the machine. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine ( {without the adiabatic strokes}) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate, for specific cases (e.g. x-x), a definite ordering may be obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.

Title: Circuit-based characterization of finite-temperature quantum phases and self-correcting quantum memory
Authors: Ruochen Ma, Vedika Khemani, Shengqi Sang
Abstract: Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition, which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.

Title: Simultaneous Quantization and Reduction of Constrained Systems
Authors: Jianhao M. Yang
Abstract: We present a novel framework for quantizing constrained quantum systems in which the processes of quantization and constraint enforcement are performed simultaneously. The approach is based on an extension of the stationary action principle, incorporating an information-theoretic term arising from vacuum fluctuations. Constraints are included directly in the Lagrangian via Lagrange multipliers, allowing the subsequent variational procedure to yield the quantum dynamics without ambiguity regarding the order of quantization and reduction. We demonstrate the method through two examples: (i) a one-dimensional system with vanishing local momentum, where the simultaneous approach produces the time-independent Schrödinger equation while conventional reduced and Dirac quantization yield only trivial states, and (ii) a bipartite system with global translational invariance, where all three methods agree. These results show that the proposed framework generalizes standard quantization schemes and provides a consistent treatment of systems with constraints that cannot be expressed as linear operators acting on the wave function. In addition to a unified variational principle for constrained quantum systems, the formalism also offers an information-theoretic perspective on quantum effects arising from vacuum fluctuations.

Title: Dynamics of Majorana zero modes across hybrid Kitaev chain
Authors: Rajiv Kumar, Rohit Kumar Shukla, Levan Chotorlishvili, Sunil Kumar Mishra
Abstract: The Kitaev chain has been extensively explored in the context of uniform couplings, with studies focusing either on purely nearest-neighbor interactions or on systems dominated by long-range superconducting pairing. Building on these investigations, we introduce a hybrid Kitaev chain in which the lattice is partitioned into two segments: the left segment comprises nearest-neighbor couplings, while the right segment incorporates long-range pairing. To probe the role of the interface, we study two scenarios: a decoupled (suppressed hopping) case, where the segments are isolated, and a coupled case, where they are connected via interface hopping that enables tunneling. Using this setup, we investigate the behavior of Majorana zero modes at the interface between the two segments, finding that in the decoupled case, Majorana zero modes remain sharply localized at the left segment chain edges while massive Dirac modes remain in right segment chain edges, with their energies and localization strongly dependent on the long-range pairing exponent. Introducing a finite interface coupling enables transfer of Majorana zero modes from the edges of the left segment to those of the right segment of the chain. We characterize this dynamics by the fidelity of state transfer, dynamical rotation, and inverse participation ratio. We show the signature of Majorana zero mode transfer across the interface by the spatiotemporal profile of the probability distribution of the time evolved state.

Title: Quadratically Shallow Quantum Circuits for Hamiltonian Functions
Authors: Youngjun Park, Minhyeok Kang, Chae-Yeun Park, Joonsuk Huh
Abstract: Many quantum algorithms for ground-state preparation and energy estimation require the implementation of high-degree polynomials of a Hamiltonian to achieve better convergence rates. Their circuit implementation typically relies on quantum signal processing (QSP), whose circuit depth is proportional to the degree of the polynomial. Previous studies exploit the Chebyshev polynomial approximation, which requires a Chebyshev series of degree $O(\sqrt{n\ln(1/\delta)})$ for an $n$-degree polynomial, where $\delta$ is the approximation error. However, the approximation is limited to only a few functions, including monomials, truncated exponential, Gaussian, and error functions. In this work, we present the most generalized function approximation methods for $\delta$-approximating linear combinations or products of polynomial-approximable functions with quadratically reduced-degree polynomials. We extend the list of polynomial-approximable functions by showing that the functions of cosine and sine can also be $\delta$-approximated by quadratically reduced-degree Laurent polynomials. We demonstrate that various Hamiltonian functions for quantum ground-state preparation and energy estimation can be implemented with quadratically shallow circuits.

Title: Robust Non-Adiabatic Holonomic Gating in Qutrits via Inverse-Engineered Pulse Shaping and Error Compensation
Authors: Jie Lu, Jie-Dong Huang, Yang Qian, Ying Yan, Zhi-Guo Huang, Ji-Ze Han
Abstract: Systematic control errors, specifically Rabi frequency fluctuations and frequency detuning, constitute a primary bottleneck for high-fidelity quantum gates across leading platforms. In this work, we present a robust pulse engineering framework for non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computing (NHQC) in qutrit systems, combining inverse engineering with time-dependent perturbation theory. We derive analytical conditions for pulse shaping that intrinsically eliminate second-order Rabi errors. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that second-order detuning errors are fundamentally linked to the accumulated population in the auxiliary excited state, making them impossible to eliminate in a single loop. To overcome this, we introduce a compensation pulse strategy that rigorously cancels these residual errors. Although this composite scheme doubles the gate duration, we demonstrate that the suppression of systematic errors yields a significant net gain in fidelity, achieving values exceeding 99.9% under realistic experimental imperfections ($\epsilon=0.2$, $\delta=2~\text{MHz}$). This framework provides a rigorous and experimentally feasible pathway for high-fidelity quantum control in superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and neutral atom systems.

Title: Forecasting Quantum Observables: A Compressed Sensing Approach with Performance Guarantees
Authors: Víctor Valls, Albert Akhriev, Olatz Sanz Larrarte, Javier Oliva del Moral, Štěpán Šmíd, Josu Etxezarreta Martinez, Sergiy Zhuk, Dmytro Mishagli
Abstract: Data-driven extrapolation methods aim to extend the dynamics of quantum observables from measurements, but they often lack guarantees on prediction accuracy. We introduce a framework based on atomic norm minimization that can certify whether the spectral model learned by a forecasting algorithm -- i.e., Bohr frequencies and amplitudes -- is consistent with unitary quantum time evolution. Certification holds when the dynamics are governed by a small number of well-separated Bohr frequencies. We validate the approach on multiple forecasting algorithms applied to spin-chain Hamiltonians with 8-20 sites. Comparing with exact diagonalization, certified models yield an average forecasting error below 0.1 (observable range $[-1, 1]$) in 97% of cases and below 0.05 in 91-99% of cases. Even in the presence of realistic shot noise, certified models remain robust at the 0.1 error threshold.

Title: Certifying the dimensionality of any quantum channel with minimal assumptions
Authors: Saheli Mukherjee, Bivas Mallick, Pratik Ghosal
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement offers significant advantages over low-dimensional ones in various information-processing tasks. However, to harness these advantages, it is crucial that the quantum channels used to store or transmit the subsystems of an entangled system not only preserve entanglement but also maintain its dimensionality above a certain threshold. The maximum entanglement dimension that a channel can preserve is referred to as its effective dimensionality, since the channel cannot be used to transmit information of dimension greater than that in a single use. In this work, we present a method to certify whether a quantum channel can preserve entanglement dimension above a given threshold. Unlike existing approaches, our method is faithful, i.e., it can be applied to any channel, and avoids common assumptions such as reliable preparation of entangled states, auxiliary side channels, or perfect measurement devices. Moreover, the method can be extended to faithfully certify other classes of non-resource-breaking channels, such as non-NPT-breaking channels. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our certification scheme through explicit examples.

Title: Single-Operation Rydberg Phase Gates via Dynamic Population Suppression
Authors: Sebastian C. Carrasco, Jabir Chathanathil, Svetlana A. Malinovskaya, Ignacio Sola, Vladimir S. Malinovsky
Abstract: We propose a versatile control protocol based on modulated zero-pulse-area fields that dynamically suppresses Rydberg excitation while retaining Rydberg-Rydberg interactions as an entangling phase resource. This mechanism enables single-step, perfectly entangling phase gates for arbitrary blockade strengths, eliminating finite-blockade errors even when the Rabi frequency approaches or exceeds the interaction energy. The approach defines a new operational regime for Rydberg-blockade quantum logic in which speed, fidelity, and robustness are achieved simultaneously within a simple dynamical framework. Owing to its simplicity and generality, the technique is compatible with a wide range of neutral-atom architectures and offers a promising route toward scalable, high-fidelity quantum computation and simulation.

Title: Characterizing Kadison--Schwarz maps on $M_3$
Authors: Adam Rutkowski
Abstract: Kadison--Schwarz (KS) maps form a natural class of positive linear maps lying tweet positivity and complete positivity. Despite their relevance in quantum dynamics and operator algebras, a detailed analytic characterization of KS maps is still largely lacking. In this work we analyze unital linear maps on $M_3$ using the Bloch--Gell--Mann representation. Exploiting unitary equivalence and structural properties of the $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ algebra, we derive explicit analytic conditions ensuring the Kadison--Schwarz property. Our approach clarifies the relation between KS maps and completely positive maps on $M_3$.

Title: Hardware-aware and Resource-efficient Circuit Packing and Scheduling on Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers
Authors: Miguel Palma, Shuwen Kan, Wenqi Wei, Juntao Chen, Kaixun Hua, Sara Mouradian, Ying Mao
Abstract: The rapid expansion of quantum cloud services has led to long job queues due to single-tenant execution models that underutilize hardware resources. Quantum multi-programming (QMP) mitigates this by executing multiple circuits in parallel on a single device, but existing methods target superconducting systems with limited connectivity, high crosstalk, and lower gate fidelity. Trapped-ion architectures, with all-to-all connectivity, long coherence times, and high-fidelity mid-circuit measurement properties, presents itself as a more suitable platform for scalable QMP. We present CircPack, a hardware-aware circuit packing framework designed for modular trapped-ion devices based on the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture. CircPack formulates static circuit scheduling as a two-dimensional packing problem with hardware-specific shuttling constraints. Compared to superconducting-based QMP approaches, CircPack achieves up to 70.72% better fidelity, 62.67% higher utilization, and 32.80% improved layer reduction. This framework is also capable of scalable, balanced scheduling across a cluster of independent QCCD modules, highlighting trapped-ion systems' potential in improving the throughput of quantum cloud computing in the near future.

Title: Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations
Authors: Kazue Kudo
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.

Abstract: This document explores the potential of quantum computing in Thermal Science. Conceived as a living document, it will be continuously updated with experimental findings and insights for the research community in Thermal Science. By experiments, we refer both to the search for the most effective algorithms and to the performance of real quantum hardware. Those are fields that are evolving rapidly, driving a technological race to define the best architectures. The development of novel algorithms for engineering problems aims at harnessing the unique strengths of quantum computing. Expectations are high, as users seek concrete evidence of quantum supremacy - a true game changer for engineering applications. Among all heat transfer mechanisms (conduction, convection, radiation), we start with conduction as a paradigmatic test case in the field being characterized by a rich mathematical foundation for our investigations.

Title: Experimental Observation of Single- and Multisite Matter-Wave Solitons in an Optical Accordion Lattice
Authors: Robbie Cruickshank, Francesco Lorenzi, Arthur La Rooij, Ethan F. Kerr, Timon Hilker, Stefan Kuhr, Luca Salasnich, Elmar Haller
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multisite solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies of transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.

Title: Relativistic orbital-free kinetic energy density functional for one-particle nuclear systems
Authors: X. H. Wu, Z. X. Ren, H. Z. Liang, P. W. Zhao
Abstract: This letter aims to derive the exact relativistic orbital-free kinetic energy density functional for one-particle nuclear systems in one-dimensional case. The kinetic energy is expressed as a functional of both vector and scalar densities. The functional derivatives of the kinetic energy density functional are also derived. Both the kinetic energy density functional and its functional derivatives are validated to be correct. This serves as a foundation for further exploration of more general relativistic orbital-free kinetic energy density functionals.

Title: Fault-tolerant dynamically-decoupled hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy of ultra-narrow clock transitions
Authors: T. Zanon-Willette, B. Ilikj, D. Wilkowski, B. Darquié, N.V. Vitanov
Abstract: Hyper-Ramsey protocols effectively reduce AC-Stark shifts in probing ultra-narrow optical clock transitions but they remain sensitive to laser intensity noise, decoherence, frequency drifts, and low-frequency perturbations. We address these limitations by incorporating dynamical decoupling, using sequences of rotary Hahn-echo pulses that toggle the probe frequency detuning and phase between opposite signs. Implementing time-optimized Eulerian cycling circuits of multiple refocusing pulses, we generate high-contrast hyper-Ramsey interferences that are completely free from AC-Stark shifts and robust against environmental noise and laser probe parameters imperfections. We demonstrate the robustness of our dynamically-decoupled hyper-Ramsey interrogation scheme by implementing it directly at the pulse level on a superconducting quantum processing unit. Fault tolerant dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks are a significant step toward universal, noise resilient quantum sensors, enabling fault-tolerant metrology for searches about new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Title: Impact of a Reflecting Material on a Search for Neutron--Antineutron Oscillations using Ultracold Neutrons
Authors: Hiroyuki Fujioka, Takashi Higuchi
Abstract: We investigate neutron--antineutron oscillations of ultracold neutrons in a storage bottle represented by a one-dimensional potential. The experimental sensitivity is determined by the annihilation rate of antineutrons. Its dependence on the antineutron reflectivity and the relative phase shift between the neutron and the antineutron wavefunctions by a reflection from the wall is derived. Optimization of the antineutron pseudopotential was found crucial to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment. Furthermore, methods are discussed for determining the antineutron pseudopotential, which has only been studied indirectly thus far.

Title: Topological characterization of phase transitions and critical edge states in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry
Authors: Longwen Zhou, Rujia Jing, Shenlin Wu
Abstract: Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.

Title: Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes
Authors: Ethan Abraham
Abstract: While the Marcus theory of electron transfer defines the reorganization energy as a classical quantity, recent work has shown for the first time that the reorganization energy is actually a quantum mechanical object that depends on the electronic coupling. We extend this picture and show that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.

Title: Holographic Tensor Networks as Tessellations of Geometry
Authors: Qiang Wen, Mingshuai Xu, Haocheng Zhong
Abstract: Holographic tensor networks serve as toy models for the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, capturing many of its essential features in a concrete manner. However, existing holographic tensor network models remain far from a complete theory of quantum gravity. A key obstacle is their discrete structure, which only approximates the semi-classical geometry of gravity in a qualitative sense. In \cite{Lin:2024dho}, it was shown that a network of partial-entanglement-entropy (PEE) threads, which are bulk geodesics with a specific density distribution, generates a perfect tessellation of AdS space. Moreover, such PEE-network tessellations can be constructed for more general geometries using the Crofton formula. In this paper, we assign a quantum state to each vertex in the PEE network and develop two holographic tensor network models: the factorized PEE tensor network, which takes the form of a tensor product of EPR pairs, and the random PEE tensor network. In both models we reproduce the exact Ryu-Takayanagi formula by showing that the minimal number of cuts along a homologous surface in the network exactly computes the area of this surface.
