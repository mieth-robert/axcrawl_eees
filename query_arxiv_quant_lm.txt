Title: The Quantum Ratio
Authors: Kenichi Konishi, Hans-Thomas Elze
Abstract: The concept of the Quantum Ratio was born out of the efforts to find a simple but universal criterion if the center of mass (CM) of an isolated (microscopic or macroscopic) body behaves quantum mechanically or classically, and under which conditions. It is defined as the ratio between the quantum fluctuation range, which is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, and the linear size of the body (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases where the ratio is smaller than unity or much larger than unity, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. An important notion following from the introduction of quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical. This is so even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence (mixed state) and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation is further elaborated, by analyzing some atomic or molecular processes. It may have far-reaching implications on the way quantum mechanics works, e.g., in biological systems.

Title: Exploring the Potential of QEEGNet for Cross-Task and Cross-Dataset Electroencephalography Encoding with Quantum Machine Learning
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Huan-Hsin Tseng
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in neuroscience and clinical research for analyzing brain activity. While deep learning models such as EEGNet have shown success in decoding EEG signals, they often struggle with data complexity, inter-subject variability, and noise robustness. Recent advancements in quantum machine learning (QML) offer new opportunities to enhance EEG analysis by leveraging quantum computing's unique properties. In this study, we extend the previously proposed Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a hybrid neural network incorporating quantum layers into EEGNet, to investigate its generalization ability across multiple EEG datasets. Our evaluation spans a diverse set of cognitive and motor task datasets, assessing QEEGNet's performance in different learning scenarios. Experimental results reveal that while QEEGNet demonstrates competitive performance and maintains robustness in certain datasets, its improvements over traditional deep learning methods remain inconsistent. These findings suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures require further optimization to fully leverage quantum advantages in EEG processing. Despite these limitations, our study provides new insights into the applicability of QML in EEG research and highlights challenges that must be addressed for future advancements.

Title: The concept of minimal dissipation and the identification of work in autonomous systems: A view from classical statistical physics
Authors: Anja Seegebrecht, Tanja Schilling
Abstract: Recently, the concept of minimal dissipation has been brought forward as a means to define work performed on open quantum systems [Phys. Rev. A 105, 052216 (2022)]. We discuss this concept from the point of view of projection operator formalisms in classical statistical physics. We analyse an autonomous composite system which consists of a system and an environment in the most general sense (i.e. we neither impose conditions on the coupling between system and environment nor on the properties of the environment). One condition any useful definition of work needs to fulfill is that it reproduces the thermodynamic notion of work in the limit of weak coupling to an environment that has infinite heat capacity. We propose a projection operator route to a definition of work that reaches this limit and we discuss its relation to minimal dissipation.

Title: Fast Scrambling in Hyperbolic Ising Model
Authors: Goksu Can Toga, Abhishek Samlodia, Alexander F. Kemper
Abstract: We investigate many-body chaos and scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising model, a mixed-field Ising model living in the background of AdS2. The effect of the curvature is captured by site-dependent couplings obtained from the AdS2 metric applied to a flat nearest neighbor spin chain. We show that this model with only local site-dependent nearest neighbor interactions is maximally chaotic, can be classified as a fast scrambler, and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound on chaos for a certain set of parameters, thus making this model one of the few if not the only example where such fast scrambling behavior has been seen without all-to-all or long-range interactions. Moreover, the modest resources needed to simulate this model make it an ideal test-bed for studying scrambling and chaos on quantum computers.

Title: Universality in the Anticoncentration of Chaotic Quantum Circuits
Authors: Arman Sauliere, Beatrice Magni, Guglielmo Lami, Xhek Turkeshi, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: We establish universal behavior in the anticoncentration properties of random quantum circuits, demonstrating its broad independence from the circuit architecture. Specifically, universality emerges in a certain scaling limit and extends beyond the leading order, incorporating subleading corrections arising from the finite system size $N$. We compute these corrections through exact calculations on ensembles of random tensor network states and corroborate the results with analytical findings in the random phase model. We then identify a heuristic framework for generic brickwork circuits, conjecturing the universality of these corrections. We further support our claim of anticoncentration universality through extensive numerical simulations, capturing the distribution of overlaps for systems up to $N = 64$ qudits and computing collision probabilities for systems up to $N \leq 1024$. Collectively, our results highlight the critical role of finite-size corrections and lead to a thorough understanding of the core phenomenology governing anticoncentration in quantum circuits.

Title: Quantum illumination via frequency-mode-based correlation-to-displacement conversion
Authors: Xin Chen, Zhibin Ye
Abstract: Quantum illumination leverages entanglement to surpass classical target detection, even in high-noise environments. Remarkably, its quantum advantage persists despite entanglement degradation caused by environmental decoherence. A central challenge lies in designing optimal receivers to exploit this advantage, with the correlation-to-displacement conversion module emerging as a promising candidate. However, the practical implementation of the conversion module faces technical hurdles, primarily due to the vast number of modes involved. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a frequency-mode entangled source with matched photon numbers, a heterodyne detection scheme for the returned signals across vast modes, and a cavity-enhanced quantum pulse gate for programmable mode processing. This integrated framework paves the way for the realization of practical quantum illumination systems.

Title: Broadband pulsed quadrature measurements with calorimeters
Authors: Ezad Shojaee, James R. van Meter, Karl Mayer, Scott Glancy, Emanuel Knill
Abstract: A general one-dimensional quantum optical mode is described by a shape in the time or frequency domain. A fundamental problem is to measure a quadrature operator of such a mode. If the shape is narrow in frequency this can be done by pulsed homodyne detection, in which the mode and a matched local oscillator (LO) interfere on a beamsplitter, whose output ports are monitored by photo-detectors. The quadrature value is proportional to the difference between the photo-detectors' signals. When the shape of the mode is broad in frequency, the lack of uniform response of the detectors across the spectrum prevents direct application of this technique. We show that pulsed homodyne detection can be generalized to broadband pulsed (BBP) homodyne detection setups with detectors such as calorimeters that detect total energy instead of total number of photons. This generalization has applications in quantum measurements of femtosecond pulses, and, speculatively, measurements of Rindler modes to verify the temperature of Unruh radiation. Like pulsed homodyne detection, BBP homodyne detection requires choosing the LO pulse such that the subtracted signal approaches the desired quadrature measurement for large LO amplitudes. A distinctive feature of the technique is that the LO pulse does not belong to the mode of the quadrature being measured. We analyze how the implemented measurement approaches an ideal quadrature measurement with growing LO amplitude. We prove that the moments of the measurement converge to the moments of the quadrature and that the measurement distributions converge weakly.

Title: Observation and mitigation of microwave echoes from dielectric defects in Josephson traveling wave amplifiers
Authors: Matteo Boselli, Joel Grebel, Ambroise Peugeot, Rémy Dassonneville, Benjamin Huard, Audrey Bienfait
Abstract: Amplifying microwave signals with a noise close to the minimum imposed by quantum mechanics is now routinely performed with superconducting quantum devices. In particular, Josephson-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPA) have shown record bandwidth with added noise close to the quantum limit. In this work, we report the appearance of echo signals emitted by JTWPAs driven by trains of high-power pulses exceeding their dynamical range. we explore the case of weak signals generated through high power pulses. By sending a train of such high-power pulses, beyond the 1 dB compression point of such amplifiers, we observe the appearance of echoes, solely due to the JTWPA. These echoes have micro-second coherence and we attribute their origin to microscopic defects in the amplifier dielectric layer. By analyzing the power and the coherence of the echo signal as a function of temperature, we estimate the dielectric loss brought by these defects, and their impact on the JTWPA quantum efficiency. We introduce a mitigation technique (BLAST) to prevent the appearance of these echoes, consisting in an additional high-power tone sent concurrently with each pulse. We demonstrate that it suppresses the spurious defect signals and we recover the typical gain and noise figure within 95% of their low-power values in 300 ns. These results can help to extend the use of JTWPAs in experiments where fast high-power sequences are necessary to generate weak microwave responses from the system under study, and also provide a path towards characterizing in-situ the dielectric losses of these devices.

Title: A Framework for Analyzing the Scalability of Ion Trap Geometries
Authors: Le Minh Anh Nguyen, Brant Bowers, Sara Mouradian
Abstract: A utility-scale trapped-ion quantum information processor will require millions of qubits controlled with fast and high-fidelity gates. Achievable ion number, gate speed, and gate fidelity are all influenced by the trapping field, which depends on the electrode geometry. Here we identify a set of key field-dependent figures of merit: harmonicity of the trapping potential, radial trapping frequency, and trap depth. We also consider fabrication requirements and the path towards integration of peripherals. We apply this framework to three types of traps: a standard surface trap, a surface trap with a grounded top wafer, and a trap with two stacked identical patterned wafers with cross-alignment of rf and dc electrodes. We determine that purely 2D surface traps lack the necessary field properties for large-scale quantum technologies due to their shallow trap depth and low harmonicity. Moving to 3D geometries will be essential to achieve higher radial confinement, better harmonicity, and therefore lower power dissipation. This framework can be applied to future work in designing and demonstrating scalable electrode geometries for trapped-ion quantum information processing.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimisation of Traveling Salesperson Problem
Authors: Christos Lytrosyngounis, Ioannis Lytrosyngounis
Abstract: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimisation challenge with widespread applications in logistics, operations research, and network design. While classical algorithms effectively solve small to medium-sized instances, they struggle with scalability due to exponential complexity. In this work, we present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that leverages IBM's Qiskit Runtime to integrate quantum optimisation techniques with classical machine learning methods, specifically K-Means clustering and Random Forest classifiers. These machine learning components aid in problem decomposition and noise mitigation, improving the quality of quantum solutions. Experimental results for TSP instances ranging from 4 to 8 cities reveal that the quantum-only approach produces solutions up to 21.7% worse than the classical baseline, while the hybrid method reduces this cost increase to 11.3% for 8 cities. This demonstrates that hybrid approaches improve solution quality compared to purely quantum methods but remain suboptimal compared to classical solvers. Despite current hardware limitations, these results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced methods for combinatorial optimisation, paving the way for future advancements in scalable quantum computing frameworks.

Title: Distributed Variational Quantum Algorithm with Many-qubit for Optimization Challenges
Authors: Seongmin Kim, In-Saeng Suh
Abstract: Optimization problems are critical across various domains, yet existing quantum algorithms, despite their great potential, struggle with scalability and accuracy due to excessive reliance on entanglement. To address these limitations, we propose variational quantum optimization algorithm (VQOA), which leverages many-qubit (MQ) operations in an ansatz solely employing quantum superposition, completely avoiding entanglement. This ansatz significantly reduces circuit complexity, enhances noise robustness, mitigates Barren Plateau issues, and enables efficient partitioning for highly complex large-scale optimization. Furthermore, we introduce distributed VQOA (DVQOA), which integrates high-performance computing with quantum computing to achieve superior performance across MQ systems and classical nodes. These features enable a significant acceleration of material optimization tasks (e.g., metamaterial design), achieving more than 50$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Additionally, DVQOA efficiently solves quantum chemistry problems and $\textit{N}$-ary $(N \geq 2)$ optimization problems involving higher-order interactions. These advantages establish DVQOA as a highly promising and versatile solver for real-world problems, demonstrating the practical utility of the quantum-classical approach.

Title: Design of a quantum diamond microscope with efficient scanning confocal readout
Authors: Daniel G. Ang, Jiashen Tang, Ronald L. Walsworth
Abstract: We introduce the light-sheet confocal quantum diamond microscope (LC-QDM) for widefield 3D quantum sensing with efficient confocal readout. The LC-QDM leverages light-sheet illumination and laser scanning confocal methods to enable high-resolution, high-speed 3D measurements with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond, combining the best of widefield and confocal modalities in a single device and eliminating the need for thin-NV-layer diamond chips. We perform simulations and measurements of NV initialization and readout times to model the anticipated performance of the LC-QDM compared to existing QDM designs. Our findings show that the LC-QDM will provide significant advantages for applications requiring limited laser power.

Title: Efficient quantum tomography of a polynomial subspace
Authors: Yat Wong, Ming Yuan, Kevin He, Srivatsan Chakram, Alireza Seif, David I. Schuster, Liang Jiang
Abstract: Quantum tomography is crucial for characterizing the quantum states of multipartite systems, but its practicality is often limited by the exponentially large dimension of the Hilbert space. Most existing approaches, such as compressed sensing and tensor network-based tomography, impose structural constraints on the state to enable more resource-efficient characterization. However, not all physical states can be well-approximated with highly structured states. Here, we develop a partial quantum tomography method based on direct fidelity estimation (DFE) that focuses on a neighborhood subspace -- the subspace spanned by states physically close to a given target state. Using this generalized DFE method, we estimate elements of the density operator within this subspace in a self-verifying manner. We investigate the efficiency of this approach under different sets of available measurements for various states and find that the set of available measurements significantly impacts the cost of DFE. For example, we show that Pauli measurements alone are insufficient for performing efficient DFE on all product states, whereas the full set of product measurements is sufficient. This method can be applied in many situations, including characterizing quantum systems with confined dynamics and verifying preparations of quantum states and processes.

Title: Entanglement dynamics via Geometric phases in Trapped-ions
Authors: Dharmaraj Ramachandran, Ganesh H, Radhika Vathsan
Abstract: Trapped-ion systems are a leading platform for quantum computing. The Mølmer-Sørensen (MS) gate is a widely used method for implementing controlled interactions in multipartite systems. However, due to unavoidable interactions with the environment, quantum states undergo non-unitary evolution, leading to significant deviations from ideal dynamics. Common techniques such as Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) and Bell State Tomography (BST) are typically employed to evaluate MS gate performance and to characterize noise in the system. In this letter, we propose leveraging the geometric phase as a tool for performance assessment and noise identification in the MS gate. Our findings indicate that the geometric phase is particularly sensitive to environmental noise occurring around twice the clock pulse time. Given that geometric phase measurements do not require full-state tomography, this approach offers a practical and experimentally feasible method to detect entanglement and classify the nature of noise affecting the system.

Title: Nonperturbative Open Quantum Dynamics Bypass Influence Functional
Authors: Yu Su, Yao Wang, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: An ordered moment approach to exact open quantum dynamics is presented, which bypasses the Feynmann-Vernon influence functional formalism. The hierarchical equations of motion are constructed using Wick's contraction, which follows specific orderings of the bath's creation and annihilation operators. Our approach moves beyond the traditional influence functional formalism, offering a more intuitive and direct framework, and extends the applicability of theory to nonlinear system--bath coupling scenarios.

Title: Harnessing Hybrid Frequency-Entangled Qudits through Quantum Interference
Authors: Sheng-Hung Wang, Po-Han Chen, Cheng-Yu Yang, Yen-Hung Chen, Pin-Ju Tsai
Abstract: High-dimensional (HD) quantum entanglement expands the Hilbert space, offering a robust framework for quantum information processing with enhanced capacity and error resilience. In this work, we present a novel HD frequency-domain entangled state, the hybrid frequency-entangled qudit (HFEQ), generated via Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference, exhibiting both discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) characteristics. By tuning HOM interference, we generate and control HFEQs with dimensions $D=5,7,9,11$, confirming their DV nature. Franson interferometry confirms the global frequency correlations with visibility exceeding 98% and verifies the CV entanglement within individual frequency modes with visibility greater than 95%. Our findings provide deeper insight into the physical nature of frequency-entangled qudits generated by quantum interference and introduce a novel resource for HD time-frequency quantum information processing.

Title: Characterizing dynamical behaviors in topological open systems with boundary dissipations
Authors: Zhen-Yu Zheng, Xueliang Wang, Shu Chen
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with boundary dissipations described by Lindblad master equations and unravel distinct dynamical features in the topologically different phases of the underlying Hamiltonian. By examining the long-time damping dynamics, we uncover a dynamical duality phenomenon between the weak and strong dissipation region, which exists only in the topologically non-trivial phase, linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectra,particularly the stripe closest to the steady state. When dissipation is confined to a single boundary, the dynamical duality phenomenon still exists. Under this condition, the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential size scaling relation in the topologically non-trivial phase and a power-law size scaling relation in the topologically trivial phase. Within the topologically non-trivial region, we identify the existence of boundary-localized dark states in the thermodynamical limit, which is responsible for the exponential size decay of Liouvillian gap.

Title: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Variational Quantum Regressor for Enhancing QSPR Modeling of CO2-Capturing Amine
Authors: Hyein Cho, Jeonghoon Kim, Hocheol Lim
Abstract: Accurate amine property prediction is essential for optimizing CO2 capture efficiency in post-combustion processes. Quantum machine learning (QML) can enhance predictive modeling by leveraging superposition, entanglement, and interference to capture complex correlations. In this study, we developed hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNN) to improve quantitative structure-property relationship modeling for CO2-capturing amines. By integrating variational quantum regressors with classical multi-layer perceptrons and graph neural networks, quantum advantages were explored in physicochemical property prediction under noiseless conditions and robustness was evaluated against quantum hardware noise using IBM quantum systems. Our results showed that HQNNs improve predictive accuracy for key solvent properties, including basicity, viscosity, boiling point, melting point, and vapor pressure. The fine-tuned and frozen pre-trained HQNN models with 9 qubits consistently achieved the highest rankings, highlighting the benefits of integrating quantum layers with pre-trained classical models. Furthermore, simulations under hardware noise confirmed the robustness of HQNNs, maintaining predictive performance. Overall, these findings emphasize the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in molecular modeling. As quantum hardware and QML algorithms continue to advance, practical quantum benefits in QSPR modeling and materials discovery are expected to become increasingly attainable, driven by improvements in quantum circuit design, noise mitigation, and scalable architectures.

Title: Characterizing the mixed eigenstates in kicked top model through the out-of-time-order correlator
Authors: Qian Wang, Marko Robnik
Abstract: Generic systems are associated with a mixed classical phase this http URL question of the properties of the eigenstates for these systems remains less known, although it plays a key role for understanding several important quantum phenomena such as thermalization, scarring, tunneling, and (de-)localization. In this work, by employing the kicked top model, we perform a detailed investigation of the dynamical signatures of the mixed eigenstates via the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). We show how the types of the eigenstates get reflected in the short- and long-time behaviors of the OTOC and conjecture that the dynamics of the OTOC can be used as an indicator of the mixed eigenstates. Our findings further confirm the usefulness of the OTOC for studying quantum complex systems and also provide more insights into the characters the mixed eigenstates.

Title: Entanglement transition and suppression of critical phase of thermofield double state in monitored quantum circuit with unitary $R$ matrix gates
Authors: Shi-Kang Sun, Shu Chen
Abstract: We study quantum circuits with gates composed randomly of identity operators, projectors, or a kind of $R$ matrices which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation and are unitary and dual-unitary. This enables us to translate the quantum circuit into a topological object with distinguished overcrossings and undercrossings. The circuit corresponds to a classical loop model when an overcrossings and undercrossing coincides. The entanglement entropy between the final state and initial state is given by the spanning number of the classical model, and they share the same phase diagram. Whenever an overcrossing and undercrossing differ, the circuit extends beyond the classical model. Considering a specific case with $R$ matrices randomly replaced by swap gates, we demonstrate that the topological effect dominates, and only the area-law phase remains in the thermodynamic limit, regardless of how small the replacement probability is. We also find evidence of an altered phase diagram for non-Clifford cases.

Title: Enhanced Predictive Capability for Chaotic Dynamics by Modified Quantum Reservoir Computing
Authors: Longhan Wang, Yifan Sun, Xiangdong Zhang
Abstract: Deducing the states of spatiotemporally chaotic systems (SCSs) as they evolve in time is crucial for various applications. However, it is a dramatic challenge for generally achieving so due to the complexity of non-periodic dynamics and the hardness of obtaining robust solutions. In recent, there is a growing interest in approaching the problem using both classical and quantum machine learning methods. Although effective for predicting SCSs within a relative short time, the current schemes are not capable of providing robust solutions for longer time than training time. Here, we propose an approach for advancing the prediction of chaotic behavior. Our approach can be viewed as a novel quantum reservoir computing scheme, which can simultaneously capture the linear and the nonlinear features of input data and evolve under a modified Hamiltonian. Our work paves the way for a new avenue in handling SCSs.

Title: Deterministic high-rate entanglement distillation with neutral atom arrays
Authors: Thomas A. Hahn, Ryan White, Hannes Bernien, Rotem Arnon-Friedman
Abstract: The goal of an entanglement distillation protocol is to convert large quantities of noisy entangled states into a smaller number of high-fidelity Bell pairs. The celebrated one-way hashing method is one such protocol, and it is known for being able to efficiently and deterministically distill entanglement in the asymptotic limit, i.e., when the size of the quantum system is very large. In this work, we consider setups with finite resources, e.g., a small fixed number of atoms in an atom array, and derive lower bounds on the distillation rate for the one-way hashing method. We provide analytical as well as numerical bounds on its entanglement distillation rate -- both significantly tighter than previously known bounds. We then show how the one-way hashing method can be efficiently implemented with neutral atom arrays. The combination of our theoretical results and the experimental blueprint we provide indicate that a full coherent implementation of the one-way hashing method is within reach with state-of-the-art quantum technology.

Title: Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples
Authors: Matt Lourens, Ilya Sinayskiy, Johannes N. Kriel, Francesco Petruccione
Abstract: We introduce a method that generates ground state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for local observables and correlation functions. We also point out an interesting connection between this ansatz and a well-studied sequence in analytical number theory and the one-dimensional classical Ising model.

Title: Quantum Lamb model
Authors: Dennis P. Clougherty, Nam H. Dinh
Abstract: H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We show that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and we find that it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory for coupling strength below a critical value. The model is found to break down for coupling strength above the critical value where the lowest Bogoliubov frequency vanishes. We show that the addition of an anharmonic elastic term is sufficient to stabilize the system in this strong coupling regime.

Title: Collective Neutrino Oscillations in Three Flavors on Qubit and Qutrit Processors

Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor oscillations are of primary importance in understanding the dynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae and subsequent terrestrial detection, but also among the most challenging aspects of numerical simulations. This situation is complicated by the quantum many-body nature of the problem due to neutrino-neutrino interactions which demands a quantum treatment. An additional complication is the presence of three flavors, which often is approximated by the electron flavor and a heavy lepton flavor. In this work, we provide both qubit and qutrit encodings for all three flavors, and develop optimized quantum circuits for the time evolution and analyze the Trotter error. We conclude our study with a hardware experiment of a system of two neutrinos with superconducting hardware: the IBM Torino device for qubits and AQT device for qutrits. We find that error mitigation greatly helps in obtaining a signal consistent with simulations. While hardware results are comparable at this stage, we expect the qutrit setup to be more convenient for large-scale simulations since it does not suffer from probability leakage into nonphsycial qubit space, unlike the qubit setup.

Title: Compactfying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG
Authors: Bruna G. M. Araújo, Antonio M S Macedo
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.

Title: PIMutation: Exploring the Potential of PIM Architecture for Quantum Circuit Simulation
Authors: Dongin Lee, Enhyeok Jang, Seungwoo Choi, Junwoong An, Cheolhwan Kim, Won Woo Ro
Abstract: Quantum circuit simulations are essential for the verification of quantum algorithms on behalf of real quantum devices. However, the memory requirements for such simulations grow exponentially with the number of qubits involved in quantum programs. Moreover, a substantial number of computations in quantum circuit simulations cause low locality data accesses, as they require extensive computations across the entire table of the full state vector. These characteristics lead to significant latency and energy overheads during data transfers between the CPU and main memory. Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computational logic near DRAM banks, could present a promising solution to address these challenges. In this paper, we introduce PIMutation (PIM framework for qUanTum circuit simulATION) for achieving fast and energy-efficient quantum circuit simulation. PIMutation is the first attempt to leverage UPMEM, a publicly available PIM-integrated DIMM, to implement quantum circuit simulations. PIMutation incorporates three optimization strategies to overcome the overhead of quantum circuit simulation using the real PIM system: (i) gate merging, (ii) row swapping, and (iii) vector partitioning. Our evaluations show that PIMutation achieves an average speedup of 2.99x and 16.51x with a reduction of energy of 25.23% and 75.29% over the QuEST simulator on CPU in 16- and 32-qubit benchmarks, respectively.

Title: Superior monogamy and polygamy relations and estimates of concurrence
Authors: Yue Cao, Naihuan Jing, Kailash Misra, Yiling Wang
Abstract: It is well known that any well-defined bipartite entanglement measure $\mathcal{E}$ obeys $\gamma$th-monogamy relations Eq. (1.1) and assisted measure $\mathcal{E}_{a}$ obeys $\delta$th-polygamy relations Eq. (1.2). Recently, we presented a class of tighter parameterized monogamy relation for the $\alpha$th $(\alpha\geq\gamma)$ power based on Eq. (1.1). This study provides a family of tighter lower (resp. upper) bounds of the monogamy (resp. polygamy) relations in a unified manner. In the first part of the paper, the following three basic problems are focused: (i) tighter monogamy relation for the $\alpha$th ($0\leq \alpha\leq \gamma$) power of any bipartite entanglement measure $\mathcal{E}$ based on Eq. (1.1); (ii) tighter polygamy relation for the $\beta$th ($ \beta \geq \delta$) power of any bipartite assisted entanglement measure $\mathcal{E}_{a}$ based on Eq. (1.2); (iii) tighter polygamy relation for the $\omega$th ($0\leq \omega \leq \delta$) power of any bipartite assisted entanglement measure $\mathcal{E}_{a}$ based on Eq. (1.2). In the second part, using the tighter polygamy relation for the $\omega$th ($0\leq \omega \leq 2$) power of CoA, we obtain good estimates or bounds for the $\omega$th ($0\leq \omega \leq 2$) power of concurrence for any $N$-qubit pure states $|\psi\rangle_{AB_{1}\cdots B_{N-1}}$ under the partition $AB_{1}$ and $B_{2}\cdots B_{N-1}$. Detailed examples are given to illustrate that our findings exhibit greater strength across all the region.

Title: Microscopic theory of a precessing ferromagnet for ultrasensitive magnetometry
Authors: Xueqi Ni, Zhixing Zou, Ruvi Lecamwasam, Andrea Vinante, Dmitry Budker, Ping Koy Lam, Tao Wang, Jiangbin Gong
Abstract: Levitated systems have great potential in quantum sensing and exploring quantum effects at the macroscopic scale. Of particular interest are recent works suggesting that a levitated ferromagnet can beat the standard quantum limit of magnetometry. This work offers a theoretical model to analyze and understand critical features of the precessing dynamics of a levitated ferromagnetic needle, indeed much like a macrospin, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. The dynamics from the atomic scale reveals how the standard quantum limit is surpassed, thus verifying sensing advantages when compared with a collection of independent spins. Our theory further takes us to two additional experimental designs of immediate interest: measurement of the celebrated Berry phase with a precessing ferromagnetic needle and the use of its nutation motion to sense a low-frequency oscillating magnetic field. With a microscopic theory established for levitated ferromagnetic needles, future studies of macroscopic quantum effects and the associated quantum-classical transition also become possible.

Title: Scalable Memory Recycling for Large Quantum Programs
Authors: Israel Reichental, Ravid Alon, Lior Preminger, Matan Vax, Amir Naveh
Abstract: As quantum computing technology advances, the complexity of quantum algorithms increases, necessitating a shift from low-level circuit descriptions to high-level programming paradigms. This paper addresses the challenges of developing a compilation algorithm that optimizes memory management and scales well for bigger, more complex circuits. Our approach models the high-level quantum code as a control flow graph and presents a workflow that searches for a topological sort that maximizes opportunities for qubit reuse. Various heuristics for qubit reuse strategies handle the trade-off between circuit width and depth. We also explore scalability issues in large circuits, suggesting methods to mitigate compilation bottlenecks. By analyzing the structure of the circuit, we are able to identify sub-problems that can be solved separately, without a significant effect on circuit quality, while reducing runtime significantly. This method lays the groundwork for future advancements in quantum programming and compiler optimization by incorporating scalability into quantum memory management.

Title: Incompatibility of rank-one POVMs and uncertainty relations
Authors: W. Dong, P. Lian, X. Wang
Abstract: The incompatibility between quantum measurements is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics with profound implications for uncertainty relations and quantum information processing. In this paper, we realized that the $s$-order incompatibility of measurements by Xu (inspired by De Bièvre's "complete incompatibility" ), can be equivalently characterized by spark of the associated measurement matrix. This provides a new linear algebraic perspective on measurement incompatibility. Leveraging this insight, we extend $s$-order incompatibility to rank-one POVMs and establish novel uncertainty relations. Furthermore, we explore the incompatibility of multiple bases and its connection to support uncertainty relations. These results may have applications in quantum cryptography, quantum state reconstruction, and quantum compressed sensing.

Title: Optimizing Low-Energy Carbon IIoT Systems with Quantum Algorithms: Performance Evaluation and Noise Robustness
Authors: Kshitij Dave, Nouhaila Innan, Bikash K. Behera, Shahid Mumtaz, Saif Al-Kuwari, Ahmed Farouk
Abstract: Low-energy carbon Internet of Things (IoT) systems are essential for sustainable development, as they reduce carbon emissions while ensuring efficient device performance. Although classical algorithms manage energy efficiency and data processing within these systems, they often face scalability and real-time processing limitations. Quantum algorithms offer a solution to these challenges by delivering faster computations and improved optimization, thereby enhancing both the performance and sustainability of low-energy carbon IoT systems. Therefore, we introduced three quantum algorithms: quantum neural networks utilizing Pennylane (QNN-P), Qiskit (QNN-Q), and hybrid quantum neural networks (QNN-H). These algorithms are applied to two low-energy carbon IoT datasets room occupancy detection (RODD) and GPS tracker (GPSD). For the RODD dataset, QNN-P achieved the highest accuracy at 0.95, followed by QNN-H at 0.91 and QNN-Q at 0.80. Similarly, for the GPSD dataset, QNN-P attained an accuracy of 0.94, QNN-H 0.87, and QNN-Q 0.74. Furthermore, the robustness of these models is verified against six noise models. The proposed quantum algorithms demonstrate superior computational efficiency and scalability in noisy environments, making them highly suitable for future low-energy carbon IoT systems. These advancements pave the way for more sustainable and efficient IoT infrastructures, significantly minimizing energy consumption while maintaining optimal device performance.

Title: Revealing quantum operator scrambling via measuring Holevo information on digital quantum simulators
Authors: Bin Sun, Geng-Bin Cao, Xi-Dan Hu, Dan-Bo Zhang
Abstract: Quantum operator scrambling describes the spreading of local operators into the whole system in the picture of Heisenberg evolution, which is often quantified by the operator size growth. Here we propose a measure of quantum operator scrambling via Holevo information of operators, by taking its capacity to distinguish operator information locally. We show that the operator size is closely related to a special kind of Holevo information of operators. Moreover, we propose a feasible protocol for measuring Holevo information of operators on digital quantum simulators based on random states. Our numerical simulations show that the integrable system can be told apart from the chaotic system by measuring the spatial-temporal patterns of Holevo information. Furthermore, we find that error mitigation is required to restore the time-oscillation behavior of Holevo information for the integrable system, a crucial feature distinct from the chaotic one. Our work provides a new perspective to understand the information scrambling and quantum chaos from aspects of Holevo information of operators.

Title: Nonadiabatic braiding of Majorana modes
Authors: Fei Yu, P. Z. Zhao, Jiangbin Gong
Abstract: The realization and manipulation of Majorana zero modes have drawn significant attention for their crucial role in enabling topological quantum computation. Conventional approaches to the braiding of Majorana zero modes rely on adiabatic processes. In this work, using a composite 2-Kitaev-chain system accommodating Majorana zero modes as a working example, we propose a nonadiabatic and non-Abelian geometry phase-based protocol to execute operations on these Majorana zero modes. This is possible by locally coupling the edge sites of both quantum chains with an embedded lattice defect, successfully simulating the braiding operation of two Majorana modes in a highly nonadiabatic fashion. To further enhance the robustness against control imperfections, we apply a multiple-pulse composite strategy to our quantum chain setting for second-order protection of the braiding operations. Our proposal can also support the fast and robust realization of the {\pi}/8 gate, an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. This work hence offers a potential pathway towards the nonadiabatic and fault-tolerant control of Majorana zero modes.

Title: Simulating quantum instruments with projective measurements and quantum post-processing
Authors: Shishir Khandelwal, Armin Tavakoli
Abstract: Quantum instruments describe both the classical outcome and the updated state associated with a quantum measurement. We ask whether these processes can be simulated using only a natural subset of resources, namely projective measurements on the system and quantum processing of the post-measurement states. We show that the simulability of instruments can be connected to an entanglement classification problem. This leads to a computationally efficient necessary condition for simulation of generic instruments and to a complete characterisation for qubits. We use this to address relevant quantum information tasks, namely (i) the noise-tolerance of standard qubit unsharp measurements, (ii) non-projective advantages in information-disturbance trade-offs, and (iii) increased sequential Bell inequality violations under projective measurements. Moreover, we consider also $d$-dimensional Lüders instruments that correspond to weak versions of standard basis measurements and show that for large $d$ these can permit scalable noise-advantages over projective implementations.

Title: Reasoning across spacelike surfaces in the Frauchiger-Renner thought experiment
Authors: Jeffrey M. Epstein
Abstract: The Frauchiger-Renner argument purports to show that the standard framework of quantum mechanics yields a contradiction when used to reason about systems containing agents who are themselves using quantum mechanics to perform deductions. This has been framed as an obstacle to taking quantum mechanics to be a complete theory. I formalize the argument in two closely related ways and elucidate the source of the paradox, clarifying the flaw in the original argument.

Title: Quantum nonlocal double slit interference with partially coherent qubits
Authors: Sakshi Rao, Bhaskar Kanseri
Abstract: Partially coherent quantum-entangled beams combine quantum entanglement with partial coherence, allowing them to maintain quantum characteristics while being more resistant to distortions caused by random media during propagation. In this study, we investigate the effect of coherence variation of such beams on non-local double-slit quantum interference. The spatial coherence variation is achieved by controlling the spot size and transverse coherence length of the Gaussian Schell model pump in the spontaneous parametric down conversion process. For a fixed beam size, the momentum correlation width of partially coherent biphotons increases with the decreases in the transverse coherence length. This results in a biphoton beam exhibiting multiple spatial modes, making it more suitable for studying the non-local features of quantum states in imaging, interference, and diffraction experiments. Our findings infer both high-quality and near-unity visibility of nonlocal interference using the partially coherent twin beams, even with the substantial decrease in the coherence of the pump. We believe these results can enhance robustness against the deleterious effects of the medium during propagation and can have potential applications in optical image cryptography, biomedical imaging, quantum lithography, and quantum holography.

Title: Integration of a GaAs-based nanomechanical phase shifter with quantum-dot single-photon sources
Authors: Celeste Qvotrup, Ying Wang, Marcus Albrechtsen, Rodrigo A. Thomas, Zhe Liu, Sven Scholz, Arne Ludwig, Leonardo Midolo
Abstract: We demonstrate a small-footprint electromechanical phase shifter with a compact active length of $10\:\mu \text{m}$ fabricated on a suspended GaAs membrane, offering versatile integration with quantum-dot single-photon sources. The phase shifter is based on a slot-mode waveguide, whose slot width can be controlled by electrostatic forces, enabling a large effective refractive index change $\Delta n_\text{eff} > 0.1$. We observe up to 3$\pi$ phase modulation with 10.6 \text{V} applied bias, and a figure of merit $V_{\pi}L = 5.7\cdot 10^{-3} \text{V}\cdot \text{cm}$. Integration with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) further allows routing of single photons with up to 24 \text{dB} extinction ratio at cryogenic temperatures. This device enables advanced manipulation of quantum emitters and the realization of reconfigurable quantum photonic integrated circuits.

Title: Controlling emitter-field coupling in waveguides with a nanomechanical phase shifter
Authors: Celeste Qvotrup, Ying Wang, Marcus Albrechtsen, Rodrigo A. Thomas, Zhe Liu, Sven Scholz, Arne Ludwig, Leonardo Midolo
Abstract: The ability to control light-matter interfaces with solid-state photon emitters is a major requirement for the development of quantum photonic integrated circuits. We demonstrate controllable coupling between a quantum dot and an optical mode in a dielectric waveguide using a nano-opto-electro-mechanical phase shifter and a photonic crystal mirror. By controlling the phase, we induce a virtual displacement of the mirror that modifies the local density of states at the position of the emitter, thereby enhancing or suppressing spontaneous emission without an optical cavity. We observe a broadband tuning of the spontaneous emission rate and a modulation of the intensity emitted by the quantum dot in the waveguide. The method reported here could be employed to optimize the emitter-field interaction between quantum dots in-operando, by maximizing a single-photon source generation rate or adjusting its lifetime, as well as a characterization tool for the direct measurement of emitter-photon cooperativity.

Title: Efficient multiplexed quantum memory with high dimensional orbital angular momentum states in cold atoms
Authors: Xin Yang, Chengyuan Wang, Jinwen Wang, Mingtao Cao, Yun Chen, Hong Chang, Ruifang Dong, Shougang Zhang, Dong Wei, Pei Zhang, Fuli Li, Hong Gao
Abstract: Quantum memory plays a pivotal role in the construction of quantum repeaters, which are essential devices for establishing long-distance quantum communications and large-scale quantum networks. To boost information capacity and signal processing speed, the implementation of high-efficiency multiplexed quantum memories is essential for the development of multiplexed quantum repeaters. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient multiplexed quantum memory by consolidating photons carrying high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) state from 4 individual channels into an elongated cold $^{87}$Rb atomic ensemble. Benefiting from the cold atomic ensemble with high optical depth, we obtain a storage efficiency exceeding 70% for the 4-channel multiplexed beam. The storage fidelities surpass 83% when all channels are operated in a 4-dimensional Hilbert space, which is far above the classical benchmark and validates the quantum functionality of our memory system. The achieved high-efficiency OAM multiplexed quantum memory opens up an avenue for efficient quantum information processing over multiple parallel channels, promising significant advances in the field of quantum communication and networking.

Title: A thermal-noise-resilient microwave quantum network traversing 4 K
Authors: Jiawei Qiu, Zihao Zhang, Zilin Wang, Libo Zhang, Yuxuan Zhou, Xuandong Sun, Jiawei Zhang, Xiayu Linpeng, Song Liu, Jingjing Niu, Youpeng Zhong, Dapeng Yu
Abstract: Quantum communication at microwave frequencies has been fundamentally constrained by the susceptibility of microwave photons to thermal noise, hindering their application in scalable quantum networks. Here we demonstrate a thermal-noise-resilient microwave quantum network that establishes coherent coupling between two superconducting qubits through a 4 K thermalized niobium-titanium transmission line. By overcoupling the communication channel to a cold load at 10 mK, we suppress the effective thermal occupancy of the channel to 0.06 photons through radiative cooling -- a two-order-of-magnitude reduction below ambient thermal noise. We then decouple the cold load and rapidly transfer microwave quantum states through the channel while it rethermalizes, achieving a 58.5% state transfer fidelity and a 52.3% Bell entanglement fidelity, both exceeding the classical communication threshold. Our architecture overcomes the temperature-compatibility barrier for microwave quantum systems, providing a scalable framework for distributed quantum computing and enabling hybrid quantum networks with higher-temperature semiconductor or photonic platforms.

Title: Purcell-enhanced emissions from diamond color centers in slow light photonic crystal waveguides
Authors: Sophie W. Ding, Chang Jin, Kazuhiro Kuruma, Xinghan Guo, Michael Haas, Boris Korzh, Andrew Beyer, Matt Shaw, Neil Sinclair, David D. Awschalom, F. Joseph Heremans, Nazar Delegan, Alexander A. High, Marko Loncar
Abstract: Quantum memories based on emitters with optically addressable spins rely on efficient photonic interfaces, often implemented as nanophotonic cavities with ideally narrow spectral linewidths and small mode volumes. However, these approaches require nearly perfect spectral and spatial overlap between the cavity mode and quantum emitter, which can be challenging. This is especially true in the case of solid-state quantum emitters that are often randomly positioned and can suffer from significant inhomogeneous broadening. An alternative approach to mitigate these challenges is to use slow-light waveguides that can enhance light-matter interaction across large optical bandwidths and large areas. Here, we demonstrate diamond slow light photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides that enable broadband optical coupling to embedded silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers. We take advantage of the recently demonstrated thin-film diamond photonic platform to fabricate fully suspended two-dimensional PhC waveguides. Using this approach, we demonstrate waveguide modes with high group indices up to 70 and observe Purcell-enhanced emissions of the SiVs coupled to the waveguide mode. Our approach represents a practical diamond platform for robust spin-photon interfaces with color centers.

Title: Magic State Distillation under Imperfect Measurements
Authors: Yunzhe Zheng, Yuanchen Zhao, Dong E. Liu
Abstract: We examine the impact of imperfect measurement on magic state distillation (MSD) process by employing the framework of stabilizer reduction, which characterizes MSD protocols using stabilizer codes. We show the existence of thresholds for measurement strength in MSD protocols, below which there doesn't exist non-trivial target states and no input states can be distilled into better states. We prove that for MSD protocols based on CSS codes with transversal non-Clifford gates, the first-order effect of imperfect measurement will at most cause biased Pauli noise on the target states. Furthermore, we prove that we can minimize the effect of imperfect measurement noise on the asymptotically distilled states by measuring stabilizer generators in the standard form. We numerically demonstrate our theoretical results by simulating the $[[15, 1, 3]]$ and $[[14, 2, 2]]$ MSD protocols using the mapping from MSD protocols to dynamical systems. Our numerical results imply that the existence of imperfect measurement degrades the order of convergence rate to linear, regardless of the original order in the noiseless case. Our work will therefore contribute to understanding fault-tolerant quantum computing under imperfect measurement noise.

Title: Adaptive cold-atom magnetometry mitigating the trade-off between sensitivity and dynamic range
Authors: Zhu Ma, Chengyin Han, Zhi Tan, Haihua He, Shenszhen Shi, Xin Kang, Jiatao Wu, Jiahao Huang, Bo Lu, Chaohong Lee
Abstract: Cold-atom magnetometers can achieve an exceptional combination of superior sensitivity and high spatial resolution. One key challenge these quantum sensors face is improving the sensitivity within a given timeframe while preserving a high dynamic range. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an adaptive entanglement-free cold-atom magnetometry with both superior sensitivity and high dynamic range. Employing a tailored adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation algorithm designed for Ramsey interferometry using coherent population trapping (CPT), cold-atom magnetometry facilitates adaptive high-precision detection of a direct-current (d.c.) magnetic field with high dynamic range. Through implementing a sequence of correlated CPT-Ramsey interferometry, the sensitivity significantly surpasses the standard quantum limit with respect to total interrogation time. We yield a sensitivity of 6.8$\pm$0.1 picotesla per square root of hertz over a range of 145.6 nanotesla, exceeding the conventional frequentist protocol by 3.3$\pm$0.1 decibels. Our study opens avenues for the next generation of adaptive cold-atom quantum sensors, wherein real-time measurement history is leveraged to improve their performance.

Title: Noise effects on the diagnostics of quantum chaos
Authors: Tingfei Li
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of noise on the diagnostics of quantum chaos, focusing on three primary tools: the spectral form factor (SFF), Krylov complexity, and out-of-time correlators (OTOCs). Utilizing a closed quantum system model with white noise, we demonstrate that increasing noise strength leads to an exponential suppression of these diagnostic measures. Specifically, our findings reveal that in the strong noise limit, the SFF, two-point correlation function, and OTOCs become ineffective in distinguishing chaotic behavior. The SFF is particularly impacted, exhibiting a significant decay that obscures its ability to identify quantum chaos. This study highlights the challenges posed by environmental noise in accurately diagnosing quantum chaotic systems and suggests that traditional methods may require adaptation to remain effective in realistic open quantum systems. Our results underscore the need for further research into robust diagnostic techniques that can account for noise-induced effects in quantum chaotic systems.

Title: Hyperspectral image segmentation with a machine learning model trained using quantum annealer
Authors: Dawid Mazur, Tomasz Rybotycki, Piotr Gawron
Abstract: Training of machine learning models consumes large amounts of energy. Since the energy consumption becomes a major problem in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence systems there exists a need to investigate the ways to reduce use of the resources by these systems. In this work we study how application of quantum annealers could lead to reduction of energy cost in training models aiming at pixel-level segmentation of hyperspectral images. Following the results of QBM4EO team, we propose a classical machine learning model, partially trained using quantum annealer, for hyperspectral image segmentation. We show that the model trained using quantum annealer is better or at least comparable with models trained using alternative algorithms, according to the preselected, common metrics. While direct energy use comparison does not make sense at the current stage of quantum computing technology development, we believe that our work proves that quantum annealing should be considered as a tool for training at least some machine learning models.

Title: On Exact Sizes of Minimal CNOT Circuits
Authors: Jens Emil Christensen, Søren Fuglede Jørgensen, Andreas Pavlogiannis, Jaco van de Pol
Abstract: Computing a minimum-size circuit that implements a certain function is a standard optimization task. We consider circuits of CNOT gates, which are fundamental binary gates in reversible and quantum computing. Algebraically, CNOT circuits on $n$ qubits correspond to $GL(n,2)$, the general linear group over the field of two elements, and circuit minimization reduces to computing distances in the Cayley graph $G_n$ of $GL(n,2)$ generated by transvections. However, the super-exponential size of $GL(n,2)$ has made its exploration computationally challenging. In this paper, we develop a new approach for computing distances in $G_n$, allowing us to synthesize minimum circuits that were previously beyond reach (e.g., we can synthesize optimally all circuits over $n=7$ qubits). Towards this, we establish two theoretical results that may be of independent interest. First, we give a complete characterization of all isometries in $G_n$ in terms of (i) permuting qubits and (ii) swapping the arguments of all CNOT gates. Second, for any fixed $d$, we establish polynomials in $n$ of degree $2d$ that characterize the size of spheres in $G_n$ at distance $d$, as long as $n\geq 2d$. With these tools, we revisit an open question of [Bataille, 2022] regarding the smallest number $n_0$ for which the diameter of $G_{n_0}$ exceeds $3(n_0-1)$. It was previously shown that $6\leq n_0 \leq 30$, a gap that we tighten considerably to $8\leq n_0 \leq 20$. We also confirm a conjecture that long cycle permutations lie at distance $3(n-1)$, for all $n\leq 8$, extending the previous bound of $n\leq 5$.

Title: Meissner-Like Currents of Photons in Anomalous Superradiant Phases
Authors: Linjun Li, Pengfei Huang, Yu-Yu Zhang
Abstract: The Meissner effect, a signature feature of superconductors, involves circular surface currents that cancel an external field. In this study, we present our findings on Meissner-like currents of photons in highly tunable light-matter interaction systems. In a quantum Rabi zigzag chain exposed to a staggered magnetic field, we identify a Meissner superradiant phase, manifesting persistent chiral edge currents in the ground state. Counter-flowing edge currents arise in each species of cavities,leading to complete cancellation of net currents throughout the entire chain. This phenomenon is analogous to surface currents in the Meissner effect. The Meissner phase is signaled by the unusual scaling exponents of the lowest excitation energy, which exhibit anomalous criticality with and without geometric frustration in each species. Intriguingly, adjusting the staggered flux induces transitions from the Meissner phase to either the even-chiral or odd-chiral superradiant phases, where the chiral edge currents flow exclusively in even or odd cavities, respectively. Additionally, by enhancing interspecies interactions, chiral currents vanish in a ferromagnetic superradiant phase. Our realization of Meissner-like currents of photons opens avenues for exploring edge state interferometry and quantum Hall effects within light-matter coupling platforms.

Title: Limitations of Amplitude Encoding on Quantum Classification
Authors: Xin Wang, Yabo Wang, Bo Qi, Rebing Wu
Abstract: It remains unclear whether quantum machine learning (QML) has real advantages when dealing with practical and meaningful tasks. Encoding classical data into quantum states is one of the key steps in QML. Amplitude encoding has been widely used owing to its remarkable efficiency in encoding a number of $2^{n}$ classical data into $n$ qubits simultaneously. However, the theoretical impact of amplitude encoding on QML has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work we prove that under some broad and typical data assumptions, the average of encoded quantum states via amplitude encoding tends to concentrate towards a specific state. This concentration phenomenon severely constrains the capability of quantum classifiers as it leads to a loss barrier phenomenon, namely, the loss function has a lower bound that cannot be improved by any optimization algorithm. In addition, via numerical simulations, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon of amplitude encoding: as the amount of training data increases, the training error may increase rather than decrease, leading to reduced decrease in prediction accuracy on new data. Our results highlight the limitations of amplitude encoding in QML and indicate that more efforts should be devoted to finding more efficient encoding strategies to unlock the full potential of QML.

Title: Photon Routing Induced by Giant Atoms in a Synthetic Frequency Dimension
Authors: Ruolin Chai, Guoqing Cai, Qiongtao Xie, Huaizhi Wu, Yong Li
Abstract: We propose a hardware-efficient photon routing scheme based on a dynamically modulated multi-mode ring resonator and a driven cyclic three-level artificial atom, which effectively models a two-level giant atom coupled to a pair of one-dimensional lattices in a synthetic frequency dimension. The routing dynamics of single-photon wave packets in the frequency dimension are investigated numerically and analytically. Our results show that by tuning the phase of the driving field, the photon transmission between the two frequency lattices can be well controlled, thereby determining the propagation direction of photons within the ring resonator. This work presents a feasible scheme for implementing a controllable node in quantum networks, and the predictions of this scheme are well within reach of state-of-the-art experiments.

Title: Locating Rydberg Decay Error in SWAP-LRU
Authors: Cheng-Cheng Yu, Yu-Hao Deng, Ming-Cheng Chen, Chao-Yang Lu, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: Achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms necessitates addressing inherent errors, particularly leakage from Rydberg states during the implementation of multi-qubit gates. Such leakage induces two-qubit error chains, which degrades the error distance and compromise the performance of error correction. While existing solutions, such as hardware-specific protocols (Erasure Conversion) and circuit-based protocols, have demonstrated favorable error distances (d_e = d for pure Rydberg decay) and high error thresholds, they rely on significant additional hardware resources. In this work, we propose a hardware-efficient approach to deal with Rydberg decay errors using SWAP-LRU, augmented by final leakage detection to locate errors. Our method requires only one additional CNOT gate per round, significantly reducing resource overhead. For a located decoder, where all leakage can be detected, we achieve a high error threshold of 1.8% per CNOT gate and demonstrate improved error distances for pure Rydberg decay, outperforming traditional Pauli error models. Furthermore, we introduce an alternative, more hardware-efficient solution, partially located decoder, which detects only one type of leakage, yet effectively eliminates the damaging effects of Rydberg decay on sub-threshold scaling. Our findings provide new insights into located error and pave the way for a resource-efficient strategy to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation with neutral atom arrays.

Title: Renormalization and Low-Energy Effective Models in Cavity and Circuit QED
Authors: Daniele Lamberto, Alberto Mercurio, Omar Di Stefano, Vincenzo Savona, Salvatore Savasta
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a cornerstone in the study of light-matter interactions within cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). It effectively captures the dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a single-mode resonator, serving as a foundation for understanding quantum optical phenomena in a great variety of systems. However, this model may produce inaccurate results for large coupling strengths, even in systems with high anharmonicity. Moreover, issues of gauge invariance further undermine its reliability. In this work, we introduce a renormalized QRM that incorporates the effective influence of higher atomic energy levels, providing a significantly more accurate representation of the system while still maintaining a two-level description. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we present two different examples: an atom in a double-well potential and a superconducting artificial atom (fluxonium qubit). This procedure opens new possibilities for precisely engineering and understanding cavity and circuit QED systems, which are highly sought-after, especially for quantum information processing.

Title: Krylov shadow tomography: Efficient estimation of quantum Fisher information
Authors: Da-Jian Zhang, D. M. Tong
Abstract: Efficiently estimating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is pivotal in quantum information science but remains an outstanding challenge for large systems due to its high nonlinearity. In this Letter, we tackle this long-standing challenge by integrating the Krylov subspace method--a celebrated tool from applied mathematics--into the framework of shadow tomography. The integrated technique, dubbed Krylov shadow tomography (KST), enables us to formulate a strict hierarchy of non-polynomial lower bounds on the QFI, among which the highest one matches the QFI exactly. We show that all the bounds can be expressed as expected values of the inverses of Hankel matrices, which are accessible via shadow tomography. Our KST therefore opens up a resource-efficient and experimentally feasible avenue to estimate not only non-polynomial lower bounds but also the QFI itself.

Title: Automorphism Ensemble Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes
Authors: Stergios Koutsioumpas, Hasan Sayginel, Mark Webster, Dan E Browne
Abstract: We introduce AutDEC, a fast and accurate decoder for quantum error-correcting codes with large automorphism groups. Our decoder employs a set of automorphisms of the quantum code and an ensemble of belief propagation (BP) decoders. Each BP decoder is given a syndrome which is transformed by one of the automorphisms, and is run in parallel. For quantum codes, the accuracy of BP decoders is limited because short cycles occur in the Tanner graph and our approach mitigates this effect. We demonstrate decoding accuracy comparable to BP-OSD-0 with a lower time overhead for Quantum Reed-Muller (QRM) codes in the code capacity setting, and Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes under circuit level noise. We provide a Python repository for use by the community and the results of our simulations.

Title: Fast Expectation Value Calculation Speedup of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: HoLCUs QAOA
Authors: Alejandro Mata Ali
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new method for calculating expectation values of operators that can be expressed as a linear combination of unitary (LCU) operators. This method allows to perform this calculation in a single quantum circuit measuring a single qubit, which speeds up the computation process. This method is general for any quantum algorithm and is of particular interest in the acceleration of variational quantum algorithms, both in real devices and in simulations. We analyze its application to the parameter optimization process of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the case of having degenerate values in the matrix of the Ising problem. Finally, we apply it to several Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems to analyze the speedup of the method in circuit simulators.

Title: Noisy-enhanced quantum search on complex networks
Authors: Ugo Nzongani, Andrea Simonetto, Giuseppe Di Molfetta
Abstract: The task of finding an element in an unstructured database is known as spatial search and can be expressed as a quantum walk evolution on a graph. In this Letter, we modify the usual search problem by adding an extra trapping vertex to the graph, which is only connected to the target element. The walker evolution is a mix between classical and quantum walk search dynamics. The balance between unitary and non-unitary dynamics is tuned with a parameter, and we numerically show that depending on the graph topology and the connectivity of the target element, this hybrid approach can outperform a purely classical or quantum evolution for reaching the trapping site. We show that this behavior is only observed in the presence of an extra trapping site, and that depending on the topology, the increase of non-unitary operations can be compensated by increasing the strength of the quantum walk exploration. This compensation comes at the cost of reducing the searching feature of the evolution induced by the Hamiltonian. We also relate the optimal hybrid regime to the entropy's decay rate. As the introduction of non-unitary operations may be considered as noise, we interpret this phenomena as a noisy-assisted quantum evolution.

Authors: Amir Shehata, Peter Groszkowski, Thomas Naughton, Murali Gopalakrishnan Meena, Elaine Wong, Daniel Claudino, Rafael Ferreira da Silvaa, Thomas Beck
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive software stack architecture for integrating quantum computing (QC) capabilities with High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. While quantum computers show promise as specialized accelerators for scientific computing, their effective integration with classical HPC systems presents significant technical challenges. We propose a hardware-agnostic software framework that supports both current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, while maintaining compatibility with existing HPC workflows. The architecture includes a quantum gateway interface, standardized APIs for resource management, and robust scheduling mechanisms to handle both simultaneous and interleaved quantum-classical workloads. Key innovations include: (1) a unified resource management system that efficiently coordinates quantum and classical resources, (2) a flexible quantum programming interface that abstracts hardware-specific details, (3) A Quantum Platform Manager API that simplifies the integration of various quantum hardware systems, and (4) a comprehensive tool chain for quantum circuit optimization and execution. We demonstrate our architecture through implementation of quantum-classical algorithms, including the variational quantum linear solver, showcasing the framework's ability to handle complex hybrid workflows while maximizing resource utilization. This work provides a foundational blueprint for integrating QC capabilities into existing HPC infrastructures, addressing critical challenges in resource management, job scheduling, and efficient data movement between classical and quantum resources.

Title: Eigenstate thermalization in spin-1/2 systems with SU(2) symmetry
Authors: Rohit Patil, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We study the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the eigenstates of the extended spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, which exhibits the non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry. We explore integrable and nonintegrable regimes, and consider observables that preserve the SU(2) symmetry of the Hamiltonian as well as observables that break it. We study in detail the low-frequency behavior of the off-diagonal matrix elements at and away from integrability. In the nonintegrable regime, we test the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, paying special attention to the effect of the spin, which is the novel conserved quantity introduced by the SU(2) symmetry.

Title: Surface Morphology Assisted Trapping of Strongly Coupled Electron-on-Neon Charge States
Authors: Kaiwen Zheng, Xingrui Song, Kater W. Murch
Abstract: Single electrons confined to a free neon surface and manipulated through the circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED) architecture is a promising novel quantum computing platform. Understanding the exact physical nature of the electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states is important for realizing this platform's potential for quantum technologies. We investigate how resonator trench depth and substrate surface properties influence the formation of eNe charge states and their coupling to microwave resonators. Through experimental observation supported by modeling, we find that shallow-depth etching of the resonator features maximizes coupling strength. By comparing the trapping statistics and surface morphology of devices with altered trench roughness, our work reveals the role of fabrication-induced surface features in the formation of strongly coupled eNe states.

Title: A Short History of Rocks: or, How to Invent Quantum Computing
Authors: David Wakeham
Abstract: This essay gives a short, informal account of the development of digital logic from the Pleistocene to the Manhattan Project, the introduction of reversible circuits, and Richard Feynman's allied proposal for quantum computing. We argue that Feynman's state-based analogy is not the only way to arrive at quantum computing, nor indeed the simplest. To illustrate, we imagine an alternate timeline in which John von Neumann skipped Operation Crossroads to debug a military computer, got tickled by the problem, and discovered a completely different picture of quantum computing - in 1946. Feynman suggested we "quantize" state, and turn classically reversible circuits into quantum reversible, unitary ones. In contrast, we speculate that von Neumann, with his background in functional analysis and quantum logic, would seek to "quantize" the operators of Boolean algebra, and with tools made available in 1946 could successfully do so. This leads to a simpler, more flexible circuit calculus and beautiful parallels to classical logic, as we detail in a forthcoming companion paper.

Title: Time-Irreversible Quantum-Classical Dynamics of Molecular Models in the Brain
Authors: Alessandro Sergi, Antonino Messina, Rosalba Saija, Gabriella Martino, Maria Teresa Caccamo, Min-Fang Kuo, Michael A. Nitsche
Abstract: This manuscript aims to illustrate a quantum-classical dissipative theory (suited to be converted to effective algorithms for numerical simulations) within the long-term project of studying molecular processes in the brain. Other approaches, briefly sketched in the text, have advocated the need to deal with both quantum and classical dynamic variables when studying the brain. At variance with these other frameworks, the manuscript's formalism allows us to explicitly treat the classical dynamical variables. The theory must be dissipative not because of formal requirements but because brain processes appear to be dissipative at the molecular, physiological, and high functional levels. We discuss theoretically that using Brownian dynamics or the Nosè-Hoover-Chain thermostat to perform computer simulations provides an effective way to introduce an arrow of time for open quantum systems in a classical environment. In the future, We plan to study classical models of neurons and astrocytes, as well as their networks, coupled to quantum dynamical variables describing, e.g., nuclear and electron spins, HOMO and LUMO orbitals of phenyl and indole rings, ion channels, and tunneling protons.

Title: Understanding Floquet Resonances in Ultracold Gas Scattering
Authors: Christoph Dauer, Axel Pelster, Sebastian Eggert
Abstract: Scattering by a short-range potential with time-periodic interaction strength is investigated with a Floquet-scattering theory. Sharp resonances occur, at which the s-wave scattering length can be tuned to large positive and negative values. We show that the shape of these resonances is described by a simple formula, and find that both resonance position and prefactor can be altered by the driving strength. Our approach allows to identify the physical origin of the scattering resonances as Floquet bound states with positive energies, which are dynamically created by the drive. This insight is valuable for a detailed analysis and uncovers a general resource for enhanced or reduced scattering in Floquet systems.

Title: A Study of Superconducting Behavior in Ruthenium Thin Films
Authors: Bernardo Langa Jr., Brooke Henry, Ivan Lainez, Richard Haight, Kasra Sardashti
Abstract: Ruthenium (Ru) is a promising candidate for the next-generation of electronic interconnects due to its low resistivity, small mean free path, and superior electromigration reliability at nanometer scales. Additionally, Ru exhibits superconductivity below 1 K, with resistance to oxidation, low diffusivity, and a small superconducting gap, making it a potential material for superconducting qubits and Josephson Junctions. Here, we investigate the superconducting behavior of Ru thin films (11.9 - 108.5 nm thick), observing transition temperatures from 657.9 mK to 557 mK. A weak thickness dependence appears in the thinnest films, followed by a conventional inverse thickness dependence in thicker films. Magnetotransport studies reveal type-II superconductivity in the dirty limit ({\xi} >> l), with coherence lengths ranging from 13.5 nm to 27 nm. Finally, oxidation resistance studies confirm minimal RuOx growth after seven weeks of air exposure. These findings provide key insights for integrating Ru into superconducting electronic devices.

Title: Current-driven collective control of helical spin texture in van der Waals antiferromagnet
Authors: Kai-Xuan Zhang, Suik Cheon, Hyuncheol Kim, Pyeongjae Park, Yeochan An, Suhan Son, Jingyuan Cui, Jihoon Keum, Joonyoung Choi, Younjung Jo, Hwiin Ju, Jong-Seok Lee, Youjin Lee, Maxim Avdeev, Armin Kleibert, Hyun-Woo Lee, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: Electrical control of quantum magnetic states is essential in spintronic science. Initial studies on the ferromagnetic state control were extended to collinear antiferromagnets and, more recently, noncollinear antiferromagnets. However, electrical control mechanisms of such exotic magnetic states remain poorly understood. Here, we report the first experimental and theoretical example of the current control of helical antiferromagnets, arising from the competition between collinear antiferromagnetic exchange and interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in new van-der-Waals (vdW) material Ni1/3NbS2. Due to the intrinsic broken inversion symmetry, an in-plane current generates spin-orbit torque that, in turn, interacts directly with the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our theoretical analyses indicate that a weak ferromagnetic order coexists due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, mediating the spin-orbit torque to collectively rotate the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our Ni1/3NbS2 nanodevice experiments produce current-dependent resistance change consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work widens our understanding of the electrical control of helical antiferromagnets and promotes vdW quantum magnets as interesting material platforms for electrical control.

Title: Theoretical Exploration of Phase Transitions in a Cavity-BEC System with Two Crossed Optical Pumps
Authors: Wei Qin, Dong-Chen Zheng, Zhao-Di Wu, Yuan-Hong Chen, Renyuan Liao
Abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) inside an optical cavity and two crossed coherent pump fields. We determine the phase boundary separating the normal superfluid phase and the superradiance phase, perturbatively. In the regime of negative cavity detuning, we map out the phase diagrams both for an attractive and a repulsive optical lattice. It turns out that the situation is quite different in two cases. Specifically, in the case of attractive lattice, if a system is in the superradiant phase with one pump laser, adding another pump does not drive the system out of the superradiance phase. While for the repulsive lattice, increasing another pump potential have suppressive effects on the superradiance. We also find that, in the case of attractive lattice, equally increasing two pump lattice potentials can induce a transition from the normal phase to the superradiance phase. In stark contrast, for the repulsive lattice, the system will remain in the normal phase as the pump depths are tuned within a wide range, independent of the cavity detuning and the decay rate.

Title: Extracting RABBITT-like phase information from time-dependent transient absorption spectra
Authors: J. Jakob, C. Bauer, M.-J. Ilhan, D. Bharti, C. Ott, T. Pfeifer, K. Bartschat, A. Harth
Abstract: We explore how the spectral phase of atto\-second pulse trains influences the optical cross section in transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The interaction of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and time-delayed near-infrared (NIR) fields with an atomic or molecular system governs the dynamics. As already shown in RABBITT experiments, the spectral phase of the XUV pulses can be extracted from the photoionization spectrum as a function of the time delay. Similarly, this XUV phase imprints itself on delay-dependent optical cross-section oscillations. With a perturbative analytical approach and by simulating the quantum dynamics both in a few-level model and via solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for atomic hydrogen, we reveal the similarity between the spectral phase in RABBITT and TA spectroscopy.

Title: Mediated Interactions and Damping Effects in Superfluid Mixtures of Bose and Fermi Gases
Authors: Dong-Chen Zheng, Yu-Xin Liao, Wen Lin, Renyuan Liao
Abstract: We investigate the homogeneous superfluid mixtures of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer~(BCS) superfluid originating from pairing two-species fermionic atoms and superfluidity stemming from condensation of bosonic atoms. By integrating out the freedoms associated with the BCS superfluid, we derive the fermion-mediated interactions between bosons, which is attractive and can be tuned from long range in the BCS region to short range in the region of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of molecular dimers. By analyzing the Bogoliubov spectrum and the damping rate of bosonic superfluid, we map out the phase diagram spanned by the boson-fermion mass ratio and the boson-fermion coupling strength, which consists of a phase separation region and two phase mixing regions with and without Landau damping. The three different phases can coexist at a tricritical point, which moves toward low boson-fermion mass ratio and high boson-fermion scattering length as the fermion-fermion interaction strength is tuned up on the BCS side.

Title: Light-controlled strong coupling of optical cavity modes spaced by 200 THz
Authors: Lavanya Taneja, David I Schuster, Jonathan Simon
Abstract: Cavities have driven significant advances in optical physics and quantum science, with applications ranging from lasers and spectroscopy to quantum information processing, simulation and metrology. For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-Pérot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $>$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.

Title: Extended Haldane model -- a modern gateway to topological insulators
Authors: Tanay Nag, Saptarshi Mandal
Abstract: The seminal Haldane model brings up a paradigm beyond the quantum Hall effect to look for a plethora of topological phases in the honeycomb and other lattices. Here we dwell into this model considering a full parameter space in the presence of spin-orbit interaction as well as Zeeman field such that the flavour of Kane-Mele model is invoked. Adopting this extended Haldane model as an example, we elucidate, in a transparent manner, a number of topological features in a pedagogical manner. First, we describe various first order topological insulator phases and their characterizations while explaining various anomalous quantum Hall effects and quantum spin Hall effects in the extended Haldane model. Second, we demonstrate the concepts of higher order topological insulator phases along with the topological invariants in the anisotropic limit of the extended Haldane model. At the end, we discuss various open issues involving \textcolor{black}{emergent or extended} symmetries that might lead to a broader understanding of various topological phases and the associated criteria behind their emergence.

Title: False vacuum decay in triamond lattice gauge theory
Authors: Ali H. Z. Kavaki, Randy Lewis
Abstract: The transition from a false vacuum to the true vacuum is a real-time phenomenon of interest in many contexts. It represents a special challenge for strongly interacting non-Abelian gauge theories because standard spacetime lattices incorporate imaginary time from the outset. To attain real-time phenomena, Hamiltonian lattice methods are being developed for quantum computers. The present work considers SU(2) gauge theory on a minimal lattice in three spatial dimensions, where round-the-world strings called torelons can travel and interact. This minimal 3D lattice has a triamond structure whose properties are elucidated by calculating the spectrum of torelon states. Then, by introducing a twisted boundary condition, real-time evolution is used to demonstrate the decay of a false vacuum. Calculations in the present work are done on classical computers except for one benchmark study of imaginary time evolution that ran on the ibm_brisbane quantum computer.

Title: Deconfined criticality as intrinsically gapless topological state in one dimension
Authors: Sheng Yang, Fu Xu, Da-Chuan Lu, Yi-Zhuang You, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.

Title: Beyond Born-Oppenheimer Green's function theories: absolute and relational
Authors: Ville J. Härkönen
Abstract: We consider quantum field theoretic many-body Green's function approach to solve the Coulomb many-body problem. The earlier beyond Born-Oppenheimer Green's function theories are absolute in nature and are based on the non-reduced Hamiltonian. Motivated by the issues following this approach we have developed a reduced Green's function theory which is relational in nature. The central differences between these approaches trace back to the relational-absolute debate, which has continued for over two thousand years since the time of Aristotle and still persists today. We highlight that these aspects of the theories are connected to several areas of modern physics, including relational quantum mechanics, quantum reference frames, superselection rules, the separation of different types of motion and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The starting point of any such exact theory must be absolute, given that the global conservation laws hold. However, for the observables to be meaningful, they must be defined with respect to the relative space. Approximations, such as the one introduced by Born and Oppenheimer, can break global symmetries and make certain parts of the absolute description well-defined. We highlight that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not necessary to explain the existence of solids, but entities such as phonons can be naturally explained within the relational theory.

Title: Leap into the future: shortcut to dynamics for quantum mixtures
Authors: Pablo Capuzzi, Zehra Akdeniz, Patrizia Vignolo
Abstract: The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution. Just like the fast-forward button in a movie player that allows to quickly reach the part of the movie one wants to watch, it is a leap into the future.

Abstract: The concept of synthetic dimensions has emerged as a powerful framework in photonics and atomic physics, enabling the exploration of high-dimensional physics beyond conventional spatial constraints. Originally developed for quantum simulations in high dimensions, synthetic dimensions have since demonstrated advantages in designing novel Hamiltonians and manipulating quantum or optical states for exploring topological physics, and for applications in computing and information processing. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of progress in synthetic dimensions across photonic, atomic, and other physical platforms over the past decade. We showcase different approaches used to construct synthetic dimensions and highlight key physical phenomena enabled by the advantage of such a framework. By offering a unified perspective on developments in this field, we aim to provide insights into how synthetic dimensions can bridge fundamental physics and applied technologies, fostering interdisciplinary engagement in quantum simulation, atomic and photonic engineering, and information processing.

Title: Confinement-induced unatomic trimer states in mass-imbalanced systems
Authors: Rafael M. Francisco, D. S. Rosa, T. Frederico, M. T. Yamashita, G. Krein
Abstract: As resonantly interacting trimers of the type AAB are progressively squeezed from $D=3$ to $D=2$, unatomic states emerge. We calculated the contacts from the high momentum tail of the single particle densities. The sharp increase of the contacts serves as a signature of the transition between the Efimov and unatomic regimes, characterized by the emergence of continuous scale invariance when the system reaches a critical dimension, $D_c$. This continuous scale invariance starts to dominate the behavior of the system at the dimension $\overline{D}<D_c$, below which the trimers momentum distribution tails exhibit a power-law behavior signaling the unatomic regime. To illustrate our findings, we studied compounds of the forms $^{7}$Li$-^{23}$Na$_{2}$, $^{7}$Li$-^{87}$Rb$_{2}$ and $^{7}$Li$-^{133}$Cs$_{2}$. The increase in the mass-imbalance of the trimers reduces the interval between $D_c$ and $\overline{D}$. The emergence of unatomic states can be experimentally verified by observing the two-body contact parameter, which is a quantity directly related to the thermodynamic properties of the gas.

Title: Universal whirling magnetic orders in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type quasicrystal approximants
Authors: Farid Labib, Kazuhiro Nawa, Yusuke Nambu, Hiroyuki Takakura, Yoichi Ikeda, Kazuhiko Deguchi, Masato Matsuura, Asuka Ishikawa, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Kazuhiko Ikeuchi, Taku J. Sato, Ryuji Tamura
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.

Title: Unconditionally stable time discretization of Lindblad master equations in infinite dimension using quantum channels
Authors: Rémi Robin, Pierre Rouchon, Lev-Arcady Sellem
Abstract: We examine the time discretization of Lindblad master equations in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our study is motivated by the fact that, with unbounded Lindbladian, projecting the evolution onto a finite-dimensional subspace using a Galerkin approximation inherently introduces stiffness, leading to a Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy type condition for explicit integration schemes. We propose and establish the convergence of a family of explicit numerical schemes for time discretization adapted to infinite dimension. These schemes correspond to quantum channels and thus preserve the physical properties of quantum evolutions on the set of density operators: linearity, complete positivity and trace. Numerical experiments inspired by bosonic quantum codes illustrate the practical interest of this approach when approximating the solution of infinite dimensional problems by that of finite dimensional problems of increasing dimension.

Title: The Coherent Forward Scattering peak: a probe of non-ergodicity and symmetries in a quantum chaotic system
Authors: F. Arrouas, J. Hébraud, N. Ombredane, E. Flament, D. Ronco, N. Dupont, G. Lemarié, B. Georgeot, Ch. Miniatura, J. Billy, B. Peaudecerf, D. Guéry-Odelin
Abstract: The Coherent Backscattering (CBS) peak is a well-known interferential signature of weak localization in disordered or chaotic systems. Recently, it was realized that another interferential peak, the Coherent Forward Scattering (CFS) peak, emerges in the presence of strong localization. This peak has never been observed directly to date. We report the first direct observation of the CFS peak and demonstrate its dual role as signature of non-ergodicity and as probe of symmetries in quantum chaotic systems. Using a shaken rotor model realized with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms in a modulated optical lattice, we investigate dynamical localization in momentum space. The CFS peak emerges in the position distribution as a consequence of non-ergodic dynamics, while its growth timescale depends critically on the localization scale. By finely tuning the modulation, we control the symmetries of the dynamics (time-reversal and parity) and measure their impact on both CFS and CBS peaks. Our results highlight the strong link of CFS and its temporal growth with symmetry and localization properties, establishing CFS as a robust quantitative marker of non-ergodicity. This work opens new avenues for characterizing non-ergodicity and symmetries in quantum chaotic or disordered systems, with possible applications in many-body localization and many-body chaos.

Title: Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field
Authors: Benjamin D. Woods
Abstract: The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.

Title: A projected complex Langevin sampling method for bosons in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles
Authors: Ethan C. McGarrigle, Hector D. Ceniceros, Glenn H. Fredrickson
Abstract: We introduce a projected complex Langevin (CL) numerical sampling method -- a fictitious Langevin dynamics scheme that uses numerical projection to sample a constrained stationary distribution with highly oscillatory character. Despite the complex-valued degrees of freedom and associated sign-problem, the projected CL method succeeds as a natural extension of real-valued projected Langevin processes. In the new proposed method, complex-valued Lagrange multipliers are determined to enforce constraints to machine precision at each iteration. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we adapt the projected CL method to sample coherent state quantum field theories describing interacting Bose gases, which are realized in modern cold-atom experiments. We apply projected CL to two scenarios with holomorphic constraints, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, and show that projected CL reproduces the correct thermodynamic observables. We further observe improved numerical stability and accuracy at larger timesteps when compared to the previous state-of-the-art method for performing constrained CL sampling.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins
Authors: Lei Su
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.

Title: Power and temperature dependent model for High Q superconductors
Authors: Ashish Alexander ((1) Laboratory for Physical Sciences, University of Maryland (2) Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland), Christopher G. Weddle ((1) Laboratory for Physical Sciences, University of Maryland), Christopher J.K. Richardson ((1) Laboratory for Physical Sciences, University of Maryland (3) Department of Material Science and Engineering, University of Maryland)
Abstract: Measuring the internal quality factor of coplanar waveguide superconducting resonators is an established method of determining small losses in superconducting devices. Traditionally, the resonator losses are only attributed to two-level system (TLS) defects using a power dependent model for the quality factor. However, excess non-equilibrium quasiparticles can also limit the quality factor of the planar superconducting resonators used in circuit quantum electrodynamics. At millikelvin temperatures, quasiparticles can be generated by breaking Cooper pairs via a single high-energy or multiple sub-gap photons. Here a two-temperature, power and temperature dependent model is proposed to evaluate resonator losses for isolating TLS and quasiparticle loss simultaneously. The model combines the conventional TLS power and temperature dependence with an effective temperature non-equilibrium quasiparticle description of the superconducting loss. The quasiparticle description is based on the quasiparticle number density calculated using rate equations for an external quasiparticle generation source, recombination, and trapping. The number density is translated to an effective temperature using a thermal distribution that may be different from the bath. Experimental measurements of high-quality factor resonators fabricated from single crystal aluminum and titanium nitride thin films on silicon are interpreted with the presented model. This approach enables identification of quasiparticle and TLS loss, resulting in the determination that the TiN resonator has comparable TLS and quasiparticle loss at low power and low-temperature, while the low-temperature Al resonator behavior is dominated by non-equilibrium quasiparticle loss.

Title: Optimization in quantum metrology and entanglement theory using semidefinite programming
Authors: Árpád Lukács, Róbert Trényi, Tamás Vértesi, Géza Tóth
Abstract: We discuss efficient methods to optimize the metrological performance over local Hamiltonians in a bipartite quantum system. For a given quantum state, our methods find the best local Hamiltonian for which the state outperforms separable states the most from the point of view of quantum metrology. We show that this problem can be reduced to maximize the quantum Fisher information over a certain set of Hamiltonians. We present the quantum Fisher information in a bilinear form and maximize it by an iterative see-saw (ISS) method, in which each step is based on semidefinite programming. We also solve the problem with the method of moments that works very well for smaller systems. We consider a number of other problems in quantum information theory that can be solved in a similar manner. For instance, we determine the bound entangled quantum states that maximally violate the Computable Cross Norm-Realignment (CCNR) criterion. Our approach is one of the efficient methods that can be applied for an optimization of the unitary dynamics in quantum metrology, the other methods being, for example, machine learning, variational quantum circuits, or neural networks. The advantage of our method is the fast and robust convergence due to the simple mathematical structure of the approach.

Title: Thermalization of the Quantum Planar Rotor with external potential
Authors: Birthe Schrinski, Yoon Jun Chan, Björn Schrinski
Abstract: We study decoherence, diffusion, friction, and how they thermalize a planar rotor in the presence of an external potential. Representing the quantum master equation in terms of auxiliary Wigner functions in periodic phase space not only illustrates the thermalization process in a concise way, but also allows for an efficient numerical evaluation of the open quantum dynamics and its approximate analytical description. In particular, we analytically and numerically verify the existence of a steady state that, in the high-temperature regime, closely approximates a Gibbs state. We also derive the proper classical limit of the planar rotor time evolution and present exemplary numerical studies to verify our results.

Title: Multidimensional Quantum Walks, with Application to $k$-Distinctness
Authors: Stacey Jeffery, Sebastian Zur
Abstract: While the quantum query complexity of $k$-distinctness is known to be $O\left(n^{3/4-1/4(2^k-1)}\right)$ for any constant $k \geq 4$, the best previous upper bound on the time complexity was $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{1-1/k}\right)$. We give a new upper bound of $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{3/4-1/4(2^k-1)}\right)$ on the time complexity, matching the query complexity up to polylogarithmic factors. In order to achieve this upper bound, we give a new technique for designing quantum walk search algorithms, which is an extension of the electric network framework. We also show how to solve the welded trees problem in $O(n)$ queries and $O(n^2)$ time using this new technique, showing that the new quantum walk framework can achieve exponential speedups.

Title: Characterizing the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick excited spectrum through the quantum coherence spectrum
Authors: Qian Wang, Francisco Pérez-Bernal
Abstract: Excited-state quantum phase transitions extend the quantum phase transition concept beyond the ground state and offer insights into the complex behavior of quantum systems. In the present work, we assess the use of the multiple quantum coherence spectrum as a valid tool to probe excited state quantum phase transitions within the framework of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. The time dependence and the long-time average of the multiple quantum coherence spectrum reveal the intricate dynamics that stems from the existence of singularities in the excited spectrum of a quantum many-body system.

Title: Quantum memory assisted observable estimation
Authors: Liubov A. Markovich, Attaallah Almasi, Sina Zeytinoğlu, Johannes Borregaard
Abstract: The estimation of many-qubit observables is an essential task of quantum information processing. The generally applicable approach is to decompose the observables into weighted sums of multi-qubit Pauli strings, i.e., tensor products of single-qubit Pauli matrices, which can readily be measured with single qubit rotations. The accumulation of shot noise in this approach, however, severely limits the achievable variance for a finite number of measurements. We introduce a novel method, dubbed Coherent Pauli Summation (CPS) that circumvents this limitation by exploiting access to a single-qubit quantum memory in which measurement information can be stored and accumulated. Our algorithm offers a reduction in the required number of measurements for a given variance that scales linearly with the number of Pauli strings of the decomposed observable. Our work demonstrates how a single long-coherence qubit memory can assist the operation of noisy many-qubit quantum devices in a cardinal task.

Title: Reinforcement learning optimization of the charging of a Dicke quantum battery
Authors: Paolo Andrea Erdman, Gian Marcello Andolina, Vittorio Giovannetti, Frank Noé
Abstract: Quantum batteries are energy-storing devices, governed by quantum mechanics, that promise high charging performance thanks to collective effects. Due to its experimental feasibility, the Dicke battery - which comprises $N$ two-level systems coupled to a common photon mode - is one of the most promising designs for quantum batteries. However, the chaotic nature of the model severely hinders the extractable energy (ergotropy). Here, we use reinforcement learning to optimize the charging process of a Dicke battery either by modulating the coupling strength, or the system-cavity detuning. We find that the ergotropy and quantum mechanical energy fluctuations (charging precision) can be greatly improved with respect to standard charging strategies by countering the detrimental effect of quantum chaos. Notably, the collective speedup of the charging time can be preserved even when nearly fully charging the battery.

Title: Clifford Assisted Optimal Pass Selection for Quantum Transpilation
Authors: Siddharth Dangwal, Gokul Subramanian Ravi, Lennart Maximilian Seifert, Poulami Das, James Sud, Frederic T. Chong
Abstract: The fidelity of quantum programs in the NISQ era is limited by high levels of device noise. To increase the fidelity of quantum programs running on NISQ devices, a variety of optimizations have been proposed. These include mapping passes, routing passes, scheduling methods and standalone optimisations which are usually incorporated into a transpiler as passes. Popular transpilers such as those proposed by Qiskit, Cirq and Cambridge Quantum Computing make use of these extensively. However, choosing the right set of transpiler passes and the right configuration for each pass is a challenging problem. Transpilers often make critical decisions using heuristics since the ideal choices are impossible to identify without knowing the target application outcome. Further, the transpiler also makes simplifying assumptions about device noise that often do not hold in the real world. As a result, we often see effects where the fidelity of a target application decreases despite using state-of-the-art optimisations. To overcome this challenge, we propose OPTRAN, a framework for Choosing an Optimal Pass Set for Quantum Transpilation. OPTRAN uses classically simulable quantum circuits composed entirely of Clifford gates, that resemble the target application, to estimate how different passes interact with each other in the context of the target application. OPTRAN then uses this information to choose the optimal combination of passes that maximizes the target application's fidelity when run on the actual device. Our experiments on IBM machines show that OPTRAN improves fidelity by 87.66% of the maximum possible limit over the baseline used by IBM Qiskit. We also propose low-cost variants of OPTRAN, called OPTRAN-E-3 and OPTRAN-E-1 that improve fidelity by 78.33% and 76.66% of the maximum permissible limit over the baseline at a 58.33% and 69.44% reduction in cost compared to OPTRAN respectively.

Title: Local Purity Distillation in Quantum Systems: Exploring the Complementarity Between Purity and Entanglement
Authors: Ray Ganardi, Piotr Masajada, Moein Naseri, Alexander Streltsov
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics and quantum entanglement represent two pivotal quantum resource theories with significant relevance in quantum information science. Despite their importance, the intricate relationship between these two theories is still not fully understood. Here, we delve into the interplay between entanglement and thermodynamics, particularly in the context of local cooling processes. We introduce and develop the framework of Gibbs-preserving local operations and classical communication. Within this framework, we explore strategies enabling remote parties to effectively cool their local systems to the ground state. Our analysis is centered on scenarios where only a single copy of a quantum state is accessible, with the ideal performance defined by the highest possible fidelity to the ground state achievable under these constraints. We focus on systems with fully degenerate local Hamiltonians, where local cooling aligns with the extraction of local purity. In this context, we establish a powerful link between the efficiency of local purity extraction and the degree of entanglement present in the system, a concept we define as purity-entanglement complementarity. Moreover, we demonstrate that in many pertinent scenarios, the optimal performance can be precisely determined through semidefinite programming techniques. Our findings open doors to various practical applications, including techniques for entanglement detection and estimation. We demonstrate this by evaluating the amount of entanglement for a class of bound entangled states.

Title: Bridging Classical and Quantum Machine Learning: Knowledge Transfer From Classical to Quantum Neural Networks Using Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Mohammad Junayed Hasan, M.R.C.Mahdy
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs), harnessing superposition and entanglement, have shown potential to surpass classical methods in complex learning tasks but remain limited by hardware constraints and noisy conditions. In this work, we present a novel framework for transferring knowledge from classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to QNNs via knowledge distillation, thereby reducing the need for resource intensive quantum training and error mitigation. We conduct extensive experiments using two parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with 4 and 8 qubits on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. The approach demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements attributed to distilled knowledge from larger classical networks. Through ablation studies, we systematically compare the effect of state of the art dimensionality reduction techniques fully connected layers, center cropping, principal component analysis, and pooling to compress high-dimensional image data prior to quantum encoding. Our findings reveal that fully connected layers retain the most salient features for QNN inference, thereby surpassing other down sampling approaches. Additionally, we examine state of the art data encoding methods (amplitude, angle, and qubit encoding) and identify amplitude encoding as the optimal strategy, yielding superior accuracy across all tested datasets and qubit configurations. Through computational analyses, we show that our distilled 4-qubit and 8-qubit QNNs achieve competitive performance while utilizing significantly fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. Our results establish a promising paradigm for bridging classical deep learning and emerging quantum computing, paving the way for more powerful, resource conscious models in quantum machine intelligence.

Title: Quantum time dynamics mediated by the Yang-Baxter equation and artificial neural networks
Authors: Sahil Gulania, Yuri Alexeev, Stephen K. Gray, Bo Peng, Niranjan Govind
Abstract: Quantum computing shows great potential, but errors pose a significant challenge. This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error mitigation methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. We developed a novel method that combines ANN for noise mitigation combined with the YBE to generate noisy data. This approach effectively reduces noise in quantum simulations, enhancing the accuracy of the results. The YBE rigorously preserves quantum correlations and symmetries in spin chain simulations in certain classes of integrable lattice models, enabling effective compression of quantum circuits while retaining linear scalability with the number of qubits. This compression facilitates both full and partial implementations, allowing the generation of noisy quantum data on hardware alongside noiseless simulations using classical platforms. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating errors in time-evolving quantum states, providing a scalable framework to enhance quantum computation fidelity, particularly in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by performing quantum time dynamics simulations using the Heisenberg XY Hamiltonian on real quantum devices.

Title: Grover's algorithm in a four-qubit silicon processor above the fault-tolerant threshold
Authors: Ian Thorvaldson, Dean Poulos, Christian M. Moehle, Saiful H. Misha, Hermann Edlbauer, Jonathan Reiner, Helen Geng, Benoit Voisin, Michael T. Jones, Matthew B. Donnelly, Luis F. Pena, Charles D. Hill, Casey R. Myers, Joris G. Keizer, Yousun Chung, Samuel K. Gorman, Ludwik Kranz, Michelle Y. Simmons
Abstract: Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with >99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum processors.

Title: Variational quantum simulation: a case study for understanding warm starts
Authors: Ricard Puig, Marc Drudis, Supanut Thanasilp, Zoë Holmes
Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time-step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial size time-steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training. While our main focus is on this case study of variational quantum simulation, we end by discussing how our results work in other iterative settings.

Title: Inertial Torsion Noise in Matter-Wave Interferometers for Gravity Experiments
Authors: Meng-Zhi Wu, Marko Toroš, Sougato Bose, Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is susceptible to non-inertial noise sources, which can induce dephasing and a resulting loss of interferometric visibility. Here, we focus on inertial torsion noise (ITN), which arises from the rotational motion of the experimental apparatus suspended by a thin wire and subject to random external torques. We provide analytical expressions for the ITN noise starting from generalized Langevin equations describing the experimental box which can then be used together with the transfer function to obtain the dephasing factor. We verify the theoretical modelling and the validity of the approximations using Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining good agreement between theory and numerics. As an application, we estimate the size of the effects for the next generation of interferometry experiments with femtogram particles, which could be used as the building block for entanglement-based tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We find that the ambient gas is a weak source of ITN, posing mild restrictions on the ambient pressure and temperature. We discuss the general ITN constraints by assuming a Langevin equation parameterized by three phenomenological parameters.

Title: Imaginary-Stark Skin Effect
Authors: Heng Lin, Jinghui Pi, Yunyao Qi, Wei Qin, Franco Nori, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: A unique phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), namely the boundary localization of continuous-spectrum eigenstates. However, studies on the NHSE in systems without translational invariance are still limited. Here, we unveil a new class of NHSE, dubbed the imaginary-Stark skin effect (ISSE), in a one-dimensional lossy lattice with a spatially increasing loss rate. This ISSE is beyond the framework of non-Bloch band theory and exhibits intriguing properties significantly different from the conventional NHSE. Specifically, the energy spectrum of our model has a T-shaped feature, with approximately half of the eigenstates localized at the left boundary. Furthermore, each skin mode can be expressed as a single stable, exponentially-decaying wave within the bulk region. Such peculiar behaviors are analyzed via the transfer-matrix method, whose eigendecomposition quantifies the formation of the ISSE. Our work provides new insights into the NHSE in systems without translational symmetry and contributes to the understanding of non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Conservation Laws For Every Quantum Measurement Outcome
Authors: Daniel Collins, Sandu Popescu
Abstract: In the paradigmatic example of quantum measurements, whenever one measures a system which starts in a superposition of two states of a conserved quantity, it jumps to one of the two states, implying different final values for the quantity that should have been conserved. The standard law of conservation for quantum mechanics handles this jump by stating only that the total distribution of the conserved quantity over repeated measurements is unchanged, but states nothing about individual cases. Here however we show that one can go beyond this and have conservation in each individual instance. We made our arguments in the case of angular momentum of a particle on a circle, where many technicalities simplify, and bring arguments to show that this holds in full generality. Hence we argue that the conservation law in quantum mechanics should be rewritten, to go beyond its hitherto statistical formulation, to state that the total of a conserved quantity is unchanged in every individual measurement outcome. As a further crucial element, we show that conservation can be localised at the level of the system of interest and its relevant frame of reference, and is independent on any assumptions on the distribution of the conserved quantity over the entire universe.

Title: Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models
Authors: Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Federico Garcia-Gaitan, David J. Strachan, Petr Plechac, Stephen R. Clark, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.

Title: Robust ultra-shallow shadows
Authors: Renato M. S. Farias, Raghavendra D. Peddinti, Ingo Roth, Leandro Aolita
Abstract: We present a robust shadow estimation protocol for wide classes of low-depth measurement circuits that mitigates noise as long as the effective measurement map including noise is locally unitarily invariant. This is in practice an excellent approximation, encompassing for instance the case of ideal single-qubit Clifford gates composing the first circuit layer of an otherwise arbitrary circuit architecture and even non-Markovian, gate-dependent noise in the rest of the circuit. We argue that for weakly-correlated local noise, the measurement channel has an efficient matrix-product representation, and show how to estimate this directly from experimental data using tensor-network tools, eliminating the need for analytical or numeric calculations. We illustrate the relevance of our method with both numerics and proof-of-principle experiments on an IBM Quantum device. Numerically, we show that unmitigated shallow shadows with noisy circuits become more biased as the depth increases. In contrast, using the same number of samples, robust ultra-shallow shadows become more precise with increasing depth for relevant parameter regimes. The gain in sample efficiency is still limited by the noise per gate, resulting in an optimal circuit depth per noise level. Experimentally, we observe improved precision in two simple fidelity estimation tasks using five-qubit circuits with up to two layers of entangling gates, by about an order of magnitude. Under the practical constraints of current and near-term noisy quantum devices, our method maximally realizes the potential of shadow estimation with global rotations and identifies its fundamental limitations in the presence of noise.

Title: Measurement of Many-Body Quantum Correlations in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Kamal Sharma, Wade DeGottardi
Abstract: Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.

Title: On the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect and the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem
Authors: Masashi Wakamatsu
Abstract: The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integrals of the time-dependent vector potential along paths in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Owing to the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, this closed line-integral of the vector potential can be related to the integral of the electric and magnetic fields over the 2-dimensional area, the boundary of which is given by the above-mentioned closed path. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators based on the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In the present paper, we carefully reanalyze their cancellation argument by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of the time-dependent external electromagnetic potential combined with more careful treatment of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem. Careful analysis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem shows that the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is partially correct but their central claim that only the time-independent part of the magnetic field contributes to the AB-phase shift so that there is no time-dependent AB-effect is not justified, thereby supporting likely existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.

Title: Exploiting Spatial Diversity in Earth-to-Satellite Quantum-Classical Communications
Authors: Ziqing Wang, Timothy C. Ralph, Ryan Aguinaldo, Robert Malaney
Abstract: Despite being an integral part of the vision of quantum Internet, Earth-to-satellite (uplink) quantum communications have been considered more challenging than their satellite-to-Earth (downlink) counterparts due to the severe channel-loss fluctuations (fading) induced by atmospheric turbulence. The question of how to address the negative impact of fading on Earth-to-satellite quantum communications remains largely an open issue. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting spatial diversity as a means of fading mitigation in Earth-to-satellite Continuous-Variable (CV) quantum-classical optical communications. We demonstrate, via both our theoretical analyses of quantum-state evolution and our detailed numerical simulations of uplink optical channels, that the use of spatial diversity can improve the effectiveness of entanglement distribution through the use of multiple transmitting ground stations and a single satellite with multiple receiving apertures. We further show that the transfer of both large (classically-encoded) and small (quantum-modulated) coherent states can benefit from the use of diversity over fading channels. Our work represents the first quantitative investigation into the use of spatial diversity for satellite-based quantum communications in the uplink direction, showing under what circumstances this fading-mitigation paradigm, which has been widely adopted in classical communications, can be helpful within the context of Earth-to-satellite CV quantum communications.

Title: Circuit Partitioning and Transmission Cost Optimization in Distributed Quantum Circuits
Authors: Xinyu Chen, Zilu Chen, Pengcheng Zhu, Xueyun Cheng, Zhijin Guan
Abstract: Given the limitations on the number of qubits in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the implementation of large-scale quantum algorithms on such devices is challenging, prompting research into distributed quantum computing. This paper focuses on the issue of excessive communication complexity in distributed quantum computing based on the quantum circuit model. To reduce the number of quantum state transmissions, i.e., the transmission cost, in distributed quantum circuits, a circuit partitioning method based on the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model is proposed, coupled with the lookahead method for transmission cost optimization. Initially, the problem of distributed quantum circuit partitioning is transformed into a graph minimum cut problem. The QUBO model, which can be accelerated by quantum annealing algorithms, is introduced to minimize the number of quantum gates between quantum processing units (QPUs) and the transmission cost. Subsequently, the dynamic lookahead strategy for the selection of transmission qubits is proposed to optimize the transmission cost in distributed quantum circuits. Finally, through numerical simulations, the impact of different circuit partitioning indicators on the transmission cost is explored, and the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed circuit partitioning method has a shorter runtime compared with current circuit partitioning methods. Additionally, the transmission cost optimized by the proposed method is significantly lower than that of current transmission cost optimization methods, achieving noticeable improvements across different numbers of partitions.

Title: Interpretation of wave function by coherent ensembles of trajectories
Authors: Vladimir V. Kisil
Abstract: We re-use some original ideas of de~Broglie, Schrödiger, Dirac and Feynman to revise the ensemble interpretation of wave function in quantum mechanics. To this end we introduce coherence (auto-concordance) of ensembles of quantum trajectories in the space-time. The coherence condition accounts phases proportional to classical action, which are in foundation of the Feynman path integral technique. Therefore, our interpretation is entirely based on well-known and tested concepts and methods of wave mechanics. Similarly to other ensemble interpretations our approach allows us to avoid all problems and paradoxes related to wave function collapse during a measurement process. Another consequence is that no quantum computation or quantum cryptography method will ever work if it assumes that a particular q-bit represents the entire wave function.

Title: Binarisation of multi-outcome measurements in high-dimensional quantum correlation experiments
Authors: Armin Tavakoli, Roope Uola, Jef Pauwels
Abstract: High-dimensional systems are an important frontier for photonic quantum correlation experiments. These correlation tests commonly prescribe measurements with many possible outcomes but they are often implemented through many individual binary-outcome measurements that use only a single-detector. Here, we discuss how this binarisation procedure for multi-outcome measurements can open a loophole, unless specific device-characterisation assumptions are satisfied. We highlight that correlation tests designed for multi-outcome measurements can be trivialised in binarised implementations and we then show how to accurately analyse binarised data to reveal its quantum features. For seminal types of correlation experiments, such as Bell inequality tests, steering tests and prepare-and-measure experiments, we find that binarisation may incur a sizable cost in the magnitude of quantum advantages. This emphasizes the importance of both accurate data analysis and implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements in high-dimensional correlation experiments.

Title: Speeding Up Quantum Measurement Using Space-Time Trade-Off
Authors: C. Corlett, I. Čepaitė, A. J. Daley, C. Gustiani, G. Pelegrí, J. D. Pritchard, N. Linden, P. Skrzypczyk
Abstract: We present a scheme for speeding up quantum measurement. The scheme builds on previous protocols that entangle the system to be measured with ancillary systems. In the idealised situation of perfect entangling operations and no decoherence, it gives an exact space-time trade-off meaning the readout speed increases linearly with the number of ancilla. We verify this scheme is robust against experimental imperfections through numerical modelling of gate noise and readout errors, and under certain circumstances our scheme can even lead to better than linear improvement in the speed of measurement with the number of systems measured. This hardware-agnostic approach is broadly applicable to a range of quantum technology platforms and offers a route to accelerate mid-circuit measurement as required for effective quantum error correction.

Title: Quantum machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection: A review
Authors: Sebastiano Corli, Lorenzo Moro, Daniele Dragoni, Massimiliano Dispenza, Enrico Prati
Abstract: The advent of quantum computers has justified the development of quantum machine learning algorithms , based on the adaptation of the principles of machine learning to the formalism of qubits. Among such quantum algorithms, anomaly detection represents an important problem crossing several disciplines from cybersecurity, to fraud detection to particle physics. We summarize the key concepts involved in quantum computing, introducing the formal concept of quantum speed up. The review provides a structured map of anomaly detection based on quantum machine learning. We have grouped existing algorithms according to the different learning methods, namely quantum supervised, quantum unsupervised and quantum reinforcement learning, respectively. We provide an estimate of the hardware resources to provide sufficient computational power in the future. The review provides a systematic and compact understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. We eventually provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the learning methods in real application domains.

Title: Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement
Authors: Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.

Title: Interference of photons from independent hot atoms
Authors: Jaromír Mika, Stuti Joshi, Robin Kaiser, Lukáš Slodička
Abstract: The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. Presented interferometry promises direct applications in Doppler-free atomic and molecular spectroscopy.

Title: Reservoir-engineered two-mode squeezing in an optomechanical cavity
Authors: Muhdin Abdo Wodedo, Tesfay Gebremariam Tesfahannes, Tewodros Yirgashewa Darge, Berihu Teklu
Abstract: We propose a scheme that optimizes entanglement in nanomechanical resonators through quantum state transfer of squeezed fields assisted by radiation pressure. The system is driven by red-detuned laser fields, which enable simultaneous cooling of the mechanical resonators while facilitating the transfer of quantum states in a weak coupling, sideband-resolved regime. The mechanical entanglement is quantified using logarithmic negativity within the bipartite Gaussian states of the two mechanical modes. Our results show that the degree of mechanical entanglement is strongly influenced by several key parameters, including the parametric phase and nonlinear gain of the non-degenerate OPA, the squeezing strength of the injected squeezed vacuum reservoir, optomechanical cooperativity (controlled by laser drive power), and the mechanical bath temperature (phonon thermal excitation). Additionally, our results indicate that careful tuning of these parameters can enhance entanglement robustness, suggesting that this optomechanical scheme holds promise for applications in quantum sensing and information processing.

Title: New random compiler for Hamiltonians via Markov Chains
Authors: Benoît Dubus (Université libre de Bruxelles), Joseph Cunningham (Université libre de Bruxelles), Jérémie Roland (Université libre de Bruxelles)
Abstract: Many quantum algorithms, such as adiabatic algorithms (e.g. AQC) and phase randomisation, require simulating Hamiltonian evolution. In addition, the simulation of physical systems is an important objective in its own right. In many cases, the Hamiltonian is complex at first sight, but can be decomposed as a linear combination of simple ones; for instance, a sum of local Hamiltonians for Ising models or a sum of time-independent Hamiltonians with time-dependent coefficients (which is typically the case for adiabatic algorithms). In this paper we develop a new compiler, similar to the first order randomized Trotter, or qDRIFT, but with an arguably simpler framework. It is more versatile as it supports a large class of randomisation schemes and as well as time-dependent weights. We first present the model and derive its governing equations. We then define and analyze the simulation error for a sum of two Hamiltonians, and generalize it to a sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians. We prove that the number of gates necessary to simulate the weighted sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians of magnitude $C$ during a time $T$ with an error less than $\epsilon_0$ grows as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(C^2T^2\epsilon_0^{-1}\right)$.

Title: Routing algorithm within the multiple non-overlapping paths approach for quantum key distribution networks
Authors: Evgeniy O. Kiktenko, Andrey Tayduganov, Aleksey K. Fedorov
Abstract: We develop a novel key routing algorithm for quantum key distribution (QKD) networks that utilizes a distribution of keys between remote, i.e., not directly connected by a QKD link, nodes through multiple non-overlapping paths. This approach enchases the security of QKD network by minimizing potential vulnerabilities associated with individual trusted nodes. The algorithm ensures a balanced allocation of the workload across the QKD network links, while aiming for the target key generation rate between directly connected and remote nodes. We present the results of testing the algorithm on two QKD network models consisting of 6 and 10 nodes. The testing demonstrates the ability of the algorithm to distribute secure keys among the nodes of the network in an all-to-all manner, ensuring that the information-theoretic security of the keys between remote nodes is maintained even when one of the trusted nodes is compromised. These results highlight the potential of the algorithm to improve the performance of QKD networks.

Title: A Classical Analogue of Entanglement for a Kicked Top
Authors: Bilal Khalid, Sabre Kais
Abstract: It is widely believed that quantum mechanics cannot exhibit chaos, since unitarity of time evolution ensures that distances between quantum states are preserved. However, a parallel argument can be constructed in classical mechanics that would seem to deny the existence of classical chaos too. The argument works by describing classical states as probability distributions in phase space and showing that the inner product between distributions on phase space is preserved under Liouvillian dynamics. Thus, the more faithful classical analogy of a quantum state is not a single phase space trajectory but is instead a phase space distribution, and chaos in such states must be identified by some statistical signatures instead of exponential separation of nearby states. The search for these signatures is the primary goal in quantum chaos research. However, this perspective also naturally motivates the search for classical analogues of these signatures, to reveal the inner machinery of chaos in quantum systems. One widely recognized signature of chaos in quantum systems is the dynamical generation of entanglement. Chaos in the classical system is correlated with a greater entanglement production in the corresponding quantum system. One of the most well-studied examples of this is the kicked top model. In this paper, we construct a classical analogue of bipartite entanglement in terms of the mutual information between phase space distributions of subsystems and find completely analogous signatures of chaos as those found in entanglement for the kicked top Hamiltonian.

Title: Towards quantum error correction with two-body gates for quantum registers based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
Authors: Daniel Dulog, Martin B. Plenio
Abstract: Color centers in diamond provide a possible hardware for quantum computation, where the most basic quantum information processing unit are nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, each in contact with adjacent carbon nuclear spins. With specifically tailored dynamical decoupling sequences, it is possible to execute selective, high-fidelity two-body gates between the electron spin of the NV center and a targeted nuclear spin. In this work, we present a method to determine the optimal execution time that balances the trade-off between fidelity and execution speed for gates generated by adaptive XY sequences. With these optimized gates, we use the nuclear spin environment as a code space for quantum error correction within a color center register.

Title: Cavity enhancement of V2 centers in 4H-SiC with a fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity
Authors: Jannis Hessenauer, Jonathan Körber, Misagh Ghezellou, Jawad Ul-Hassan, Georgy V. Astakhov, Wolfgang Knolle, Jörg Wrachtrup, David Hunger
Abstract: Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.

Title: Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase
Authors: Benedikt M. Reible, Ana Djurdjevac, Luigi Delle Site
Abstract: Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.

Title: Flipping qudits: Extending the Bit-Flip Channel to higher-dimensional systems
Authors: Jean F. Gomez, Hermann L. Albrecht Q
Abstract: We present three possible extensions of the bit-flip channel to qutrit systems based on the diverse interpretations of the channel. Also, we extended them to higher-dimensional qudit systems, formulating different versions of dit flip channels. Finally, we studied their impact on the Negativity, as an entanglement measure, of qubit-qutrit and 2-qutrit Werner states. In doing so, we showed the inequivalence of these versions as they affect in very distinct ways the states entanglement.

Title: Quantum Advantage in Trading: A Game-Theoretic Approach
Authors: Faisal Shah Khan, Norbert M. Linke, Anton Trong Than, Dror Baron
Abstract: Quantum games, like quantum algorithms, exploit quantum entanglement to establish strong correlations between strategic player actions. This paper introduces quantum game-theoretic models applied to trading and demonstrates their implementation on an ion-trap quantum computer. The results showcase a quantum advantage, previously known only theoretically, realized as higher-paying market Nash equilibria. This advantage could help uncover alpha in trading strategies, defined as excess returns compared to established benchmarks. These findings suggest that quantum computing could significantly influence the development of financial strategies.

Title: Frame-dependent coherence of a quantum state
Authors: Nicolae Cotfas
Abstract: A finite-dimensional Hilbert space is usually described by using an orthonormal basis, but a more general description can be obtained by using a tight frame. The frame-dependent coherence, defined by following the analogy with the basis-dependent coherence, allows us to define the coherence with respect to several orthogonal bases considered simultaneously or with respect to a discrete system of coherent states. By using this more general definition, we can investigate how the basis-dependent coherence changes when we go from a basis to another one, from a basis to a complementary one. Frame-dependent coherence of a quantum state coincides with the basis-dependent coherence of the corresponding state in a Neumark extension.

Title: Fat-Tree QRAM: A High-Bandwidth Shared Quantum Random Access Memory for Parallel Queries
Authors: Shifan Xu, Alvin Lu, Yongshan Ding
Abstract: Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) is a crucial architectural component for querying classical or quantum data in superposition, enabling algorithms with wide-ranging applications in quantum arithmetic, quantum chemistry, machine learning, and quantum cryptography. In this work, we introduce Fat-Tree QRAM, a novel query architecture capable of pipelining multiple quantum queries simultaneously while maintaining desirable scalings in query speed and fidelity. Specifically, Fat-Tree QRAM performs $O(\log (N))$ independent queries in $O(\log (N))$ time using $O(N)$ qubits, offering immense parallelism benefits over traditional QRAM architectures. To demonstrate its experimental feasibility, we propose modular and on-chip implementations of Fat-Tree QRAM based on superconducting circuits and analyze their performance and fidelity under realistic parameters. Furthermore, a query scheduling protocol is presented to maximize hardware utilization and access the underlying data at an optimal rate. These results suggest that Fat-Tree QRAM is an attractive architecture in a shared memory system for practical quantum computing.

Title: Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves
Authors: Or Dobkowski, Barak Trok, Peter Skakunenko, Yonathan Japha, David Groswasser, Maxim Efremov, Chiara Marletto, Ivette Fuentes, Roger Penrose, Vlatko Vedral, Wolfgang P. Schleich, Ron Folman
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.

Title: High-precision measurement of microwave electric field by cavity-enhanced critical behavior in a many-body Rydberg atomic system
Authors: Qinxia Wang, Yukang Liang, Zhihui Wang, Shijun Guan, Pengfei Yang, Pengfei Zhang, Gang Li, Tiancai Zhang
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that the Rydberg criticality in a many-body atomic system can enhance the measurement sensitivity of the microwave electric field by increasing the Fisher information. In our previous work, we proposed and experimentally verified that the Fisher information near the critical point can be increased by more than two orders of magnitude with the Rydberg atoms coupled with an optical cavity compared with that in free space. Here we demonstrate the precision measurement of the microwave electric field by cavity-enhanced critical behavior. We show that the equivalent measurement sensitivity of the microwave electric field can be enhanced by an order of magnitude compared with that in free space. The obtained sensitivity can be enhanced to 2.6 nV/cm/Hz$^{1/2}$.

Authors: Monica De Angelis
Abstract: Mathematical models related to some Josephson junctions are pointed out and attention is drawn to the solutions of certain initial boundary problems and to some of their estimates. In addition, results of rigorous analysis of the behaviour of these solutions when the time tends to infinity and when the small parameter tends to zero are cited. These analyses lead us to mention some of the open problems.

Title: Integration of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits in 3D cavity
Authors: Kuei-Lin Chiu, Youyi Chang, Avishma J. Lasrado, Cheng-Han Lo, Yung-Hsiang Chen, Tao-Yi Hsu, Yen-Chih Chen, Yi-Chen Tsai, Samina, Yen-Hsiang Lin, Chung-Ting Ke
Abstract: Integrating 2D materials into circuit quantum electrodynamics (c-QED) devices is an emerging filed in recent years. This integration not only facilitates the exploration of potential applications in quantum information processing but also enables the study of material's fundamental properties using microwave techniques. While most studies employ 2D coplanar architectures with scalability potential, 3D cavity based c-QED devices, due to their simpler design, offer the advantage of a quicker turnaround to probe the composite Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, we construct the first flux-tunable, 3D cavity-compatible superconducting quantum circuit based on 2D materials, featuring a graphene superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) shunted by a capacitor that is accessible by both DC and microwave probes. We have shown how flux-modulated cavity frequency can be linked to the SQUID critical current under the influence of Fraunhofer pattern. In addition, we extracted the symmetry information of the SQUIDs based on DC analysis, and correlated this with the flux-modulated cavity frequency observed in microwave measurements. Our platform can extend to topological materials, holding the prospect of establishing valid topological JJs with DC probe while allowing fast microwave probe to avoid quasiparticle poisoning.

Title: Tracking chirality in photoelectron circular dichroism
Authors: Marec W. Heger, Daniel M. Reich
Abstract: In photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) it is generally difficult to trace how and when the chirality of the molecule is imprinted onto the photoelectron. We present simulations of PECD in a simple model and employ chirality measures to establish a quantitative connection between the chirality of the potential, the electronic wave function's chirality, and the anisotropy of the photoelectron distribution. We show that these measures are suitable indicators for chirality, paving the way for tracking the chiral evolution from the nuclear scaffold to the final observable.

Title: Renormalized Internally-Contracted Multireference Coupled Cluster with Perturbative Triples
Authors: Robin Feldmann, Markus Reiher
Abstract: In this work, we combine the many-body formulation of the internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (ic-MRCC) method with Evangelista's multireference formulation of the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). The DSRG method can be viewed as a unitary multireference coupled cluster theory, which renormalizes the amplitudes based on a flow equation approach to eliminate numerical instabilities. We extend this approach by demonstrating that the unitary flow equation approach can be adapted for nonunitary transformations, rationalizing the renormalization of ic-MRCC amplitudes. We denote the new approach, the renormalized ic-MRCC (ric-MRCC) method. To achieve high accuracy with a reasonable computational cost, we introduce a new approximation to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We fully consider the linear commutator while approximating the quadratic commutator, for which we neglect specific contractions involving amplitudes with active indices. Moreover, we introduce approximate perturbative triples to obtain the ric-MRCCSD[T] method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approaches in comparison to advanced multireference methods for the potential energy curves of H8, F2, H2O, N2, and Cr2. Additionally, we show that ric-MRCCSD and ric-MRCSSD[T] match the accuracy of CCSD(T) for evaluating spectroscopic constants and of full configuration interaction energies for a set of small molecules.

Title: Average-exact mixed anomalies and compatible phases
Authors: Yichen Xu, Chao-Ming Jian
Abstract: The quantum anomaly of a global symmetry is known to strongly constrain the allowed low-energy physics in a clean and isolated quantum system. However, the effect of quantum anomalies in disordered systems is much less understood, especially when the global symmetry is only preserved on average by the disorder. In this work, we focus on disordered systems with both average and exact symmetries $A\times K$, where the exact symmetry $K$ is respected in every disorder configuration, and the average $A$ is only preserved on average by the disorder ensemble. When there is a mixed quantum anomaly between the average and exact symmetries, we argue that the mixed state representing the ensemble of disordered ground states cannot be featureless. While disordered mixed states smoothly connected to the anomaly-compatible phases in clean limit are certainly allowed, we also found disordered phases that have no clean-limit counterparts, including the glassy states with strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and average topological orders for certain anomalies. We construct solvable lattice models to demonstrate each of these possibilities. We also provide a field-theoretic argument to provide a criterion for whether a given average-exact mixed anomaly admits a compatible average topological order.

Title: Timelike transitions in an atom by a mirror in light cone and Kruskal-Szekeres regions: a status of quantum equivalence
Authors: Subhajit Barman, Pradeep Kumawat, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: We investigate the timelike transitions in a two-level atom in the presence of an infinite reflecting mirror in the future-past light cone regions of a Minkowski spacetime as well as in the region interior of a $(1+1)$ dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, when considering the light cone regions, two specific scenarios are dealt with -- $(i)$ a static mirror is synchronized with Minkowski time while the static atom is using a frame in the light cone, $(ii)$ a static atom is using Minkowski time, and the mirror is using the light cone frame. Analogous scenarios in the black hole spacetime are -- the static mirror uses future Kruskal frame while the static atom uses the Schwarzschild coordinates, defined inside the black hole, and vice-versa. The calculations, depending upon the frame of the atom, are respectively done within the light cone, Minkowski, Schwarzschild, and Kruskal time-interaction pictures. In all of these scenarios, we observe that the excitation probabilities contain a thermal factor and are periodic on the separation between the atom and the mirror, contrasting the uniform acceleration scenario. The above two scenarios in $(1+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone regions appear to be the same when we equate the field and atomic frequencies. However, the same is not true when we consider the $(3+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone or the Schwarzschild interior regions. We also estimate the de-excitation probabilities and encounter similar situations. However, we observe that the ratio between the excitation and corresponding de-excitation probabilities resembles the classical equivalence in motion at the quantum level. The excitation to de-excitation ratios (EDRs) corresponding to analogous scenarios are equal for equal atomic and field frequencies. This bolsters our earlier proposal on the relevance of EDRs in the context of the equivalence principle.

Title: Bose-Fermi $N$-polaron state emergence from correlation-mediated blocking of phase separation
Authors: Felipe Gómez-Lozada, Hoshu Hiyane, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty
Abstract: We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions-periodic for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations, which induce large impurity-impurity correlations that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information, respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to impurity clusters delocalized along the system. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.

Title: Emergent multi-loop nested point gap in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice
Authors: Yi-Qi Zheng, Shan-Zhong Li, Zhi Li
Abstract: We propose a geometric series modulated non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice model, and explore its localization and topological properties. The results show that with the ever-increasing summation terms of the geometric series, multiple mobility edges and non-Hermitian point gaps with high winding number can be induced in the system. The point gap spectrum of the system has a multi-loop nested structure in the complex plane, resulting in a high winding number. In addition, we analyze the limit case of summation of infinite terms. The results show that the mobility edges merge together as only one mobility edge when summation terms are pushed to the limit. Meanwhile, the corresponding point gaps are merged into a ring with winding number equal to one. Through Avila's global theory, we give an analytical expression for mobility edges in the limit of infinite summation, reconfirming that mobility edges and point gaps do merge and will result in a winding number that is indeed equal to one.

Title: Dynamic Tuning of Single-Photon Emission in Monolayer WSe2 via Localized Strain Engineering
Authors: Yi Yu, Junyu Ge, Manlin Luo, In Cheol Seo, Youngmin Kim, John J. H. Eng, Kunze Lu, Tian-Ran Wei, Seok Woo Lee, Weibo Gao, Hong Li, Donguk Nam
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation integrated single-photon emitters (SPEs). However, significant variability in the emission energies of 2D SPEs presents a major challenge in producing identical single photons from different SPEs, which may become crucial for various quantum applications including quantum information processing. Although various approaches to dynamically tuning the emission energies of 2D SPEs have been developed to address the issue, the practical solution to matching multiple individual SPEs in a single 2D flake is still scarce. In this work, we demonstrate a precise emission energy tuning of individual SPEs in a WSe2 monolayer. Our approach utilizes localized strain fields near individual SPEs, which we control independently by adjusting the physical volume of an SU-8-based stressor layer via focused laser annealing. This technique allows continuous emission energy tuning of up to 15 meV while maintaining the qualities of SPEs. Additionally, we showcase the precise spectral alignment of three distinct SPEs in a single WSe2 monolayer to the same wavelength. The tunability of 2D SPEs represents a solid step towards the on-chip integrated photonics with 2D materials for quantum technologies.

Title: Exactly characterizing critical states: invariance in both position and momentum spaces
Authors: Tong Liu
Abstract: The critical state of disordered systems is an intriguing and popular topic in condensed matter physics, known for its non-ergodic properties such as multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge so far. In this work, we propose an Ansatz for the critical state, and argue that critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both dual spaces. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we demonstrate that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, also exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces. Subsequent numerical simulations verify the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.

Title: Two-body interaction induced phase transitions and intermediate phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals
Authors: Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that interactions could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into an intermediate mobility edge phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.

Title: On Compton ionization of a hydrogen atom by twisted photons
Authors: Igor Volobuev, Vadim Egorov
Abstract: The differential probability of the process of Compton ionization of a hydrogen atom by a cylindrical electromagnetic wave is calculated taking into account the finite size of the target, which resulted in the appearance of a dependence of this value on the angular momentum of the cylindrical wave. It is shown that the use of a cylindrical wave instead of a plane wave does not lead to new angular distributions of the reaction products.

Title: Asymptotic Freedom of Two Heavy Impurities in a Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Dong-Chen Zheng, Lin Wen, Renyuan Liao
Abstract: We consider two heavy impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, and calculate the self-energy using the Wilsonian renormalization. The polaron energy, quasiparticle residue and damping rate are extracted from the self-energy. We demonstrate that various effective potentials emerge from the polaron energy under the specific conditions. In the limit of large separation between the impurities, the polaron spectrum converges to the results for a single impurity, exhibiting an attractive-repulsive crossover across the Feshbach resonance. The boundary of this crossover is identified through the analysis of the damping rate. We highlight that repulsive-dominant polarons can exist as long as the impurities are sufficiently close, even when the impurity-boson interactions are attractive. Additionally, we observe that the two impurities become asymptotically free in the repulsive polaron regime. These results are verifiable and offer a fresh perspective on the interaction dynamics between two polarons.

Title: From Staging to Insight: An Educational Path to Understanding Bell's Inequalities
Authors: Valentina De Renzi, Matteo G. A. Paris, Maria Bondani
Abstract: Quantum Physics is a cornerstone of modern science and technology, yet a comprehensive approach to integrating it into school curricula and communicating its foundations to policymakers, industrial stakeholders, and the general public has yet to be established. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for introducing entanglement and Bell's inequalities to a non-expert audience, and how these topics have been presented in the exhibit "Dire l'indicibile" ("Speaking the Unspeakable"), as a part of the Italian Quantum Weeks project. This initiative aims to make quantum mechanics accessible to all, bridging the gap between complex scientific principles and public understanding. Our approach meets the challenge of simplifying quantum concepts without sacrificing their core meaning, specifically avoiding the risks of oversimplification and inaccuracy. Through interactive activities, including a card game demonstration and the staging of CHSH experiments, participants explore the fundamental differences between classical and quantum probabilistic predictions. They gain insights into the significance of Bell inequality verification experiments and the implications of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Preliminary results from both informal and formal assessment sessions are encouraging, suggesting the effectiveness of this approach.

Title: Entanglement between accelerated probes in de Sitter
Authors: Mayank, K. Hari, Subhajit Barman, Dawood Kothawala
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.
