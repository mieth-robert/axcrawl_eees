Title: Quantum Internet, Governance, Trust, and the Promise of Secure Communication: On building a Quantum Internet that will be used
Authors: Pieter E. Vermaas, Luca Possati, Zeki C. Seskir
Abstract: The development of quantum technologies has been accelerating in the last decade, turning them into emerging technologies that need explicit attention by decision-makers at national funding agencies, companies and governments. In this paper we consider the governance of quantum internet, a new type of communication network developed for the promise that it can deliver inherently secure communication solely through its technical design. This paper gives a general analysis of the functions quantum internet offer, and then challenges this proposition by arguing that trust, an essential precondition for users to adopt this technology, cannot be guaranteed by technical features alone. Instead, trust is fundamentally a social phenomenon, shaped by how quantum internet is governed, operated, and regulated. Therefore, the ultimate success of quantum internet in fulfilling its promise of secure communication will depend not just on its technical hardware and software but also on the policies and frameworks for running these capacities, and on the public trust in those policies and frameworks. With this argument we arrive at recommendations to decision-makers for developing quantum internet and its governance in a way that quantum internet that can be trusted for its promised capacities.

Title: Quantum steganography using catalytic and entanglement-assisted quantum codes
Authors: Sanjoy Dutta, Nihar Ranjan Dash, Subhashish Banerjee, R. Srikanth
Abstract: Steganography is the technique for transmitting a secret message by employing subterfuge to conceal it in innocent-looking data, rather than by overt security measures as in cryptography. Typically, non-degenerate quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) are used as the cover medium, with the stego message disguised as noise. As in cryptography, a large number of bits or ebits are pre-shared, in this case mainly in order to ensure the innocence effect. In this work we develop three steganographic protocols: first, a scheme based on catalytic quantum codes to minimize initial pre-shared resources; second, a scheme incorporating prior entanglement into QECCs in the form of possibly degenerate entanglement-assisted QECCs; third, a scheme that uses the phase bit of a pre-shared ebit, combined with QECCs.

Title: Readout sweet spots for spin qubits with strong spin-orbit interaction
Authors: Domonkos Svastits, Bence Hetényi, Gábor Széchenyi, James Wootton, Daniel Loss, Stefano Bosco, András Pályi
Abstract: Qubit readout schemes often deviate from ideal projective measurements, introducing critical issues that limit quantum computing performance. In this work, we model charge-sensing-based readout for semiconductor spin qubits in double quantum dots, and identify key error mechanisms caused by the back-action of the charge sensor. We quantify how the charge noise of the sensor, residual tunneling, and $g$-tensor modulation degrade readout fidelity, induce a mixed post-measurement state, and cause leakage from the computational subspace. For state-of-the-art systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and electrically tunable $g$-tensors, we identify a readout sweet spot, that is, a special device configuration where readout is closest to projective. Our framework provides a foundation for developing effective readout error mitigation strategies, with broad applications for optimizing readout performance for a variety of charge-sensing techniques, advancing quantum protocols, and improving adaptive circuits for error correction.

Title: A Temperature Change can Solve the Deutsch-Josza Problem : An Exploration of Thermodynamic Query Complexity
Authors: Jake Xuereb
Abstract: We demonstrate how a single heat exchange between a probe thermal qubit and multi-qubit thermal machine encoding a Boolean function, can determine whether the function is balanced or constant, thus providing a novel thermodynamic solution to the Deutsch-Josza problem. We introduce a thermodynamic model of quantum query complexity, showing how qubit thermal machines can act as oracles, queried via heat exchange with a probe. While the Deutsch-Josza problem requires an exponential encoding in the number of oracle bits, we also explore the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, which admits a linear thermal oracle and a single thermal query solution. We establish bounds on the number of samples needed to determine the probe temperature encoding the solution, showing that it remains constant with problem size. Additionally, we propose a proof-of-principle experimental implementation to solve the 3-bit Bernstein-Vazirani problem via thermal kickback. This work bridges thermodynamics and complexity theory, suggesting a new test bed for quantum thermodynamic computing.

Title: Heuristic ansatz design for trainable ion-native digital-analog quantum circuits
Authors: Georgii Paradezhenko, Daniil Rabinovich, Ernesto Campos, Kirill Lakhmanskiy
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have become a standard approach for solving a wide range of problems on near-term quantum computers. Identifying an appropriate ansatz configuration for variational algorithms, however, remains a challenging task, especially when taking into account restrictions imposed by real quantum platforms. This motivated the development of digital-analog quantum circuits, where sequences of quantum gates are alternated with natural Hamiltonian evolutions. A prominent example is the use of the controllable long-range Ising interaction induced in ion-based quantum computers. This interaction has recently been applied to develop an algorithm similar to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), but native to the ion hardware. The performance of this algorithm has demonstrated a strong dependence on the strengths of the individual ion-ion interactions, which serve as ansatz hyperparameters. In this work, we propose a heuristic for identifying a problem-specific ansatz configuration, which enhances the trainability of the ion native digital-analog circuit. The proposed approach is systematically applied to random instances of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian for up to 15 qubits, providing favorable cost landscapes. As the result, the developed approach identifies a well-trainable ion native ansatz, which requires a lower circuit depth to solve specific problems as compared to standard QAOA. This brings the algorithm one step closer to its large scale practical implementation.

Title: On Dequantization of Supervised Quantum Machine Learning via Random Fourier Features
Authors: Mehrad Sahebi, Alice Barthe, Yudai Suzuki, Zoë Holmes, Michele Grossi
Abstract: In the quest for quantum advantage, a central question is under what conditions can classical algorithms achieve a performance comparable to quantum algorithms--a concept known as dequantization. Random Fourier features (RFFs) have demonstrated potential for dequantizing certain quantum neural networks (QNNs) applied to regression tasks, but their applicability to other learning problems and architectures remains unexplored. In this work, we derive bounds on the generalization performance gap between classical RFF models and quantum models for regression and classification tasks with both QNN and quantum kernel architectures. We support our findings with numerical experiments that illustrate the practical dequantization of existing quantum kernel-based methods. Our findings not only broaden the applicability of RFF-based dequantization but also enhance the understanding of potential quantum advantages in practical machine-learning tasks.

Title: Resource Analysis of Low-Overhead Transversal Architectures for Reconfigurable Atom Arrays
Authors: Hengyun Zhou, Casey Duckering, Chen Zhao, Dolev Bluvstein, Madelyn Cain, Aleksander Kubica, Sheng-Tao Wang, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Based on these advances, including dynamically-reconfigurable connectivity and fast transversal operations, we present a low-overhead architecture that supports the layout and resource estimation of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. Utilizing recent advances in fault tolerance with transversal gate operations, this architecture achieves a run time speed-up on the order of the code distance $d$, which we find directly translates to run time improvements of large-scale quantum algorithms. Our architecture consists of functional building blocks of key algorithmic subroutines, including magic state factories, quantum arithmetic units, and quantum look-up tables. These building blocks are implemented using efficient transversal operations, and we design space-time efficient versions of them that minimize interaction distance, thereby reducing atom move times and minimizing the volume for correlated decoding. We further propose models to estimate their logical error performance. We perform resource estimation for a large-scale implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm, one of the prototypical benchmarks for large-scale quantum algorithms, finding that 2048-bit RSA factoring can be executed with 19 million qubits in 5.6 days, for 1 ms QEC cycle times. This represents close to 50$\times$ speed-up of the run-time compared to existing estimates with similar assumptions, with no increase in space footprint.

Title: NonHermitian Topological Phases in a Hermitian Modified Bosonic Kitaev Chain
Authors: Raditya Weda Bomantara, Ibsal Assi, J. P. F. LeBlanc, Michael Vogl
Abstract: We present a modification to the bosonic Kitaev chain that, despite being Hermitian, supports both nonHermitian skin effect and nontrivial topological edge modes in its excitation Hamiltonian. We establish an exact mapping between the excitation Hamiltonian of our system and a nonHermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which allows for a completely analytical characterization of its topology. In particular, topological phase transition points separating a topologically trivial and nontrivial regime were identified analytically by the appropriate winding number invariant and the presence of zero energy modes. Similarly to the regular bosonic Kitaev chain, the nonHermitian skin effect and some (but not all) topological edge modes are quickly destroyed at nonzero bosonic onsite potential (harmonic oscillator frequency). Remarkably, however, disorder partially recovers some of these features. This work thus demonstrates the potential of a modified bosonic Kitaev chain as a platform to generate rich nonHermitian topological phenomena from a completely Hermitian system's perspective. Lastly, we suggest a possible experimental realization of the model, which could allow for total control over the parameter space.

Title: In the shadow of the Hadamard test: Using the garbage state for good and further modifications
Authors: Paul K. Faehrmann, Jens Eisert, Richard Kueng
Abstract: The Hadamard test is naturally suited for the intermediate regime between the current era of noisy quantum devices and complete fault tolerance. Its applications use measurements of the auxiliary qubit to extract information, but disregard the system register completely. Separate advances in classical representations of quantum states via classical shadows allow the implementation of even global classical shadows with shallow circuits. This work combines the Hadamard test on a single auxiliary readout qubit with classical shadows on the remaining $n$-qubit work register. We argue that this combination inherits the best of both worlds and discuss statistical phase estimation as a vignette application. There, we can use the Hadamard test to estimate eigenvalues on the auxiliary qubit, while classical shadows on the remaining $n$ qubits provide access to additional features such as, (i) fidelity with certain pure quantum states, (ii) the initial state's energy and (iii) how pure and how close the initial state is to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Finally, we also discuss how anti-controlled unitaries can further augment this framework.

Title: How to factor 2048 bit RSA integers with less than a million noisy qubits
Authors: Craig Gidney
Abstract: Planning the transition to quantum-safe cryptosystems requires understanding the cost of quantum attacks on vulnerable cryptosystems. In Gidney+Ekerå 2019, I co-published an estimate stating that 2048 bit RSA integers could be factored in eight hours by a quantum computer with 20 million noisy qubits. In this paper, I substantially reduce the number of qubits required. I estimate that a 2048 bit RSA integer could be factored in less than a week by a quantum computer with less than a million noisy qubits. I make the same assumptions as in 2019: a square grid of qubits with nearest neighbor connections, a uniform gate error rate of $0.1\%$, a surface code cycle time of 1 microsecond, and a control system reaction time of $10$ microseconds. The qubit count reduction comes mainly from using approximate residue arithmetic (Chevignard+Fouque+Schrottenloher 2024), from storing idle logical qubits with yoked surface codes (Gidney+Newman+Brooks+Jones 2023), and from allocating less space to magic state distillation by using magic state cultivation (Gidney+Shutty+Jones 2024). The longer runtime is mainly due to performing more Toffoli gates and using fewer magic state factories compared to Gidney+Ekerå 2019. That said, I reduce the Toffoli count by over 100x compared to Chevignard+Fouque+Schrottenloher 2024.

Title: Mitigating cosmic ray-like correlated events with a modular quantum processor
Authors: Xuntao Wu, Yash J. Joshi, Haoxiong Yan, Gustav Andersson, Alexander Anferov, Christopher R. Conner, Bayan Karimi, Amber M. King, Shiheng Li, Howard L. Malc, Jacob M. Miller, Harsh Mishra, Hong Qiao, Minseok Ryu, Siyuan Xing, Jian Shi, Andrew N. Cleland
Abstract: Quantum processors based on superconducting qubits are being scaled to larger qubit numbers, enabling the implementation of small-scale quantum error correction codes. However, catastrophic chip-scale correlated errors have been observed in these processors, attributed to e.g. cosmic ray impacts, which challenge conventional error-correction codes such as the surface code. These events are characterized by a temporary but pronounced suppression of the qubit energy relaxation times. Here, we explore the potential for modular quantum computing architectures to mitigate such correlated energy decay events. We measure cosmic ray-like events in a quantum processor comprising a motherboard and two flip-chip bonded daughterboard modules, each module containing two superconducting qubits. We monitor the appearance of correlated qubit decay events within a single module and across the physically separated modules. We find that while decay events within one module are strongly correlated (over $85\%$), events in separate modules only display $\sim 2\%$ correlations. We also report coincident decay events in the motherboard and in either of the two daughterboard modules, providing further insight into the nature of these decay events. These results suggest that modular architectures, combined with bespoke error correction codes, offer a promising approach for protecting future quantum processors from chip-scale correlated errors.

Title: Ideal Gas Law for a Quantum Particle
Authors: Alejandro M.F Rivas, Eduardo G. Vergini, Leonardo Ermann, Gabriel G. Carlo
Abstract: The question of how classical thermodynamic laws emerge from the underlying quantum substrate lies at the foundations of physics. Here, we examine the validity of the ideal gas law (IGL) for a single quantum particle confined within a two-dimensional cavity. By interpreting the quantum wave function as a probability density analogous to that of an ideal gas, we employ the energy equipartition principle to define the temperature of the quantum state. For the mean pressure we take two definitions, one straightforwardly based on the radiation pressure concept and the other taking advantage of a quasi-orthogonality relation valid for billiard eigenstates. We analyze systems with regular dynamics-the circular and rectangular billiards-and compare them with the classically chaotic Bunimovich stadium. We find that the IGL for the first definition of pressure holds exactly in isotropic systems (as the circular case), while for anisotropic geometries, quantum eigenfunctions generally conform to the IGL only on average, exhibiting meaningful deviations. These deviations are diminished in the presence of chaotic dynamics and for coherent states. This observation is consistent with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). Notably, the second definition of pressure allows for a good matching with the IGL.

Title: Bloch oscillation with a diatomic tight-binding model on quantum computers
Authors: Peng Guo, Jaime Park, Frank X. Lee
Abstract: We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.

Title: Fast quantum interferometry at the nanometer and attosecond scales with energy-entangled photons
Authors: Colin P. Lualdi, Spencer J. Johnson, Michael Vayninger, Kristina A. Meier, Swetapadma Sahoo, Simeon I. Bogdanov, Paul G. Kwiat
Abstract: In classical optical interferometry, loss and background complicate achieving fast nanometer-resolution measurements with illumination at low light levels. Conversely, quantum two-photon interference is unaffected by loss and background, but nanometer-scale resolution is physically difficult to realize. As a solution, we enhance two-photon interference with highly non-degenerate energy entanglement featuring photon frequencies separated by 177 THz. We observe measurement resolution at the nanometer (attosecond) scale with only $O(10^4)$ photon pairs, despite the presence of background and loss. Our non-destructive thickness measurement of a metallic thin film agrees with atomic force microscopy, which often achieves better resolution via destructive means. With contactless, non-destructive measurements in seconds or faster, our instrument enables metrological studies in optically challenging contexts where background, loss, or photosensitivity are factors.

Title: Thermodynamic Analysis for Harmonic Oscillator with Position-Dependent Mass
Authors: Daniel Sabi Takou, Assimiou Yarou Mora, Gabriel Y. H. Avossevou
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the thermodynamic behavior of a quantum harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass (PDM), where spatial inhomogeneity is modeled through a deformation parameter {\alpha}. Based on the exact energy spectrum, we explore the resulting thermodynamic quantities and superstatistics. Our findings reveal that increasing {\alpha} leads to a decrease in entropy and specific heat, reflecting a confinement-induced reduction in the number of accessible states. The partition function and free energy exhibit smooth behavior across all parameter regimes, indicating the absence of critical phase transitions. This study underscores the influence of mass deformation on quantum thermal responses and demonstrates that, while the overall thermodynamic trends are consistent with those reported in the literature, certain distinctive features emerge due to the specific form of the deformation.

Title: Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo for Electron-Photon Correlation
Authors: Braden M. Weight, Yu Zhang
Abstract: Hybrid light-matter polaritonic states have shown great promise for altering already known and enabling novel chemical reactions and controlling photophysical phenomena. This field has recently become one of the most prominent and active areas of research that connects the communities of chemistry and quantum optics. The ab initio modeling of such polaritonic phenomena has led to updating commonly used electronic structure methods, such as Hartree-Fock, density functional, and coupled cluster theories, to explicitly include Bosonic degrees of freedom. In this work, we explore the quantum electrodynamic auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QED-AFQMC) method to accurately capture the polaritonic ground state of representative quantum chemical benchmark systems to explore electron-photon correlations. We analyze these correlations across multiple examples and benchmark the QED-AFQMC results against other ab initio quantum electrodynamics methods, including QED-coupled cluster and QED-full configuration interaction, demonstrating the method's accuracy and its potential for scalable simulations of strongly coupled light-matter systems.

Title: Improved linear and Kerr nonlinear phase estimation via photon addition operations
Authors: Zekun Zhao, Qingqian Kang, Shoukang Chang, Teng Zhao, Cunjin Liu, Xin Su, Liyun Hu
Abstract: The accuracy of quantum measurements can be effectively improved by using both photon-added non-Gaussian operations and Kerr nonlinear phase shifters. Here, we employ coherent state mixed photon-added squeezed vacuum state as input into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with parity detection, thereby achieving a significant enhancement in phase measurement accuracy. Our research focuses on phase sensitivity of linear phase shift under both ideal conditions and photon loss, as well as quantum Fisher information. The results demonstrate that employing the photon addition operations can markedly enhance phase sensitivity and quantum Fisher information, and the measurement accuracy can even approach the Heisenberg limit. In addition, we delve deeper into the scenario of replacing the linear phase shifter with a Kerr nonlinear one and systematically analyze the quantum Fisher information under both ideal and photon loss conditions. By comparison, it is evident that employing both the photon addition operations and the Kerr nonlinear phase shifter can further significantly enhance phase measurement accuracy while effectively improving the system's robustness against photon loss. These findings are instrumental in facilitating the development and practical application of quantum metrology.

Title: Improving adiabatic quantum factorization via chopped random-basis optimization
Authors: Tianlai Yang, Mo Xiong, Ming Xue, Xinwei Li, Jinbin Li
Abstract: Integer factorization remains a significant challenge for classical computers and is fundamental to the security of RSA encryption. Adiabatic quantum algorithms present a promising solution, yet their practical implementation is limited by the short coherence times of current NISQ devices and quantum simulators. In this work, we apply the chopped random-basis (CRAB) optimization technique to enhance adiabatic quantum factorization algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAB by applying it to factor the integers ranging from 21 to 2479, achieving significantly improved fidelity of the target state when the evolution time exceeds the quantum speed limit. Notably, this performance improvement shows resilience in the presence of dephasing noise, highlighting CRAB's practical utility in noisy quantum systems. Our findings suggest that CRAB optimization can serve as a powerful tool for advancing adiabatic quantum algorithms, with broader implications for quantum information processing tasks.

Title: Variational Quantum Algorithm for Solving the Liouvillian Gap
Authors: Xu-Dan Xie, Zheng-Yuan Xue, Dan-Bo Zhang
Abstract: In open quantum systems, the Liouvillian gap characterizes the relaxation time toward the steady state. However, accurately computing this quantity is notoriously difficult due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the non-Hermitian nature of the Liouvillian superoperator. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for efficiently estimating the Liouvillian gap. By utilizing the Choi-Jamiokowski isomorphism, we reformulate the problem as finding the first excitation energy of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method employs variance minimization with an orthogonality constraint to locate the first excited state and adopts a two-stage optimization scheme to enhance convergence. Moreover, to address scenarios with degenerate steady states, we introduce an iterative energy-offset scanning technique. Numerical simulations on the dissipative XXZ model confirm the accuracy and robustness of our algorithm across a range of system sizes and dissipation strengths. These results demonstrate the promise of variational quantum algorithms for simulating open quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.

Title: Die Separation for Mitigation of Phonon Bursts in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Guy Moshel, Omer Rabinowitz, Eliya Blumenthal, Shay Hacohen-Gourgy
Abstract: Cosmic rays and background radioactive decay can deposit significant energy into superconducting quantum circuits on planar chips. This energy converts into pair-breaking phonons that travel across the substrate and generate quasiparticles, leading to correlated energy and phase errors in nearby qubits. To mitigate this, we fabricated two separate dies and placed them adjacently without a galvanic connection between them. This blocks phonon propagation from one die to the other. Using microwave kinetic inductance detectors on both dies, we successfully detected high-energy bursts and conclusively demonstrated the blocking effect. However, we also observed simultaneous events in both dies, likely from a single cosmic particle traversing both dies.

Abstract: Quantum simulation has emerged as a powerful framework for investigating complex many - body phenomena. A key requirement for emulating these dynamics is the realization of fully controllable quantum systems enabling various spin interactions. Yet, quantum simulators remain constrained in the types of attainable interactions. Here we demonstrate experimental realization of multiple microwave - engineered spin interactions in superconducting quantum circuits. By precisely controlling the native XY interaction and microwave drives, we achieve tunable spin Hamiltonians including: (i) XYZ spin models with continuously adjustable parameters, (ii) transverse - field Ising systems, and (iii) Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya interacting systems. Our work expands the toolbox for analogue - digital quantum simulation, enabling exploration of a wide range of exotic quantum spin models.

Title: Is Quantum Optimization Ready? An Effort Towards Neural Network Compression using Adiabatic Quantum Computing
Authors: Zhehui Wanga, Benjamin Chen Ming Choonga, Tian Huang, Daniel Gerlinghoffa, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Cheng Liu, Tao Luo
Abstract: Quantum optimization is the most mature quantum computing technology to date, providing a promising approach towards efficiently solving complex combinatorial problems. Methods such as adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) have been employed in recent years on important optimization problems across various domains. In deep learning, deep neural networks (DNN) have reached immense sizes to support new predictive capabilities. Optimization of large-scale models is critical for sustainable deployment, but becomes increasingly challenging with ever-growing model sizes and complexity. While quantum optimization is suitable for solving complex problems, its application to DNN optimization is not straightforward, requiring thorough reformulation for compatibility with commercially available quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of adopting AQC for fine-grained pruning-quantization of convolutional neural networks. We rework established heuristics to formulate model compression as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, and assess the solution space offered by commercial quantum annealing devices. Through our exploratory efforts of reformulation, we demonstrate that AQC can achieve effective compression of practical DNN models. Experiments demonstrate that adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) not only outperforms classical algorithms like genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning in terms of time efficiency but also excels at identifying global optima.

Title: Magnonic entanglement in a chiral cavity-magnon coupling system
Authors: Yuxin Kang, Xin Zeng, Wuji Zhang, Chunfang Sun, Chunfeng Wu, Gangcheng Wang
Abstract: The generation of magnon entanglement and squeezing plays a crucial role in quantum information processing. In this study, we propose a scheme based on a chiral cavity-magnon system, which consists of a torus-shaped cavity and two yttrium iron garnet spheres. The magnon mode of each yttrium iron garnet sphere is selectively coupled to one of the two degenerate rotating microwave modes of the toroidal cavity. The system aims to achieve entangled and squeezed magnon states through the mediation of the cavity. We further show that bipartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning external driving parameters. Additionally, our scheme does not rely on the magnon Kerr nonlinearity, which is usually extremely weak in yttrium iron garnet spheres. This work provides insights and methods for the research of quantum states in cavity-magnon systems.

Title: Estimation of multiple parameters encoded in the modal structure of light
Authors: Alexander Boeschoten, Giacomo Sorelli, Manuel Gessner, Claude Fabre, Nicolas Treps
Abstract: We investigate the problem of estimating simultaneously multiple parameters encoded in the shape of the modes on which the light is expanded. For this, we generalize the mode-encoded parameter estimation theory as introduced in Ref.[1] to a multi-parameter scenario. We derive the general expression for the Quantum Fisher information matrix and establish the conditions under which the multi-parameter Quantum Cramér-Rao bound is attainable. In specific scenarios, we find that each parameter can be associated with a mode -- the detection mode -- that is proportional to the derivative of either a single non-vacuum mode or the mean-field mode. For a single non-vacuum mode, the correlation between parameters is determined by the real part of the overlap of these detection modes, while in the case of a strong mean-field by the covariance of the quadrature operators of the derivative modes. In both cases, the attainability of the Quantum Cramér-Rao bound is determined by the imaginary part of the overlap of the detection modes. Our findings provide clear criteria for optimal joint estimation of parameters encoded in the modal structure of light, and can be used to benchmark experimental multi-parameter estimations and find optimal measurement strategies by carefully shaping the modes and populating them with non-classical light.

Title: Scaling Quantum Simulation-Based Optimization: Demonstrating Efficient Power Grid Management with Deep QAOA Circuits
Authors: Maximilian Adler, Jonas Stein, Michael Lachner
Abstract: Quantum Simulation-based Optimization (QuSO) is a recently proposed class of optimization problems that entails industrially relevant problems characterized by cost functions or constraints that depend on summary statistic information about the simulation of a physical system or process. This work extends initial theoretical results that proved an up-to-exponential speedup for the simulation component of the QAOA-based QuSO solver proposed by Stein et al. for the unit commitment problem by an empirical evaluation of the optimization component using a standard benchmark dataset, the IEEE 57-bus system. Exploiting clever classical pre-computation, we develop a very efficient classical quantum circuit simulation that bypasses costly ancillary qubit requirements by the original algorithm, allowing for large-scale experiments. Utilizing more than 1000 QAOA layers and up to 20 qubits, our experiments complete a proof of concept implementation for the proposed QuSO solver, showing that it can achieve both highly competitive performance and efficiency in its optimization component compared to a standard classical baseline, i.e., simulated annealing.

Title: Maximum Separation of Quantum Communication Complexity With and Without Shared Entanglement
Authors: Atsuya Hasegawa, François Le Gall, Augusto Modanese
Abstract: We present relation problems whose input size is $n$ such that they can be solved with no communication for entanglement-assisted quantum communication models, but require $\Omega(n)$ qubit communication for $2$-way quantum communication models without prior shared entanglement. This is the maximum separation of quantum communication complexity with and without shared entanglement. To our knowledge, our result is the first lower bound on quantum communication complexity without shared entanglement when the upper bound of entanglement-assisted quantum communication models is zero. The problem we consider is a parallel repetition of any non-local game which has a perfect quantum strategy and no perfect classical strategy, and for which a parallel repetition theorem for the classical value holds with exponential decay.

Title: Quantum Multi-view Kernel Learning with Local Information
Authors: Jing Li, Yanqi Song, Sujuan Qin, Fei Gao
Abstract: Kernel methods serve as powerful tools to capture nonlinear patterns behind data in machine learning. The quantum kernel, integrating kernel theory with quantum computing, has attracted widespread attention. However, existing studies encounter performance bottlenecks when processing complex data with localized structural patterns, stemming from the limitation in single-view feature representation and the exclusive reliance on global data structure. In this paper, we propose quantum multi-view kernel learning with local information, called L-QMVKL. Specifically, based on the multi-kernel learning, a representative method for multi-view data processing, we construct the quantum multi-kernel that combines view-specific quantum kernels to effectively fuse cross-view information. Further leveraging local information to capture intrinsic structural information, we design a sequential training strategy for the quantum circuit parameters and weight coefficients with the use of the hybrid global-local kernel alignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of L-QMVKL through comprehensive numerical simulations on the Mfeat dataset, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements achieved through leveraging multi-view methodology and local information. Meanwhile, the results show that L-QMVKL exhibits a higher accuracy than its classical counterpart. Our work holds promise for advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of quantum kernel methods.

Title: Strict advantage of complex quantum theory in a communication task
Authors: Thomas J. Elliott
Abstract: Standard formulations of quantum theory are based on complex numbers: Quantum states can be in superpositions, with weights given by complex probability amplitudes. Motivated by quantum theory promising a range of practical advantages over classical for a multitude of tasks, we investigate how the presence of complex amplitudes in quantum theory can yield operational advantages over counterpart real formulations. We identify a straightforward communication task for which complex quantum theory exhibits a provably lower communication cost than not just any classical approach, but also any approach based on real quantum theory. We certify the necessity of complex quantum theory for optimal approaches to the task through geometric properties of quantum state ensembles that witness the presence of basis-independent complexity. This substantiates a strict operational advantage of complex quantum theory. We discuss the relevance of this finding for quantum advantages in stochastic simulation.

Title: Extreme value statistics and eigenstate thermalization in kicked quantum chaotic spin-$1/2$ chains
Authors: Tanay Pathak, Masaki Tezuka
Abstract: It is often expected (and assumed) for a quantum chaotic system that the presence of correlated eigenvalues implies that all the other properties as dictated by random matrix theory are satisfied. We demonstrate using the spin-$1/2$ kicked field Ising model that this is not necessarily true. We study the properties of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix for this model, which constitutes the entanglement spectrum. It is shown that the largest eigenvalue does not follow the expected Tracy--Widom distribution even for the large system sizes considered. The distribution instead follows the extreme value distribution of Weibull type. Furthermore, we also show that such deviations do not lead to drastic change in the thermalization property of this system by showing that the models satisfy the diagonal and off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Finally, we study the spin-spin autocorrelation function and numerically show that it has the characteristic behavior for chaotic systems: it decreases exponentially and saturates to a value at late time that decreases with system size.

Authors: Baibhab Bose, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: The theory of an $\eta$-pseudo Hermitian Hamiltonian with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is reviewed and extended to include open system dynamics. Inspired by a simple light matter interaction open system model, information theoretic quantities like a non-Markovian witness and fidelity are calculated for the $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric Hamiltonian, and the results are compared with their corresponding Hermitian counterparts. The nature of entanglement between two $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric and Hermitian open quantum systems is calculated, and the contrast observed.

Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics are a cornerstone for describing nanoscale and open quantum systems. However, formulating these laws for systems under continuous feedback control and under experimentally relevant conditions is challenging. In this work, we lay out a formalism for the laws of thermodynamics in an open quantum system under continuous measurement and feedback described by a Quantum Fokker Planck Master Equation. We derive expressions for work, heat, and measurement-induced energy changes, and we investigate entropy production and fluctuation theorems. We illustrate our results with a continuous version of a measurement-driven Szilard engine, as well as a work extraction scheme in a two-level system under bang-bang control. Our results provide insights into the energetics as well as the irreversibility of classical and quantum systems under continuous feedback control.

Title: Bosonic quantum Fourier codes
Authors: Anthony Leverrier
Abstract: While 2-level systems, aka qubits, are a natural choice to perform a logical quantum computation, the situation is less clear at the physical level. Encoding information in higher-dimensional physical systems can indeed provide a first level of redundancy and error correction that simplifies the overall fault-tolerant architecture. A challenge then is to ensure universal control over the encoded qubits. Here, we explore an approach where information is encoded in an irreducible representation of a finite subgroup of $U(2)$ through an inverse quantum Fourier transform. We illustrate this idea by applying it to the real Pauli group $\langle X, Z\rangle$ in the bosonic setting. The resulting two-mode Fourier cat code displays good error correction properties and admits an experimentally-friendly universal gate set that we discuss in detail.

Title: Families of isospectral and isoscattering quantum graphs
Authors: Pavel Kurasov, Omer Farooq, Michał Ławniczak, Szymon Bauch, Mats-Erik Pistol, Matthew de Courcy-Ireland, Leszek Sirko
Abstract: A concept of germ graphs and the M-function formalism are employed to construct large families of isospectral and isoscattering graphs. This approach represents a complete departure from the original approach pioneered by Sunada, where isospectral graphs are obtained as quotients of a certain large symmetric graph. Using the M-function formalism and the symmetries of the graph itself we construct isospectral and isoscattering pairs. In our novel approach isospectral pairs do not need to be embedded into a larger symmetric graph as in Sunada's approach. We demonstrate that the introduced formalism can also be extended to graphs with dissipation. The theoretical predictions are validated experimentally using microwave networks emulating open quantum graphs with dissipation.

Title: Decoherence manipulation through entanglement dynamics: A photonic experiment
Authors: Saumya Ranjan Behera, Animesh Sinha Roy, Kallol Sen, Ashutosh Singh, A.R.P. Rau, Urbasi Sinha
Abstract: Decoherence serves as a major obstacle to achieving higher efficiency in all quantum technologies. Thus, controlling and mitigating decoherence is currently an active research direction. In this work, we experimentally manipulate entanglement sudden death (ESD), a major manifestation of decoherence, in an all-photonic setup. We demonstrate a protocol that uses local unitary NOT operations along with a variant of amplitude-damping decoherence to influence the evolution of bipartite entangled states through an amplitude-damping channel. Our results obtained using the photonic test-bed demonstrate the ability to hasten, delay, or completely prevent ESD, thereby offering a potential avenue for improving and scaling various quantum architectures.

Title: Manipulating decoherence: Towards a universal framework
Authors: Kallol Sen, Animesh Sinha Roy, Saumya Ranjan Behera, Snigdhadev Ray, A.R.P. Rau, Urbasi Sinha
Abstract: Coherence is a fundamental characteristic of quantum systems and central to understanding quantum behaviour. It is also important for a variety of applications in quantum information. However, physical systems suffer from decoherence due to their interaction with the environment. Although different approaches have been developed to deal with decoherence, there is no unified framework to manipulate the degradation of quantum entanglement. In this work, using a time-dependent formalism (TDF), we take a step towards a broad framework for manipulating decoherence in photonic systems that lead to {\it Entanglement Sudden Death} (ESD). We show explicitly that a time-delay parameter can be used to tune ESD in damping channels. We further propose a novel setup along with the TDF to explore between two limits, one of an amplitude-damping channel (ADC) and another of a correlated amplitude-damping channel (CADC). The generalized definition of the Kraus operators in the TDF allows treatment of the three domains where ESD is hastened, delayed, or completely avoided. We show how a cascade of such damping channels is affected by to the time-delay parameter.

Title: Statistical analysis of level spacing ratios in pseudo-integrable systems: semi-Poisson insight and beyond
Authors: Afshin Akhshani, Małgorzata Białous, Leszek Sirko
Abstract: We studied the statistical properties of a quantum system in the pseudo-integrable regime through the gap ratios between consecutive energy levels of the scattering spectra. A two-dimensional quantum billiard containing a point-like (zero-range) perturbation was experimentally simulated by a flat rectangular resonator with wire antennas. We show that the system exhibits semi-Poisson behavior in the frequency range $8 <\nu < 16 $ GHz. The probability distribution $P(r)$ of the studied system is characterized by the parameter $\xi=0.97 \pm 0.03 $, with the expected value $\xi=1$ for the short-range plasma model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical expression for the higher-order non-overlapping probability distribution $P_{\mathrm{sP}}^k(r)$, $k \geq 1$, in the semi-Poisson regime, incorporating long-range spectral correlations between levels. The experimental and numerical results confirm the pseudo-integrability of the studied system. The semi-Poisson ensemble, for $k=2$, approaches the GUE distribution. In addition, the uncorrelated Poisson statistics mimic the RMT ensembles at certain $k$ values, $k=4$ for GUE and $k=7$ for GSE. This unexpected scale-dependent convergence shows how spectral statistics can exhibit chaos-like features even in non-chaotic systems, suggesting that scale-dependent analysis bridges integrable and chaotic regimes.

Title: An open harmonic chain: Exact vs global and local reduced dynamics
Authors: Melika Babakan, Fabio Benatti, Laleh Memarzadeh
Abstract: In the following, we study the dissipative time-evolution of a quantum chain consisting of three coupled harmonic oscillators, the first and third of which weakly interact quadratically with two independent thermal baths in equilibrium at different temperatures. Due to the quadratic form of the total Hamiltonian, the unitary dynamics of the compound system is formally analytically solvable and defines a one-parameter group of Gaussian maps which enables us to solve the exact dynamics of the chain numerically. Following the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) approach to open quantum systems, one can perform the rotating wave approximation with respect to the interacting, or non-interacting chain Hamiltonian and respectively derive the so-called global and local master equations. The solutions of the ensuing different master equations can then be compared with the exact one, possibly sorting out the two approaches in correspondence to different time-scales of the system. We derive the steady states of the open chain quantum dynamics in the two approaches and show that the behaviour of fidelity between them versus inter-oscillator coupling depends on the two bath temperatures, revealing the existence of a temperature-dependent critical inter-oscillator coupling strength that determines the domain of validity of each approach. When the newly found coupling is less than this critical value, the local approach outperforms the global approach, whereas for larger inter-oscillator coupling, the global approach is a better approximation of the exact evolution. This critical value of inter-oscillator coupling depends on the two bath temperatures, which then play a crucial role in deciding the best possible approximating open dynamics.

Title: Hybrid Parameterized Quantum States for Variational Quantum Learning
Authors: Chen-Yu Liu
Abstract: Variational quantum learning faces practical challenges in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) models suffer from statistical uncertainty due to finite-shot measurements and are highly sensitive to quantum noise, while purely classical approximations like neural quantum states (NQS) lack access to genuine quantum correlations and are limited in scalability. This work introduces Hybrid Parameterized Quantum States (HPQS), a general-purpose modeling framework that interpolates between quantum and classical parameterizations. HPQS combines PQC-based measurements with neural estimators via a blending mechanism and postprocessing functions, enabling enhanced, shot-efficient evaluation under hardware constraints. We demonstrate HPQS across three representative quantum learning tasks: (1) Expectation-based QML, where HPQS yields higher classification accuracy than PQC-only and NQS-only baselines under limited quantum measurements. (2) Quantum-Train, where HPQS generates the entire parameter set of classical networks using polylogarithmic trainable variables; and (3) Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA), where HPQS produces LoRA adapter parameters for fine-tuning large language models like GPT-2 and Gemma-2 with improved perplexity under low-shot conditions; Together, these results position HPQS as a scalable, noise-resilient approach for variational quantum learning, compatible with both current NISQ hardware and future fault-tolerant architectures.

Title: Tuning Topological States by Dissipation
Authors: Xue-Ping Ren, Yue Hu, Long-Ye Lu, Xin-Ran Ma, Ji-Yao Fan, Cui-Xian Guo, Su-Peng Kou
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence plays a crucial role in topological quantum systems, however,this principle is broken in non-Hermitian systems. The breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence indicates that the global phase diagrams under open boundary conditions are significantly different from those under periodic boundary conditions. In this paper, we investigate how the bulk-boundary correspondence breaks down by gradually tearing the system. We find that by tuning the strength of gain and loss domain wall, in the thermodynamic limit, the global phase diagrams of the topological system become the hybrids of those under periodic and open boundary conditions. Moreover, during the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence, several phase transitions occur. This situation is quite different from earlier work, where the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence in the thermodynamic limit occurred suddenly due to infinitesimal boundary hopping amplitudes. To support our conclusions, we provide both analytical and numerical calculations. These results help researchers better understand non-Hermitian topological systems.

Title: Experimental robustness benchmark of quantum neural network on a superconducting quantum processor

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models, like their classical counterparts, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, hindering their secure deployment. Here, we report the first systematic experimental robustness benchmark for 20-qubit quantum neural network (QNN) classifiers executed on a superconducting processor. Our benchmarking framework features an efficient adversarial attack algorithm designed for QNNs, enabling quantitative characterization of adversarial robustness and robustness bounds. From our analysis, we verify that adversarial training reduces sensitivity to targeted perturbations by regularizing input gradients, significantly enhancing QNN's robustness. Additionally, our analysis reveals that QNNs exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to classical neural networks, an advantage attributed to inherent quantum noise. Furthermore, the empirical upper bound extracted from our attack experiments shows a minimal deviation ($3 \times 10^{-3}$) from the theoretical lower bound, providing strong experimental confirmation of the attack's effectiveness and the tightness of fidelity-based robustness bounds. This work establishes a critical experimental framework for assessing and improving quantum adversarial robustness, paving the way for secure and reliable QML applications.

Title: Simultaneous Estimation of Nonlinear Functionals of a Quantum State
Authors: Kean Chen, Qisheng Wang, Zhan Yu, Zhicheng Zhang
Abstract: We consider a fundamental task in quantum information theory, estimating the values of $\operatorname{tr}(O\rho)$, $\operatorname{tr}(O\rho^2)$, ..., $\operatorname{tr}(O\rho^k)$ for an observable $O$ and a quantum state $\rho$. We show that $\widetilde\Theta(k)$ samples of $\rho$ are sufficient and necessary to simultaneously estimate all the $k$ values. This means that estimating all the $k$ values is almost as easy as estimating only one of them, $\operatorname{tr}(O\rho^k)$. As an application, our approach advances the sample complexity of entanglement spectroscopy and the virtual cooling for quantum many-body systems. Moreover, we extend our approach to estimating general functionals by polynomial approximation.

Title: PulserDiff: a pulse differentiable extension for Pulser
Authors: Vytautas Abramavicius, Melvin Mathé, Gergana V. Velikova, João P. Moutinho, Mario Dagrada, Vincent E. Elfving, Alexandre Dauphin, Joseph Vovrosh, Roland Guichard
Abstract: Programming analog quantum processing units (QPUs), such as those produced by Pasqal, can be achieved using specialized low-level pulse libraries like Pulser. However, few currently offer the possibility to optimize pulse sequence parameters. In this paper, we introduce PulserDiff, a user-friendly and open-source Pulser extension designed to optimize pulse sequences over a well-defined set of control parameters that drive the quantum computation. We demonstrate its usefulness through several case studies involving analog configurations that emulate digital gates and state preparation. PulserDiff produces hardware-compatible pulses with remarkably high fidelities, showcasing its potential for advancing analog quantum computing applications.

Title: Satellite-assisted Entanglement Distribution with High-Dimensional Photonic Encoding
Authors: V. Domínguez Tubío, M.C. Dijksman, J. Borregaard
Abstract: Satellite-assisted entanglement distribution is a promising approach for realizing long-range quantum networking. However, the limited coherence time of existing quantum memories makes it challenging to obtain multiple event-ready entangled pairs between ground stations since one pair decoheres before the successful distribution of another. We demonstrate how this can be circumvented by pairing existing satellite-compatible spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources with qudit-compatible quantum memories on ground. By operating the SPDC source as a source of time-bin encoded photonic qudits, simultaneous distribution of multiple entangled pairs between the ground stations can be achieved at a significantly higher rate than if the SPDC sources was operated as a source of photonic qubits. We find that for achievable coherence times of several seconds and demonstrated satellite performances from the Micius satellite, the qudit operation leads to several orders of magnitude faster distribution rates than the qubit-based operation when more than one event-ready high-quality (Bell pair fidelity $\geq0.95$) entangled pair is desired. To ensure high-quality entanglement distribution, we consider multiplexed quantum memory operation storage and, in the qubit case, we also consider storage cutoff times.

Title: Extending Quantum Computing through Subspace, Embedding and Classical Molecular Dynamics Techniques
Authors: Thomas M. Bickley, Angus Mingare, Tim Weaving, Michael Williams de la Bastida, Shunzhou Wan, Martina Nibbi, Philipp Seitz, Alexis Ralli, Peter J. Love, Minh Chung, Mario Hernández Vera, Laura Schulz, Peter V. Coveney
Abstract: The advent of hybrid computing platforms consisting of quantum processing units integrated with conventional high-performance computing brings new opportunities for algorithms design. By strategically offloading select portions of the workload to classical hardware where tractable, we may broaden the applicability of quantum computation in the near term. In this perspective, we review techniques that facilitate the study of subdomains of chemical systems with quantum computers and present a proof-of-concept demonstration of quantum-selected configuration interaction deployed within a multiscale/multiphysics simulation workflow leveraging classical molecular dynamics, projection-based embedding and qubit subspace tools. This allows the technology to be utilised for simulating systems of real scientific and industrial interest, which not only brings true quantum utility closer to realisation but is also relevant as we look forward to the fault-tolerant regime.

Title: Fusion for High-Dimensional Linear Optical Quantum Computing with Improved Success Probability
Authors: Gözde Üstün, Eleanor G. Rieffel, Simon J. Devitt, Jason Saied
Abstract: Type-II fusion is a probabilistic entangling measurement that is essential to measurement-based linear optical quantum computing and can be used for quantum teleportation more broadly. However, it remains under-explored for high-dimensional qudits. Our main result gives a Type-II fusion protocol with proven success probability approximately $2/d^2$ for qudits of arbitrary dimension $d$. This generalizes a previous method which only applied to even-dimensional qudits. We believe this protocol to be the most efficient known protocol for Type-II fusion, with the $d=5$ case beating the previous record by a factor of approximately $723$. We discuss the construction of the required $(d-2)$-qudit ancillary state using a silicon spin qudit ancilla coupled to a microwave cavity through time-bin multiplexing. We then introduce a general framework of extra-dimensional corrections, a natural technique in linear optics that can be used to non-deterministically correct non-maximally-entangled projections into Bell measurements. We use this method to analyze and improve several different circuits for high-dimensional Type-II fusion and compare their benefits and drawbacks.

Title: Extraction of coherence times of biexciton and exciton photons emitted by a single resonantly excited quantum dot under controlled dephasing
Authors: Jaewon Lee, Charlie Stalker, Loris Colicchio, Fernando Redivo Cardoso, Jan Seelbinder, Sven Höfling, Christian Schneider, Celso J. Villas-Boas, Ana Predojević
Abstract: The visibility of two-photon interference is limited by the indistinguishability of the photons. In the cascaded emission of a three-level system, such as a single quantum dot, the indistinguishability of each photon in the pair is primarily affected by two main factors: the temporal correlation between paired photons and dephasing. Investigating the individual effects of these factors on photon indistinguishability is challenging, as both factors affect it simultaneously. In this study, we investigate the temperature-dependent two-photon interference visibility of the biexciton and exciton photons emitted from a single quantum dot under two-photon resonant excitation, while keeping temporal correlation between the paired photons intact. Finally, we simultaneously extract the coherence times of the biexciton and exciton photons as a function of temperature.

Title: Fluctuation in energy extraction from quantum batteries: How open should the system be to control it?
Authors: Anindita Sarkar, Paranjoy Chaki, Priya Ghosh, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: We ask whether there exists a relation between controllability of the fluctuations in extractable energy of a quantum battery and (a) how open an arbitrary but fixed battery system is and (b) how large the battery is. We examine three classes of quantum processes for the energy extraction: unitary operations, completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, and arbitrary quantum maps, including physically realizable non-CPTP maps. We show that all three process classes yield the same average extractable energy from a fixed quantum battery. Moreover, open systems are better at controlling fluctuations in fixed quantum batteries: while random unitary operations result in nonzero fluctuation in the extractable energy, the remaining two classes lead to vanishing fluctuations in extractable energy. Furthermore, when the auxiliary system used to implement the non-unitary physically realizable maps is restricted up to a dimension $n$, fluctuation in extractable energy scales as $1/n$ for CPTP maps, outperforming the $\ln{n}/n$ scaling observed for general quantum maps. Even within open dynamics, therefore, energy extraction via random CPTP maps exhibits greater resilience to fluctuation compared to processes based on arbitrary quantum maps. We subsequently obtain that fluctuations in extractable energy scale as the inverse of the battery's dimension for all three process classes. Unitary maps, therefore, perform - in the sense of as low fluctuation as possible - equally well as more resource-intensive open maps, provided we have access to large quantum batteries. The results underscore a fundamental trade-off between performance of a battery and the resource cost of implementing the extraction processes.

Title: Quantum-to-classical transition and the emergence of quantum Darwinism with measurements distributed in time -- a path integral approach
Authors: Harsh Arora, Bishal Kumar Das, Baladitya Suri, Vaibhav Madhok
Abstract: We present a new formulation for the emergence of classical dynamics in a quantum world by considering a path integral approach that also incorporates continuous measurements. Our program is conceptually different from the decoherence program as well as the quantum-to-classical transition framework with coarse-grained measurements. The path integral formulation provides the joint statistics of a sequence of measurements with each Feynman path picking up an additional random phase due to measurements. The magnitude of this phase is proportional to the measurement strength, and we give conditions under which the dominant contribution to the probability amplitude comes from the trajectories in the vicinity of the classical paths. The proliferation of this information accross the environment, an essential feature of quantum Darwinism, takes place via scattering of plane-wave probes by the system. Extending to repeated measurements, we show that in the continuous limit, each system trajectory picks up an additional phase due to work done by the momentum kicks from the probes - origin of the back-action force. We provide conditions for which the measurement provides sufficient ''which-path" information and keeps the wave packet sufficiently localized. This allows for description of quantum-to-classical transition at the level of individual trajectories in contrast to the statistical ensemble interpretation provided by density matrices in the decoherence program.

Title: Quantum Compiler Design for Qubit Mapping and Routing: A Cross-Architectural Survey of Superconducting, Trapped-Ion, and Neutral Atom Systems
Authors: Chenghong Zhu, Xian Wu, Zhaohui Yang, Jingbo Wang, Anbang Wu, Shenggen Zheng, Xin Wang
Abstract: Quantum hardware development is progressing rapidly with substantial advancements achieved across leading platforms, including superconducting circuits, trapped-ion systems, and neutral atom arrays. As the pursuit of practical quantum advantage continues, efficient quantum program compilation becomes essential for transforming high-level representations of quantum algorithms into physically executable circuits. A fundamental challenge in this process is qubit mapping and gate scheduling, which play a critical role in adapting compiled circuits to the architectural constraints and physical limitations of specific quantum hardware. In this survey, we systematically review and categorize research on the qubit mapping and routing problems across the three mainstream quantum hardware platforms. We primarily explore the development of hardware-aware compilers for superconducting platforms, classifying existing methods into solver-based, heuristic-based, and machine learning-based approaches, and analyze their optimization targets, including gate count, circuit duration, fidelity, and scalability. Furthermore, we examine the evolution of trapped-ion and neutral atom devices, analyzing the distinct challenges posed by their hardware characteristics and highlighting specialized compilers tailored to these unique physical constraints. Finally, we summarize the key challenges and identify some promising opportunities for future research in quantum compiler design across these hardware platforms.

Title: Quantum circuits for partial differential equations in Fourier space
Authors: Michael Lubasch, Yuta Kikuchi, Lewis Wright, Conor Mc Keever
Abstract: For the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), we show that the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) can enable the design of quantum circuits that are particularly simple, both conceptually and with regard to hardware requirements. This is shown by explicit circuit constructions for the incompressible advection, heat, isotropic acoustic wave, and Poisson's equations as canonical examples. We utilize quantum singular value transformation to develop circuits that are expected to be of optimal computational complexity. Additionally, we consider approximations suited for smooth initial conditions and describe circuits that make lower demands on hardware. The simple QFT-based circuits are efficient with respect to dimensionality and pave the way for current quantum computers to solve high-dimensional PDEs.

Title: Active Quantum Reservoir Engineering: Using a Qubit to Manipulate its Environment
Authors: Marcelo Janovitch, Matteo Brunelli, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.

Title: Is Circuit Depth Accurate for Comparing Quantum Circuit Runtimes?
Authors: Matthew Tremba, Ji Liu, Paul Hovland
Abstract: Although quantum circuit depth is commonly used to estimate differences in circuit runtimes, it overlooks a prevailing trait of current hardware implementation: different gates have different execution times. Consequently, the use of depth may lead to inaccurate comparisons of circuit runtimes, especially for circuits of similar scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative metric, gate-aware depth, that uses unique gate weights, and investigate how its accuracy in comparing circuit runtimes compares to the existing metrics of traditional and multi-qubit circuit depth. To do so, we compiled a suite of 15 practical circuits using different algorithms and compared depths and runtimes between the compiled versions to determine how accurately the size of the change in depth approximated the size of the change in runtime, and how accurately the order of circuits by depth matched their order by runtime. When approximating the size of runtime changes, gate-aware depth decreased the approximation error by an average of 412 times relative to traditional depth and 124 times relative to multi-qubit depth. When matching the order of true runtimes, gate-aware depth achieved the highest accuracy on all devices and a perfect accuracy of 100% on five out of six devices. Additionally, we show that the optimal weights needed to achieve these accuracy improvements can be easily calculated using device gate times, and provide good general weight values for the IBM Eagle and Heron architectures.

Title: Quantum Routing and Entanglement Dynamics Through Bottlenecks
Authors: Dhruv Devulapalli, Chao Yin, Andrew Y. Guo, Eddie Schoute, Andrew M. Childs, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: To implement arbitrary quantum circuits in architectures with restricted interactions, one may effectively simulate all-to-all connectivity by routing quantum information. We consider the entanglement dynamics and routing between two regions only connected through an intermediate "bottleneck" region with few qubits. In such systems, where the entanglement rate is restricted by a vertex boundary rather than an edge boundary of the underlying interaction graph, existing results such as the small incremental entangling theorem give only a trivial constant lower bound on the routing time (the minimum time to perform an arbitrary permutation). We significantly improve the lower bound on the routing time in systems with a vertex bottleneck. Specifically, for any system with two regions $L, R$ with $N_L, N_R$ qubits, respectively, coupled only through an intermediate region $C$ with $N_C$ qubits, for any $\delta > 0$ we show a lower bound of $\Omega(N_R^{1-\delta}/\sqrt{N_L}N_C)$ on the Hamiltonian quantum routing time when using piecewise time-independent Hamiltonians, or time-dependent Hamiltonians subject to a smoothness condition. We also prove an upper bound on the average amount of bipartite entanglement between $L$ and $C,R$ that can be generated in time $t$ by such architecture-respecting Hamiltonians in systems constrained by vertex bottlenecks, improving the scaling in the system size from $O(N_L t)$ to $O(\sqrt{N_L} t)$. As a special case, when applied to the star graph (i.e., one vertex connected to $N$ leaves), we obtain an $\Omega(\sqrt{N^{1-\delta}})$ lower bound on the routing time and on the time to prepare $N/2$ Bell pairs between the vertices. We also show that, in systems of free particles, we can route optimally on the star graph in time $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ using Hamiltonian quantum routing, obtaining a speed-up over gate-based routing, which takes time $\Theta(N)$.

Title: HQSI: Hybrid Quantum Swarm Intelligence -- A Case Study of Online Certificate Status Protocol Request Flow Prediction
Authors: Abel C. H. Chen
Abstract: As quantum computing technology continues to advance, various sectors, including industry, government, academia, and research, have increasingly focused on its future applications. With the integration of artificial intelligence techniques, multiple Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models have been proposed, including quantum convolutional neural networks, quantum long short-term memory networks, and quantum generative adversarial networks. Furthermore, optimization methods such as constrained optimization by linear approximation and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation have been explored. Therefore, this study proposes Hybrid Quantum Swarm Intelligence (HQSI), which constructs a QNN model as a forward propagation neural network. After measuring quantum states and obtaining prediction results, a classical computer-based swarm intelligence algorithm is employed for weight optimization. The training process iterates between quantum and classical computing environments. During the experimental phase, the proposed HQSI method is evaluated using an online certificate status protocol request traffic prediction task. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms demonstrates that the proposed HQSI approach achieves more than a 50% reduction in error.

Title: Fundamental Complement of a Gravitating Region
Authors: Raphael Bousso, Sami Kaya
Abstract: Any gravitating region $a$ in any spacetime gives rise to a generalized entanglement wedge, the hologram $e(a)$. Holograms exhibit properties expected of fundamental operator algebras, such as strong subadditivity, nesting, and no-cloning. But the entanglement wedge EW of an AdS boundary region $B$ with commutant $\bar B$ satisfies an additional condition, complementarity: EW$(B)$ is the spacelike complement of EW$(\bar B)$ in the bulk. Here we identify an analogue of the boundary commutant $\bar B$ in general spacetimes: given a gravitating region $a$, its \emph{fundamental complement} $\tilde{a}$ is the smallest wedge that contains all infinite world lines contained in the spacelike complement $a'$ of $a$. We refine the definition of $e(a)$ by requiring that it be spacelike to $\tilde a$. We prove that $e(a)$ is the spacelike complement of $e(\tilde a)$ when the latter is computed in $a'$. We exhibit many examples of $\tilde{a}$ and of $e(a)$ in de Sitter, flat, and cosmological spacetimes. We find that a Big Bang cosmology (spatially closed or not) is trivially reconstructible: the whole universe is the entanglement wedge of any wedge inside it. But de Sitter space is not trivially reconstructible, despite being closed. We recover the AdS/CFT prescription by proving that EW$(B)=e($causal wedge of $B$).

Title: Strong Hilbert space fragmentation and fractons from subsystem and higher-form symmetries
Authors: Charles Stahl, Oliver Hart, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Rahul Nandkishore
Abstract: We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.

Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of a free massive scalar field at its ground state in (3+1)-dimensional AdS space in global coordinates. We consider spherical entangling surfaces centered at the origin of AdS. We determine the structure of the UV-divergent terms in the entanglement entropy and compute the numerical values of the respective coefficients. We confirm the connection between the coefficient of the logarithmic term and the conformal anomaly.

Title: Vibrational Quantum States of Methanol
Authors: Ayaki Sunaga, Tibor Győri, Gábor Czakó, Edit Matyus
Abstract: The methanol molecule is a sensitive probe of astrochemistry, astrophysics, and fundamental physics. The first-principles elucidation and prediction of its rotation-torsional-vibrational motions are enabled in this work by the computation of a full-dimensional, \emph{ab initio} potential energy surface (PES) and numerically exact quantum dynamics. An active-learning approach is used to sample explicitly correlated coupled-cluster electronic energies, and the datapoints are fitted with permutationally invariant polynomials to obtain a spectroscopic-quality PES representation. Variational vibrational energies and corresponding tunnelling splittings are computed up to the first overtone of the C-O stretching mode by direct numerical solution of the (ro)vibrational Schrödinger equation with optimal internal coordinates and efficient basis and grid truncation techniques. As a result, the computed vibrational band origins finally agree with experiment within $5\ \text{cm}^{-1}$, allowing for the exploration of the large-amplitude quantum mechanical motion and tunnelling splittings coupled with the small-amplitude vibrational dynamics. These developments open the route towards simulating rovibrational spectra used to probe methanol in outer space and in precision science laboratories, as well as for probing interactions with external magnetic fields.

Title: Fast and high-fidelity transfer of edge states via dynamical control of topological phases and effects of dissipation
Authors: Yuuki Kanda, Yusuke Fujisawa, Kousuke Yakubo, Norio Kawakami, Hideaki Obuse
Abstract: Topological edge states are robust against symmetry-preserving perturbations and noise, making them promising for quantum information and computation, particularly in topological quantum computation through braiding operations of Majorana quasiparticles. Realizing these applications requires fast and high-fidelity dynamic control of edge states. In this work, we theoretically propose a high-fidelity method for transferring one-dimensional topological edge states by dynamically moving a domain wall between regions of different topological numbers. This method fundamentally relies on Lorentz invariance and relativistic effects, as moving the domain wall at a constant speed results in the problem into the uniform linear motion of a particle obeying a Dirac equation. We demonstrate effectiveness of our method in transferring edge states with high fidelity using a one-dimensional quantum walk with two internal states, which is feasible with current experimental technology. We also investigate how bit and phase-flip dissipation from environment affects transfer efficiency. Remarkably, these dissipation have minimal effects on efficiency at slow and fast transfer limits, respectively, which can be explained by relativistic effects to the edge states.

Title: Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --
Authors: Takuya Matsumoto, Hiroki Takada, Osami Yasukura
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.

Title: Dissipatively dressed quasiparticles in boundary driven integrable spin chains
Authors: Vladislav Popkov, Xin Zhang, Carlo Presilla, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: The nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of integrable spin chains experiencing strong boundary dissipation is accounted by introducing quasiparticles with a renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. This allows us to evaluate the spectrum of the NESS in terms of the Bethe ansatz equations for a related coherent system which has the same set of eigenstates, the so-called dissipation-projected Hamiltonian. We find explicit analytic expressions for the dressed energies of the XXX and XXZ models with effective, i.e., induced by the dissipation, diagonal boundary fields, which are U(1) invariant, as well as the XXZ and XYZ models with effective non-diagonal boundary fields. In all cases, the dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, substantially altering the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensation in exotic lattice geometries
Authors: Kamil Dutkiewicz, Marcin Płodzień, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Bruno Juliá-Díaz, Maciej Lewenstein, Tobias Grass
Abstract: Modern quantum engineering techniques allow for synthesizing quantum systems in exotic lattice geometries, from self-similar fractal networks to negatively curved hyperbolic graphs. We demonstrate that these structures profoundly reshape Bose-Einstein condensation. Fractal lattices dramatically lower the condensation temperature, while hyperbolic lattices cause it to increase as the system grows - a behavior not seen in ordinary two-dimensional arrays, where the condensation temperature vanishes in the large-size limit. The underlying geometry also controls condensate fluctuations, enhancing them on fractal networks but suppressing them on hyperbolic graphs compared with regular one-dimensional or two-dimensional lattices. When strong repulsive interactions are included, the gas enters a Mott insulating state. A multi-site Gutzwiller approach finds a smooth interpolation between the characteristic insulating lobes of one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. Re-entrant Mott transitions are seen within a first-order resummed hopping expansion. Our findings establish lattice geometry as a powerful tuning knob for quantum phase phenomena and pave the way for experimental exploration in photonic waveguide arrays and Rydberg-atom tweezer arrays.

Title: Derivative coupling in horizon brightened acceleration radiation: a quantum optics approach
Authors: Ashmita Das, Anjana Krishnan, Soham Sen, Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) signifies a unique radiation process and provides a promising framework in exploring acceleration radiation in flat/ curved spacetime. Its construction primarily relies on the transition probability of an atom falling through a high-Q cavity while interacting with a quantum field. The HBAR effect has typically been explored in the context of minimal coupling between the atom and the field amplitude. However, the minimally coupled models are affected by the infrared (IR) divergences that arise in the massless limit of the quantum fields in (1+1) dimensions. Thus, in the present manuscript, we examine the HBAR process using both the point-like and finite size detectors coupled with the momentum of the field, which plays a crucial role in naturally resolving IR divergences. Our results suggest that the transition probability for the point-like detector is independent of its frequency. This can be interpreted as the influence of the local gravitational field which modifies the sensitivity of the detector to its frequency and broadens its effective frequency range. Through a comparative study based on the length of the detector, we find that for a detector with a smaller length, the steady state solution for the density matrix of the field vanishes. This may indicate the existence of a non equilibrium thermodynamic state under the condition of finite size detector-field interaction. These distinctive features are exclusive to the derivative coupling between the atom and the field, highlighting them as a compelling subject for future investigation.

Title: Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost
Authors: Linqing Peng, Shuanglong Liu, Xing Zhang, Xiao Chen, Chenghan Li, Hai-Ping Cheng, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.

Title: Quantum Systems with jump-discontinuous mass. I
Authors: Fabio Deelan Cunden, Giovanni Gramegna, Marilena Ligabò
Abstract: We consider a free quantum particle in one dimension whose mass profile exhibits jump discontinuities. The corresponding Hamiltonian is realised as a self-adjoint extension of the kinetic energy operator formulated in divergence form, with the extension encoded in the boundary conditions at the mass discontinuity points. For a family of scale-free boundary conditions, we analyse the associated spectral problem. We find that the eigenfunctions exhibit a highly sensitive and erratic dependence on the energy, leading to irregular spectral behaviour. Notably, the system supports infinitely many distinct semiclassical limits, each labeled by a point on a spectral curve embedded in the two-torus. These results demonstrate a rich interplay between discontinuous coefficients, boundary data, and spectral asymptotics.

Title: Spin adaptation of the cumulant expansions of reduced density matrices
Authors: Julia Liebert, Christian Schilling, David A. Mazziotti
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for the spin adaptation of the cumulants of p-particle reduced density matrices (RDMs), with explicit constructions for p = 1 to 3. These spin-adapted cumulants enable rigorous treatment of both S_z and S^2 symmetries in quantum systems, providing a foundation for spin-resolved electronic structure methods. We show that complete spin adaptation -- referred to as complete S-representability -- can be enforced by constraining the variances of S_z and S^2, which require the 2-RDM and 4-RDM, respectively. Importantly, the cumulants of RDMs scale linearly with system size -- size-extensive -- making them a natural object for incorporating spin symmetries in scalable electronic structure theories. The developed formalism is applicable to density-based methods (DFT), one-particle RDM functional theories (RDMFT), and two-particle RDM methods. We further extend the approach to spin-orbit-coupled systems via total angular momentum adaptation. Beyond spin, the framework enables the adaptation of RDM theories to additional symmetries through the construction of suitable irreducible tensor operators.

Title: Topological Phases, Criticality, and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator
Authors: Lin Su, Rahul Sahay, Michal Szurek, Alexander Douglas, Ognjen Markovic, Ceren B. Dag, Ruben Verresen, Markus Greiner
Abstract: Phases of matter are conventionally distinguished from one another by local observables. Topological quantum phases lie outside this paradigm; their differences can only be learned by examining them globally. This has striking implications for the stability of these phases, their classification, and the phase transitions between them. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate these implications using interacting magnetic erbium atoms in an optical lattice. We show that a Mott insulator and a pinned charge-density wave in one dimension are in distinct crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). The quantum phase transition separating them is revealed by measuring nonlocal string order parameters using site-resolved imaging. Remarkably, stacking two copies of these states eliminates the critical point -- a signature feature of topological phases that underlies their classification. Moreover, we show that while a programmable symmetry-breaking disorder pattern can also remove this critical point, averaging over disorder restores it, supporting recent theoretical predictions of mixed-state order. Finally, we highlight a connection between one of these CSPTs and the Haldane insulator, and detect signatures of the transition between the Haldane and the Mott insulator. Our results establish a path toward probing broader symmetry-protected topology and mixed-state order in programmable quantum devices.

Title: Polaromechanics: cavity-magnon polaritons strongly coupled to phonons
Authors: Rui-Chang Shen, Jie Li, Yi-Ming Sun, Wei-Jiang Wu, Xuan Zuo, Yi-Pu Wang, Shi-Yao Zhu, J. Q. You
Abstract: Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel {\it polaromechanical} hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at cryogenic temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.

Title: Power of quantum measurement in simulating unphysical operations
Authors: Xuanqiang Zhao, Lei Zhang, Benchi Zhao, Xin Wang
Abstract: The manipulation of quantum states through linear maps beyond quantum operations has many important applications in various areas of quantum information processing. Current methods simulate unphysical maps by sampling physical operations according to classically determined probability distributions. In this work, we show that using quantum measurement instead leads to lower simulation costs for general Hermitian-preserving maps. Remarkably, we establish the equality between the simulation cost and the well-known diamond norm, thus closing a previously known gap and assigning diamond norm a universal operational meaning for all Hermitian-preserving maps. We demonstrate our method in two applications closely related to error mitigation and quantum machine learning, where it exhibits a favorable scaling. These findings highlight the power of quantum measurement in simulating unphysical operations, in which quantum interference is believed to play a vital role. Our work paves the way for more efficient sampling techniques and has the potential to be extended to more quantum information processing scenarios.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Based Quantum Circuit Optimization via ZX-Calculus
Authors: Jordi Riu, Jan Nogué, Gerard Vilaplana, Artur Garcia-Saez, Marta P. Estarellas
Abstract: We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for optimizing quantum circuits using graph-theoretic simplification rules of ZX-diagrams. The agent, trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, employs Graph Neural Networks to approximate the policy and value functions. We demonstrate the capacity of our approach by comparing it against the best performing ZX-Calculus-based algorithm for the problem in hand. After training on small Clifford+T circuits of 5-qubits and few tenths of gates, the agent consistently improves the state-of-the-art for this type of circuits, for at least up to 80-qubit and 2100 gates, whilst remaining competitive in terms of computational performance. Additionally, we illustrate the versatility of the agent by incorporating additional optimization routines on the workflow during training, improving the two-qubit gate count state-of-the-art on multiple structured quantum circuits for relevant applications of much larger dimension and different gate distributions than the circuits the agent trains on. This conveys the potential of tailoring the reward function to the specific characteristics of each application and hardware backend. Our approach is a valuable tool for the implementation of quantum algorithms in the near-term intermediate-scale range (NISQ).

Title: Interplay between disorder and topology in Thouless pumping on a superconducting quantum processor
Authors: Yu Liu, Yu-Ran Zhang, Yun-Hao Shi, Tao Liu, Congwei Lu, Yong-Yi Wang, Hao Li, Tian-Ming Li, Cheng-Lin Deng, Si-Yun Zhou, Tong Liu, Jia-Chi Zhang, Gui-Han Liang, Zheng-Yang Mei, Wei-Guo Ma, Hao-Tian Liu, Zheng-He Liu, Chi-Tong Chen, Kaixuan Huang, Xiaohui Song, SP Zhao, Ye Tian, Zhongcheng Xiang, Dongning Zheng, Franco Nori, Kai Xu, Heng Fan
Abstract: Topological phases are robust against weak perturbations, but break down when disorder becomes sufficiently strong. However, moderate disorder can also induce topologically nontrivial phases. Thouless pumping, as a (1+1)D counterpart of the integer quantum Hall effect, is one of the simplest manifestations of topology. Here, we report experimental observations of the competition and interplay between Thouless pumping and disorder on a 41-qubit superconducting quantum processor. We improve a Floquet engineering technique to realize cycles of adiabatic pumping by simultaneously varying the on-site potentials and the hopping couplings. We demonstrate Thouless pumping in the presence of disorder and show its breakdown as the strength of disorder increases. Moreover, we observe two types of topological pumping that are induced by on-site potential disorder and hopping disorder, respectively. In particular, an intrinsic topological pump that is induced by quasi-periodic hopping disorder has never been experimentally realized before. Our highly controllable system provides a valuable quantum simulating platform for studying various aspects of topological physics in the presence of disorder.

Title: Superconducting qubit readout enhanced by path signature

Abstract: Quantum non-demolition measurement plays an essential role in quantum technology, crucial for quantum error correction, metrology, and sensing. Conventionally, the qubit state is classified from the raw or integrated time-domain measurement record. Here, we demonstrate a method to enhance the assignment fidelity of the readout by considering the "path signature" of this measurement record, where the path signature is a mathematical tool for analyzing stochastic time series. We evaluate this approach across five different hardware setups, including those with and without readout multiplexing and parametric amplifiers, and demonstrate a significant improvement in assignment fidelity across all setups. Moreover, we show that the path signature of the measurement record provides an expressive feature set that can be used to detect and classify state transitions that occurred during the measurement, improving the prediction of the qubit state at the end of the measurement. This method has the potential to become a foundational tool for quantum technology.

Authors: Nouhaila Innan, Alberto Marchisio, Mohamed Bennai, Muhammad Shafique
Abstract: This study introduces the Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection (QFNN-FFD), a cutting-edge framework merging Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and quantum computing with Federated Learning (FL) for financial fraud detection. Using quantum technologies' computational power and the robust data privacy protections offered by FL, QFNN-FFD emerges as a secure and efficient method for identifying fraudulent transactions within the financial sector. Implementing a dual-phase training model across distributed clients enhances data integrity and enables superior performance metrics, achieving precision rates consistently above 95%. Additionally, QFNN-FFD demonstrates exceptional resilience by maintaining an impressive 80% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and readiness for real-world applications. This combination of high performance, security, and robustness against noise positions QFNN-FFD as a transformative advancement in financial technology solutions and establishes it as a new benchmark for privacy-focused fraud detection systems. This framework facilitates the broader adoption of secure, quantum-enhanced financial services and inspires future innovations that could use QML to tackle complex challenges in other areas requiring high confidentiality and accuracy.

Title: Vibrational ADAPT-VQE: Critical points leads to problematic convergence
Authors: Marco Majland, Patrick Ettenhuber, Nikolaj Thomas Zinner, Ove Christiansen
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is one of the most promising applications for which quantum computing is expected to have significant impact. Despite considerable research in the field of electronic structure, calculating the vibrational properties of molecules on quantum computers remain a relatively unexplored field. In this work, we develop a vibrational ADAPT-VQE (vADAPT-VQE) formalism based on an infinite product representation (IPR) of anti-Hermitian excitation operators of the Full Vibrational Configuration Interaction (FVCI) wavefunction which allows for preparing eigenstates of vibrational Hamiltonians on quantum computers. In order to establish the vADAPT- VQE algorithm using the IPR, we study the exactness of disentangled Unitary Vibrational Coupled Cluster (dUVCC) theory and show that dUVCC can formally represent the FVCI wavefunction in an infinite expansion. To investigate the performance of the vADAPT-VQE algorithm, we numerically study whether the vADAPT-VQE algorithm generates a sequence of operators which may represent the FVCI wavefunction. Our numerical results indicate frequent appearance of critical points in the wavefunction preparation using vADAPT-VQE. These results imply that one may encounter diminishing usefulness when preparing vibrational wavefunctions on quantum computers using vADAPT-VQE and that additional studies are required to find methods that can circumvent this behavior.

Title: Preparation of Schrödinger cat quantum state using parametric down-conversion interaction
Authors: V. L. Gorshenin
Abstract: The Schrödinger cat (SC) states are important in quantum optics because of their non-Gaussian properties. We propose a novel method of conditional generation of bright (multi-photon) SC states that uses degenerate parametric down-conversion and heralding measurement of the photon number in the pump mode. We show that this method, in principle, could be implemented using the modern high-\(Q\) optical microresonators.

Title: Operational simultaneous correlations in complementary bases of bipartite states via one-sided semi-device-independent steering
Authors: Chellasamy Jebarathinam, Debarshi Das, Huan-Yu Ku, Debasis Sarkar, Hsi-Sheng Goan
Abstract: Recently, a different form of quantum steering, i.e., certification of quantum steering in a one-sided semi-device-independent way, has been formulated [Jebarathinam \etal Phys. Rev. A 108, 042211 (2023)]. In this work, we use this phenomenon to provide operational simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases as quantified by the measures in [Wu \etal Scientific Reports 4, 4036 (2014)]. First, we show that for any bipartite state, such measure of simultaneous correlations in two mutually unbiased bases can be operationally identified as exhibiting one-sided semi-device-independent steering in a two-setting scenario. Next, we demonstrate that for two-qubit Bell-diagonal states, quantifying one-sided semi-device-independent steerability provides an operational quantification of information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases. Then, we provide a different classification of two-qubit separable states with the above-mentioned information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases and the quantification of one-sided semi-device-independent steerability. Finally, we invoke quantum steering ellipsoid formalism to shed intuitions on the operational characterization of simultaneous correlations in complementary bases of two-qubit states via one-sided semi-device-independent steerability. This provides us with a geometric visualization of the results.

Title: Renormalisation of Quantum Cellular Automata
Authors: Lorenzo Siro Trezzini, Alessandro Bisio, Paolo Perinotti
Abstract: We study a coarse-graining procedure for quantum cellular automata on hypercubic lattices that consists in grouping neighboring cells into tiles and selecting a subspace within each tile. This is done in such a way that multiple evolution steps applied to this subspace can be viewed as a single evolution step of a new quantum cellular automaton, whose cells are the subspaces themselves. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalizability and use it to investigate the renormalization flow of cellular automata on a line, where the cells are qubits and the tiles are composed of two neighboring cells. The problem is exhaustively solved, and the fixed points of the renormalization flow are highlighted.

Title: Optimization by Decoded Quantum Interferometry
Authors: Stephen P. Jordan, Noah Shutty, Mary Wootters, Adam Zalcman, Alexander Schmidhuber, Robbie King, Sergei V. Isakov, Tanuj Khattar, Ryan Babbush
Abstract: Whether quantum computers can achieve exponential speedups in optimization has been a major open question in quantum algorithms since the field began. Here we introduce a quantum algorithm called Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), which uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce optimization problems to decoding problems. For approximating optimal polynomial fits to data over finite fields, DQI efficiently achieves a better approximation ratio than any polynomial time classical algorithm known to us, thus suggesting exponential quantum speedup. Sparse unstructured optimization problems such as max-k-XORSAT are reduced to decoding of LDPC codes. We prove a theorem which allows the performance of DQI to be calculated instance-by-instance based on the empirical performance of classical decoders. We use this to construct an instance of max-XORSAT for which DQI finds an approximate optimum that cannot be found by simulated annealing or any of the other general-purpose classical heuristics that we tried, unless given five orders of magnitude more compute time than the decoding problem requires. Although we subsequently design a tailored classical solver that beats DQI within reasonable runtime, our results nevertheless demonstrate that the combination of quantum Fourier transforms with powerful decoding primitives provides a promising new approach to finding quantum speedups for hard optimization problems.

Title: Quasiperiodic trajectories drawn by the Bloch vector of the thermal multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model
Authors: Hiroo Azuma
Abstract: We study the time evolution of the Bloch vector of the thermal multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). If the multiphoton JCM incorporates thermal fluctuations, its corresponding Bloch vector evolves unpredictably, traces a disordered trajectory, and exhibits quasiperiodicity. However, if we plot the trajectory as a discrete-time sequence with a constant time interval, it reveals unexpected regularities. First, we show that this plot is invariant under a scale transformation of a finite but non-zero time interval. Second, we numerically evaluate the times at which the absolute value of the $z$-component of the Bloch vector is nearly equal to zero. At those times, the density matrix of the two-level system approximates a classical ensemble of the ground and excited states. We demonstrate that some time values can be derived from the denominators of the fractions of certain approximations for irrational numbers. The reason underlying these findings is that the components of the Bloch vector for the thermal multiphoton JCM are described with a finite number of trigonometric functions whose dimensionless angular frequencies are irrational numbers in the low-temperature limit.

Title: VAE-QWGAN: Addressing Mode Collapse in Quantum GANs via Autoencoding Priors
Authors: Aaron Mark Thomas, Harry Youel, Sharu Theresa Jose
Abstract: Recent proposals for quantum generative adversarial networks (GANs) suffer from the issue of mode collapse, analogous to classical GANs, wherein the distribution learnt by the GAN fails to capture the high mode complexities of the target distribution. Mode collapse can arise due to the use of uninformed prior distributions in the generative learning task. To alleviate the issue of mode collapse for quantum GANs, this work presents a novel \textbf{hybrid quantum-classical generative model}, the VAE-QWGAN, which combines the strengths of a classical Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) with a hybrid Quantum Wasserstein GAN (QWGAN). The VAE-QWGAN fuses the VAE decoder and QWGAN generator into a single quantum model, and utilizes the VAE encoder for data-dependant latent vector sampling during training. This in turn, enhances the diversity and quality of generated images. To generate new data from the trained model at inference, we sample from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior that is learnt on the latent vectors generated during training. We conduct extensive experiments for image generation QGANs on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST datasets and compute a range of metrics that measure the diversity and quality of generated samples. We show that VAE-QWGAN demonstrates significant improvement over existing QGAN approaches.

Title: Aspect of bipartite coherence in quantum discord to semi-device-independent nonlocality and its implication for quantum information processing
Authors: Chellasamy Jebarathinam, Huan-Yu Ku, Hao-Chung Cheng, Hsi-Sheng Goan
Abstract: $\textit{Nonlocality}$ or $\textit{steerability}$ of $\textit{quantum discord}$ can be demonstrated in the context of a $\textit{semi-device-independent}$ Bell or steering scenario where shared randomness is not a free resource, respectively. This work addresses which aspect of $\textit{bipartite coherence}$ is essential for such semi-device-independent quantum information tasks going beyond Bell nonlocality or standard quantum steering. It has been shown that $\textit{global coherence}$ of a single system can be transformed into $\textit{bipartite entanglement}$. However, global coherence can also be present in quantum discord. At the same time, discord can display bipartite coherence locally, i.e., only in a subsystem or in both subsystems. Thus, global coherence of bipartite separable states is defined here as a form of bipartite coherence that is not reducible to local coherence in any of the subsystems or both subsystems. To answer the above-mentioned question, we demonstrate that global coherence is necessary to demonstrate semi-device-independent nonlocality or steerability of quantum discord in any given Bell or steering scenario, respectively. From this result, it follows that for the resource theory of semi-device-independent nonlocality or steerability of discord, any $\textit{local operations}$ of the form $\Phi_A \otimes \Phi_B$ that may create $\textit{coherence locally}$ from an incoherent state are $\textit{free operations}$. As a by-product, we identify the precise quantum resource for the quantum communication task of $\textit{remote state preparation}$ using two-qubit separable states.

Title: Use of Electron Paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to build quantum computers: n-qubit (n=1,2,3,4) Toffoli Gates
Authors: Sayan Manna, Sushil K. Misra
Abstract: It is shown theoretically how to use the EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) technique, using electron spins as qubits, coupled with each other by the exchange interaction, to set the configuration of n qubits (n=1,2,3,4) at resonance, in conjunction with pulses, to construct the NOT (one qubit), CNOT (two qubits), CCNOT (three qubits), CCCNOT (four qubits) Toffoli gates, which can be exploited to build a quantum computer. This is unique to EPR, wherein exchange-coupled electron spins are used. This is not possible with NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), that uses nuclear spins as qubits, which do not couple with each other by the exchange interaction.

Title: Implementing Semiclassical Szegedy Walks in Classical-Quantum Circuits for Homomorphic Encryption
Authors: Sergio A. Ortega, Pablo Fernández, Miguel A. Martin-Delgado
Abstract: As cloud services continue to expand, the security of private data stored and processed in these environments has become paramount. This work delves into quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE), an emerging technology that facilitates secure computation on encrypted quantum data without revealing the underlying information. We reinterpret QHE schemes through classical-quantum circuits, enhancing efficiency and addressing previous limitations related to key computations. Our approach eliminates the need for exponential key preparation by calculating keys in real-time during simulation, leading to a linear complexity in classically controlled gates. We also investigate the $T/T^{\dagger}$-gate complexity associated with various quantum walks, particularly Szegedy quantum and semiclassical algorithms, demonstrating efficient homomorphic implementations across different graph structures. Our simulations, conducted in Qiskit, validate the effectiveness of QHE for both standard and semiclassical walks. The rules for the homomorphic evaluation of the reset and intermediate measurement operations have also been included to perform the QHE of semiclassical walks. Additionally, we introduce the CQC-QHE library, a comprehensive tool that simplifies the construction and simulation of classical-quantum circuits tailored for quantum homomorphic encryption. Future work will focus on optimizing classical functions within this framework and exploring broader graph types to enhance QHE applications in practical scenarios.

Title: Small but large: Single organic molecules as hybrid platforms for quantum technologies
Authors: Burak Gurlek, Daqing Wang
Abstract: Single organic molecules embedded in solid-state matrices exhibit remarkable optical properties, making them competitive candidates for single-photon sources and quantum nonlinear optical elements. However, the lack of long-lived internal states imposes significant constraints on their application in the broader field of quantum technologies. In this article, we reexamine the single-molecule host-guest system from first principles, elaborate on the rich internal states this system encompasses and put forward strategies to harness them for applications in quantum memory, spin-photon interface, spin register, and optomechanics. Further, we discuss the potential of leveraging the vast chemical space of molecules, and highlight the challenges and opportunities for molecular systems along these directions.

Title: Variational quantum state diagonalization with computational-basis probabilities
Authors: Juan Yao
Abstract: In this report, we propose a novel quantum diagonalization algorithm based on the optimization of variational quantum circuits. Diagonalizing a quantum state is a fundamental yet computationally challenging task in quantum information science, especially as the system size increases. To address this challenge, we reformulate the problem as a variational optimization process, where parameterized quantum circuits are trained to transform the input state into a diagonal form. To guide the optimization, we develop two objective functions based on measurement outcomes in the computational basis. The first objective function utilizes global computational basis probabilities, with the optimized value directly yielding the purity of the input state. The second objective function, designed for enhanced experimental feasibility, is constructed solely from single-qubit probabilities. It admits an elegant and compact analytical form that significantly reduces the exponential measurement complexity, while still effectively driving the state toward a diagonal representation. Through numerical simulations and analytical insights, we demonstrate that our variational optimization framework successfully produces the diagonal form of an input quantum state, offering a scalable and practical solution for quantum state diagonalization.

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental expressivity limits of quantum reservoir computing (QRC) by establishing a formal connection to parametrized quantum circuit quantum machine learning (PQC-QML). We analytically prove, and numerically corroborate, that in QRC the number of orthogonal non-linear functions that can be generated from classical data is bounded linearly by the number of input encoding gates, independent of the reservoir's Hilbert space size. This finding applies across both physical and gate-based reservoir implementations using typical single-qubit input rotation schemes. Our results challenge the common assumption that exponential Hilbert space scaling confers a corresponding computational advantage in QRC, and demonstrate that true quantum benefit will require either more sophisticated, potentially multi-qubit, input schemes or quantum-native input data. These insights lay new groundwork for the design and evaluation of future QRC hardware and algorithms.

Title: Persistent fermionic entanglement under decoherence
Authors: E. Salinas, A. P. Majtey, A. Valdés-Hernández
Abstract: We consider a system of two indistinguishable fermions (with four accessible states each) that suffers decoherence without dissipation due to its coupling with a global bosonic bath at a fixed temperature. Using an appropriate measure of fermionic entanglement, we identify families of two-fermion states whose entanglement persists throughout the evolution, either fully or partially, despite the noisy effects of the interaction with the bath, and independently of its temperature. The identified resilience to decoherence provides valuable insights into the entanglement dynamics of open systems of indistinguishable fermions, and into the conditions under which long-lived entanglement emerges under more general decoherence channels.

Title: Nonstabilizerness of a Boundary Time Crystal
Authors: Gianluca Passarelli, Angelo Russomanno, Procolo Lucignano
Abstract: Boundary time crystals exhibit measurement-induced phase transitions in their steady-state entanglement, with critical behavior that depends on the particular unraveling of the Lindblad dynamics. In this work, we investigate another key measure of quantum complexity -- nonstabilizerness (or ``magic'') -- and show that it follows a markedly different pattern. Importantly, in contrast to entanglement, for large system sizes, nonstabilizerness remains invariant under different unraveling schemes -- a property we attribute to the inherent permutational symmetry of the model. Although the steady-state stabilizer entropy does not display a genuine phase transition, it exhibits a singular derivative (a cusp) at the mean-field critical point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that finite-size simulations of the average Lindblad evolution fail to capture the asymptotic behavior of nonstabilizerness in the time-crystal phase, while quantum trajectory unravelings correctly reveal its extensive scaling with system size. These findings offer insights into how different quantum resources manifest in open systems.

Title: Multi-Timescale Coherent Control via Quantum Averaging Theory for High-Fidelity Gate Operations
Authors: Kristian D. Barajas, Wesley C. Campbell
Abstract: We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling Mølmer-Sørensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.

Title: Quantum Averaging Theory for Multi-Timescale Driven Quantum Systems
Authors: Kristian D. Barajas, Wesley C. Campbell
Abstract: We present a multi-timescale Quantum Averaging Theory (QAT), a generalized unitarity-preserving analytic framework for modeling periodically and almost-periodically driven quantum systems across multiple timescales. By integrating the Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT captures the effects of both far-detuned and near-resonant interactions on system dynamics. The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.

Title: On the Efficient Extraction of Entangled Resources
Authors: Si-Yi Chen, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti, Marcello Caleffi
Abstract: In the Quantum Internet, multipartite entanglement enables a rich and dynamic overlay topology, referred to as artificial topology, upon the physical one, that can be exploited for communication purposes. In fact, the ability to extract $n$-qubits GHZ states and EPR pairs from the original multipartite entangled state constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand quantum communications. Thus, in this paper, we theoretically determine upper and lower bounds for the number of extractable $n$-qubits GHZ states and EPR pairs involving nodes remote in the artificial topology, as well as the achievable size $n$ of remote GHZ states. The theoretical analysis is then complemented by the proposal of a novel algorithm, which provides in polynomial-time a heuristic solution to the above problem. This is remarkable, since the theoretical problem is NP-complete. The performance analysis demonstrates the proposed algorithm is able to effectively manipulate the original and arbitrary graph state for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.

Title: Optimal statistical ensembles for quantum thermal state preparation within the quantum singular value transformation framework
Authors: Yasushi Yoneta
Abstract: Preparing thermal equilibrium states is an essential task for finite-temperature quantum simulations. In statistical mechanics, microstates in thermal equilibrium can be obtained from statistical ensembles. To date, numerous ensembles have been devised, ranging from Gibbs ensembles such as the canonical and microcanonical ensembles to a variety of generalized ensembles. Since these ensembles yield equivalent thermodynamic predictions, one can freely choose an ensemble for computational convenience. In this paper, we exploit this flexibility to develop an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing thermal equilibrium states. We first present a quantum algorithm for implementing generalized ensembles within the framework of quantum singular value transformation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the computational cost and elucidate its dependence on the choice of the ensemble. Our analysis shows that employing an appropriate ensemble can significantly mitigate ensemble-dependent overhead and yield improved scaling of the computational cost with system size compared to existing methods based on the canonical ensemble. We also numerically demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost even for small finite-size systems. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary thermodynamic systems at any temperature and is thus expected to offer a practical and versatile method for computing finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems. These results highlight the potential of ensemble design as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of a broad class of quantum algorithms.

Title: Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks
Authors: Matija Tečer, Giuseppe Calajó, Marco Di Liberto
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.

Title: Dark States of Light and the Hidden Energy in Thermal Radiation Detection
Authors: Celso Jorge Villas-Boas, Ciro Micheletti Diniz
Abstract: We develop a quantum-optical framework demonstrating that thermal radiation can confine a significant portion of its energy in dark collective modes -- highly entangled photon states that, despite their photonic nature, remain decoupled from matter through standard electromagnetic interactions. In a system comprising $M$ thermal field modes, we show that only a fraction $1/M$ of the total energy is accessible to matter, while the remaining $(M-1)/M$ is stored in dark states, rendering it undetectable by conventional electromagnetic means. We also demonstrate that intensity measurements, commonly used to estimate field energy, can be misleading due to collective effects that suppress or enhance light-matter coupling. To explore further this phenomenon, we analyze a cavity QED model enclosing a single dissipative atom and show that symmetry breaking in the atom-field interaction enables access to the hidden energy stored in dark modes. While inconclusive, these findings suggest that dark states of light may underlie certain unexplained energy phenomena, pointing to a possible microscopic mechanism based on the collective structure of thermal radiation.

Title: Exact Solutions and Quantum Defect Theory for van der Waals Potentials in Ultracold Molecular Systems
Authors: Jianwen Jie, Shi Chen, Yue Chen, Ran Qi
Abstract: In this paper, we have provided exact two-body solutions to the 2D and 3D Schrödinger equations with isotropic van der Waals potentials of the form \(\pm 1/r^6\). Based on these solutions, we developed an analytical quantum defect theory (QDT) applicable to both quasi-2D and 3D geometries, and applied it to study the scattering properties and bound-state spectra of ultracold polar molecules confined in these geometries. Interestingly, we find that in the attractive (repulsive) van der Waals potential case, the short-range interaction can be effectively modeled by an infinite square barrier (finite square well), which leads to narrow and dense (broad and sparse) resonance structures in the quantum defect parameter. In the quasi-2D attractive case, shape resonances can appear in an ordered fashion across different partial waves, characterized by sharp phase jumps as the scattering energy is varied. Furthermore, the low-energy analytical expansions derived from QDT show excellent agreement with the exact numerical results, validating the accuracy and usefulness of our analytical approach in describing two-body physics governed by long-range van der Waals interactions.

Title: Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times
Authors: Deepak Sah, Manoranjan P. Singh
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.

Title: Hamiltonian for a Bose gas with Contact Interactions
Authors: Daniele Ferretti, Alessandro Teta
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian for a three-dimensional Bose gas of $N \geq 3$ spinless particles interacting via zero-range (also known as contact) interactions. Such interactions are encoded by (singular) boundary conditions imposed on the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide. It is well known that imposing the same kind of boundary conditions as in the two-body problem with a point interaction leads to a Hamiltonian unbounded from below (and thus unstable). This is due to the fact that the interaction becomes overly strong and attractive when the coordinates of three or more particles coincide. In order to avoid such instability, we develop a suggestion originally formulated by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962, introducing slightly modified boundary conditions that weaken the strength of the interaction between two particles $i$ and $j$ in two scenarios: (a) a third particle approaches the common position of $i$ and $j$; (b) another distinct pair of particles approach each other. In all other cases, the usual boundary condition is restored. Using a quadratic form approach, we construct a class of Hamiltonians characterized by such modified boundary conditions, that are self-adjoint and bounded from below. We also compare our approach with the one developed years ago by Albeverio, Høegh-Krohn and Streit using the theory of Dirichlet forms (J. Math. Phys., 18, 907--917, 1977). In particular, we show that the $N$-body Hamiltonian defined by Albeverio et al. is a special case of our class of Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we also introduce a Dirichlet form by considering a more general weight function, and we prove that the corresponding $N$-body Hamiltonians essentially coincide with those constructed via our method.

Title: CMOS-fabricated ultraviolet light modulators using low-loss alumina piezo-optomechanical photonic circuits
Authors: Zachary A. Castillo, Roman Shugayev, Daniel Dominguez, Michael Gehl, Nicholas Karl, Andrew Leenheer, Bethany Little, Yuan-Yu Jau, Matt Eichenfield
Abstract: Ultra-violet (UV) and near-UV wavelengths are necessary for many important optical transitions for quantum technologies and various sensing mechanisms for biological and chemical detection. However, all well-known photonic platforms have excessively high losses in the UV, which has prevented photonic integrated circuits (PICs) being used to address these and other important application spaces. Photonic waveguides using low-loss alumina cores have emerged as a promising solution because of almunia's large optical bandgap and the high quality of films enabled by atomic layer deposition. However, to the best of our knowledge, active alumina PICs have only been realized using thermo-optic tuning, which precludes switching speeds shorter than one microsecond, high circuit densities, and cryogenically compatible operation. Here, we introduce a CMOS-fabricated, piezo-optomechanical PIC platform using alumina waveguides with low optical losses at UV wavelengths and aluminum nitride piezoelectric strain actuators, which solves the issues associated with thermal tuning. We demonstrate a high-performance, reconfigurable optical filter operating at wavelengths as low as 320 nm. The filter has a 6 nanosecond switching time, a loaded linewidth of 3.3 GHz, tuning rate of -120 MHz/V, and a hold power less than 20 nW.

Title: Generalized flux trajectories: New insights into partially coherent Airy beams
Authors: A. S. Sanz, R. Martínez-Herrero
Abstract: The propagation of Airy beams in free space is characterized by being non dispersive, which warrants the shape invariance of their intensity distribution, and self-accelerating along the transverse direction. These distinctive traits are still present in partially coherent Airy beams as long as the reach of their back tail (and hence their energy content) is not importantly reduced. To investigate the effects associated with the decrease of the beam coherence and its power content (by smoothly reducing the reach of their back tails), here we introduce a novel and insightful methodology based on a generalization of the concept of flux trajectory for paraxial partially coherent beams. This methodologies emphasizes the role of phase relations, thus helping to clarify why and how the beam smears out spatially along its propagation. This formalism, though, is general enough to tackle other types of structured light beams with whatever degree of partial coherence, from full coherence to total incoherence.

Title: Inducing a transition between thermal and many-body localized states and detecting many-body mobility edges through dissipation
Authors: Yutao Hu, Chao Yang, Yucheng Wang
Abstract: The many-body mobility edge (MBME) in energy, which separates thermal states from many-body localization (MBL) states, is a critical yet controversial concept in MBL physics. Here we examine the quasiperiodic $t_1-t_2$ model that features a mobility edge. With the addition of nearest-neighbor interactions, we suggest the potential existence of a MBME. Then we investigate the impact of a type of bond dissipation on the many-body system by calculating the steady-state density matrix and analyzing the transport behavior, and demonstrate that dissipation can cause the system to predominantly occupy either the thermal region or the MBL region, irrespective of the initial state. Finally, we discuss the effects of increasing system size. Our results indicate that dissipation can induce transitions between thermal and MBL states, providing a new approach for experimentally determining the existence of the MBME.

Title: The multi-state geometry of shift current and polarization
Authors: Alexander Avdoshkin, Johannes Mitscherling, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: The quantum metric and Berry curvature capture essential properties of non-trivial Bloch states and underpin many fascinating phenomena. However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsically multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using previously calculated minimal tight-binding models, and demonstrated analytically on a three-band generalization of the Rice-Mele chain to elucidate the different contributions. We close with comments on further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.

Title: Kramers-Wannier self-duality and non-invertible translation symmetry in quantum chains: a wave-function perspective
Authors: Hua-Chen Zhang, Germán Sierra
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.

Title: Solving and visualizing fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions with neural network
Authors: Yi Teng, David D. Dai, Liang Fu
Abstract: We introduce an attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN) to variationally solve the problem of two-dimensional Coulomb electron gas in magnetic fields, a canonical platform for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids, Wigner crystals and other unconventional electron states. Working directly with the full Hilbert space of $N$ electrons confined to a disk, our FNN consistently attains energies lower than LL-projected exact diagonalization (ED) and learns the ground state wavefunction to high accuracy. In low LL mixing regime, our FNN reveals microscopic features in the short-distance behavior of FQH wavefunction beyond the Laughlin ansatz. For moderate and strong LL mixing parameters, the FNN outperforms ED significantly. Moreover, a phase transition from FQH liquid to a crystal state is found at strong LL mixing. Our study demonstrates unprecedented power and universality of FNN based variational method for solving strong-coupling many-body problems with topological order and electron fractionalization.

Title: Gauge-invariant projector calculus for quantum state geometry and applications to observables in crystals
Authors: Johannes Mitscherling, Alexander Avdoshkin, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research. More complex aspects of geometry emerge in properties linking multiple bands, such as optical responses. In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.

Title: Chirality-induced Spin-Orbit Coupling and Spin Selectivity
Authors: Massimiliano Di Ventra, Rafael Gutierrez, Gianaurelio Cuniberti
Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling because of the curvature of the path. We then estimate the magnitude of this effective geometric spin-orbit interaction for structures that showcase chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that this chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling ($\chi$-SOC), in conjunction with broken time-reversal symmetry, may be an important ingredient for the microscopic underpinning of the CISS phenomenon.

Title: Rigorous lower bound of the dynamical critical exponent of the Ising model
Authors: Rintaro Masaoka, Tomohiro Soejima, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: We study the kinetic Ising model under Glauber dynamics and establish an upper bound on the spectral gap for finite systems. This bound implies the critical exponent inequality $z \geq 2$, thereby rigorously improving the previously known estimate $z \geq 2 - \eta$. Our proof relies on the mapping from stochastic processes to frustration-free quantum systems and leverages the Simon--Lieb and Gosset--Huang inequalities.

Title: Adiabatic Gauge Potential as a Tool for Detecting Chaos in Classical Systems
Authors: Nachiket Karve, Nathan Rose, David Campbell
Abstract: The interplay between chaos and thermalization in weakly non-integrable systems is a rich and complex subject. Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos, which is interpreted as a ``mixing" time. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. Further, a hierarchy of $t_{\text{Lyapunov}} < t_{\text{chaos}} < t_{\text{thermalization}}$ is found in these models. We conclude by commenting on the wide applicability of our method to a broader class of systems.

Title: Quantum response theory and momentum-space gravity
Authors: M. Mehraeen
Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.

Title: Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Xuhao Jiang, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.

Title: Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics
Authors: Masaya Kunimi, Yusuke Kato, Hosho Katsura
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.
