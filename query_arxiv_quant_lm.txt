Title: Quantum QSAR for drug discovery
Authors: Alejandro Giraldo, Daniel Ruiz, Mariano Caruso, Guido Bellomo
Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is key in drug discovery, but classical methods face limitations when handling high-dimensional data and capturing complex molecular interactions. This research proposes enhancing QSAR techniques through Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), which leverage quantum computing principles to process information Hilbert spaces. By using quantum data encoding and quantum kernel functions, we aim to develop more accurate and efficient predictive models.

Title: A review of applications of Quantum Energy Teleportation: from experimental tests to thermodynamics and spacetime engineering
Authors: Boris Ragula, Eduardo Martín-Martínez
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) exploits the existence of correlations to enable remote energy transfer without without the need for physical energy carriers between emitter and receiver. This paper presents a review of the thermodynamic foundations of QET and reviews its first experimental demonstration (performed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), along with its implementation on publicly available superconducting quantum hardware. Additionally, we review an application of QET in the field of quantum thermodynamics as an efficient algorithmic cooling technique to cool down individual parts of interacting systems. Finally, we will review how QET can be employed to optimally generate exotic quantum states characterized by negative average stress-energy densities, offering a new operational approach to engineering such states which are promising in the context of semiclassical gravity.

Title: Approximate Quadratization of High-Order Hamiltonians for Combinatorial Quantum Optimization
Authors: Sabina Drăgoi, Alberto Baiardi, Daniel J. Egger
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems have wide-ranging applications in industry and academia. Quantum computers may help solve them by sampling from carefully prepared Ansatz quantum circuits. However, current quantum computers are limited by their qubit count, connectivity, and noise. This is particularly restrictive when considering optimization problems beyond the quadratic order. Here, we introduce Ansatze based on an approximate quadratization of high-order Hamiltonians which do not incur a qubit overhead. The price paid is a loss in the quality of the noiseless solution. Crucially, this approximation yields shallower Ansatze which are more robust to noise than the standard QAOA one. We show this through simulations of systems of 8 to 16 qubits with variable noise strengths. Furthermore, we also propose a noise-aware Ansatz design method for quadratic optimization problems. This method implements only part of the corresponding Hamiltonian by limiting the number of layers of SWAP gates in the Ansatz. We find that for both problem types, under noise, our approximate implementation of the full problem structure can significantly enhance the solution quality. Our work opens a path to enhance the solution quality that approximate quantum optimization achieves on noisy hardware.

Title: Measurement-driven quantum advantages in shallow circuits
Authors: Chenfeng Cao, Jens Eisert
Abstract: Quantum advantage schemes probe the boundary between classically simulatable quantum systems and those that computationally go beyond this realm. Here, we introduce a constant-depth measurement-driven approach for efficiently sampling from a broad class of dense instantaneous quantum polynomial-time circuits and associated Hamiltonian phase states, previously requiring polynomial-depth unitary circuits. Leveraging measurement-adaptive fan-out staircases, our "dynamical circuits" circumvent light-cone constraints, enabling global entanglement with flexible auxiliary qubit usage on bounded-degree lattices. Generated Hamiltonian phase states exhibit statistical metrics indistinguishable from those of fully random architectures. Additionally, we demonstrate measurement-driven globally entangled feature maps capable of distinguishing phases of an extended SSH model from random eigenstates using a quantum reservoir-computing benchmark. Technologically, our results harness the power of mid-circuit measurements for realizing quantum advantages on hardware with a favorable topology. Conceptually, we highlight their power in achieving rigorous computational speedups.

Title: Correlating noise floor with magic and entanglement in Pauli product states
Authors: Erika Lloyd, Alexandre Fleury, Marc P. Coons, James Brown, Maritza Hernandez
Abstract: The dependence of quantum algorithms on state fidelity is difficult to characterize analytically and is best explored experimentally as hardware scales and noisy simulations become intractable. While low fidelity states are often disregarded, they may still retain valuable information, as long as their dominant eigenvector approximates the target state. Through classical purification, we demonstrate the ability to recover resources specific to quantum computing such as magic and entanglement from noisy states generated by Pauli product formulas, which are common subroutines of many quantum algorithms. The fidelity of purified states represents the noise floor of a given computation and we show its dependence on both the magnitude and order in which magic and entanglement are generated. Using an ion trap quantum device, we experimentally validate these findings by collecting classical shadow data for a range of small circuits. While overall consistent, our results reveal meaningful differences in the captured qubit correlations, further highlighting the gap between conventional numerical studies and real experimental outcomes. In both simulation and experiment, we show the advantage of designing methods targeting states which are more robust against noise. This study uses quantum informatic tools for analyzing quantum algorithms in a noisy framework, and demonstrates practical strategies for optimizing quantum circuit performance.

Title: Quantum information processing in modular cavity QED architectures
Authors: Z. M. McIntyre
Abstract: This thesis contains a collection of articles exploring various aspects of quantum information processing with cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), starting with qubit noise spectroscopy and building towards the longer-term goal of modular quantum-computing architectures equipped with protocols for controlling and correcting the states of distantly separated qubits. The first chapter presents a self-contained introduction to the field of cavity QED. Following this introductory material, we show in Chapter 2 how measurements of the field emitted by a cavity can be leveraged for in-situ qubit noise spectroscopy in the presence of significant inhomogeneous broadening. We also identify a signature of genuinely quantum noise in the cavity output field originating from the non-commutation of bath operators acting on the qubit. In Chapter 3, we present a novel quantum-optical effect whereby a suitable modulation of a longitudinal cavity-qubit coupling can be used to entangle the state of a qubit with the path taken by a multiphoton wavepacket. Entanglement between a qubit and a which-path degree-of-freedom can in turn be used to generate entanglement between distant stationary qubits. As shown in Chapter 4, qubit-which-path entanglement can also be exploited for maximally sensitive estimation of a phase in a Mach-Zehnder interferometry setup, i.e., sensing at the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. In Chapter 5, we discuss strategies for realizing stabilizer measurements using qubit-conditioned phase shifts applied to propagating pulses of radiation. We find that in the context of a subsystem surface code, photon loss during such stabilizer measurements would not introduce any horizontal hook errors on the code qubits. In the sixth and final chapter, we give protocols for performing entangling gates between distant stationary qubits using Fock- or time-bin encoded photons.

Title: Quantum-enabled optical large-baseline interferometry: applications, protocols and feasibility
Authors: Zixin Huang, Oleg Titov, Mikolaj K. Schmidt, Benjamin Pope, Gavin K. Brennen, Daniel Oi, Pieter Kok
Abstract: Optical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offers the potential for unprecedented angular resolution in both astronomical imaging and precision measurements. Classical approaches, however, face significant limitations due to photon loss, background noise, and the requirements for dynamical delay lines over large distances. This document surveys recent developments in quantum-enabled VLBI, which aim to address these challenges using entanglement-assisted protocols, quantum memory storage, and nonlocal measurement techniques. While its application to astronomy is well known, we also examine how these techniques may be extended to geodesy -- specifically, the monitoring of Earth's rotation. Particular attention is given to quantum-enhanced telescope architectures, including repeater-based long baseline interferometry and quantum error-corrected encoding schemes, which offer a pathway toward high-fidelity optical VLBI. To aid the discussion, we also compare specifications for key enabling technologies to current state-of-the-art experimental components, including switching rates, gate times, entanglement distribution rates, and memory lifetimes. By integrating quantum technologies, future interferometric networks may achieve diffraction-limited imaging at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, surpassing the constraints of classical techniques and enabling new precision tests of astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena.

Title: An Introduction to Variational Quantum Eigensolver Applied to Chemistry
Authors: Matheus da S. Fonseca, Caio M. Porto, Nicolás A. C. Carpio, Guilherme S. T. Moraes, Nelson H. Morgon, René A. Nome, Celso J. Villas-Boas
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has introduced a new theoretical framework for the study of molecules, enabling the prediction of properties and dynamics through the solution of the Schrödinger equation applied to these systems. However, solving this equation is computationally expensive, which has led to the development of various mathematical frameworks and computational methods designed to balance the available resources with the desired level of accuracy. In particular, quantum computers have emerged as a promising technology with the potential to address these problems more efficiently in the coming decades, whether through reductions in memory, time, and energy consumption, $\textit{i. e.}$, reductions in computational complexity or by enhancing precision. This research field is known as Quantum Simulation. Given the current technological limitations of quantum computers, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), especially the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), stand out as a feasible approach to demonstrating advantages over classical methods in the near term. This feasibility arises from their lower demand for quantum gates and the reduced depth of the circuits required for their implementation. In this work, we present the application of quantum mechanics to the study of molecules, provide an introduction to the fundamentals of quantum computing, and explore the integration of these fields by employing the VQE in molecular simulations. Finally, we discuss the spatial and temporal complexity associated with the algorithm, highlighting its implications and challenges.

Title: Single-bounce quantum gravimeter to measure the free-fall of anti-hydrogen
Authors: Joachim Guyomard, Pierre Cladé, Serge Reynaud
Abstract: We introduce an innovative concept for a matter-wave gravimeter, where atoms prepared in a Heisenberg-limited quantum state perform a single bounce on a surface followed by a free fall that reveals interferences. This new approach to quantum gravimetry produces a more robust interference pattern compared to previous multi-bounce proposals. We specify numbers and expected performance for the GBAR experiment, which aims at measuring the free-fall acceleration of antihydrogen at CERN antimatter facilities, and show that this approach improves the expected accuracy of the measurement. Our method opens the door to gravity measurements on rare or exotic atomic species, especially in situations where experimental time or detection events are fundamentally constrained.

Title: Secure quantum ranging
Authors: Yunkai Wang, Graeme Smith, Alex May
Abstract: Determining and verifying an object's position is a fundamental task with broad practical relevance. We propose a secure quantum ranging protocol that combines quantum ranging with quantum position verification (QPV). Our method achieves Heisenberg-limited precision in position estimation while simultaneously detecting potential cheaters. Two verifiers each send out a state that is entangled in frequency space within a single optical mode. An honest prover only needs to perform simple beam-splitter operations, whereas cheaters are allowed to use arbitrary linear optical operations, one ancillary mode, and perfect quantum memories-though without access to entanglement. Our approach considers a previously unstudied security aspect to quantum ranging. It also provides a framework to quantify the precision with which a prover's position can be verified in QPV, which previously has been assumed to be infinite.

Title: Resonant pump intensity dependence of luminescence achieved via Floquet engineering
Authors: I. S. Pashkevich, I. V. Doronin, A. A. Zyablovsky, E. S. Andrianov
Abstract: We discover an unexpected behavior in a hybrid system composed of cavity strongly coupled to molecules and subjected to high intensity coherent pumping. We show that if the frequency of the pumping wave is close to polariton transitions in the hybrid system, non monotone dependence of fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump intensity with a narrow resonance-like response occurs. We demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs due to hybridization of lower and upper polaritons with substantially different excitation numbers caused by the pumping affecting polariton states of the system. This occurs when the Rabi interaction with coherent field is comparable to the field-matter coupling constant which in turn needs to be sufficient for the manifestation of strong coupling. This non-monotonic dependence of the fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump rate intensity pave the way for creation of nonlinear optical devices.

Title: Quantum-Inspired Optimization Process for Data Imputation
Authors: Nishikanta Mohanty, Bikash K. Behera, Badsah Mukherjee, Christopher Ferrie
Abstract: Data imputation is a critical step in data pre-processing, particularly for datasets with missing or unreliable values. This study introduces a novel quantum-inspired imputation framework evaluated on the UCI Diabetes dataset, which contains biologically implausible missing values across several clinical features. The method integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with quantum-assisted rotations, optimized through gradient-free classical optimizers -COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution to reconstruct missing values while preserving statistical fidelity. Reconstructed values are constrained within +/-2 standard deviations of original feature distributions, avoiding unrealistic clustering around central tendencies. This approach achieves a substantial and statistically significant improvement, including an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values between 0.18 and 0.22, compared to p-values > 0.99 in classical methods such as Mean, KNN, and MICE. The method also eliminates zero-value artifacts and enhances the realism and variability of imputed data. By combining quantum-inspired transformations with a scalable classical framework, this methodology provides a robust solution for imputation tasks in domains such as healthcare and AI pipelines, where data quality and integrity are crucial.

Title: Spontaneous Raman scattering out of a metastable atomic qubit
Authors: I. D. Moore, A. Quinn, J. O'Reilly, J. Metzner, S. Brudney, G. J. Gregory, D. J. Wineland, D. T. C. Allcock
Abstract: Metastable qubits in atomic systems can enable large-scale quantum computing by simplifying hardware requirements and adding efficient erasure conversion to the pre-existing toolbox of high-fidelity laser-based control. For trapped atomic ions, the fundamental error floor of this control is given by spontaneous Raman and Rayleigh scattering from short-lived excited states. We measure spontaneous Raman scattering rates out of a metastable $D_{5/2}$ qubit manifold of a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion illuminated by 976 nm light that is -44 THz detuned from the dipole-allowed transition to the $P_{3/2}$ manifold. This supports the calculation of error rates from both types of scattering during one- and two-qubit gates on this platform, thus demonstrating that infidelities $<10^{-4}$ are possible.

Title: GroverGPT-2: Simulating Grover's Algorithm via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Quantum-Native Tokenization
Authors: Min Chen, Jinglei Cheng, Pingzhi Li, Haoran Wang, Tianlong Chen, Junyu Liu
Abstract: Quantum computing offers theoretical advantages over classical computing for specific tasks, yet the boundary of practical quantum advantage remains an open question. To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether, and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2 outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research, and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.

Title: Enhanced resolution chirped-pulse interferometry
Authors: Madeleine Bérubé, Michael D. Mazurek, Kevin J. Resch
Abstract: Chirped-pulse interferometry (CPI) is a classical low-coherence interferometry technique with automatic dispersion cancellation and improved resolution over white-light interference. Previous work has shown that CPI with linearly-chirped Gaussian laser pulses achieves a $\sqrt{2}$ improvement in resolution over conventional white-light interferometry, but this is less than the factor of 2 improvement exhibited by a comparable quantum technique. In this work, we show how a particular class of nonlinearly-chirped laser pulses can meet, and even exceed, the factor of 2 improvement resolution. This enhanced resolution CPI removes the remaining advantage of quantum interferometers in dispersion-cancelled interferometry.

Title: Enhancing the Dynamic Range of Quantum Sensing via Quantum Circuit Learning
Authors: Hideaki Kawaguchi, Yuichiro Mori, Takahiko Satoh, Yuichiro Matsuzaki
Abstract: Quantum metrology is a promising application of quantum technologies, enabling the precise measurement of weak external fields at a local scale. In typical quantum sensing protocols, a qubit interacts with an external field, and the amplitude of the field is estimated by analyzing the expectation value of a measured observable. Sensitivity can, in principle, be enhanced by increasing the number of qubits within a fixed volume, thereby maintaining spatial resolution. However, at high qubit densities, inter-qubit interactions induce complex many-body dynamics, resulting in multiple oscillations in the expectation value of the observable even for small field amplitudes. This ambiguity reduces the dynamic range of the sensing protocol. We propose a method to overcome the limitation in quantum metrology by adopting a quantum circuit learning framework using a parameterized quantum circuit to approximate a target function by optimizing the circuit parameters. In our method, after the qubits interact with the external field, we apply a sequence of parameterized quantum gates and measure a suitable observable. By optimizing the gate parameters, the expectation value is trained to exhibit a monotonic response within a target range of field amplitudes, thereby eliminating multiple oscillations and enhancing the dynamic range. This method offers a strategy for improving quantum sensing performance in dense qubit systems.

Title: Discrete time crystal for periodic-field sensing with quantum-enhanced precision
Authors: Rozhin Yousefjani, Saif Al-Kuwari, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: Sensing periodic-fields using quantum sensors has been an active field of research. In many of these scenarios, the quantum state of the probe is flipped regularly by the application of ${\pi}$-pulses to accumulate information about the target periodic-field. The emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase, as a nonequilibrium phase of matter, naturally provides oscillations in a many-body system with an inherent controllable frequency. They benefit from long coherence time and robustness against imperfections, which makes them excellent potential quantum sensors. In this paper, through theoretical and numerical analysis, we show that a disorder-free discrete time crystal probe can reach the ultimate achievable precision for sensing a periodic-field. As the amplitude of the periodic-field increases, the discrete time crystalline order diminishes, and the performance of the probe decreases remarkably. Nevertheless, the obtained quantum enhancement in the discrete time crystal phase shows robustness against different imperfections in the protocol. Finally, we propose the implementation of our protocol in ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.

Title: Isotope-selective Ion Trapping via Sympathetic Cooling using a Surface-Electrode Trap with a Hole for Collimated Atomic Loading
Authors: Masanari Miyamoto, Takashi Higuchi, Kentaro Furusawa, Norihiko Sekine, Kazuhiro Hayasaka, Utako Tanaka
Abstract: We developed a surface-electrode ion trap with a square hole measuring $40\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ for atomic loading. The hole was fabricated using anisotropic etching of a silicon substrate and was designed to minimize potential distortion in the trapping region. By introducing the atomic beam through the hole, we achieved enhanced isotope selectivity and experimentally demonstrated the selective trapping of calcium isotope ions using an atomic oven. We successfully prepared isotope ion pairs directly from the oven via sympathetic cooling at a rate comparable to that achieved using ablation loading. The sympathetic cooling process occurred on the order of a few seconds. We demonstrated the direct generation of an ion chain above the through-hole. This approach can be applied for trapping a wide range of ion species using a remarkably simple experimental setup, making it desirable for several applications such as quantum-charge-coupled-device (QCCD) architectures and precision measurements of isotope shifts.

Title: Non-Hermitian sensing from the perspective of post-selected measurements
Authors: Neng Zeng, Tao Liu, Keyu Xia, Yu-Ran Zhang, Franco Nori
Abstract: By employing the Naimark dilation, we establish a fundamental connection between non-Hermitian quantum sensing and post-selected measurements. The sensitivity of non-Hermitian quantum sensors is determined by the effective quantum Fisher information (QFI), which incorporates the success probability of post-selection. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian sensors cannot outperform their Hermitian counterpart when all information is harnessed, since the total QFI for the extended system constrains the effective QFI of the non-Hermitian subsystem. Moreover, we quantify the efficiency of non-Hermitian sensors with the ratio of the effective QFI to the total QFI, which can be optimized within the framework of post-selected measurements with minimal experimental trials. Our work provides a distinctive theoretical framework for investigating non-Hermitian quantum sensing and designing noise-resilient quantum metrological protocols.

Title: From Hope to Heuristic: Realistic Runtime Estimates for Quantum Optimisation in NHEP
Authors: Maja Franz, Manuel Schönberger, Melvin Strobl, Eileen Kühn, Achim Streit, Pía Zurita, Markus Diefenthaler, Wolfgang Mauerer
Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, despite their limitations, present opportunities for near-term quantum advantages in Nuclear and High-Energy Physics (NHEP) when paired with specially designed quantum algorithms and processing units. This study focuses on core algorithms that solve optimisation problems through the quadratic Ising or quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation model, specifically quantum annealing and the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA). In particular, we estimate runtimes and scalability for the task of particle track reconstruction, a key computing challenge in NHEP, and investigate how the classical parameter space in QAOA, along with techniques like a Fourier-analysis based heuristic, can facilitate future quantum advantages. The findings indicate that lower frequency components in the parameter space are crucial for effective annealing schedules, suggesting that heuristics can improve resource efficiency while achieving near-optimal results. Overall, the study highlights the potential of NISQ computers in NHEP and the significance of co-design approaches and heuristic techniques in overcoming challenges in quantum algorithms.

Title: Quantum Acoustics with Superconducting Qubits in the Multimode Transition-Coupling Regime
Authors: Li Li, Xinhui Ruan, Si-Lu Zhao, Bing-Jie Chen, Gui-Han Liang, Yu Liu, Cheng-Lin Deng, Wei-Ping Yuan, Jia-Cheng Song, Zheng-He Liu, Tian-Ming Li, Yun-Hao Shi, He Zhang, Ming Han, Jin-Ming Guo, Xue-Yi Guo, Xiaohui Song, Qianchuan Zhao, Jing Zhang, Pengtao Song, Kai Xu, Heng Fan, Yu-Xi Liu, Zhihui Peng, Zhongcheng Xiang, Dongning Zheng
Abstract: Hybrid mechanical-superconducting systems for quantum information processing have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications. In such systems, the weak coupling regime, dominated by dissipation, has been extensively studied. The strong coupling regime, where coherent energy exchange exceeds losses, has also been widely explored. However, the transition-coupling regime, which lies between the above two and exhibits rich, unique physics, remains underexplored. In this study, we fabricate a tunable coupling device to investigate the coupling of a superconducting transmon qubit to a seven-mode surface acoustic wave resonator (SAWR), with a particular focus on the transition-coupling regime. Through a series of phonon oscillation experiments and studies in the dispersive regime, we systematically characterize the performance of the SAWR. We then explore the complex dynamics of energy exchange between the qubit and the mechanical modes, highlighting the interplay between dissipation and coherence. Finally, we propose a protocol for qubit readout and fast reset with a multimode mechanical cavity using one mode for readout and another mode for reset. We have demonstrated in simulation that the qubit achieves both fast reset and high coherence performance when the qubit is coupled to the reset mode in the transition-coupling regime.

Title: Overcoming Dimensional Factorization Limits in Discrete Diffusion Models through Quantum Joint Distribution Learning
Authors: Chuangtao Chen, Qinglin Zhao, MengChu Zhou, Zhimin He, Haozhen Situ
Abstract: This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning.

Title: A short review on qudit quantum machine learning
Authors: Tiago de Souza Farias, Lucas Friedrich, Jonas Maziero
Abstract: As quantum devices scale toward practical machine learning applications, the binary qubit paradigm faces expressivity and resource efficiency limitations. Multi-level quantum systems, or qudits, offer a promising alternative by harnessing a larger Hilbert space, enabling richer data embeddings, more compact variational circuits, and support for multi-valued problem structures. In this work, we review the role of qudits in quantum machine learning techniques, mainly variational quantum algorithms and quantum neural networks. Drawing on recent experimental demonstrations, including high-level superconducting transmons, qutrit-based combinatorial optimization, and single-qudit classifiers, we highlight how qudit architectures can reduce circuit depth and parameter counts while maintaining competitive fidelity. We further assess the evolving software ecosystem, from specialized simulators and differentiable-programming libraries to extensions of mainstream frameworks. We also identify key challenges in control complexity, noise management, and tooling maturity.

Title: Influence of vibrational motion and temperature on interatomic Coulombic electron capture
Authors: Elena M. Jahr, Jan Senk, Jan P. Drennhaus, Premysl Kolorenc, Nicolas Sisourat, Elke Fasshauer
Abstract: Interatomic Coulombic Electron Capture (ICEC) is an environment-mediated process in which a free electron attaches to a species by transferring excess energy to a neighbor. While previous theoretical investigations assumed fixed nuclei, recent studies indicate that nuclear dynamics significantly influences the ICEC process. In this work, we incorporate the vibrational motion into an analytical model of the ICEC cross section including both energy and electron transfer. To validate this approach, we compare the results to the adiabatic-nuclei approximation based on fixed-nuclei ab initio R-matrix calculations. We apply our theory to the helium-neon dimer, which is ideal for studying diverse dynamical effects. We show that while vibrational dynamics can slightly reduce ICEC efficiency, ICEC remains dominant over photorecombination and can trigger dimer dissociation. Accounting for the nuclear motion also enables to describe the broadening of the electron spectrum and enables evaluation of temperature-dependent cross sections - capabilities beyond the reach of fixed-nuclei approaches.

Title: Planar fault-tolerant circuits for non-Clifford gates on the 2D color code
Authors: Andreas Bauer, Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente
Abstract: We introduce a family of scalable planar fault-tolerant circuits that implement logical non-Clifford operations on a 2D color code, such as a logical $T$ gate or a logical non-Pauli measurement that prepares a magic $|T\rangle$ state. The circuits are relatively simple, consisting only of physical $T$ gates, $CX$ gates, and few-qubit measurements. They can be implemented with an array of qubits on a 2D chip with nearest-neighbor couplings, and no wire crossings. The construction is based on a spacetime path integral representation of a non-Abelian 2+1D topological phase, which is related to the 3D color code. We turn the path integral into a circuit by expressing it as a spacetime $ZX$ tensor network, and then traversing it in some chosen time direction. We describe in detail how fault tolerance is achieved using a "just-in-time" decoding strategy, for which we repurpose and extend state-of-the-art color-code matching decoders.

Title: Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results
Authors: Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Jovan Odavić, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.

Title: Switching Dynamics of Metastable Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Ya-Xin Xiang, Weibin Li, Zhengyang Bai, Yu-Qiang Ma
Abstract: Classical metastability manifests as noise-driven switching between disjoint basins of attraction and slowing down of relaxation, quantum systems like qubits and Rydberg atoms exhibit analogous behavior through collective quantum jumps and long-lived Liouvillian modes with a small spectral gap. Though any metastable mode is expected to decay after a finite time, stochastic switching persists indefinitely. Here, we elaborate on the connection between switching dynamics and quantum metastability through the lens of the large deviation principles, spectral decomposition, and quantum-jump simulations. Specifically, we distinguish the trajectory-level noise-induced metastability (stochastic switching) from the spectrum-level deterministic metastability (small Liouvillian gap) in a Markovian open quantum system with bistability. Without stochastic switching, whether a small spectral gap leads to slow relaxation depends on initial states. In contrast, with switching, the memory of initial conditions is quickly lost, and the relaxation is limited by the rare switching between the metastable states. Consistent with the exponential scaling of the Liouvillian gap with system size, the switching rates conform to the Arrhenius law, with the inverse system size serving as the nonequilibrium analog of temperature. Using the dynamical path integral and the instanton approach, we further extend the connection between the quasipotential functional and the probabilities of rare fluctuations to the quantum realm. These results provide new insights into quantum bistability and the relaxation processes of strongly interacting, dissipative quantum systems far away from the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Optimal Decoder for the Error Correcting Parity Code
Authors: Konstantin Tiurev, Christophe Goeller, Leo Stenzel, Paul Schnabl, Anette Messinger, Michael Fellner, Wolfgang Lechner
Abstract: We present a two-step decoder for the parity code and evaluate its performance in code-capacity and faulty-measurement settings. For noiseless measurements, we find that the decoding problem can be reduced to a series of repetition codes while yielding near-optimal decoding for intermediate code sizes and achieving optimality in the limit of large codes. In the regime of unreliable measurements, the decoder demonstrates fault-tolerant thresholds above 5% at the cost of decoding a series of independent repetition codes in (1 + 1) dimensions. Such high thresholds, in conjunction with a practical decoder, efficient long-range logical gates, and suitability for planar implementation, position the parity architecture as a promising candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage on qubit platforms with strong noise bias.

Title: Quantum Teleportation from Telecom Photons to Erbium-ion Ensembles
Authors: Yu-Yang An, Qian He, Wenyi Xue, Ming-Hao Jiang, Chengdong Yang, Yan-Qing Lu, Shining Zhu, Xiao-Song Ma
Abstract: To realize a quantum internet, the distribution of quantum states via quantum teleportation with quantum memories is a key ingredient. Being compatible with existing fiber networks, entangled photons and quantum memories at telecom-wavelength are of central interest for such a scalable quantum network. Here, we demonstrate quantum teleportation from a telecom-wavelength photonic qubit to a solid-state quantum memory based on erbium-ion ensembles, which have a native optical transition at 1.5 $\mu$m telecom C-band. To accomplish this, we use chip-scale silicon nitride micro-resonators to generate entangled photons with narrow linewidth, compatible with the quantum memory. We confirm the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure using quantum state and process tomography techniques, in which both the quantum state and process fidelities exceeds the classical limit. These results pave the way for the realization of scalable quantum networks based on solid-state devices.

Title: Quantum optical formulation of difference-frequency generation and optimal cloning of spatial modes
Authors: Tanita Permaul, Andrew Forbes, Thomas Konrad
Abstract: We present a quantum optical formulation of difference-frequency generation (DFG) that incorporates the spatial modes of light. It reproduces the well established result for classical light beams and establishes the relation of DFG to stimulated and spontaneous parametric downconversion. As shown here, these relations determine that stimulated parametric down-conversion can realise $N\xrightarrow{} M $ $d$-dimensional optimal quantum cloning.

Title: Quantum Surrogate-Driven Image Classifier: A Gradient-Free Approach to Avoid Barren Plateaus
Authors: Yichen Xie
Abstract: Training deep quantum neural networks (QNNs) for image classification is notoriously difficult due to vanishing gradients (barren plateaus) and limited nonlinearity in purely unitary circuits. We propose a novel gradient-free surrogate-driven framework combined with mid-circuit measurement and reset of ancillary qubits to induce effective nonunitarity. Our approach uses a classical neural surrogate to predict measurement outcomes from circuit parameters to avoid direct gradients. Theoretical results prove that bypassing quantum gradients mitigates plateau issues. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with 15-qubit, 6-layer circuits using four resettable ancillas demonstrate superior accuracy compared to direct-gradient QNNs and classical baselines. Our method also serves as a potential for a generalized training framework applicable to various QNN architectures beyond image classification.

Title: Gap-preserving reductions and RE-completeness of independent set games
Authors: Laura Mančinska, Pieter Spaas, Taro Spirig
Abstract: In complexity theory, gap-preserving reductions play a crucial role in studying hardness of approximation and in analyzing the relative complexity of multiprover interactive proof systems. In the quantum setting, multiprover interactive proof systems with entangled provers correspond to gapped promise problems for nonlocal games, and the recent result MIP$^*$=RE (Ji et al., arXiv:2001.04383) shows that these are in general undecidable. However, the relative complexity of problems within MIP$^*$ is still not well-understood, as establishing gap-preserving reductions in the quantum setting presents new challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework to study such reductions and use it to establish MIP$^*$-completeness of the gapped promise problem for the natural class of independent set games. In such a game, the goal is to determine whether a given graph contains an independent set of a specified size. We construct families of independent set games with constant question size for which the gapped promise problem is undecidable. In contrast, the same problem is decidable in polynomial time in the classical setting. To carry out our reduction, we establish a new stability theorem, which could be of independent interest, allowing us to perturb families of almost PVMs to genuine PVMs.

Title: Distributed quantum sensing with measurement-after-interaction strategies
Authors: Jiajie Guo, Shuheng Liu, Matteo Fadel, Qiongyi He
Abstract: We investigate multiparameter quantum estimation protocols based on measurement-after-interaction (MAI) strategies, in which the probe state undergoes an additional evolution prior to linear measurements. As we show in our study, this extra evolution enables different level of advantages depending on whether it is implemented locally or nonlocally across the sensing nodes. By benchmarking MAI strategies in both discrete- and continuous-variable systems, we show that they can significantly enhance multiparameter sensitivity and robustness against detection noise, particularly when non-Gaussian probe states are employed, cases where standard linear measurements are often insufficient. We also derive analytical results for multiparameter squeezing and establish the corresponding scaling laws for spin-squeezed states, demonstrating that MAI protocols can reach the Heisenberg scaling. These results pave the way for immediate experimental implementation in platforms such as atomic ensembles and optical fields.

Title: From the Bloch equation to a thermodynamically consistent master equation
Authors: Eugenia Pyurbeeva, Ronnie Kosloff
Abstract: The Bloch equation, that set the foundation for open quantum systems, was conceived by pure physical reasoning. Since then, the Lindblad (GKLS) form of a quantum master equation, its most general mathematical representation, became an established staple in the open quantum systems toolbox. It allows to describe a multitude of quantum phenomena, however, its universality comes at a cost -- without additional constraints, the resultant dynamics are not necessarily thermodynamically consistent, and the equation itself lacks an intuitive interpretation. We present a mathematically equivalent form of the Lindblad master equation under a single constraint of strict energy conservation. The ``elemental Bloch'' equation separates the system dynamics into its elemental parts, making an explicit distinction between thermal mixing, dephasing, and energy relaxation, and thus reinstating the physical intuition in the equation. We derive the equation for a many-level system by accounting for all relevant transitions between pairs of levels. Finally, the formalism is illustrated by calculating the fixed point of the dynamics and exploring the conditions for canonical invariance in quantum systems.

Title: Operator-Level Quantum Acceleration of Non-Logconcave Sampling
Authors: Jiaqi Leng, Zhiyan Ding, Zherui Chen, Lin Lin
Abstract: Sampling from probability distributions of the form $\sigma \propto e^{-\beta V}$, where $V$ is a continuous potential, is a fundamental task across physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, and statistics. However, when $V$ is non-convex, the resulting distribution becomes non-logconcave, and classical methods such as Langevin dynamics often exhibit poor performance. We introduce the first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value thresholding and yields the first provable quantum advantage with respect to the Poincaré constant in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this framework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates replica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from complex, rugged energy landscapes.

Title: Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields
Authors: Daniele Gamba, Bingyu Cui, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation where the external field plays an explicit role. Using these results, we provide an illustration of their usefulness and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.

Title: Quantum-Aware Network Planning and Integration
Authors: Cédric Ware, Mounia Lourdiane
Abstract: In order to broaden the adoption of highly-demanded quantum functionalities such as QKD, there is a need for having quantum signals coexist with classical traffic over the same physical medium, typically optical fibers in already-deployed networks. Beyond the experimental point-to-point demonstrations of the past few years, efforts are now underway to integrate QKD at the network level: developing interfaces with the software-defined-network ecosystem; but also network planning tools that satisfy physical-layer contraints jointly on the classical and quantum signals. We have found that in certain situations, naïve network planning prioritizing quantum traffic drastically degrades classical capacity, whereas a quantum-aware wavelength assignment heuristic allows coexistence with minimal impact on both capacities. More such techniques will be required to enable widespread deployment of QKD and other future quantum functionalities.

Title: An analytical exploration of the optomechanical attractor diagram and of limit cycles
Authors: Jorge G. Russo, Miguel Tierz
Abstract: We analyse the interplay between mechanical and radiation pressure in an optomechanical cavity system. Our study is based on an analytical evaluation of the infinite Bessel summations involved, which previously had led to a numerical exploration of the so-called attractor diagram. The analytical expressions are then suitable for further asymptotic analysis in opposing regimes of the amplitude, which allows for a characterisation of the diagram in terms of elementary functions. The same method is applied to the study of optomechanical limit cycles, extending previous results for enhanced values of the parameter space without the need for approximations such as the resolved sideband approximation.

Title: Scalable Quantum Architecture Search via Landscape Analysis
Authors: Chenghong Zhu, Xian Wu, Hao-Kai Zhang, Sixuan Wu, Guangxi Li, Xin Wang
Abstract: Balancing trainability and expressibility is a central challenge in variational quantum computing, and quantum architecture search (QAS) plays a pivotal role by automatically designing problem-specific parameterized circuits that address this trade-off. In this work, we introduce a scalable, training-free QAS framework that efficiently explores and evaluates quantum circuits through landscape fluctuation analysis. This analysis captures key characteristics of the cost function landscape, enabling accurate prediction of circuit learnability without costly training. By combining this metric with a streamlined two-level search strategy, our approach identifies high-performance, large-scale circuits with higher accuracy and fewer gates. We further demonstrate the practicality and scalability of our method, achieving significantly lower classical resource consumption compared to prior work. Notably, our framework attains robust performance on a challenging 50-qubit quantum many-body simulation, highlighting its potential for addressing complex quantum problems.

Title: Device-independent Shannon entropy certification
Authors: Robert Okuła, Piotr Mironowicz
Abstract: Quantum technologies promise information processing and communication technology advancements, including random number generation (RNG). Using Bell inequalities, a user of a quantum RNG hardware can certify that the values provided by an untrusted device are truly random. This problem has been extensively studied for von Neumann and min-entropy as a measure of randomness. However, in this paper, we analyze the feasibility of such verification for Shannon entropy. We investigate how the usability of various Bell inequalities differs depending on the presence of noise. Moreover, we present the benefit of certification for Shannon compared to min-entropy.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Dynamical Response Functions of Equilibrium States
Authors: Esther Cruz, Dominik S. Wild, Mari Carmen Bañuls, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: The computation of dynamical response functions is central to many problems in condensed matter physics. Owing to the rapid growth of quantum correlations following a quench, classical methods face significant challenges even if an efficient description of the equilibrium state is available. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative. However, existing approaches often assume access to the equilibrium state, which may be difficult to prepare in practice. In this work, we present a method that circumvents this by using energy filter techniques, enabling the computation of response functions and other dynamical properties in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Our approach only requires the preparation of states that have significant weight at the desired energy. The dynamical response functions are then reconstructed from measurements after quenches of varying duration by classical postprocessing. We illustrate the algorithm numerically by applying it to compute the dynamical conductivity of a free-fermion model, which unveils the energy-dependent localization properties of the model.

Title: A new time-dependent quantum theory based on Tsallis' distribution
Authors: Won Sang Chung, Georg Junker, Luis M. Nieto, Hassan Hassanabadi
Abstract: In this paper, inspired by Tsallis' probability distribution based on a $q$-deformed Boltzmann factor, we stipulate a new $q$-deformed quantum dynamics by applying the inverse Wick rotation $ \beta \rightarrow i t$ to the Tsallis-deformed Boltzmann factor. We obtain a new time-dependent $q$-deformed Schrödinger equation. The free time-evolution of a Gaussian wave packet and that induced by an harmonic interaction are studied within this $q$-deformed quantum mechanical framework.

Title: Statistical Characterization of Entanglement Degradation Under Markovian Noise in Composite Quantum Systems
Authors: Nunzia Cerrato, Sauro Succi, Giacomo De Palma, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: Understanding how noise degrades entanglement is crucial for the development of reliable quantum technologies. While the Markovian approximation simplifies the analysis of noise, it remains computationally demanding, particularly for high-dimensional systems like quantum memories. In this paper, we present a statistical approach to study the impact of different noise models on entanglement in composite quantum systems. By comparing global and local noise scenarios, we quantify entanglement degradation using the Positive Partial Transpose Time (PPTT) metric, which measures how long entanglement persists under noise. When the sampling of different noise scenarios is performed under controlled and homogeneous conditions, our analysis reveals that systems subjected to global noise tend to exhibit longer PPTTs, whereas those influenced by independent local noise models display the shortest entanglement persistence. To carry out this analysis, we employ a computational method proposed by Cao and Lu, which accelerates the simulation of PPTT distributions and enables efficient analysis of systems with dimensions up to $D=8$. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for investigating the resilience of quantum systems under Markovian noise.

Title: Non-Markovianity in collision models with initial intra-environment correlations
Authors: Graeme Pleasance, Angel E. Neira, Marco Merkli, Francesco Petruccione
Abstract: Collision models (CMs) describe an open system interacting in sequence with elements of an environment, termed ancillas. They have been established as a useful tool for analyzing non-Markovian open quantum dynamics based on the ability to control the environmental memory through simple feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how ancilla-ancilla entanglement can serve as a mechanism for controlling the non-Markovianity of an open system, focusing on an operational approach to generating correlations within the environment. To this end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially generated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a composite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an enlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and show that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of ancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand, when system-ancilla collisions precede ancilla-ancilla entanglement, we find the open dynamics to always be Markovian. Our findings highlight how certain qualitative features of inter-ancilla correlations can strongly influence the onset of system non-Markovianity.

Title: Asymmetric decay of quantum many-body scars in XYZ quantum spin chains
Authors: Dhiman Bhowmick, Vir B. Bulchandani, Wen Wei Ho
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are atypical energy eigenstates of chaotic quantum many-body systems that prevent certain special non-equilibrium initial conditions from thermalizing. We point out that quantum many-body scars exist for any nearest-neighbor spin-$S$ XYZ quantum spin chain, and arise in the form of an infinite family of highly excited yet nonentangled product-state eigenstates, which define periodic textures in spin space. This set of scars, discovered originally by Granovskii and Zhedanov in 1985, encompasses both the experimentally relevant 'spin helices' for XXZ chains and more complicated helix-like states constructed from Jacobi elliptic functions for generic XYZ chains. An appealing feature of Granovskii-Zhedanov scars is that they are well-defined in the semiclassical limit $S \to \infty$, which allows for a systematic and analytical treatment of their dynamical instability to perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Using time-dependent spin-wave theory, we predict that upon perturbing along certain directions in Hamiltonian space, Granovskii-Zhedanov scars exhibit a dramatic asymmetry in their decay: depending on the sign of the perturbation, the decrease of their contrast is either slow and linear, or fast and exponential in time. This asymmetry can be traced to the absence (presence) of imaginarity in the spectrum of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian governing quantum fluctuations about the scar, which corresponds to the absence (presence) of a non-zero Lyapunov exponent for the limiting classical trajectory. Numerical simulations using matrix product states (MPS) and infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) confirm that our prediction remains valid even far from the semiclassical limit. Our findings challenge existing theories of how quantum-many body scars relax.

Title: A Solovay-Kitaev theorem for quantum signal processing
Authors: Zane M. Rossi
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) studies quantum circuits interleaving known unitaries (the phases) and unknown unitaries encoding a hidden scalar (the signal). For a wide class of functions one can quickly compute the phases applying a desired function to the signal; surprisingly, this ability can be shown to unify many quantum algorithms. A separate, basic subfield in quantum computing is gate approximation: among its results, the Solovay-Kitaev theorem (SKT) establishes an equivalence between the universality of a gate set and its ability to efficiently approximate other gates. In this work we prove an 'SKT for QSP,' showing that the density of parameterized circuit ansätze in classes of functions implies the existence of short circuits approximating desired functions. This is quite distinct from a pointwise application of the usual SKT, and yields a suite of independently interesting 'lifted' variants of standard SKT proof techniques. Our method furnishes alternative, flexible proofs for results in QSP, extends simply to ansätze for which standard QSP proof methods fail, and establishes a formal intersection between QSP and gate approximation.

Title: High-fidelity entanglement of metastable trapped-ion qubits with integrated erasure conversion
Authors: A. Quinn, G. J. Gregory, I. D. Moore, S. Brudney, J. Metzner, E. R. Ritchie, J. O'Reilly, D. J. Wineland, D. T. C. Allcock
Abstract: We present metastable qubits in trapped ions as potential erasure qubits for which most fundamental algorithm errors can be converted into erasures. We first implement an erasure conversion scheme which enables us to detect $\sim$94% of spontaneous Raman scattering errors and nearly all errors from qubit decay. Second, we perform a two-ion geometric phase gate with a SPAM-corrected fidelity of 98.56% using far-detuned (-43 THz) Raman beams. Subtracting runs where erasures were detected, this fidelity becomes 99.14%. We present a pathway for improved gate efficiency and reduced overhead from erasure conversion.

Authors: Zoe Gonzalez Izquierdo, Sophie Block, Besart Mujeci, P. Aaron Lott, Davide Venturelli, David Bell
Abstract: In the rapidly expanding field of quantum computing, one key aspect to maintain ongoing progress is ensuring that early career scientists interested in the field get appropriate guidance and opportunity to advance their work, and in return that institutions and enterprises with a stake in quantum computing have access to a qualified pool of talent. Internship programs at the graduate level are the perfect vehicle to achieve this. In this paper, we review the trajectory of the USRA Feynman Quantum Academy Internship Program over the last 8 years, placing it in the context of the current push to prepare the quantum workforce of the future, and highlighting the caliber of the work it produced.

Title: Disorder-Free Localization and Fragmentation in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Giovanni Cataldi, Giuseppe Calajó, Pietro Silvi, Simone Montangero, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: We investigate how isolated quantum many-body systems equilibrate when quenched far from equilibrium under non-Abelian gauge-symmetry constraints. By encoding gauge superselection sectors into static $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ background charges, we map out the dynamical phase diagram of a $1+1D$ $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter. We uncover three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase, (ii) a fragmented phase that is nonthermal but delocalized, and (iii) a disorder-free many-body localized regime. In the latter, a superposition of superselection sectors retains spatial matter inhomogeneities in time, as confirmed by distinctive temporal scalings of entropy. We highlight the non-Abelian nature of these phases and argue for potential realizations on qudit processors.

Title: Dissipation meets conformal interface: How the relaxation rate is suppressed
Authors: Ruhanshi Barad, Qicheng Tang, Xueda Wen
Abstract: Conformal interfaces play an important role in quantum critical systems. In closed systems, the transmission properties of conformal interfaces are typically characterized by two quantities: One is the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}$, which measures the amount of quantum entanglement through the interface, and the other is the transmission coefficient $c_{\text{LR}}$, which measures the energy transmission through the interface. In the present work, to characterize the transmission property of conformal interfaces in open quantum systems, we propose a third quantity $c_{\text{relax}}$, which is defined through the ratio of Liouvillian gaps with and without an interface. Physically, $c_{\text{relax}}$ measures the suppression of the relaxation rate towards a steady state when the system is subject to a local dissipation. We perform both analytical perturbation calculations and exact numerical calculations based on a free fermion chain at the critical point. It is found that $c_{\text{relax}}$ decreases monotonically with the strength of the interface. In particular, $0\le c_{\text{relax}}\le c_{\text{LR}}\le c_{\text{eff}}$, where the equalities hold if and only if the interface is totally reflective or totally transmissive. Our result for $c_{\text{relax}}$ is universal in the sense that $c_{\text{relax}}$ is independent of (i) the dissipation strength in the weak dissipation regime and (ii) the location where the local dissipation is introduced. Comparing to the previously known $c_{\text{LR}}$ and $c_{\text{eff}}$ in a closed system, our $c_{\text{relax}}$ shows a distinct behavior as a function of the interface strength, suggesting its novelty to characterize conformal interfaces in open systems and offering insights into critical systems under dissipation.

Title: Nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory: a generalised dividing-surface approach
Authors: Rhiannon A. Zarotiadis, Joseph E. Lawrence, Jeremy O. Richardson
Abstract: Constructing an accurate approximation to nonadiabatic rate theory which is valid for arbitrary values of the electronic coupling has been a long-standing challenge in theoretical chemistry. Ring-polymer instanton theories offer a very promising approach to solve this problem, since they can be rigorously derived using semiclassical approximations and can capture nuclear quantum effects such as tunnelling and zero-point energy at a cost similar to that of a classical calculation. A successful instanton rate theory already exists within the Born--Oppenheimer approximation, for which the optimal tunnelling pathway is located on a single adiabatic surface. A related instanton theory has also been developed for nonadiabatic reactions using two weakly-coupled diabatic surfaces within the framework of Fermi's golden rule. However, many chemical reactions do not satisfy the conditions of either limit. By employing a tunable dividing surface which measures the flux both along nuclear coordinates as well as between electronic states, we develop a generalised nonadiabatic instanton rate theory that bridges between these two limits. The resulting theory approximates the quantum-mechanically exact rates well for the systems studied and, in addition, offers a novel mechanistic perspective on nonadiabatic reactions.

Title: Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics
Authors: Masaya Kunimi, Yusuke Kato, Hosho Katsura
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.

Title: Giant Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Graphene/$h$-BN Based van der Waals Magnetic Tunnel Junctions via 3$d$ Transition Metal Intercalation
Authors: Zhi Yan, Jianhua Xiao, Xujin Zhang, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: Atomic intercalation offers a powerful route for engineering two-dimensional (2D) materials by precisely tuning interlayer electronic coupling and spin configurations. Here, we propose a generic strategy for the construction of fully 2D magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on transition metal-intercalated graphene electrodes with $h$-BN barrier layer. First-principles calculations reveal that intercalation not only stabilizes uniform atomic dispersion via steric hindrance but also induces robust ferromagnetism in graphene. Manganese- and vanadium-intercalated systems (Mn-Gr and V-Gr) exhibit exceptional spintronic performance, with tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) showing a pronounced odd-even oscillation as a function of barrier thickness. A giant TMR of $4.35 \times 10^8\,\%$ is achieved in the Mn-Gr system with a monolayer barrier $h$ -BN ($n=1$), while V-Gr reaches a maximum TMR of $1.86 \times 10^5\,\%$ for a trilayer barrier ($n=3$). Moreover, biaxial strain further enhances the TMR to $10^9\,\%$ and $10^7\,\%$ in Mn-Gr and V-Gr systems, respectively. The devices also exhibit perfect spin filtering and pronounced negative differential resistance, offering new opportunities for high-performance spintronic and memory applications based on 2D van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: The spatial correlation of radiation-induced errors in superconducting devices decays over a millimeter
Authors: Francesco Valenti, Anil Murani, Patrick Paluch, Robert Gartmann, Lukas Scheller, Richard Gebauer, Robert Kruk, Thomas Reisinger, Luis Ardila-Perez, Ioan M. Pop
Abstract: We perform nanosecond-resolution multiplexed readout on six same-chip superconducting microwave resonators. This allows us to pinpoint the impact positions of ionizing radiation on the chip by measuring the differential time of flight of the generated phonons, inducing correlated errors in the device, thereby implementing an on-chip seismic array. We correlate the phase response of each resonator - a proxy for the absorbed energy - to the distance from the impact point to uncover a millimetric decay length for the phonon-mediated radiation poisoning.

Title: Steady-state heat engines driven by finite reservoirs
Authors: Iago N. Mamede, Saulo V. Moreira, Mark T. Mitchison, Carlos E. Fiore
Abstract: We provide a consistent thermodynamic analysis of stochastic thermal engines driven by finite-size reservoirs, which are in turn coupled to infinite-size reservoirs. We consider a cyclic operation mode, where the working medium couples sequentially to hot and cold reservoirs, and a continuous mode with both reservoirs coupled simultaneously. We derive an effective temperature for the finite-size reservoirs determining the entropy production for two-state engines in the sequential coupling scenario, and show that finite-size reservoirs can meaningfully affect the power when compared to infinite-size reservoirs in both sequential and simultaneous coupling scenarios. We also investigate a three-state engine comprising two interacting units and optimize its performance in the presence of a finite reservoir. Notably, we show that the efficiency at maximum power can exceed the Curzon-Ahlborn bound with finite reservoirs. Our work introduces tools to optimize the performance of nanoscale engines under realistic conditions of finite reservoir heat capacity and imperfect thermal isolation.

Title: General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions
Authors: Yu-bo Shi, Roderich Moessner, Ricard Alert, Marin Bukov
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.

Title: Polaritonic Quantum Matter
Authors: D.N. Basov, A. Asenjo-Garcia, P.J. Schuck, X.-Y. Zhu, A. Rubio, A. Cavalleri, M. Delor, M.M. Fogler, Mengkun Liu
Abstract: Polaritons are quantum mechanical superpositions of photon states with elementary excitations in molecules and solids. The light-matter admixture causes a characteristic frequency-momentum dispersion shared by all polaritons irrespective of the microscopic nature of material excitations that could entail charge, spin, lattice or orbital effects. Polaritons retain the strong nonlinearities of their matter component and simultaneously inherit ray-like propagation of light. Polaritons prompt new properties, enable new opportunities for spectroscopy/imaging, empower quantum simulations and give rise to new forms of synthetic quantum matter. Here, we review the emergent effects rooted in polaritonic quasiparticles in a wide variety of their physical implementations. We present a broad portfolio of the physical platforms and phenomena of what we term polaritonic quantum matter. We discuss the unifying aspects of polaritons across different platforms and physical implementations and focus on recent developments in: polaritonic imaging, cavity electrodynamics and cavity materials engineering, topology and nonlinearities, as well as quantum polaritonics.

Title: Reduced Basis Method for Driven-Dissipative Quantum Systems
Authors: Hans Christiansen, Virgil V. Baran, Jens Paaske
Abstract: Reduced basis methods provide an efficient way of mapping out phase diagrams of strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. The method relies on using the exact solutions at select parameter values to construct a low-dimensional basis, from which observables can be efficiently and reliably computed throughout the parameter space. Here we show that this method can be generalized to driven-dissipative Markovian systems allowing efficient calculations of observables in the transient and steady states. A subsequent distillation of the reduced basis vectors according to their explained variances allows for an unbiased exploration of the most pronounced parameter dependencies indicative of phase boundaries in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Geometric measures of CHSH quantum nonlocality: characterization, quantification, and comparison by distances and operations
Authors: Gennaro Zanfardino, Wojciech Roga, Masahiro Takeoka, Fabrizio Illuminati
Abstract: We introduce a geometric framework for the study of Bell nonlocality in Hilbert space, aiming to provide intrinsic measures based solely on the properties of quantum states for a given Bell inequality. Recognizing that nonlocality is inherently measurement-dependent, our approach focuses on fixing a specific Bell scenario -- that is, a chosen number of measurements and outcomes per party, along with a specific Bell inequality -- and, for each quantum state, maximizing the violation over all possible measurement choices within the given scenario. We then characterize the geometry of the corresponding set of local states, defined as those states for which no violation occurs for any choice of the measurements. Within this framework, we define geometric measures of nonlocality based on the distance of a given quantum state from the set of local states, using quantities such as the trace distance, the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, and the relative entropy. We first establish the general formalism, emphasizing the challenges posed by the NP-hardness of characterizing local sets for arbitrary Bell scenarios. We then specialize to the case of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality in two-qubit systems, where the local set is fully characterized and an explicit geometric analysis is possible. In this setting, we derive geometric measures of nonlocality for Bell-diagonal and Werner states, showing that the local state closest to a Werner state is a Werner state, and analogously for Bell-diagonal states. For each quantum state, our results offer a metric-based characterization of Bell nonlocality that is independent of specific experimental implementations and naturally extend to different Bell scenarios whenever the corresponding set of local states is accessible.

Title: Ancilla-Assisted Process Tomography with Bipartiete Mixed Separable States
Authors: Zhuoran Bao, Daniel F. V. James
Abstract: It has been shown that the entanglement between the system and ancillary states is not a strict requirement for performing ancilla-assisted process tomography(AAPT). Instead, from a theoretical point of view, it only requires that the system-ancilla state be faithful, which, in the qubit case, is the invertibility of a certain matrix representing the state. Our paper takes on the operational definition of faithfulness, i.e., a state is faithful if one can extract complete information about the quantum process, and we restrict the process to single-qubit operations on a two-qubit system-ancilla state. We present a theoretical analysis that connects the invertibility problem to the concept of Sinisterness, which quantifies the correlation between two qubits and can be generalized to bipartite systems formed by qubits for a certain class of states. Using Sinisterness, we derive a way of constructing two-qubit states that are guaranteed to be faithful and estimate the bound on the average error of the process featured by the condition number. Our analysis agrees that the maximally entangled states provided the smallest error amplification. Nevertheless, it maps out a numerical region where the advantage of the entanglement starts.

Title: Theory of quantum error mitigation for non-Clifford gates
Authors: David Layden, Bradley Mitchell, Karthik Siva
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation techniques mimic noiseless quantum circuits by running several related noisy circuits and combining their outputs in particular ways. How well such techniques work is thought to depend strongly on how noisy the underlying gates are. Weakly-entangling gates, like $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ for small angles $\theta$, can be much less noisy than entangling Clifford gates, like CNOT and CZ, and they arise naturally in circuits used to simulate quantum dynamics. However, such weakly-entangling gates are non-Clifford, and are therefore incompatible with two of the most prominent error mitigation techniques to date: probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and the related form of zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). This paper generalizes these techniques to non-Clifford gates, and comprises two complementary parts. The first part shows how to effectively transform any given quantum channel into (almost) any desired channel, at the cost of a sampling overhead, by adding random Pauli gates and processing the measurement outcomes. This enables us to cancel or properly amplify noise in non-Clifford gates, provided we can first characterize such gates in detail. The second part therefore introduces techniques to do so for noisy $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates. These techniques are robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and exhibit concentration and sensitivity--crucial statistical properties for many experiments. They are related to randomized benchmarking, and may also be of interest beyond the context of error mitigation. We find that while non-Clifford gates can be less noisy than related Cliffords, their noise is fundamentally more complex, which can lead to surprising and sometimes unwanted effects in error mitigation. Whether this trade-off can be broadly advantageous remains to be seen.

Title: Average Rényi Entanglement Entropy in Gaussian Boson Sampling
Authors: Jason Youm, Joseph T. Iosue, Adam Ehrenberg, Yu-Xin Wang, Alexey V. Gorshkov
Abstract: Recently, many experiments have been conducted with the goal of demonstrating a quantum advantage over classical computation. One popular framework for these experiments is Gaussian Boson Sampling, where quadratic photonic input states are interfered via a linear optical unitary and subsequently measured in the Fock basis. In this work, we study the modal entanglement of the output states in this framework just before the measurement stage. Specifically, we compute Page curves as measured by various Rényi-$\alpha$ entropies, where the Page curve describes the entanglement between two partitioned groups of output modes averaged over all linear optical unitaries. We derive these formulas for $\alpha = 1$ (i.e. the von Neumann entropy), and, more generally, for all positive integer $\alpha$, in the asymptotic limit of infinite number of modes and for input states that are composed of single-mode-squeezed-vacuum state with equal squeezing strength. We then analyze the limiting behaviors when the squeezing is small and large. Having determined the averages, we then explicitly calculate the Rényi-$\alpha$ variance for integers $\alpha > 1$, and we are able to show that these entropies are weakly typical.

Title: Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Computing
Authors: Martin Larocca, Supanut Thanasilp, Samson Wang, Kunal Sharma, Jacob Biamonte, Patrick J. Coles, Lukasz Cincio, Jarrod R. McClean, Zoë Holmes, M. Cerezo
Abstract: Variational quantum computing offers a flexible computational paradigm with applications in diverse areas. However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification in Multiple Color Spaces
Authors: Kwok-Ho Ng, Tingting Song, Zhiquan Liu
Abstract: The growing complexity and scale of image processing tasks challenge classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with high computational costs. Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks (HQCNNs) show potential to improve performance by accelerating processing speed, enhancing classification accuracy, and reducing model parameters, though studies have primarily focused on the RGB color space. However, the effectiveness of HQCNNs in non-RGB color spaces, such as Lab, YCrCb, and HSV, remains largely unexplored. We propose an HQCNN to evaluate image classification across diverse color spaces. The HQCNN integrates parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with a classical CNN, leveraging quantum entanglement and trainable gates to enhance expressiveness across varied color representations. We assess performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, EuroSAT, and SAT-4 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the HQCNN outperforms the classical CNN across all tested color spaces for the ten-class MNIST task, achieving a best accuracy of $94.3\%$ in Lab compared to $92.8\%$ in RGB for the CNN, with superior performance on other datasets in various color spaces. These findings highlight the potential of non-RGB color spaces and optimized PQC designs to improve classification performance. We provide new insights for advancing hybrid quantum-classical computer vision through optimized PQC architectures and diverse color space applications.

Title: Ergodiscord: An Operational and Distinct Notion of Quantumness of Correlations
Authors: Mir Alimuddin, Snehasish Roy Chowdhury, Ram Krishna Patra, Subhendu B. Ghosh, Tommaso Tufarelli, Gerardo Adesso, Manik Banik
Abstract: Nonclassicality in composite quantum systems depicts several puzzling manifestations, with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement, Schrödinger steering, and Bell nonlocality being the most celebrated ones. In addition to those, an unentangled quantum state can also exhibit nonclassicality, as evidenced from notions such as quantum discord and work deficit. In this work, we present a general framework for exploring quantumness of correlations in multipartite quantum states. By exploiting the different signatures reflected on observable quantities depending on whether subsystems of a composite systems are probed jointly or independently, we introduce an operational quantifier of nonclassicality, termed {\em ergodiscord}. As we show, this newly proposed quantifier faithfully captures nonclassicality in any bipartite quantum state, while being fundamentally distinct from the original quantum discord. Moreover, ergodiscord uncovers an intriguing phenomenon called `nonlocal energy locking', where a useful form of energy (i.e. work) gets locked in correlations of nonclassical states. We also show that a mixed nonclassical state can lock more work than the maximally entangled state of the corresponding system, establishing an interesting super-additivity phenomenon of nonlocal energy locking. The present work may inspire novel designs of quantum energy storage devices by utilizing nonclassical correlations in composite quantum systems.

Title: Stable infinite-temperature eigenstates in SU(2)-symmetric nonintegrable models
Authors: Christopher J. Turner, Marcin Szyniszewski, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Ronald Melendrez, Hitesh J. Changlani, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Nonintegrable many-body quantum systems typically thermalize at long times through the mechanism of quantum chaos. However, some exceptional systems, such as those harboring quantum scars, break thermalization, serving as testbeds for foundational problems of quantum statistical physics. Here, we investigate a class of nonintegrable bond-staggered models that is endowed with a large number of zero-energy eigenstates and possesses a non-Abelian internal symmetry. We use character theory to give a lower bound on the zero-energy degeneracy, which matches exact diagonalization results, and is found to grow exponentially with the system size. We also show that few-magnon zero-energy states have an exact analytical description, allowing us to build a basis of low-entangled fixed-separation states, which is stable to most perturbations found in experiments. This remarkable dynamical stability of special states elucidates our understanding of nonequilibrium processes in non-Abelian chaotic quantum models.

Title: Quantum decoherence from complex saddle points
Authors: Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe
Abstract: Quantum decoherence is the effect that bridges quantum physics to well-understood classical physics. As such, it plays a crucial role in understanding the mysterious nature of quantum physics. Quantum decoherence is also a source of quantum noise that has to be well under control in quantum computing and in various experiments based on quantum technologies. Here we point out that quantum decoherence can be captured by $\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the Feynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured by instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in the Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of quantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment, such as the temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how to extend our approach to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a recently developed method to overcome the sign problem.

Title: Recovering optimal precision in quantum sensing with time domain imperfections
Authors: Zi-Shen Li, Xinyue Long, Xiaodong Yang, Dawei Lu, Yuxiang Yang
Abstract: Quantum control plays a crucial role in enhancing precision scaling for quantum sensing. However, most existing protocols require perfect control, even though real-world devices inevitably have control imperfections. Here, we consider a fundamental setting of quantum sensing with time domain imperfections, where the duration of control pulses and the interrogation time are all subject to uncertainty. Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg limit up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Our finding confirms that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.

Title: Efficient computation of topological order
Authors: Louis Fraatz, Amit Jamadagni, Hendrik Weimer
Abstract: We analyze the computational aspects of detecting topological order in a quantum many-body system. We contrast the widely used topological entanglement entropy with a recently introduced operational definition for topological order based on error correction properties, finding exponential scaling with the system size for the former and polynomial scaling for the latter. We exemplify our approach for a variant of the paradigmatic toric code model with mobile particles, finding that the error correction method allows to treat substantially larger system sizes. In particular, the phase diagram of the model can be successfully computed using error correction, while the topological entanglement entropy is too severely limited by finite size effects to obtain conclusive results. While we mainly focus on one-dimensional systems whose ground states can be expressed in terms of matrix product states, our strategy can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and systems out of equilibrium, even allowing for an efficient detection of topological order in current quantum simulation experiments.

Title: Stochastic resetting in discrete-time quantum dynamics: steady states and correlations in few-qubit systems
Authors: Sascha Wald, Louie Hong Yao, Thierry Platini, Chris Hooley, Federico Carollo
Abstract: Time evolution in several classes of quantum devices is generated through the application of quantum gates. Resetting is a critical technological feature in these systems allowing for mid-circuit measurement and complete or partial qubit reset. The possibility of realizing discrete-time reset dynamics on quantum computers makes it important to investigate the steady-state properties of such dynamics. Here, we explore the behavior of generic discrete-time unitary dynamics interspersed by random reset events. For Poissonian resets, we compute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a weak-reset limit, the existence of "resonances" in the quantum gates, allowing for the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a genuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations even beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset processes and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show that, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the system does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences between continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be useful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.

Title: Deterministic two-photon C-Z gate with the two-photon quantum Rabi model
Authors: Jia-Cheng Tang, Jin Zhao, Haitao Yang, Junlong Tian, Pinghua Tang, Shuai-Peng Wang, Lucas Lamata, Jie Peng
Abstract: We propose a scheme for realizing a deterministic two-photon C-Z gate based on variants of the two-photon quantum Rabi model (QRM), which is feasible within the framework of circuit QED. We begin by utilizing the two-photon interaction to implement the nonlinear sign (NS) gate, and subsequently, we construct the C-Z gate following the KLM scheme. We consider three different regimes: the strong coupling regime, the perturbative ultrastrong coupling regime, and the large detuning regime. Our results indicate that the C-Z gate operates fast with high fidelity, and is robust against decoherence. We also show the photonic state in the waveguide can be input into the circuit QED system through a variable coupler, and released after interaction with almost the same waveform except for a $\pi$-phase shift. Our scheme offers a suitable approach for achieving fast and deterministic two-photon quantum gates via light-matter interactions.

Title: Provable DI-QRNG protocols based on self-testing methodologies in preparation and measure scenario
Authors: Asmita Samanta, Arpita Maitra, Goutam Paul
Abstract: We present two Device Independent Quantum Random Number Generator (DI-QRNG) protocols using two self-testing methodologies in Preparation \& Measure (P\&M) scenario. These two methodologies are the variants of two well-known non-local games, namely, CHSH and pseudo-telepathy games, in P\&M framework. We exploit them as distinguishers in black-box settings to differentiate the classical and the quantum paradigms and hence to certify the Device Independence. The first self-test was proposed by Tavakoli et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 2018). We show that this is actually a P\&M variant of the CHSH game. Then based on this self-test, we design our first DI-QRNG protocol. We also propose a new self-testing methodology, which is the first of its kind that is reducible from pseudo-telepathy game in P\&M framework. Based on this new self-test, we design our second DI-QRNG protocol.

Title: Exploring dynamical quantum phase transition from pure states to mixed states through extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models
Authors: Kaiyuan Cao, Tianren Zhang, Xiangping Jiang, Jian Wang
Abstract: We investigate dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the framework of the generalized SSH model, specifically analyzing the SSH-3 and SSH-4 models, which exhibit different symmetries. We find that the SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states associated with its topological properties. Our results show that DQPTs for pure states occur following a quench that crosses the topological transition, even with an open energy band gap. For mixed states, DQPT behavior is consistent at low temperatures, but significant changes are observed at high temperatures, resulting in the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, allows for the analysis of two distinct energy spectrum configurations. We conclude that the occurrence of DQPTs for pure states in the SSH-4 model necessitates a quench from an initial state without a band gap while crossing the critical point of the topological transition, whereas DQPTs are absent for mixed states at elevated temperatures.

Title: Exponential Improvement on Asian Option Pricing Through Quantum Preconditioning Methods
Authors: Gumaro Rendon, Rutuja Kshirsagar, Quoc Hoan Tran
Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum algorithm designed to solve the differential equation used in the pricing of Asian options, in the framework of the Black-Scholes model. Our approach modifies an existing quantum pre-conditioning method (different from classical methods) for the problem of Asian option pricing such that we remove the dependence on the original condition number of discretized differential equation (system of linear equations). This was possible with new fast-forwardable discretizations of the first and second derivatives with respect to the underlying asset value ratio (value over average). We determine that these discretizations handle well kinks in the initial/terminal conditions. We also introduce a new circuit construction for the discretized time-derivative operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions which avoids the oracle workspace needed for the general sparse matrix implementation. Here, we also devised a new method probability integral estimation from which we extract the solution, achieving $\tilde{O}({\rm polylog}\left(1/\epsilon)\right)$, which is an exponential improvement over other quantum methods when it comes to solution information extraction from the solution state.

Title: Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field
Authors: E. Medina-Guerra, I. V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.

Title: Deterministic generation of multi-qubit entangled states among distant parties using indefinite causal order
Authors: Wen-Qiang Liu, Hai-Rui Wei
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays an irreplaceable role in various remote quantum information processing tasks. Here we present protocols for generating deterministic and heralded $N$-qubit entangled states across multiple network nodes. By utilizing a pre-shared maximally entangled state and single-qubit operations within an indefinite causal order framework, the multi-qubit entangled state between distant parties can be generated deterministically. The complex entangled state measurements and multiple pre-shared entangled states, are essential in conventional entanglement swapping technique, but are not required in our approach. This greatly reduces the complexity of the quantum circuit and makes it more experimentally feasible. Furthermore, we develop optical architectures to implement these protocols by encoding qubits in polarization degree of freedom. The results indicate that our protocols significantly improve the efficiency of long-distance entanglement generation and provide a practical framework for establishing large-scale quantum networks.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, tensor networks serve as an important tool due to their multifaceted utility. In this paper, we review the diverse applications of tensor networks and show that they are an important instrument for quantum computing. Specifically, we summarize the application of tensor networks in various domains of quantum computing, including simulation of quantum computation, quantum circuit synthesis, quantum error correction and mitigation, and quantum machine learning. Finally, we provide an outlook on the opportunities and the challenges of the tensor-network techniques.

Title: Quantum geometry and adiabaticity in molecules and in condensed matter
Authors: Raffaele Resta
Abstract: The adiabatic theorem states that when the time evolution of the Hamiltonian is "infinitely slow", a system, when started in the ground state, remains in the instantaneous ground state at all times. This, however, does not mean that the adiabatic evolution of a generic observable obtains simply as its expectation value over the instantaneous eigenstate. As a general principle there is an additional adiabatic term, of quantum-geometrical nature, which is the relevant one for several static or adiabatic observables. This is shown explicitly for the cases of polarizability and infrared tensors (in molecules and condensed matter); rotational g factor and magnetizability (in molecules only). Quantum geometry allows for a transparent derivation and a compact expression for these observables, alternative to the well known sum-over-states Kubo formulas.

Title: Exhaustive Search for Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX Calculus
Authors: Tobias Fischbach, Pierre Talbot, Pascal Bouvry
Abstract: Quantum computers allow a near-exponential speed-up for specific applications when compared to classical computers. Despite recent advances in the hardware of quantum computers, their practical usage is still severely limited due to a restricted number of available physical qubits and quantum gates, short coherence time, and high error rates. This paper lays the foundation towards a metric independent approach to quantum circuit optimization based on exhaustive search algorithms. This work uses depth-first search and iterative deepening depth-first search. We rely on ZX calculus to represent and optimize quantum circuits through the minimization of a given metric (e.g. the T-gate and edge count). ZX calculus formally guarantees that the semantics of the original circuit is preserved. As ZX calculus is a non-terminating rewriting system, we utilise a novel set of pruning rules to ensure termination while still obtaining high-quality solutions. We provide the first formalization of quantum circuit optimization using ZX calculus and exhaustive search. We extensively benchmark our approach on 100 standard quantum circuits. Finally, our implementation is integrated in the well-known libraries PyZX and Qiskit as a compiler pass to ensure applicability of our results.

Title: A Minimal Introduction to Quantum Computing
Authors: M M Hassan Mahmud, Daniel Goldsmith
Abstract: In this article, we present an introduction to quantum computing (QC) tailored for computing professionals such as programmers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists. Our approach abstracts away the physics underlying QC, which can be challenging to grasp, and frames it as a model of computation similar to, for instance, Turing machines. This helps readers grasp the fundamental principles of QC from a purely logical perspective. We begin by defining quantum states and qubits, establishing their mathematical representation and role in computation. We introduce fundamental concepts such as basis states, quantum gates, and tensor products, illustrating how these form the building blocks of quantum computation. Then we present the Deutsch-Josza algorithm, one of the simplest quantum algorithms that demonstrate how quantum computers can outperform classical computers. Finally, we provide guidance for further study, recommending resources for those interested in exploring quantum algorithms, implementations, and industry applications.

Title: Excitation transfer and many-body dark states in WQED
Authors: Wei Chen, Guin-Dar Lin, H. H. Jen
Abstract: In one-dimensional waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, quantum emitters interact through infinite-range, dispersive, and dissipative dipole-dipole interactions mediated by guided photonic modes. These interactions give rise to long-range periodic behavior and rich many-body physics absent in free space. In this work, we construct a set of symmetrized multi-excitation dark states and derive analytic expressions for their time-evolution projections. This framework captures the essential dynamics of excitation transport and storage while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to full quantum simulations. Our analysis reveals a fundamental bound on energy redistribution governed by the structure of dark states and collective dissipation, and discovers that optimal excitation transfer between emitter ensembles converges toward an initial pumped fraction of $N_\text{p}/N \approx 0.55$ for large system sizes. We further examine the robustness of this mechanism under realistic imperfections, including positional disorder, nonradiative decay, and dephasing. These results highlight the role of many-body dark states in enabling efficient and controllable energy transfer, offering new insights into dissipative many-body dynamics in integrated quantum platforms.

Title: A Quantum of Learning: Using Quaternion Algebra to Model Learning on Quantum Devices
Authors: Sayed Pouria Talebi, Clive Cheong Took, Danilo P. Mandic
Abstract: This article considers the problem of designing adaption and optimisation techniques for training quantum learning machines. To this end, the division algebra of quaternions is used to derive an effective model for representing computation and measurement operations on qubits. In turn, the derived model, serves as the foundation for formulating an adaptive learning problem on principal quantum learning units, thereby establishing quantum information processing units akin to that of neurons in classical approaches. Then, leveraging the modern HR-calculus, a comprehensive training framework for learning on quantum machines is developed. The quaternion-valued model accommodates mathematical tractability and establishment of performance criteria, such as convergence conditions.

Title: Quantum precursors to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem in Floquet spin-$J$ systems
Authors: Jesús A. Segura-Landa, Meenu Kumari, Daniel J. Nader, Sercan Hüsnügil, Ali SaraerToosi, Sergio Lerma-Hernández
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem proves that the resonant tori of classical integrable Hamiltonians are broken when a non-integrable perturbation is introduced, whereas non-resonant tori only get deformed for up to a finite value of the perturbative parameter. In this letter, we identify quantum precursors to the KAM theorem in one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians periodically perturbed by instantaneous kicks. After recognizing quantum signatures of resonances in the Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we reveal a differentiated sensitivity to the perturbation of the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, depending on whether the states satisfy a resonant condition or not. It is also shown that this differentiated sensitivity becomes more pronounced as the system size increases, leading to the KAM theorem in the classical limit $J\rightarrow\infty$. Numerical and analytical results obtained from unitary perturbation theory strongly support these findings. Although specific to kicked models, our results can be easily extended to more general scenarios, allowing the identification of the quantum mechanism that corresponds to the KAM theorem in the classical limit.

Title: Learning functions of Hamiltonians with Hamiltonian Fourier features
Authors: Yuto Morohoshi, Akimoto Nakayama, Hidetaka Manabe, Kosuke Mitarai
Abstract: We propose a quantum machine learning task that is provably easy for quantum computers and arguably hard for classical ones. The task involves predicting quantities of the form $\mathrm{Tr}[f(H)\rho]$, where $f$ is an unknown function, given descriptions of $H$ and $\rho$. Using a Fourier-based feature map of Hamiltonians and linear regression, we theoretically establish the learnability of the task and implement it on a superconducting device using up to 40 qubits. This work provides a machine learning task with practical relevance, provable quantum easiness, and near-term feasibility.

Title: Multipartite continuous-variable quantum nondemolition interaction and entanglement certification and monitoring
Authors: Vinícius V. Seco, Alencar J. de Faria
Abstract: The quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement is one of the most studied quantum measurement procedures. Usually, such process involves the coupling of a single system of interest, called signal, with a single probe system, so that the relevant information in the signal system is indirectly measured by observing the probe system. Here, we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings among the signal and probe modes with ancillary modes prepared off-line in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed by homodyne detections and feedforward modulations. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for post-modulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.

Title: Harmonizing de Broglie-Bohm's Causal Interpretation with the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics
Authors: A. N. Khondker
Abstract: The non-relativistic quantum theory has been interpreted causally by de Broglie, David Bohm, and others, where a quantum entity is viewed as a particle with a definite position and momentum. This interpretation opposes the Copenhagen orthodox interpretation, which expresses uncertainty through the commutator relationship between position and momentum operators. This is further exacerbated by the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which uses no operators corresponding to these observables. We reconcile these opposing viewpoints by introducing mathematical nonlinear operators for the momentum observable. While nonlinear non-Hermitian operators cannot be easily used as matrices in the Hilbert space, we show that they are implicitly embedded in de Broglie-Bohm's interpretation of quantum theory.

Title: Field energy and angular momentum in spontaneous emission: A Schrödinger-picture approach
Authors: P. R. Berman (1), A. Kuzmich (1), P. W Milonni (2) ((1) University of Michigan, (2) University of Rochester)
Abstract: A Schrödinger-picture approach is used to calculate the field energy and angular momentum radiated by an atom undergoing spontaneous emission. The calculation is carried out using both the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). It is shown that a consistent application of the WWA leads to expressions for both the energy and angular momentum in the field that are finite for all times, in contrast to the results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Moreover, it is shown that the total angular momentum in the field is a sum of its spin and orbital components, again in contrast to the analogous results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Analytic expressions for the energy, spin angular momentum, and orbital angular momentum in the field are obtained for an atom undergoing spontaneous emission from a state having angular momentum H to a state having angular momentum G via an electric dipole transition. It is shown that the spin and orbital angular momenta in the field are equal, independent of the values of H and G. With a slight modification of the WWA, it can also be shown that the energy density in the field, the Poynting vector of the field, and the angular momentum flux of the field do not diverge at the origin.

Title: Long-Range Interacting Many-Body Systems in the Irrep Basis
Authors: Ivy Pannier-Günther, Andrew Kolmer Forbes, Pablo M. Poggi, Ivan H. Deutsch
Abstract: Spin models featuring infinite-range, homogeneous all-to-all interactions can be efficiently described due to the existence of a symmetry-restricted Hilbert subspace and an underlying classical phase space structure. However, when the permutation invariance of the system is weakly broken, such as by long- but finite-range interactions, these tools become mathematically invalid. Here we propose to approximately describe these scenarios by considering additional many-body subspaces according to the hierarchy of their coupling to the symmetric subspace, defined by leveraging the structure of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $SU(2)$. We put forward a procedure, dubbed ``irrep distillation," which defines these additional subspaces to minimize their dimension at each order of approximation. We discuss the validity of our method in connection with the occurrence of quantum many-body scars, benchmark its utility by analyzing the dynamical and equilibrium phase transitions, outline its phenomenology, and compare its use-cases against other approximations of long-range many-body systems.

Title: Magnetic-field dependent VB- spin decoherence in hexagonal boron nitrides: A first-principles study
Authors: Jaewook Lee, Hyeonsu Kim, Huijin Park, Hosung Seo
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN operates as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. To further advance the spin into a versatile qubit platform, it is imperative to understand its spin decoherence precisely, which is currently one of the major limiting factors for the VB- spin. In this study, we employ a first-principles quantum many-body simulation to investigate the decoherence of the VB- spin in dense nuclear spin baths as a function of magnetic field from 100 G to 3 T, revealing several unique phenomena and their origin. We found that decoherence mechanism changes at a specific magnetic field, which we refer to as the transition boundary (TB). Below the TB, the decoherence occurs within submicrosecond and it is primarily governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics. Above the TB, pair-wise flip-flop transitions become the dominant decoherence source, leading to the decoherence time of tens of microseconds. Building upon this understanding, we developed a method to predict the TB depending on the isotopic composition of h-BN, leading to TBs at 5020 G for h-10B14N and 2050 G for h-11B14N, which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. We show that the larger TB in h-10BN derives from the larger nuclear spin of 10B than that of 11B, giving rise to strong nuclear modulation effects over a wider range of magnetic field in 10BN than in 11BN. We also explain the microscopic origin of several unique features in the decoherence, such as magnetic-field insensitive fast modulation found below the TB. Our results provide essential insight on the role of the 100% dense nuclear spin environment with large nuclear spins in the VB- decoherence, opening a new avenue for advancing the spin qubit in h-BN as robust platform in quantum information science.

Title: A Multi-Scale Quantum Framework for Evaluating Metal-Organic Frameworks in Carbon Capture
Authors: Tom W. A. Montgomery, Adrian Varela-Alvarez, Sam Genway, Philip Llewellyn, Phalgun Lolur
Abstract: Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials to help mitigate the effects of global warming by selectively absorbing $\text{CO}_{2}$ for direct capture. Accurate quantum chemistry simulations are a useful tool to help select and design optimal MOF structures, replacing costly or impractical experiments or providing chemically inspired features for data-driven approaches such as machine learning. However, applying simulations over large datasets requires efficient simulation methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) which, despite often being accurate, introduces uncontrolled approximations and a lack of systematic improvability. In this work we outline a hierarchical cluster model that includes a recently developed quantum embedding that provides a more systematic approach to efficiently tune accuracy. We apply this workflow to calculate the binding affinity for a small set of MOF structures and $\text{CO}_{2}$ using experimentally measured heat of adsorption as a reference. Since quantum embeddings have also been proposed as a framework to accelerate the utility of quantum hardware, we discuss some of the benefits and challenges of integrating quantum solvers into the workflow outlined in this work.

Title: Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations
Authors: Cedric Lim, Kirill Matirko, Hyeongjin Kim, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Michael O. Flynn
Abstract: We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.

Title: Probing de Sitter Space Using CFT States
Authors: Kazuki Doi, Naoki Ogawa, Kotaro Shinmyo, Yu-ki Suzuki, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states describing a putative holographic dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of a time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.

Title: The formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in silicon
Authors: Xinxin Cai, Habitamu Y. Walelign, John M. Nichol
Abstract: Silicon-based qubits are often made by trapping individual electrons in quantum dots defined by electric gates. Quantum information can then be stored using the spin states of the electrons. However, the nuclei of the surrounding atoms also have spin degrees of freedom that couple to the electron spin qubits and cause decoherence. The emergence of a nuclear-spin dark state has been predicted to reduce this coupling during dynamic nuclear polarization, when the electrons in the quantum dot drive the nuclei in the semiconductor into a decoupled state. Here, we report the formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in a gate-defined silicon double quantum dot. We show that, as expected, the transverse electron-nuclear coupling rapidly diminishes in the dark state, and that this state depends on the synchronized precession of the nuclear spins. Moreover, the dark state significantly reduces the relaxation rate between the singlet and triplet electronic spin states. This nuclear-spin dark state has potential applications as a quantum memory or in quantum sensing, and might enable increased polarization of nuclear spin ensembles.

Title: Torus bifurcation of a dissipative time crystal
Authors: Jayson G. Cosme, Phatthamon Kongkhambut, Anton Bölian, Richelle Jade L. Tuquero, Jim Skulte, Ludwig Mathey, Andreas Hemmerich, Hans Keßler
Abstract: Using a quantum gas setup consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity by a transverse pump laser, we experimentally observe an instability of a dissipative continuous time crystal (CTC) towards a time crystalline state exhibiting two prominent oscillation frequencies. Applying a mean-field approximation model and a Floquet analysis, we theoretically confirm that this transition is a manifestation in a many-body system of a torus bifurcation between a limit cycle (LC) and a limit torus (LT). We theoretically illustrate the LC and LT attractors using the minimal model and experimentally reconstruct them using Takens' embedding theorem applied to the non-destructively measured intracavity photon dynamics.

Title: Fundamental Limitations in Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization Methods
Authors: Peter Reinholdt, Karl Michael Ziems, Erik Rosendahl Kjellgren, Sonia Coriani, Stephan P. A. Sauer, Jacob Kongsted
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr{ö}dinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we perform numerical analysis to show that QSCI methods face critical limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality CI expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a significant drawback in QSCI methods when sampling from the ground-state distribution as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications, as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.

Title: Meson thermalization with a hot medium in the open Schwinger model
Authors: Takis Angelides, Yibin Guo, Karl Jansen, Stefan Kühn, Giuseppe Magnifico
Abstract: Quantum field theories treated as open quantum systems provide a crucial framework for studying realistic experimental scenarios, such as quarkonia traversing the quark-gluon plasma produced at the Large Hadron Collider. In such cases, capturing the complex thermalization process requires a detailed understanding of how particles evolve and interact with a hot medium. Considering the open lattice Schwinger model and using tensor network algorithms, we investigate the thermalization dynamics of mesonic particles in a hot medium, such as the Schwinger boson or the electric flux string. We simulate systems with up to 100 lattice sites, achieving accurate preservation of the electric field parity symmetry, demonstrating the algorithm's robustness and scalability. Our results reveal that the thermalization time increases with stronger dissipation from the environment, increasing environment temperature, higher background electric field and heavier fermion masses. Further, we study the quantum mutual information between the two halves of the flux string connecting a meson's constituent particles and analyze its relation to relevant dynamical observables.

Title: Unconventional excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials
Authors: L. Maisel Licerán, H. T. C. Stoof
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between $\SI{50}{\kelvin}$ and $\SI{75}{\kelvin}$ on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.

Title: Acceleration-induced radiation from a qudit particle detector model
Authors: Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura, Yuki Osawa, Yasusada Nambu
Abstract: We nonperturbatively examine the emission rate of acceleration-induced radiation from a uniformly accelerated gapless qudit-type Unruh-DeWitt detector. We find that the emission rate can be written as Larmor's formula multiplied by a factor that depends on the detector's initial state. In particular, certain initial states of integer-spin detectors do not produce radiation. Although the appearance of Larmor's formula may suggest a classical phenomenon, we argue that the resulting radiation is fundamentally distinct from that of structureless classical sources, as it evolves into a multimode coherent state correlated with the detector's internal degree of freedom. Thus, gapless detectors cannot be treated as structureless sources, as previously proposed.

Title: Superkick Effect in Vortex Particle Scattering
Authors: Shiyi Liu, Bei Liu, Igor P. Ivanov, Liangliang Ji
Abstract: Vortex states of photons or electrons are a novel and promising experimental tool across atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. Various experimental schemes to generate high-energy vortex particles have been proposed. However, diagnosing the characteristics of vortex states at high energies remains a significant challenge, as traditional low-energy detection schemes become impractical for high-energy vortex particles due to their extremely short de Broglie wavelength. We recently proposed a novel experimental detection scheme based on a mechanism called "superkick" that is free from many drawbacks of the traditional methods and can reveal the vortex phase characteristics. In this paper, we present a complete theoretical framework for calculating the superkick effect in elastic electron scattering and systematically investigate the impact of various factors on its visibility. In particular, we argue that the vortex phase can be identified either by detecting the two scattered electrons in coincidence or by analyzing the characteristic azimuthal asymmetry in individual final particles.

Title: Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$\textbf{$c$}$ CFT Ensemble
Authors: Ning Bao, Hao Geng, Yikun Jiang
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.

Title: Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich/complex-scaling regularization and rigged Hilbert space
Authors: Okuto Morikawa, Shoya Ogawa
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating the Zel'dovich regularization, the complex scaling method, and the rigged Hilbert space. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations à la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. Also, we find the most essential regulator of functional analyticity and construct a modified Hilbert space of the exact WKB framework for resonance, which is called the rigged Hilbert space. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems.
