Title: Extracting filtered signal statistics of continuously measured quantum systems
Authors: Anthony Kiely, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: The joint state of a continuously monitored quantum system and the classical filtered measurement record has recently been shown to be described by a quantum Fokker-Planck master equation. We present a numerically efficient approach to compute the steady state of the system and detector in the absence of feedback. We use this to extract detailed statistics of the filtered signal, including all moments, the full probability distribution, the mutual information, correlation functions, as well as the Fisher information for parameter estimation. Building on this, we demonstrate how perturbative corrections allow one to efficiently determine the steady state solution for weak feedback driving.

Title: Fibonacci Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics

Kunst (1 and 2), Federico Roccati (1 and 3) ((1) Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, (2) Department of Physics, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, (3) Dipartimento di Fisica e Chimica -- Emilio Segré, Universitá degli Studi di Palermo)
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.

Title: Trainability of Quantum Models Beyond Known Classical Simulability
Authors: Sabri Meyer, Francesco Scala, Francesco Tacchino, Aurelien Lucchi
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising candidates for near-term quantum computing, yet they face scalability challenges due to barren plateaus, where gradients vanish exponentially in the system size. Recent conjectures suggest that avoiding barren plateaus might inherently lead to classical simulability, thus limiting the opportunities for quantum advantage. In this work, we advance the theoretical understanding of the relationship between the trainability and computational complexity of VQAs, thus directly addressing the conjecture. We introduce the Linear Clifford Encoder (LCE), a novel technique that ensures constant-scaling gradient statistics on optimization landscape regions that are close to Clifford circuits. Additionally, we leverage classical Taylor surrogates to reveal computational complexity phase transitions from polynomial to super-polynomial as the initialization region size increases. Combining these results, we reveal a deeper link between trainability and computational complexity, and analytically prove that barren plateaus can be avoided in regions for which no classical surrogate is known to exist. Furthermore, numerical experiments on LCE transformed landscapes confirm in practice the existence of a super-polynomially complex ``transition zone'' where gradients decay polynomially. These findings indicate a plausible path to practically relevant, barren plateau-free variational models with potential for quantum advantage.

Title: Quantum sensing with ultracold simulators in lattice and ensemble systems: a review
Authors: Keshav Das Agarwal, Sayan Mondal, Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit, Aditi Sen De, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modelled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.

Title: Density matrix analysis of systems influenced by periodic Hamiltonians
Authors: Soham Sen, Manjari Dutta, Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: In this work, we consider simple systems that are influenced by Hamiltonians with time periodicity. Our analysis is mainly focussed on the density matrix approach and aims to solve the Liouville equation of motion from which one can extract the state of the system when the system is in a pure state. We start our analysis with the standard Rabi-oscillation problem. We consider a density matrix corresponding to the entire model system and solve the Liouville equation of motion. We have then made use of the Lewis-Reisenfeld invariant approach and arrive at the exact same result which implies that the density matrix of the system can indeed be identified with the Lewis invariant. Finally, we consider a two-level system with a constant magnetic field in the $z$-direction and a time dependent magnetic field in the $x$-direction. Finally, we solve the Liouville equation of motion for this system and calculate the various coherence measures and plot them to investigate the time dependence and reliability of different coherence measures.

Title: Experimental Ground-State Energy of a 125-Site Flat Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering on Quantum Computer
Authors: Muhammad Ahsan
Abstract: We present an instance of utility-grade quantum computation by calculating the ground-state energy of a 125-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), using IBM's Falcon and Hummingbird quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our best per-site ground-state energy estimate reaches -0.417J, and after applying open-boundary corrections, it closely approaches the established thermodynamic value of -0.438J. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach that splits the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. We further introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining physical accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices.

Title: Where Photons Have Been: Nowhere Without All Components of Their Wavefunctions
Authors: R. E. Kastner
Abstract: A nested interferometer experiment by Danan et al (2013) is discussed and some ontological implications explored, primarily in the context of time-symmetric interpretations of quantum theory. It is pointed out that photons are supported by all components of their wavefunctions, not selectively truncated "first order" portions of them, and that figures representing both a gap in the photon's path and signals from the cut-off path are incorrect. It is also noted that the Transactional Formulation (traditionally known as the Transactional Interpretation) readily accounts for the observed phenomena.

Title: Controlling quantum entanglement with classical non-separable light
Authors: R. F. Barros, A. L. S. Santos Junior, A. Z. Khoury, R. Fickler
Abstract: Here we investigate the quantum frequency conversion of entangled photons driven by a classically non-separable laser beam. We show that the frequency conversion dynamics is described by a quantum channel that stems from the classical drive field through the channel-state duality - the quantum channel is dual to the classical coherence matrix of the drive field. This implies that the evolution of entanglement in the conversion process is bound by the classical non-separability of the drive field, a result that we confirm experimentally. Furthermore, we show that the conversion dynamics can be understood as a swapping operation between classical non-separability and entanglement, unveiling a physical connection between two fundamentally different concepts.

Title: Tunable cavity coupling of a single SnV$^{-}$ center in nanodiamond across bad-emitter and bad-cavity regimes
Authors: Selene Sachero, Robert Berghaus, Elena Nieto Hernandez, Florian Feuchtmayr, Niklas Lettner, Patrick Maier, Sviatoslav Ditalia Tchernij, Alexander Kubanek
Abstract: Efficient coupling between quantum emitters and optical cavities is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. Group IV vacancy centers in diamond, particularly the negatively charged tin-vacancy center, have emerged as promising candidates due to their spectral stability, high Debye-Waller factor and large orbital splitting in ground-states. Here, we demonstrate controlled couplinag of a single negatively charged tin vacancy center hosted in a nanodiamond to a fully tunable Fabry-Perot microcavity. At cryogenic temperatures, we access the weak coupling regime and observe a transition from the bad-emitter to the bad-cavity regime as the optical transition of the color center narrows. At 4 K, a Purcell factor exceeding 1.7 is measured, confirming cavity-enhanced emission. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of SnV$^{-}$ centers in nanodiamonds as a coherent single-photon source for quantum networks.

Title: On the commutator scaling in Hamiltonian simulation with multi-product formulas
Authors: Kaoru Mizuta
Abstract: A multi-product formula (MPF) is a promising approach for Hamiltonian simulation efficiently both in the system size $N$ and the inverse allowable error $1/\varepsilon$ by combining Trotterization and the linear combination of unitaries (LCU). It achieves poly-logarithmic cost in $1/\varepsilon$ like LCU [G. H. Low, V. Kliuchnikov, N. Wiebe, arXiv:1907.11679 (2019)]. The efficiency in $N$ is expected to come from the commutator scaling in Trotterization, and this appears to be confirmed by the error bound of MPF expressed by nested commutators [J. Aftab, D. An, K. Trivisa, arXiv:2403.08922 (2024)]. However, we point out that the efficiency of MPF in the system size $N$ is not exactly resolved yet in that the present error bound expressed by nested commutators is incompatible with the size-efficient complexity reflecting the commutator scaling. The problem is that $q$-fold nested commutators with arbitrarily large $q$ are involved in their requirement and error bound. The benefit of commutator scaling by locality is absent, and the cost efficient in $N$ becomes prohibited in general. In this paper, we show an alternative commutator-scaling error of MPF and derive its size-efficient cost properly inheriting the advantage in Trotterization. The requirement and the error bound in our analysis, derived by techniques from the Floquet-Magnus expansion, have a certain truncation order in the nested commutators and can fully exploit the locality. We prove that Hamiltonian simulation by MPF certainly achieves the cost whose system-size dependence is as large as Trotterization while keeping the $\mathrm{polylog}(1/\varepsilon)$-scaling like the LCU. Our results will provide improved or accurate error and cost also for various algorithms using interpolation or extrapolation of Trotterization.

Title: Quantum Error Mitigation by Global Randomized Error Cancellation for Adiabatic Evolution in the Schwinger Model
Authors: Oleg Kaikov, Theo Saporiti, Vasily Sazonov, Mohamed Tamaazousti
Abstract: We extend the global randomized error cancellation (GREC) method for quantum error mitigation (QEM) in an application to adiabatic evolution of states on a noisy quantum device. We apply the adiabatic GREC method to the evolution of eigenstates in the lattice Schwinger model on a simulated quantum device with custom noise. Our results suggest that the corresponding QEM learned in one parameter regime of the model successfully transfers to a different parameter regime. In particular, our findings indicate that it transfers between different phases of the model. We observe that adiabatic GREC produces a smaller error than zero noise extrapolation (ZNE). Furthermore, in general, adiabatic GREC can be more cost-efficient in terms of the total number of gates used for the simulations. We comment on approaches to further reduce the necessary quantum computational resources. We also outline extensions of the introduced adiabatic GREC QEM method.

Title: Quantum algorithm for edge detection in digital grayscale images
Authors: Mohit Rohida, Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel quantum algorithm for edge detection in digital grayscale images, based on the sequency-ordered Walsh-Hadamard transform. The proposed method significantly improves upon existing quantum techniques for edge detection by using a quantum algorithm for the sequency-ordered Walsh-Hadamard transform, achieving a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(n)$ (where $n$ is the number of qubits). This represents a notable enhancement over the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which has a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$. Furthermore, our approach for edge detection has a computational cost (both gate complexity and quantum circuit depth) of $\mathcal{O}(\log_{2}(N_{1}N_{2}))$ for an image of size $N_{1}\times N_{2}$, offering a considerable improvement over the Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) algorithm, which incurs a cost of $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log_{2}(N_{1}N_{2})))$. By integrating a quantum high-pass filter with the sequency-ordered Walsh-Hadamard transform, the algorithm effectively extracts edge information from images. Computational examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm which provides a better performance in comparison to QHED.

Title: Optimized Circuit Cutting for QAOA Sampling Tasks
Authors: Friedrich Wagner, Christian Ufrecht, Martin Braun, Daniel D. Scherer
Abstract: Circuit cutting was originally designed to retrieve the expectation value of an observable with respect to a large quantum circuit by executing smaller circuit fragments. In this work, however, we demonstrate the application of circuit cutting to a pure sampling task. In particular, we sample solutions to an optimization problem from a trained QAOA circuit. Here, circuit cutting leads to a broadening and shift of the bitstring distribution towards suboptimal values compared to the uncut case. To reduce this effect, we minimize the number of required cuts via integer programming methods. On the other hand, cutting reduces the circuit size and thus the impact of noise. Our experiments on quantum hardware reveal that, for large circuits, the effect of noise reduction outweighs the derogative effects on the bitstring distribution. The study therefore provides evidence that circuit cutting combined with optimized cutting schemes can both scale problem size and mitigate noise for near-term quantum optimization.

Title: Two Variations of Quantum Phase Estimation for Reducing Circuit Error Rates: Application to the Harrow--Hassidim--Lloyd Algorithm
Authors: Yonghae Lee, Minjin Choi, Youngho Min, Eunok Bae, Sunghyun Bae
Abstract: We introduce two variations of the quantum phase estimation algorithm: quantum shifted phase estimation and quantum punctured phase estimation. The shifted method employs a bit-string left shift to discard the most significant bit and focus on lower-order phase components, and the punctured method removes qubits corresponding to known phase bits, thereby streamlining the circuit. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the two variations, we integrate them into a hybrid quantum-classical implementation of the Harrow--Hassidim--Lloyd algorithm for solving linear systems. The hybrid method leverages both quantum and classical processors to identify and remove unnecessary qubits and gates. As a result, our method reduces qubit and gate counts compared to previous implementations, leading to lower overall circuit error rates on current hardware. Experimental demonstrations on IBM superconducting hardware confirm the error-mitigation effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method.

Title: Predict and Conquer: Navigating Algorithm Trade-offs with Quantum Design Automation
Authors: Simon Thelen, Wolfgang Mauerer
Abstract: Combining quantum computers with classical compute power has become a standard means for developing algorithms that are eventually supposed to beat any purely classical alternatives. While in-principle advantages for solution quality or runtime are expected for many approaches, substantial challenges remain: Non-functional properties like runtime or solution quality of many approaches are not fully understood, and need to be explored empirically. This makes it unclear which approach is best suited for a given problem. Accurately predicting behaviour of quantum-classical algorithms opens possibilities for software abstraction layers, which can automate decision-making for algorithm selection and parametrisation. While such techniques find frequent use in classical high-performance computing, they are still mostly absent from quantum toolchains. We present a methodology to perform algorithm selection based on desirable non-functional requirements. This simplifies decision-making processes for users. Based on annotations at the source code level, our framework traces key characteristics of quantum-classical algorithms, and uses this information to predict the most suitable approach and its parameters for given computational challenges and their non-functional requirements. As combinatorial optimisation is a very extensively studied aspect of quantum-classical systems, we perform a comprehensive case study based on numerical simulations of algorithmic approaches to implement and validate our ideas. We develop statistical models to quantify the influence of various factors on non-functional properties, and establish predictions for optimal algorithmic choices without manual effort. We argue that our methodology generalises to problems beyond combinatorial optimisation, such as Hamiltonian simulation, and lays a foundation for integrated software layers for quantum design automation.

Title: Phenomenological constraints on "impossible" measurements
Authors: Jesse Huhtala, Iiro Vilja
Abstract: In this Letter, we analyze an "impossible" measurement scenario presented by Sorkin. This scenario involving a joint measurement on spacelike separated systems in an intermediary region has widely been discussed in the quantum field theory measurement literature. We analyze the non-relativistic version of this paradoxical measurement scenario and consider which phenomenological constraints must be introduced from relativistic theory to remove the faster-than-light signaling.

Title: Relaying Quantum Information
Authors: Yigal Ilin, Uzi Pereg
Abstract: Quantum relays are central to both quantum communication and distributed quantum computing, enabling long-distance transmission and modular architectures. Unlike classical repeaters, quantum repeaters preserve coherence without amplifying quantum information, relying on entanglement swapping and quantum error correction to overcome loss and decoherence. In this work, we investigate the transmission of quantum information via quantum relay channels. Our three-terminal relay model captures the trade-off between repeater-assisted and repeaterless communication strategies. We propose a decode-forward coding scheme and analyze both entanglement-assisted and unassisted scenarios. Our framework allows for different entanglement topologies between the transmitter, the relay and the destination receiver, recovering known results on entanglement-assisted and unassisted communication. Furthermore, we discuss the interpretation of coding with quantum side information. These findings serve as a stepping stone for the design of secure, efficient, and reliable quantum networks and the practical realization of quantum repeaters and long-range quantum key distribution.

Title: Efficient Implementation of a Single-Qutrit Gate Set via Coherent Control

Abstract: Qutrit offers the potential for enhanced quantum computation by exploiting an enlarged Hilbert space. However, the synthesis of high-fidelity and fast qutrit gates, particularly for single qutrit, remains an ongoing challenge, as it involves overcoming intrinsic constraints in quantum platforms. Here, we develop a novel framework for the efficient implementation of a single-qutrit gate set via coherent control, leveraging SU(3) dynamics while obviating platform-specific constraints such as arising from the selection rule. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we realize 35 ns qutrit Hadamard and X gates using a superconducting transmon, achieving an average fidelity of 99.5\%, as verified by randomized benchmarking. We further demonstrate two paradigmatic quantum circuits, which can be naturally extended to scalable qudit algorithms for phase estimation and parity check. By addressing the challenge of efficiently implementing single-qutrit gates, our protocol paves the pathway for realizing high-performance qutrit processors in diverse quantum platforms.

Title: Quantum Simulation and Optimization of Water Distribution Networks
Authors: Carlos Romero Rocha, Nicolas Renaud, Koen Leijnse, Samuel van Beek, Mario Castro-Gama
Abstract: To compute models for Water Distribution Networks (WDN), a large system of non-linear equations needs to be solved. The hallmark algorithm for computing these models is the Newton-Raphson Global Gradient Algorithm (NR-GGA), which solves these systems iteratively. Even so, large networks can take multiple days to model and the complexity of networks is only expected to increase in the future. It is therefore important to explore different algorithms using innovative technologies, to improve the tractability of modelling large networks. Quantum computing is such an innovative technology that is still in its early stages of development, paired with a different computational paradigm. In this research we have determined the feasibility of using quantum computing algorithms as a subroutine of NR-GGA and alternatively for replacing NR-GGA with a quantum algorithm in its entirety. Calculations were run on emulators of gate-based quantum computers and using simulated annealing while models were tested on small 2-loop networks of 7 nodes. To improve NR-GGA, three different quantum subroutines were used: the hybrid Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) showed the best results on this small dataset. To replace NR-GGA by a quantum algorithm in its entirety, we also used a Quantum Annealing-based approach for simulating higher-order polynomials to determine the Least-Cost Design (LCD) of a small 3 node network.

Title: Impact of Polarization Distinguishability on Coherence in QIUP
Authors: Gaytri Arya, Paolo Bianchini, Alberto Diaspro
Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) is a promising technique for non-invasive imaging, particularly at wavelengths where detectors are inefficient or unavailable. Recent studies have investigated the role of polarization in QIUP schemes. In this work, we examine whether post-generation optical elements can recover interference when the signal photons are distinguishable in polarization at the source. Specifically, we employ a Mach-Zehnder interferometer after the photon pairs are generated from two nonlinear crystals. Our results indicate that polarization distinguishability at the time of generation leads to a loss of interference that cannot be restored by post-generation optical arrangements. This highlights the fundamental importance of indistinguishability at the source for maintaining coherence in QIUP systems.

Title: Extrapolation of quantum measurement data
Authors: Konstantinos Manos, Mirjam Weilenmann, Miguel Navascues
Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting future expectation values of a collection of quantum observables, given their noisy expectation values at past times. The measured observables, the initial state of the physical system and even the Hilbert space are unknown; we nonetheless assume a promise on the energy distribution of the state. Investigating to what extent extrapolation is possible in this framework, we discover highly problematic datasets that allow full predictability at any future time $\tau$, but only when past averages are known up to precision superexponential in $\tau$. We also find families of "self-testing datasets", which allow practical predictability under reasonable noise levels and whose approximate realization singles out specific Hamiltonians, states and measurement operators. We identify "aha! datasets", which drastically increase the predictability of the future statistics of an unrelated measurement, as well as "fog banks": fairly simple datasets that exhibit complete unpredictability at some future time $\tau$, but full predictability for a later time $\tau'>\tau$. Finally, we prove that the extrapolation problem is efficiently solvable up to arbitrary precision through hierarchies of semidefinite programming relaxations.

Title: Calibration of Quantum Devices via Robust Statistical Methods
Authors: Alexandra Ramôa, Raffaele Santagati, Nathan Wiebe
Abstract: Bayesian inference is a widely used technique for real-time characterization of quantum systems. It excels in experimental characterization in the low data regime, and when the measurements have degrees of freedom. A decisive factor for its performance is the numerical representation of the Bayesian probability distributions. In this work, we explore advanced statistical methods for this purpose, and numerically analyze their performance against the state-of-the-art in quantum parameter learning. In particular, we consider sequential importance resampling, tempered likelihood estimation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, random walk Metropolis (RWM), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variants (stochastic gradients with and without friction, energy conserving subsampling), block pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings with subsampling, hybrid HMC-RWM approaches, and Gaussian rejection filtering. We demonstrate advantages of these approaches over existing ones, namely robustness under multi-modality and high dimensionality. We apply these algorithms to the calibration of superconducting qubits from IBMQ, surpassing the standard quantum limit and achieving better results than Qiskit's default tools. In Hahn echo and Ramsey experiments, we reduce the uncertainty by factors of 10 and 3 respectively, without increasing the number of measurements; conversely, we match the performance of Qiskit's methods while using up to to 99.5% less experimental data. We additionally investigate the roles of adaptivity, dataset ordering and heuristics in quantum characterization. Our findings have applications in challenging quantum characterization tasks, namely learning the dynamics of open quantum systems.

Title: No physics required! A visual-based introduction to GKP qubits for computer scientists
Authors: Richard A. Wolf, Pavithran Iyer
Abstract: With the significance of continuous-variable quantum computing increasing thanks to the achievements of light-based quantum hardware, making it available to learner audiences outside physics has been an important yet seldom-tackled challenge. Similarly, the rising focus on fault-tolerant quantum computing has shed light on quantum error correction schemes, turning it into the locus of attention for industry and academia alike. In this paper, we explore the widely adopted framework of quantum error correction based on continuous variable systems and suggest a guide on building a self-contained learning session targeting the famous Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code through its geometric intuition.

Title: Towards relativistic generalization of collapse models
Authors: Anirudh Gundhi, Lajos Diósi, Matteo Carlesso
Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models provide a possible, testable solution to the quantum measurement problem. While experiments are providing increasingly stronger bounds on their parameters, a full-fledged relativistic extension is still missing. Previous attempts have encoutered different obstacles, such as violation of microcausality, infinite energy rate, and particle production from vacuum. Here, we propose generalization of the collapse master equation that is characterized by a local field collapse operator and a non-Markovian noise with a Lorentz invariant correlation. Our construction is able to overcome previously encountered problems and has the desirable properties in the non relativistic limit. A specific choice of the noise correlation function is also introduced and discussed.

Title: Flexible Readout and Unconditional Reset for Superconducting Multi-Qubit Processors with Tunable Purcell Filters

Abstract: Qubit readout and reset are critical components for the practical realization of quantum computing systems, as outlined by the DiVincenzo criteria. Here, we present a scalable architecture employing frequency-tunable nonlinear Purcell filters designed specifically for superconducting qubits. This architecture enables flexible readout and unconditional reset functionalities. Our readout protocol dynamically adjusts the effective linewidth of the readout resonator through a tunable filter, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio during measurement while suppressing photon noise during idle periods. Achieving a readout fidelity of $99.3\%$ without using Josephson parametric amplifiers or traveling-wave parametric amplifiers, even with a small dispersive shift, demonstrates its effectiveness. For reset operations, our protocol utilizes the tunable coupler adjacent to the target qubit as an intermediary to channel qubit excitations into the Purcell filter, enabling rapid dissipation. We demonstrate unconditional reset of both leakage-induced $|2\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ states within 200 ns (error rate $\leq1\%$), and reset of the $|1\rangle$ state alone in just 75 ns. Repeated reset cycles ($\leq600$ ns) further reduce the error rate below $0.1\%$. Furthermore, the filter suppresses both photon noise and the Purcell effect, thereby reducing qubit decoherence. This scalable Purcell filter architecture shows exceptional performance in qubit readout, reset, and protection, marking it as a promising hardware component for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.

Abstract: As quantum computing advances from theoretical promise to experimental reality, the need for rigorous experiment tracking becomes critical. Drawing inspiration from best practices in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), we argue that reproducibility, scalability, and collaboration in quantum research can benefit significantly from structured tracking workflows. This paper explores the application of MLflow in quantum research, illustrating how it enables better development practices, experiment reproducibility, decision making, and cross-domain integration in an increasingly hybrid classical-quantum landscape.

Title: Solving boundary time crystals via the superspin method
Authors: Dominik Nemeth, Alessandro Principi, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: Boundary time crystals have been extensively studied through numerical and mean-field methods. However, a comprehensive analytical approach in terms of the Liouvillian eigenvalues, without semiclassical approximations, has yet to be developed. In this work, we analyse the Liouvillian spectrum of dissipative spin models, within a perturbative framework in the weak-dissipation limit. Introducing the superspin method, we compute the eigenvalues to first order in perturbation theory, providing a direct and transparent explanation for the emergence of the time crystal phase. We analytically demonstrate how spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to persistent oscillations. Our method can be used as a tool to unequivocally identify new dissipative collective spin models that support a boundary time crystal phase. We demonstrate this by applying the technique to four distinct, collective spin Liouvillians, which experience some dissipation. The first of these is the paradigmatic model studied in [1]. We demonstrate how the boundary time crystal phase is a general feature of models that yield a solution solely in terms of a quantity that we term the superspin. Furthermore, we analyse the stability of this phase and demonstrate how, in some cases, it is stable against increasing dissipation.

Title: Efficient Algorithms for Quantum Hashing
Authors: Ilnar Zinnatullin, Kamil Khadiev
Abstract: Quantum hashing is a useful technique that allows us to construct memory-efficient algorithms and secure quantum protocols. First, we present a circuit that implements the phase form of quantum hashing using $2^{n-1}$ CNOT gates, where n is the number of control qubits. Our method outperforms existing approaches and reduces the circuit depth. Second, we propose an algorithm that provides a trade-off between the number of CNOT gates (and consequently, the circuit depth) and the precision of rotation angles. This is particularly important in the context of NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices, where hardware-imposed angle precision limit remains a critical constraint.

Title: Quantum Spectral Clustering: Comparing Parameterized and Neuromorphic Quantum Kernels
Authors: Donovan Slabbert, Dean Brand, Francesco Petruccione
Abstract: We compare a parameterized quantum kernel (pQK) with a quantum leaky integrate-and-fire (QLIF) neuromorphic computing approach that employs either the Victor-Purpura or van Rossum kernel in a spectral clustering task, as well as the classical radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Performance evaluation includes label-based classification and clustering metrics, as well as optimal number of clusters predictions for each dataset based on an elbow-like curve as is typically used in $K$-means clustering. The pQK encodes feature vectors through angle encoding with rotation angles scaled parametrically. Parameters are optimized through grid search to maximize kernel-target alignment, producing a kernel that reflects distances in the feature space. The quantum neuromorphic approach uses population coding to transform data into spike trains, which are then processed using temporal distance metrics. Kernel matrices are used as input into a classical spectral clustering pipeline prior to performance evaluation. For the synthetic datasets and \texttt{Iris}, the QLIF kernel typically achieves better classification and clustering performance than pQK. However, on higher-dimensional datasets, such as a preprocessed version of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (\texttt{SDSS}), pQK performed better, indicating a possible advantage in higher-dimensional regimes.

Title: Layer Cake Representations for Quantum Divergences
Authors: Po-Chieh Liu, Christoph Hirche, Hao-Chung Cheng
Abstract: Defining suitable quantum extensions of classical divergences often poses a challenge due to the non-commutative nature of quantum information. In this work, we propose a new approach via what we call the layer cake representation. The resulting quantum Rényi and $f$-divergences are then proven to be equivalent to those recently defined via integral representations. Nevertheless, the approach can provide several insights. We give an alternative proof of the integral representation of the relative entropy by Frenkel and prove a conjecture regarding a trace expression for the Rényi divergence. Additionally, we give applications to error exponents in hypothesis testing, a new Riemann-Stieltjes type integral representation and a variational representation.

Title: Asymmetric two-photon response of an incoherently driven quantum emitter
Authors: Lennart Jehle, Lena M. Hansen, Patrik I. Sund, Thomas W. Sandø, Raphael Joos, Michael Jetter, Simone L. Portalupi, Mathieu Bozzio, Peter Michler, Philip Walther
Abstract: Quantum emitters promise to emit exactly one photon with high probability when pumped by a laser pulse. However, even in ideal systems, re-excitation during a laser pulse causes the consecutive emission of two photons, thus limiting the single-photon purity. Although the probability and properties of re-excitation are largely determined by the optical excitation method, until now only resonant driving has been studied. Here, we demonstrate qualitative differences in the process arising from phonon-assisted excitation -- a scheme standing out for its robustness and straightforward spectral suppression of scattered laser light while preserving highly indistinguishable emission. In contrast to previous studies under resonant driving, we measure not only the $g^{(2)}(0)$ as a function of pulse length but also resolve the distinct temporal and spectral shape of each of the photons, report an asymmetric two-photon spectrum and uncover correlations between the emission time and wavelength, which are unique to phonon-assisted pumping. On the fundamental side, we show how the spectrum stemming from re-excitation provides direct access to the Rabi frequency of an incoherently driven quantum dot. On the application side, we use the asymmetric spectral response to selectively suppress multiphoton noise from re-excitation, ensuring a high-single photon purity regardless of the laser pulse length and thus enhancing implementations across quantum cryptography and quantum computing.

Title: Non-Gaussian Phase Transition and Cascade of Instabilities in the Dissipative Quantum Rabi Model
Authors: Mingyu Kang, Yikang Zhang, Kenneth R. Brown, Thomas Barthel
Abstract: The open quantum Rabi model describes a two-level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator. A Gaussian phase transition for the nonequilibrium steady states has been predicted when the bosonic mode is soft and subject to damping. We show that oscillator dephasing is a relevant perturbation, which leads to a non-Gaussian phase transition and an intriguing cascade of instabilities for $k$-th order bosonic operators. For the soft-mode limit, the equations of motion form a closed hierarchy and spectral properties can be efficiently studied. To this purpose, we establish a fruitful connection to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The results for the phase diagram, stability boundaries, and relevant observables are based on mean-field analysis, exact diagonalization, perturbation theory, and Keldysh field theory.

Title: Q-Detection: A Quantum-Classical Hybrid Poisoning Attack Detection Method
Authors: Haoqi He, Xiaokai Lin, Jiancai Chen, Yan Xiao
Abstract: Data poisoning attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by introducing malicious data into the training process, thereby degrading model performance or manipulating predictions. Detecting and sifting out poisoned data is an important method to prevent data poisoning attacks. Limited by classical computation frameworks, upcoming larger-scale and more complex datasets may pose difficulties for detection. We introduce the unique speedup of quantum computing for the first time in the task of detecting data poisoning. We present Q-Detection, a quantum-classical hybrid defense method for detecting poisoning attacks. Q-Detection also introduces the Q-WAN, which is optimized using quantum computing devices. Experimental results using multiple quantum simulation libraries show that Q-Detection effectively defends against label manipulation and backdoor attacks. The metrics demonstrate that Q-Detection consistently outperforms the baseline methods and is comparable to the state-of-the-art. Theoretical analysis shows that Q-Detection is expected to achieve more than a 20% speedup using quantum computing power.

Title: Krylov Complexity
Authors: Eliezer Rabinovici, Adrián Sánchez-Garrido, Ruth Shir, Julian Sonner
Abstract: We introduce and review a new complexity measure, called `Krylov complexity', which takes its origins in the field of quantum-chaotic dynamics, serving as a canonical measure of operator growth and spreading. Krylov complexity, underpinned by the Lanczos algorithm, has since evolved into a highly diverse field of its own right, both because of its attractive features as a complexity, whose definition does not depend on arbitrary control parameters, and whose phenomenology serves as a rich and sensitive probe of chaotic dynamics up to exponentially late times, but also because of its relevance to seemingly far-afield subjects such as holographic dualities and the quantum physics of black holes. In this review we give a unified perspective on these topics, emphasizing the robust and most general features of K-complexity, both in chaotic and integrable systems, state and prove theorems on its generic features and describe how it is geometrised in the context of (dual) gravitational dynamics. We hope that this review will serve both as a source of intuition about K-complexity in and of itself, as well as a resource for researchers trying to gain an overview over what is by now a rather large and multi-faceted literature. We also mention and discuss a number of open problems related to K-complexity, underlining its currently very active status as a field of research.

Title: Entanglement switching via mobility edges in a quasiperiodic chain
Authors: YouYoung Joung, Junmo Jeon, SungBin Lee
Abstract: We propose quasiperiodic chains with tunable mobility edge physics, as a promising platform for engineering long-range quantum entanglement. Using the generalized Aubry-André model, we show that the mobility edges play a key role in manipulating long-range indirect interactions in these systems. Near the mobility edge, critical states exhibit unexpectedly strong correlations between sites that share similar local structures, regardless of their spatial separation. Remarkably, by tuning the mobility edge across the Fermi level, one can induce both adiabatic transport and abrupt switching of entanglement between distant sites. These results highlight the potential of aperiodic structures for controlling nonlocal quantum correlations, opening new avenues for entanglement-based applications in quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Randomly measured quantum particles and thermal noise
Authors: Victor Gurarie
Abstract: We consider the motion of a quantum particle whose position is measured in random places at random moments in time. We contrast this motion with the motion of a quantum particle in a potential which varies randomly in space and in time, which could also be thought of as (possibly thermal) noise. We calculate expectations of observables both linear and nonlinear in the density matrix. We demonstrate explicitly that while linear observables cannot distinguish between random measurements and random noise, measurable distinctions can be seen in nonlinear observables.

Title: Algebraic States in Continuum in $ d\gt 1$ Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Ao Yang, Kai Zhang, Chen Fang
Abstract: We report the existence of algebraically localized eigenstates embedded within the continuum spectrum of 2D non-Hermitian systems with a single impurity. These modes, which we term algebraic states in continuum (AICs), decay algebraically as $1/|r|$ from the impurity site, and their energies lie within the bulk continuum spectrum under periodic boundary conditions. We analytically derive the threshold condition for the impurity strength required to generate such states. Remarkably, AICs are forbidden in Hermitian systems and in 1D non-Hermitian systems, making them unique to non-Hermitian systems in two and higher dimensions. To detect AICs, we introduce a local density of states as an experimental observable, which is readily accessible in photonic/acoustic platforms.

Title: The quantum Mpemba effect in long-range spin systems
Authors: Shion Yamashika, Filiberto Ares
Abstract: One of the manifestations of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is that a tilted ferromagnet exhibits faster restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry after a quantum quench when starting from a larger tilt angle. This phenomenon has recently been observed experimentally in an ion trap that simulates a long-range spin chain. However, the underlying mechanism of the QME in the presence of long-range interactions remains unclear. Using the time-dependent spin-wave theory, we investigate the dynamical restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry and the QME in generic long-range spin systems. We show that quantum fluctuations of the magnetization drive the restoration of symmetry by melting the initial ferromagnetic order and are responsible for the QME. We find that this effect occurs across a wide parameter range in long-range systems, in contrast to its absence in some short-range counterparts.

Title: Temperature-Dependent Emission Spectroscopy of Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Mouli Hazra, Manuel Rieger, Anand Kumar, Mohammad N. Mishuk, Chanaprom Cholsuk, Kabilan Sripathy, Viviana Villafañe, Kai Müller, Jonathan J. Finley, Tobias Vogl
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in future optical quantum technologies. For most applications, scalable on-demand fabrication is a key requirement. Recent advances using localized electron irradiation have demonstrated near-identical emitters in the blue and yellow spectral regions. While the blue emitters have been demonstrated in cryogenic temperatures, the yellow emitters remain uncharacterized under such conditions. In this work, we therefore extended the study of yellow emitters to cryogenic temperatures. Initially, multiple spectral features were observed, prompting a systematic investigation that led to the identification of a defect emission centered around 547.5 nm with high brightness and excellent photostability. By tuning the excitation wavelength, we are able to distinguish Raman scattering peaks from the emitter emission. Further analysis of the vibronic emissions allowed us to identify an optical phonon mode, whose contribution becomes increasingly dominant at elevated temperatures. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE) reveals excitation through this phonon mode enhances the emission by almost 5-fold in cryogenic temperature. Temperature-dependent studies further elucidate the role of phonons in the emission process. These observations deepen our understanding of the nature of the emitters, opening new avenues for precise tuning of quantum light sources.

Title: Tuning the probability detection of OAM entangled photons in Helical Ince-Gauss modes
Authors: A.A. Aguilar-Cardoso, D. Rodriguez-Guillen, R. Ramirez-Alarcon
Abstract: In this work we provide a detailed theoretical and experimental analysis of the two-photon Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) entangled state, generated by a type-I Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) process, when decomposed in terms of the Helical Ince-Gauss (HIG) modes basis. By exploiting the unique characteristics of this modal basis we show how the probability detection of the photon-pair can be tuned with the ellipticity parameter of the modes. We also show that, on the HIG basis the SPDC state has the contribution of two different symmetric Bell states, and it is possible to maximize the probability of each HIG symmetric Bell state separately, also by tuning the elipticity of the projected basis. The observed properties are confirmed experimentally by implementing measurements of the HIG modal joint probability of the SPDC two-photon state and Bell-type inequality violation experiments.

Title: Quantum state preparation without coherent arithmetic
Authors: Sam McArdle, András Gilyén, Mario Berta
Abstract: We introduce a versatile method for preparing a quantum state whose amplitudes are given by some known function. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require handcrafted reversible arithmetic circuits, or quantum table reads, to encode the function values. Instead, we use a template quantum eigenvalue transformation circuit to convert a low cost block encoding of the sine function into the desired function. Our method uses only 4 ancilla qubits (3 if the approximating polynomial has definite parity), providing order-of-magnitude qubit count reductions compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using a similar number of gates if the function can be well represented by a polynomial or Fourier approximation. Like black-box methods, the complexity of our approach depends on the 'L2-norm filling-fraction' of the function. We demonstrate the algorithmic utility of our method, including preparing Gaussian and Kaiser window states.

Title: Quantum differential equation solvers: limitations and fast-forwarding
Authors: Dong An, Jin-Peng Liu, Daochen Wang, Qi Zhao
Abstract: We study the limitations and fast-forwarding of quantum algorithms for linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems with a particular focus on non-quantum dynamics, where the coefficient matrix in the ODE is not anti-Hermitian or the ODE is inhomogeneous. On the one hand, for generic linear ODEs, by proving worst-case lower bounds, we show that quantum algorithms suffer from computational overheads due to two types of ``non-quantumness'': real part gap and non-normality of the coefficient matrix. We then show that homogeneous ODEs in the absence of both types of ``non-quantumness'' are equivalent to quantum dynamics, and reach the conclusion that quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics work best. To obtain these lower bounds, we propose a general framework for proving lower bounds on quantum algorithms that are amplifiers, meaning that they amplify the difference between a pair of input quantum states. On the other hand, we show how to fast-forward quantum algorithms for solving special classes of ODEs which leads to improved efficiency. More specifically, we obtain exponential improvements in both $T$ and the spectral norm of the coefficient matrix for inhomogeneous ODEs with efficiently implementable eigensystems, including various spatially discretized linear evolutionary partial differential equations. We give fast-forwarding algorithms that are conceptually different from existing ones in the sense that they neither require time discretization nor solving high-dimensional linear systems.

Title: Single-qubit loss-tolerant quantum position verification protocol secure against entangled attackers
Authors: Llorenç Escolà-Farràs, Florian Speelman
Abstract: Protocols for quantum position verification (QPV) which combine classical and quantum information are insecure in the presence of loss. We study the exact loss-tolerance of the most popular protocol for QPV, which is based on BB84 states, and generalizations of this protocol. By bounding the winning probabilities of a variant of the monogamy-of-entanglement game using semidefinite programming (SDP), we find tight bounds for the relation between loss and error for these extended non-local games. These new bounds enable the usage of QPV protocols using more-realistic experimental parameters. We show how these results transfer to the variant protocol which combines $n$ bits of classical information with a single qubit, thereby exhibiting a protocol secure against a linear amount of entanglement (in the classical information $n$) even in the presence of a moderate amount of photon loss. Moreover, this protocol stays secure even if the photon encoding the qubit travels arbitrarily slow in an optical fiber. We also extend this analysis to the case of more than two bases, showing even stronger loss-tolerance for that case. Finally, since our semi-definite program bounds a monogamy-of-entanglement game, we describe how they can also be applied to improve the analysis of one-sided device-independent QKD protocols.

Title: Detecting Entanglement by State Preparation and Local Measurements
Authors: Jaemin Kim, Anindita Bera, Dariusz Chruscinski, Joonwoo Bae
Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are a collection of observables that can characterize separable states and, experimentally, estimating EWs can verify entangled states. In this work, we show that a fixed measurement setting on a multipartite entangled state, which we introduce as a network state for the purpose, can estimate EWs. Namely, entangled states can be fully verified in a measurement-based manner, in which experimenters do not necessarily change measurement settings. We present a fixed measurement setting and network states for estimating decomposable EWs, equivalent to the partial transpose criteria. We also consider non-decomposable EWs that detect bound entangled states beyond the partial transpose criteria. The results can be extended to multipartite states such as graph states, a resource for measurement-based quantum computing, and readily applied to distributed settings such as quantum metrology or sensor networks where multipartite entangled states are resourceful.

Title: Transforming graph states via Bell state measurements
Authors: Matthias C. Löbl, Love A. Pettersson, Stefano Paesani, Anders S. Sørensen
Abstract: Graph states are key resources for measurement-based quantum computing, which is particularly promising for photonic systems. Fusions are probabilistic Bell state measurements, measuring pairs of parity operators of two qubits. Fusions can be used to connect/entangle different graph states, making them a powerful resource for measurement-based and related fusion-based quantum computing. There are several different graph structures and types of Bell state measurements, yet the associated graph transformations have only been analyzed for specific cases. Here, we provide a full set of graph transformation rules and give an intuitive visualization based on Venn diagrams of local neighborhoods of graph nodes. We derive these graph transformations for all types of rotated type-II fusion, showing that there are five different fusion success cases. Finally, we give application examples of the derived graph transformation rules and show that they can be used to construct graph codes or simulate fusion networks.

Title: Adaptive measurement strategy for noisy quantum amplitude estimation with variational quantum circuits
Authors: Kohei Oshio, Yohichi Suzuki, Kaito Wada, Keigo Hisanaga, Shumpei Uno, Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: In quantum computation, amplitude estimation is a fundamental subroutine that is utilized in various quantum algorithms. A general important task of such estimation problems is to characterize the estimation lower bound, which is referred to as quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB), and to construct an optimal estimator that achieves QCRB. This paper studies the amplitude estimation in the presence of depolarizing noise with unknown intensity. The main difficulty in this problem is that the optimal measurement depends on both the unknown quantum state and the amplitude we aim to estimate. To deal with these issues, we utilize the variational quantum circuits to approximate the (unknown) optimal measurement basis combined with the 2-step adaptive estimation strategy which was proposed in the quantum estimation this http URL numerically show that the proposed method can nearly attain the QCRB.

Title: Twirled worlds: symmetry-induced failures of tomographic locality
Authors: Daniel Centeno, Marco Erba, Thomas D. Galley, David Schmid, John H. Selby, Robert W. Spekkens, Sina Soltani, Jacopo Surace, Alex Wilce, Yìlè Yīng
Abstract: Tomographic locality is a principle commonly used in the program of finding axioms that pick out quantum theory within the landscape of possible theories. The principle asserts the sufficiency of local measurements for achieving a tomographic characterization of any bipartite state. In this work, we explore the meaning of the principle of tomographic locality by developing a simple scheme for generating a wide variety of theories that violate the principle. In this scheme, one starts with a tomographically local theory -- which can be classical, quantum or post-quantum -- and a physical symmetry, and one restricts the processes in the theory to all and only those that are covariant with respect to the collective action of that symmetry. We refer to the resulting theories as twirled worlds. We show that failures of tomographic locality are ubiquitous in twirled worlds. From the possibility of such failures in classical twirled worlds, we argue that the failure of tomographic locality (i.e., tomographic nonlocality) does not imply ontological holism. Our results also demonstrate the need for researchers seeking to axiomatize quantum theory to take a stand on the question of whether there are superselection rules that have a fundamental status.

Title: True and apparent motion of optomechanical resonators, with applications to feedback cooling of gravitational wave detector test masses
Authors: Evan D. Hall, Kevin Kuns
Abstract: Modern optomechanical systems employ increasingly sophisticated quantum-mechanical states of light to probe and manipulate mechanical motion. Squeezed states are now used routinely to enhance the sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers to small external forces, and they are also used in feedback-based trapping and damping experiments on the same interferometers to enhance the achievable cooling of fluctuations in the differential test mass mode (arXiv:2102.12665). In this latter context, an accurate accounting of the true test mass motion, incorporating all sources of loss, the effect of feedback control, and the influence of classical force and sensing noises, is paramount. We work within the two-photon formalism to provide such an accounting, which extends a previously described decomposition of the quantum-mechanical noise of the light field (arXiv:2105.12052). This decomposition provides insight, rooted in physically motivated parameters, into the optimal squeezed state and feedback control configuration that should be employed to achieve the lowest fluctuations. We apply this formalism to feedback damping experiments in current and possible future gravitational-wave interferometers -- LIGO A+, LIGO Voyager, Cosmic Explorer (CE), and CE Voyager -- and discuss how these multi-degree-of-freedom systems might be compared to a single degree-of-freedom oscillator. We find that, for the oscillator definition used most commonly in the literature so far, occupation numbers below 1 are possible in these interferometers over a frequency range comparable to the bandwidth of the trapped and cooled oscillator. We also discuss several technical issues in cooling experiments with gravitational-wave detectors

Title: A neural processing approach to quantum state discrimination
Authors: Saeed A. Khan, Fangjun Hu, Gerasimos Angelatos, Michael Hatridge, Hakan E. Türeci
Abstract: Although linear quantum amplification has proven essential to the processing of weak quantum signals, extracting higher-order quantum features such as correlations in principle demands nonlinear operations. However, nonlinear processing of quantum signals is often associated with non-idealities and excess noise, and absent a general framework to harness nonlinearity, such regimes are typically avoided. Here we present a framework to uncover general quantum signal processing principles of a broad class of bosonic quantum nonlinear processors (QNPs), inspired by a remarkably analogous paradigm in nature: the processing of environmental stimuli by nonlinear, noisy neural ensembles, to enable perception. Using a quantum-coherent description of a QNP monitoring a quantum signal source, we show that quantum nonlinearity can be harnessed to calculate higher-order features of an incident quantum signal, concentrating them into linearly-measurable observables, a transduction not possible using linear amplifiers. Secondly, QNPs provide coherent nonlinear control over quantum fluctuations including their own added noise, enabling noise suppression in an observable without suppressing transduced information, a paradigm that bears striking similarities to optimal neural codings that allow perception even under highly stochastic neural dynamics. Unlike the neural case, we show that QNP-engineered noise distributions can exhibit non-classical correlations, providing a new means to harness resources such as entanglement. Finally, we show that even simple QNPs in realistic measurement chains can provide enhancements of signal-to-noise ratio for practical tasks such as quantum state discrimination. Our work provides pathways to utilize nonlinear quantum systems as general computation devices, and enables a new paradigm for nonlinear quantum information processing.

Title: Completeness Relation in Renormalized Quantum Systems
Authors: Fatih Erman, O. Teoman Turgut
Abstract: In this work, we show that the completeness relation for the eigenvectors, which is an essential assumption of quantum mechanics, remains true if the initial Hamiltonian, having a discrete spectrum, is modified by a delta potential (to be made precise by a renormalization scheme) supported at a point in two and three-dimensional compact manifolds or Euclidean spaces. The formulation can be easily extended to $N$ center case, and the case where delta interaction is supported on curves in the plane or space.

Title: Probing entanglement of a continuous basis system
Authors: Pablo C. López Vázquez, Luis M. Piñuelas, Gustavo Montes
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to probe entanglement in a theoretically inaccessible quantum system with either a discrete or continuous basis. Our approach leverages insights into the entanglement distribution within a four-partite quantum system, comprising two qubit-oscillator subsystems with dephasing interactions between each qubit-oscillator pair. The method involves measurements applied only to the accessible two-qubit subsystem, enabling a qualitative detection and characterization of quantum correlations in the inaccessible two-oscillator subsystem. This approach provides a novel framework for probing entanglement in continuous-basis systems where traditional measures are often inapplicable due to their complexity. Our findings also reveal an intriguing conservative flow-like behavior in the redistribution of entanglement among subsystems, suggesting that entanglement may exhibit conservative properties in pure composite quantum systems.

Title: Study of entanglement and phase transitions in the coupled top systems with standard and nonstandard symmetries
Authors: Rashmi Jangid Sharma, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: We study classical and quantum versions of a coupled top system in the absence and the presence of nonlinear torsion in the individual top. The model without the torsion and couples two identical tops is well-known in the literature as the Feingold-Peres (FP) model. The permutation and chiral symmetries are preserved in the FP model. This model is classified under the BDI or chiral orthogonal symmetry class, one of the recently proposed nonstandard symmetry classes. For the nonzero torsional cases, we study two different models:(i) identical torsional term in the individual top (NZT-I model); (ii) non-identical torsional term due to their opposite sign in the individual top (NZT-II model). The NZT-I model has the permutation symmetry but no chiral symmetry; hence, this model is classified under the standard three-fold symmetry classes. On the other hand, the NZT-II model does not have permutation symmetry but has chiral symmetry; hence, this model is also classified as a nonstandard BDI symmetry class. In this study, we investigate the role of underlying symmetries on the entanglement between the two tops. Moreover, we explore the interrelations among classical phase space dynamics, energy transitions, and the entanglement between the tops.

Title: Spectral Bounds on Entropy and Ergotropy via Statistical Effective Temperature in Classical Polarization and Quantum Thermal States
Authors: Tariq Aziz, Meng-Long Song, Liu Ye, Dong Wang, José J. Gil, Sabre Kais
Abstract: We formulate a unified definition of the statistical effective temperature (SET) for finite-dimensional classical and quantum systems using dimension-dependent indices of purity derived from the eigenvalue spectrum. This spectral approach bypasses the need for Hamiltonians or energy gaps and remains applicable to both quantum density matrices and classical polarization coherency matrices. The SET framework naturally describes the divergence of inverse temperature near pure, non-degenerate states, consistent with the third law. Using entropy-SET diagrams, we explore spectral bounds in two-, three-, and four-level systems, which reveal physically realizable entropy regions, rank-dependent constraints, and cusp-like features. A Hamiltonian-free parametric spectrum ansatz provides a universal reference curve within these bounds. Furthermore, we derive spectral bounds on ergotropy as a function of entropy and SET, which quantify the maximum extractable work under passive constraints and introduce the notion of structured-states, engineered spectral configurations that saturate these bounds. Our analysis shows that SET serves as a thermodynamically meaningful and operationally relevant quantity for bounding entropy and ergotropy in both classical polarization systems and quantum thermal states.

Title: Integrability is generic in homogeneous U(1)-invariant nearest-neighbor qubit circuits
Authors: Marko Znidaric, Urban Duh, Lenart Zadnik
Abstract: Integrability is an exceptional property believed to hold only for systems with fine-tuned parameters. Contrary, we explicitly show that in homogeneous nearest-neighbor qubit circuits with a U(1) symmetry, i.e., circuits that repeatedly apply the same magnetization-conserving two-qubit gate, this is not the case. There, integrability is generic: all such brickwall qubit circuits are integrable, even with a randomly selected gate. We identify two phases with different conservation laws, transport properties, and strong zero edge modes. Experimentally important is the fact that varying any one of the parameters in the generic U(1) gate, one will typically cross the critical manifold that separates the two phases. Finally, we report on an unconventional time-reversal symmetry causing the system with open boundary conditions to be in the orthogonal class, while the one with periodic boundary conditions is in the unitary class.

Title: Conditional Motional Squeezing of an Optomechanical Oscillator Approaching the Quantum Regime
Authors: Benjamin B. Lane, Junxin Chen, Ronald E. Pagano, Scott Aronson, Garrett D. Cole, Xinghui Yin, Thomas R. Corbitt, Nergis Mavalvala
Abstract: Squeezed mechanical states are a highly coveted resource for quantum-enhanced sensing and serve as a compelling platform for probing the interplay between gravity and quantum mechanics. It has been predicted that a mechanical oscillator can be prepared into a quantum squeezed state if the applied measurement rate is fast relative to its mechanical resonance frequency. However, the experimental feasibility of this protocol has remained uncertain because of the difficulty in achieving low-frequency oscillators with sufficiently strong read-out. Here, we demonstrate that a careful selection of parameters in an optomechanical system, combined with optimal filtering techniques, enables the preparation of a 50 ng GaAs cantilever in a conditional classical squeezed state, achieving a minimum uncertainty of just 1.07 plus/minus 0.04 times the zero-point fluctuation level. This minimum variance is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than what has been achieved in previous experiments using the same protocol. Although we do not fully achieve the quantum squeezed regime, our demonstration provides definitive evidence that a measurement-based protocol is a practical and effective approach for the real-time preparation of macroscopic oscillators in quantum squeezed states.

Title: Axiomatization of Rényi Entropy on Quantum Phase Space
Authors: Adam Brandenburger, Pierfrancesco La Mura
Abstract: Phase-space versions of quantum mechanics -- from Wigner's original distribution to modern discrete-qudit constructions -- represent some states with negative quasi-probabilities. Conventional Shannon and Rényi entropies become complex-valued in this setting and lose their operational meaning. Building on the axiomatic treatments of Rényi (1961) and Daróczy (1963), we develop a conservative extension that applies to signed finite phase spaces and identify a single admissible entropy family, which we call signed Rényi $\alpha$-entropy (for a free parameter $\alpha > 0$). The obvious signed Shannon candidate is ruled out because it violates extensivity. We prove four results that bolster the usefulness of the new measure. (i) It serves as a witness of negative probability. (ii) For $\alpha > 1$, it is Schur-concave, delivering the intuitive property that mixing increases entropy. (iii) The same parametric family obeys a quantum H-theorem, namely, that under de-phasing dynamics entropy cannot decrease. (iv) The $2$-entropy is conserved under discrete Moyal-bracket dynamics, mirroring conservation of von Neumann entropy under unitary evolution on Hilbert space. We also comment on interpreting the Rényi order parameter as an inverse temperature. Overall, we believe that our investigation provides good evidence that our axiomatically derived signed Rényi entropy may be a useful addition to existing entropy measures employed in quantum information, foundations, and thermodynamics.

Title: Quantum Thermal Analogs of Electric Circuits: A Universal Approach
Authors: Devvrat Tiwari, Samyadeb Bhattacharya, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of quantum thermal analogs of electric circuits in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients, as well as a quantum thermal step transformer. Using this, we develop two novel quantum thermal circuits, viz., quantum thermal super Wheatstone bridge and quantum thermal adder circuit, paving the way for the corresponding integrated circuits. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.

Title: Quantum cryptography beyond key distribution: theory and experiment
Authors: Mathieu Bozzio, Claude Crépeau, Petros Wallden, Philip Walther
Abstract: Due to its fundamental principles, quantum theory holds the promise to enhance the security of modern cryptography, from message encryption to anonymous communication, digital signatures, online banking, leader election, one-time passwords and delegated computation. While quantum key distribution (QKD) has already enabled secure key exchange over hundreds of kilometers, a myriad of other quantum-cryptographic primitives are being developed to secure future applications against quantum adversaries. This article surveys the theoretical and experimental developments in quantum cryptography beyond QKD over the past decades, along with advances in secure quantum computation. It provides an intuitive classification of the main quantum primitives and their security levels, summarizes their possibilities and limits, and discusses their implementation with current photonic technology.

Title: Enhanced Qubit Readout via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Aniket Chatterjee, Jonathan Schwinger, Yvonne Y. Gao
Abstract: Measurement is an essential component of robust and practical quantum computation. For superconducting qubits, the measurement process involves the effective manipulation of the joint qubit-resonator dynamics, and it should ideally provide the highest quality for qubit state discrimination with the shortest readout pulse and resonator reset time. Here, we harness model-free reinforcement learning (RL), together with a tailored training environment, to achieve this multi-pronged optimization task. Using the IBM quantum device, we demonstrate that the pulse obtained by the RL agent not only successfully achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an assignment error of $(4.6 \pm 0.4)\times10^{-3}$, but also executes the readout and the subsequent resonator reset almost three times faster than the system's default process. Furthermore, the learned waveforms are robust against realistic parameter drifts and follow a generalized analytical form, making them readily implementable in practice with no significant computation overhead. Our results provide an effective readout strategy to boost the performance of superconducting quantum processors and demonstrate the prowess of RL in providing optimal and experimentally informed solutions for complex quantum information processing tasks.

Title: Contextuality of the probability current in quantum mechanics
Authors: Franck Laloë
Abstract: We revisit an argument proposed by Hardy \cite{Hardy-1} concerning local realistic theories, but in terms of the motion of the probability fluid and its current within standard quantum mechanic. We emphasize surprising properties of the flux lines of this current in configuration space, in particular (quasi) discontinuous variations when the context (the experimental setup) is changed. This occurs in both Galilean and Einsteinian relativity. In the latter case, discontinuous variations also appear without changing the setup, when the Lorentzian reference frame is changed. A Lorentz invariant definition of the motion of a quantum probability fluid is therefore impossible.

Title: Bayesian Quantum Amplitude Estimation
Authors: Alexandra Ramôa, Luis Paulo Santos
Abstract: We present BAE, a problem-tailored and noise-aware Bayesian algorithm for quantum amplitude estimation. In a fault tolerant scenario, BAE is capable of saturating the Heisenberg limit; if device noise is present, BAE can dynamically characterize it and self-adapt. We further propose aBAE, an annealed variant of BAE drawing on methods from statistical inference, to enhance robustness. Our proposals are parallelizable in both quantum and classical components, offer tools for fast noise model assessment, and can leverage preexisting information. Additionally, they accommodate experimental limitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We propose a robust benchmark for amplitude estimation algorithms and use it to test BAE against other approaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios. In both cases, it achieves lower error than any other algorithm as a function of the cost. In the presence of decoherence, it is capable of learning when other algorithms fail.

Abstract: The CHSH inequality is an inequality used to test locality in quantum theory and is recognized as one of Bell's inequalities. In contrast, the KCBS inequality is employed to test noncontextuality in quantum theory. While certain quantum states are known to violate these inequalities individually, it was previously assumed that no state could violate both inequalities simultaneously. This assumption is encapsulated in the concept of the `monogamy relation.' It describes a trade-off between nonlocality and contextuality: the violation of one inequality typically excludes the possibility of violating the other. However, Xue et al. demonstrated that simultaneous violations of both the CHSH and KCBS inequalities are possible with specific choices of observables. This discovery challenges the universal validity of the monogamy relation. It also suggests that the relationship between contextuality and nonlocality is more complex than previously understood. They further showed that numerous scenarios exist where both the CHSH inequality and a contextuality inequality involving more than five observables are violated. However, the number of such scenarios is finite. Building on this, we present two main results. The first is that there are infinitely many scenarios in which both the CHSH inequality and a contextuality inequality involving an odd number of observables are violated. This finding reveals the existence of infinitely many scenarios where the monogamy relation between the CHSH inequality and the noncontextuality inequality no longer holds. The second is that certain quantum states violate both the KCBS inequality and a nonlocality inequality distinct from the CHSH inequality. These insights deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between nonlocality and contextuality, and open avenues for exploring state-dependent inequalities and their physical implications.

Title: Evidence for Exceptional Points as Topological Defects
Authors: Chia-Yi Ju, Szu-Ming Chen
Abstract: Studies have shown that quantum states reside in a Hilbert space bundle. When a quantum system depends on continuous external parameters, these parameters define additional dimensions in the base space of the bundle. While much of the existing literature focuses on eigenstate subbundles, where geometric properties like Berry curvature arise, this work considers the entire Hilbert space bundle. Although the Hilbert space bundle has been found to be locally flat, suggesting that the system's geometry may appear trivial, we revisit this assumption. Specifically, we examine how an arbitrary quantum state evolves when transported along closed parameter loops, a phenomenon characterized by holonomy. Our results demonstrate that nontrivial holonomy can emerge in the presence of exceptional points. Consequently, the topology of the full Hilbert space bundle is nontrivial, with exceptional points acting as topological defects.

Title: Fundamental precision limits in finite-dimensional quantum thermal machines
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost. This notion was recently formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents decreases as entropy production increases. From another viewpoint, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. This indicates that physical constraints impose fundamental precision limits on the system, independent of its dynamics. In this study, we derive dynamics-independent bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. These bounds are governed by the minimum eigenvalue factor, which sets the maximum entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and mirrors the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamics. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence affects these fundamental bounds, demonstrating that the presence of coherence can enhance the precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.

Title: Quantum-selected configuration interaction with time-evolved state
Authors: Mathias Mikkelsen, Yuya O. Nakagawa
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) which define a subspace in which to diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Systematic analysis when increasing the number of qubits in a hydrogen chain shows that the subspace size required for sufficiently accurate results is reasonable at system sizes that cannot be solved by naive classical diagonalization. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers in quantum chemistry calculations.

Title: Plane-selective manipulations of nuclear spin qubits in a three-dimensional optical tweezer array
Authors: Toshi Kusano, Yuma Nakamura, Rei Yokoyama, Naoya Ozawa, Kosuke Shibata, Tetsushi Takano, Yosuke Takasu, Yoshiro Takahashi
Abstract: One of the central challenges for a practical fault-tolerant quantum computer is scalability. A three-dimensional structure of optical tweezer arrays offers the potential for scaling up neutral atom processors. However, coherent local operations, essential for quantum error correction, have yet to be explored for this platform. Here, we demonstrate plane-by-plane initialization of nuclear spin qubits of ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ atoms in a three-dimensional atom array and plane-dependent coherent temporal evolution of qubits, as well as plane-selective qubit manipulation by exploiting the plane-selective excitation of the atoms from the ${}^1S_0$ to the ${}^3P_2$ state. This plane-selective manipulation technique paves the way for quantum computing and quantum simulation in three-dimensional multilayer architectures.

Title: Long-Lived Photon Blockade with Weak Optical Nonlinearity
Authors: You Wang, Xu Zheng, Timothy C. H. Liew, Y. D. Chong
Abstract: In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.

Title: Variational Transformer Ansatz for the Density Operator of Steady States in Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Lu Wei, Zhian Jia, Yufeng Wang, Dagomir Kaszlikowski, Haibin Ling
Abstract: The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the \textit{transformer density operator ansatz} for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting mixed steady states.

Title: DNA Nanotechnology for Superradiance
Authors: Jaewon Lee, Sung Hun Park, Jangwon Kim, Kyung Hun Rho, Hoyoung Lee, Soyeon Kim, Seungwoo Lee
Abstract: Superradiance, first proposed by Dicke in 1954, is a highly efficient quantum light source that differs from conventional spontaneous emission. Unlike typical spontaneous emission, where intensity scales linearly with the number of electric dipoles, superradiance exhibits an intensity that scales quadratically with the number of electric dipoles. Similarly, the decay rate also increases proportionally to the dipole numbers. This collective emission is especially powerful when it manifests as superfluorescence, a physical regime of superradiance where spontaneously emerging coherence is achieved by arranging excited dipoles in the same orientation within a volume much smaller than their emission wavelength. Numerous experimental strategies have been employed to generate superradiance, with one common approach being the use of stochastically formed aggregates of quantum dots and organic dyes. However, the inherent randomness in such systems prevents precise control over the number, spatial distribution, and relative orientation of the emitters. This often leads to non-uniform coupling strengths and parasitic dephasing effects, which make it difficult to predict the resulting quantum emission and limit its use in engineered devices. A deterministic platform that provides precise control over these parameters is therefore essential for realizing the full potential of superradiant systems. Here, we (i) specifically outline the advantages of DNA nanotechnology in tackling this challenge, (ii) discuss the reasons why superradiance has not yet been realized even with the state-of-the art DNA nanotechnology, and (iii) propose potential solutions for overcoming the current limitations.

Title: Demonstration of High-Fidelity Entangled Logical Qubits using Transmons
Authors: Arian Vezvaee, Vinay Tripathi, Mario Morford-Oberst, Friederike Butt, Victor Kasatkin, Daniel A. Lidar
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) codes are necessary to fault-tolerantly operate quantum computers. However, every such code is inherently limited by its inability to detect logical errors. Here, we propose and implement a method that leverages dynamical decoupling (DD) to drastically suppress logical errors. The key to achieving this is to use the logical operators of the QEC code as DD pulses, which we refer to as logical dynamical decoupling (LDD). The resulting hybrid QEC-LDD strategy is in principle capable of handling arbitrary weight errors. We test QEC-LDD using IBM transmon devices and the [[4,2,2]] code, demonstrating performance that significantly exceeds the capabilities of using either this code or DD in isolation. We present a method that allows for the detection of logical errors affecting logically encoded Bell states, which, in this case, arise primarily from crosstalk among physical qubits. Building on this, we experimentally demonstrate high-fidelity entangled logical qubits.

Title: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Phase Transition in Free Fermion Systems
Authors: Han-Ze Li, Jian-Xin Zhong, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIET) highlight how local measurements drive quantum systems between area-law and volume-law entangled states. This review surveys MIET in free fermion models, focusing on how unitary hopping competes with measurement-induced non-unitarity. We discuss controversies regarding the existence of MIET in one dimension, the impact of non-Hermitian skin effects, and potential experimental platforms. We conclude with open challenges, including feedback control and higher-dimensional extensions.

Title: Towards robust variational quantum simulation of Lindblad dynamics via stochastic Magnus expansion
Authors: Jia-Cheng Huang, Hao-En Li, Yi-Cheng Wang, Guang-Ze Zhang, Jun Li, Han-Shi Hu
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel and general framework for the variational quantum simulation of Lindblad equations. Building on the close relationship between the unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic Magnus integrators, and variational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the quantum state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This formulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction trajectories within the established framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our algorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability of the simulation with large time steps, and the reduction in the number of quantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics in terms of the ensemble average. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical examples in both classical and quantum implementations, including the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with damping, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and the radical pair model (RPM). The simulation accuracy can be systematically improved, and the algorithm remains reliable even in highly oscillatory regimes. These methods are expected to be applicable to a broader class of open quantum systems beyond the specific models considered in this study.

Title: Self-Discharging Mitigated Quantum Battery
Authors: Wan-Lu Song, Ji-Ling Wang, Bin Zhou, Wan-Li Yang, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: As a quantum thermodynamic device that utilizes quantum systems for energy storage and delivery, the quantum battery (QB) is expected to offer revolutionary advantages in terms of increasing the charging power and the extractable work by using quantum resources. However, the ubiquitous decoherence in the microscopic world inevitably forces the QB to spontaneously lose its stored energy. This is called the self-discharging of the QB and severely limits its realization. We propose a QB scheme based on the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, where the electronic spin serves as the QB. Inspired by our finding that the coherent ergotropy decays more slowly than the incoherent ergotropy, we reveal a mechanism to enhance the inherent robustness of the QB to the self-discharging by improving the ratio of coherent ergotropy to total ergotropy. The unique hyperfine interaction between the electron and the native $^{14}$N nucleus in our scheme allows one to coherently optimize this ratio. Mitigating the self-discharging and optimizing the extractable work simultaneously, our results pave the way for the practical realization of the QB.

Title: Multiplexed Control at Scale for Electrode Arrays in Trapped-Ion Quantum Processors
Authors: Ryutaro Ohira, Shinichi Morisaka, Ippei Nakamura, Atsushi Noguchi, Takefumi Miyoshi
Abstract: The scaling up of trapped-ion quantum processors based on the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture is difficult owing to the extensive electronics and high-density wiring required to control numerous trap electrodes. In conventional QCCD architectures, each trap electrode is controlled via a dedicated digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The conventional approach places an overwhelming demand on electronic resources and wiring complexity. This is because the number of trap electrodes typically exceeds the number of trapped-ion qubits. This study proposes a method that leverages a high-speed DAC to generate time-division multiplexed signals to control a large-scale QCCD trapped-ion quantum processor. The proposed method replaces conventional DACs with a single high-speed DAC that generates the complete voltage waveforms required to control the trap electrodes, thereby significantly reducing the wiring complexity and overall resource requirements. Based on realistic parameters and commercially available electronics, our analysis demonstrates that a QCCD trapped-ion quantum computer with 10,000 trap electrodes can be controlled using only 13 field-programmable gate arrays and 104 high-speed DACs. This is in stark contrast to the 10,000 dedicated DACs required by conventional control methods. Consequently, employing this approach, we developed a proof-of-concept electronic system and evaluated its analog output performance.

Title: Dissipation-Assisted Steady-State Entanglement Engineering based on Electron Transfer Models
Authors: Mingjian Zhu, Visal So, Guido Pagano, Han Pu
Abstract: We propose a series of dissipation-assisted entanglement generation protocols that can be implemented on a trapped-ion quantum simulator. Our approach builds on the single-site molecular electron transfer (ET) model recently realized in the experiment [So et al. Sci. Adv. 10, eads8011 (2024)]. This model leverages spin-dependent boson displacement and dissipation controlled by sympathetic cooling. We show that, when coupled to external degrees of freedom, the ET model can be used as a dissipative quantum control mechanism, enabling the precise tailoring of both spin and phonon steady state of a target sub-system. We derive simplified analytical formalisms that offer intuitive insights into the dissipative dynamics. Using realistic interactions in a trapped-ion system, we develop a protocol for generating $N$-qubit and $N$-boson $W$ states. Additionally, we generalize this protocol to realize generic $N$-qubit Dicke states with tunable excitation numbers. Finally, we outline a realistic experimental setup to implement our schemes in the presence of noise sources.

Title: Monotonicity of the von Neumann Entropy under Quantum Convolution
Authors: Salman Beigi, Hami Mehrabi
Abstract: The quantum entropy power inequality, proven by König and Smith (2012), states that $\exp(S(\rho \boxplus \sigma)/m)\geq \frac 12 (\exp(S(\rho)/m) + \exp(S(\sigma)/m))$ for two $m$-mode bosonic quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$. One direct consequence of this inequality is that the sequence $\big\{ S(\rho^{\boxplus n}): n\geq 1 \big\}$ of von Neumann entropies of symmetric convolutions of $\rho$ has a monotonically increasing subsequence, namely, $S(\rho^{\boxplus 2^{k+1}})\geq S(\rho^{\boxplus 2^{k}})$. In the classical case, it has been shown that the whole sequence of entropies of the normalized sums of i.i.d.~random variables is monotonically increasing. Also, it is conjectured by Guha (2008) that the same holds in the quantum setting, and we have $S(\rho^{\boxplus n}) \geq S(\rho^{\boxplus (n-1)})$ for any $n$. In this paper, we resolve this conjecture by establishing this monotonicity. We in fact prove generalizations of the quantum entropy power inequality, enabling us to compare the von Neumann entropy of the $n$-fold symmetric convolution of $n$ arbitrary states $\rho_1, \cdots, \rho_n$ with the von Neumann entropy of the symmetric convolution of subsets of these quantum states. Additionally, we propose a quantum-classical version of this entropy power inequality, which helps us better understand the behavior of the von Neumann entropy under the convolution action between a quantum state and a classical random variable.

Title: Optomechanical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing
Authors: Margaret Pavlovich, Peter Rakich, Shruti Puri
Abstract: Fusion-based quantum computing with dual-rail qubits is a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing using linear optics. This paradigm requires single photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed into a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and for small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a single reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic sources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic outputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of resources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the all-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of quantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled states, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical quantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically long lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and insensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be prepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still probabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic modes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the states. The quantum states may be deterministically transferred from acoustic modes to optical modes, on demand, with another optical drive.

Title: Quantum accessible information and classical entropy inequalities
Authors: A. S. Holevo, A. V. Utkin
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. The optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed and proved. Via the optimality criterion, this provides also the first proof of the conjecture concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids put forward in [2].

Title: Inferring Quantum Network Topologies using Genetic Optimisation of Indirect Measurements
Authors: Conall J. Campbell, Matthew Mackinnon, Mauro Paternostro, Diana A. Chisholm
Abstract: The characterisation of quantum networks is fundamental to understanding how energy and information propagates through complex systems, with applications in control, communication, error mitigation and energy transfer. In this work, we explore the use of external probes to infer the network topology in the context of continuous-time quantum walks, where a single excitation traverses the network with a pattern strongly influenced by its topology. The probes act as decay channels for the excitation, and can be interpreted as performing an indirect measurement on the network dynamics. By making use of a Genetic Optimisation algorithm, we demonstrate that the data collected by the probes can be used to successfully reconstruct the topology of any quantum network with high success rates, where performance is limited only by computational resources for large network sizes. Moreover, we show that increasing the number of probes significantly simplifies the reconstruction task, revealing a tradeoff between the number of probes and the required computational power.

Title: Noise tolerance via reinforcement: Learning a reinforced quantum dynamics
Authors: Abolfazl Ramezanpour
Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that a reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to derive a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such reinforcement algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.

Title: Q2SAR: A Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning Approach for Drug Discovery
Authors: Alejandro Giraldo, Daniel Ruiz, Mariano Caruso, Javier Mancilla, Guido Bellomo
Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics classification tasks.

Title: Variational quantum algorithms with exact geodesic transport
Authors: André J. Ferreira-Martins, Renato M. S. Farias, Giancarlo Camilo, Thiago O. Maciel, Allan Tosta, Ruge Lin, Abdulla Alhajri, Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising candidates for near-term applications of quantum computers, but their training represents a major challenge in practice. We introduce exact-geodesic VQAs, a curvature-aware framework that enables analytic Riemannian optimization of variational quantum circuits through a convenient choice of circuit ansatz. Our method exploits the exact metric to find a parameter optimization path based on exact geodesic transport with conjugate gradients (EGT-CG). This supersedes the quantum natural gradient method, in fact recovering it as its first-order approximation. Further, the exact-geodesic updates for our circuit ansatz have the same measurement cost as standard gradient descent. This contrasts with previous metric-aware methods, which require resource-intensive estimations of the metric tensor using quantum hardware. In numerical simulations for electronic structure problems of up to 14 spin-orbitals, our framework allows us to achieve up to a 20x reduction in the number of iterations over Adam or quantum natural gradient methods. Moreover, for degenerate cases, which are notoriously difficult to optimize with conventional methods, we achieve rapid convergence to the global minima. Our work demonstrates that the cost of VQA optimization can be drastically reduced by harnessing the Riemannian geometry of the manifold expressed by the circuit ansatz, with potential implications at the interface between quantum machine learning, differential geometry, and optimal control theory.

Title: State Change via One-Dimensional Scattering in Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Olivia Pomerenk, Charles S. Peskin
Abstract: We consider a pair of particles that interact in a one-dimensional setting via a delta-function potential. One of the particles is confined to a one-dimensional box, and the other particle is free. The free particle is incident from the left with specified energy, and it may cause changes in state of the confined particle before flying away to the left or to the right. We present a non-perturbative formulation and computational scheme that determines the probability of any such outcome, as a function of the initial state of the confined particle and the energy of the incident particle.

Title: Fully Parallelized BP Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes Can Outperform BP-OSD
Authors: Ming Wang, Ang Li, Frank Mueller
Abstract: In this work, we propose a lightweight decoder based solely on belief-propagation (BP), augmented with a speculative post-processing strategy inspired by classical Chase decoding. Our method identifies unreliable bits via BP oscillation statistics, generates a set of modified test patterns, and decodes them in parallel using low-iteration BP. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve logical error rates comparable to or even better than BP-OSD, but has lower latency over its parallelization for a variety of bivariate bicycle codes, which significantly reduces decoding complexity.

Title: High-rate qutrit entanglement swapping with photon-number-basis
Authors: Kazufumi Tanji, Hikaru Shimizu, Masahiro Takeoka
Abstract: Entanglement generation between distant nodes is a fundamental process in distributed quantum information processing. Qudits, high-dimensional quantum states, are promising candidates for enhancing entanglement distribution capabilities. However, the success probability of qudit entanglement distribution using Bell measurements is typically lower than that of conventional qubit-based protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement swapping protocol specifically designed for qutrits (three-dimensional quantum states). Our protocol employs photon-number encoding combined with an additional mode basis, such as polarization, effectively increasing the success probability. We show that the proposed qutrit protocol can achieve higher entanglement generation rates compared to conventional two-photon detection-based qubit protocols, especially under conditions of limited photon generation probability. Furthermore, we evaluate our protocol under realistic experimental imperfections, including photon loss and threshold detection, and show that it achieves high fidelity with probabilistic photon sources.

Title: Contextual Light-Particle Interference
Authors: Brian Stout
Abstract: We propose and analyze a generalized model of photodetection in which the detector couples simultaneously to both electric and magnetic components of the electromagnetic field. Extending Glauber's seminal theory, we show that such detectors, now experimentally feasible via meta-materials, can yield interference patterns that depend strongly on the internal response of the detector. In particular, we show that for a two-source interference setup, coherent electric-magnetic dipole coupling can suppress or enhance interference visibility, revealing a clear instance of measurement contextuality in quantum optics, where the outcome depends on how the system is probed.

Title: On-chip magnon polaritons in the ultrastrong coupling regime
Authors: Shugo Yoshii, Manuel Müller, Ryo Ohshima, Matthias Althammer, Yuichiro Ando, Hans Huebl, Masashi Shiraishi
Abstract: Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase transitions. Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.

Title: Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Jean-Yves Desaules, Thomas Iadecola, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be locally avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.

Title: Optimizing Multiple-Control Toffoli Quantum Circuit Design with Constraint Programming
Authors: Jihye Jung, Kevin Dalmeijer, Pascal Van Hentenryck
Abstract: As quantum technology advances, the efficient design of quantum circuits has become an important area of research. This paper provides an introduction to the MCT quantum circuit design problem for reversible Boolean functions with the necessary background in quantum computing to comprehend the problem. While this is a well-studied problem, optimization models that minimize the true objective have only been explored recently. This paper introduces a new optimization model and symmetry-breaking constraints that improve solving time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to earlier work when a Constraint Programming solver is used. Experiments with up to seven qubits and using up to 15 quantum gates result in several new best-known circuits, obtained by any method, for well-known benchmarks. Several in-depth analyses are presented to validate the effectiveness of the symmetry-breaking constraints from multiple perspectives. Finally, an extensive comparison with other approaches shows that optimization models may require more time but can provide superior circuits with optimality guarantees.

Title: Symmetry-enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for a class of Bose-Hubbard type Hamiltonians
Authors: Tomotaka Kuwahara, Marius Lemm
Abstract: Several recent works have derived Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) for Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. For certain structured initial states, e.g., vacuum perturbations or near-stationary states, information propagates with velocity $v \leq C$ . However, for general bounded-density initial states, it was shown by the first author, Vu, and Saito that the velocity can grow in time as $v \sim t^{D-1}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension -- demonstrating the possibility of accelerated information spreading in bosonic systems. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on this phenomenon: we show that translation invariance combined with local $p$-body repulsion ($n^p$ with $p > D+1$) qualitatively alters the propagation behavior, leading to a bound of the form $v \sim t^{\frac{D}{p - D - 1}}$ for general bounded-energy-density initial states. In particular, this establishes for an almost-linear light cone at large $p$, in stark contrast to the previously found accelerated regimes. Our result identifies symmetry-driven constraints as a new mechanism for suppressing propagation speed in bosonic systems and thereby reframes the scope of what types of LRBs can hold. We further provide matching examples showing that, under the given assumptions, this bound is sharp -- no further improvement in the power of $t$ is possible without invoking additional dynamical constraints.

Title: Cons-training Tensor Networks: Embedding and Optimization Over Discrete Linear Constraints
Authors: Javier Lopez-Piqueres, Jing Chen
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.

Title: Quantum control of a single $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecular ion
Authors: David Holzapfel, Fabian Schmid, Nick Schwegler, Oliver Stadler, Martin Stadler, Alexander Ferk, Jonathan P. Home, Daniel Kienzler
Abstract: Science is founded on the benchmarking of theoretical models against experimental measurements, with the challenge that for all but the simplest systems, the calculations required for high precision become extremely challenging. $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ is the simplest stable molecule, and its structure is calculable to high precision. However, studying $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ experimentally presents significant challenges: Standard control methods such as laser cooling are not applicable due to the long lifetimes of its rotational and vibrational states. Here we solve this issue by combining buffer gas cooling to quench the $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ rovibrational excitation with quantum logic operations between $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ and a co-trapped 'helper' ion to control the molecule's hyperfine structure. This enables us to perform pure quantum state preparation, coherent control, and non-destructive readout, which we use to demonstrate high-resolution microwave spectroscopy in the hyperfine structure of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ with a precision of 2 Hz. Our results pave the way for high precision spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ in both the microwave and optical domains. Due to the wide applicability of buffer gas cooling, our method provides a general tool for molecular ion species that are hard to control with quantum logic tools alone.

Title: On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study
Authors: Archak Purkayastha, Giacomo Guarnieri, Janet Anders, Marco Merkli
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.

Title: Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene
Authors: Minoru Kanega, Masahiro Sato
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color-laser-driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we uniformly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the real-space path traced by the laser electric field. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zeroth order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and relative phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift- or injection-current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multicolor laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.

Title: Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters
Authors: Anastasiia Tiutiakina, Hugo Lóio, Guido Giachetti, Jacopo De Nardis, Andrea De Luca
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.

Title: Operating semiconductor qubits without individual barrier gates

Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits have emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing, following a significant improvement in their control fidelities over recent years. Increasing the qubit count remains challenging, beginning with the fabrication of small features and complex fanouts. A particular challenge has been formed by the need for individual barrier gates to control the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits. Here, we propose a method to vary two-qubit interactions without applying pulses on individual barrier gates while also remaining insensitive to detuning noise in first order. Experimentally we find that changing plunger gate voltages over 300 mV can tune the exchange energy $J$ from 100 kHz to 60 MHz. This allows us to perform two-qubit operations without changing the barrier gate voltage. Based on these findings we conceptualize a spin qubit architecture without individual barrier gates, simplifying the fabrication while maintaining the control necessary for universal quantum computation.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multi-Agent Pathfinding
Authors: Thore Gerlach, Loong Kuan Lee, Frédéric Barbaresco, Nico Piatkowski
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) focuses on determining conflict-free paths for multiple agents navigating through a shared space to reach specified goal locations. This problem becomes computationally challenging, particularly when handling large numbers of agents, as frequently encountered in practical applications like coordinating autonomous vehicles. Quantum Computing (QC) is a promising candidate in overcoming such limits. However, current quantum hardware is still in its infancy and thus limited in terms of computing power and error robustness. In this work, we present the first optimal hybrid quantum-classical MAPF algorithms which are based on branch-andcut-and-price. QC is integrated by iteratively solving QUBO problems, based on conflict graphs. Experiments on actual quantum hardware and results on benchmark data suggest that our approach dominates previous QUBO formulationsand state-of-the-art MAPF solvers.

Title: Efficient First-Principles Framework for Overdamped Phonon Dynamics and Anharmonic Electron-Phonon Coupling in Superionic Materials
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Marios Zacharias, Xiao Zhang, Nick Pant, Jacky Even, Pierre F. P. Poudeu, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.

Title: Detection of 2D SPT Order with Partial Symmetries
Authors: Alex Turzillo, Naren Manjunath, Jose Garre-Rubio
Abstract: A method of using partial symmetries to distinguish two dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of on-site, unitary symmetries is proposed. This novel order parameter takes a wavefunction, such as a ground state of a lattice model, and detects its SPT invariants as expectation values of finitely supported operators, without the need for flux insertion. The construction exploits the rotational symmetry of the lattice to extract on-site SPT invariants, building upon prior work on probing crystalline SPT phases with partial rotations. The method is demonstrated by computing the order parameter analytically on group cohomology models and numerically on a family of states interpolating between the CZX state and a trivial state. Its robustness is suggested by interpreting partial symmetries as generating the topological partition functions of lens spaces.

Title: Single-step high-fidelity three-qubit gates by anisotropic chiral interactions
Authors: Minh T. P. Nguyen, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen, Stefano Bosco
Abstract: Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.

Title: Stabilizing open photon condensates by ghost-attractor dynamics
Authors: Aya Abouelela, Michael Turaev, Roman Kramer, Moritz Janning, Michael Kajan, Sayak Ray, Johann Kroha
Abstract: We study the temporal, driven-dissipative dynamics of open photon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a dye-filled microcavity, taking the condensate amplitude and the noncondensed fluctuations into account on the same footing by means of a cumulant expansion within the Lindblad formalism. The fluctuations fundamentally alter the dynamics in that the BEC always dephases to zero for sufficiently long time. However, a ghost-attractor, although it is outside of the physically accessible configuration space, attracts the dynamics and leads to a plateau-like stabilization of the BEC for an exponentially long time, consistent with experiments. We also show that the photon BEC and the lasing state are separated by a true phase transition, since they are characterized by different fixed points. The ghost-attractor nonequilibrium stabilization mechanism is alternative to prethermalization and may possibly be realized on other dynamical platforms as well.

Title: Randomly measured quantum particle
Authors: V. Gurarie
Abstract: We consider the motion of a quantum particle whose position is measured in random places at random moments in time. We show that a freely moving particle measured in this way undergoes superdiffusion, while a charged particle moving in a magnetic field confined to the lowest Landau level undergoes conventional diffusion. We also look at a particle moving in one dimensional space in a random time-independent potential, so that it is Anderson localized, which is also measured at random points in space and randomly in time. We find that random measurements break localization and this particle also undergoes diffusion. To address these questions, we develop formalism similar to that employed when studying classical and quantum problems with time-dependent noise.

Title: Failure of the conformal-map method for relativistic quantum billiards
Authors: Barbara Dietz
Abstract: We demonstrate that the conformal-map method introduced by Robnik in 1984 for nonrelativistic quantum billiards is not applicable for the quantization of relativistic neutrino billiards (NBs) consisting of a massless non-interacting spin-1/2 particle confined to a two-dimensional domain. To be precise, we demonstrate in this work, that this method does not provide solutions of the associated Weyl (Dirac) equation, nor does it fulfill the boundary conditions imposed on the spinor eigenfunctions to ensure confinement of the particle to the domain of the billiard. We review in detail the wave equation, boundary conditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to make the proof comprehensible for the general reader. Our results are corroborated with numerical results for non-relativistic and relativistic quantum billiards whose shapes depend on a parameter, which allows the study of the properties of their eigenstates as the classical dynamics experiences a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics.

Title: The Software Landscape for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group
Authors: Per Sehlstedt, Jan Brandejs, Paolo Bientinesi, Lars Karlsson
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.

Title: Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Kuangjie Chen, Yang Qi, Zheng Yan, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.
