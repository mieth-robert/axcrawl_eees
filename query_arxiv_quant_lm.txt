Title: Information versus Physicality: On the Nature of the Wavefunctions of Quantum Mechanics
Authors: C. S. Unnikrishnan
Abstract: The physical states of matter and fields are represented in the quantum theory with complex valued wavefunctions, or more generally by quantum states in an abstract linear vector space. Determining the physical nature of wavefunctions remains an open problem that is at the very core of quantum mechanics, About a decade ago, Pusey, Barrett and Rudolf (PBR) claimed to prove an ontologically real status of wavefunctions by ruling out $\psi$-epistemic models. The result was obtained by associating wavefunctions to hypothetical distributions of notional physical states, and by examining whether some physical states were associated with more than one wavefunction, a criterion they chose for defining a wavefunction as `epistemic'. I show that the starting assumption in the PBR argument, of associating a wavefunction with a distribution of physical states, is flawed and contradictory to the linear structure of quantum mechanics coupled with its quadratic Born's rule. Since none of the axioms or calculations of observable statistical results in the standard quantum theory depends on specifying the physical nature of a $\psi$-function, the considerations in the PBR paper, involving a standard process of the preparation and projective measurements of quantum states, cannot address the ontological status of the wavefunctions in space and time.

Title: Devanagari Digit Recognition using Quantum Machine Learning
Authors: Sahaj Raj Malla
Abstract: Handwritten digit recognition in regional scripts, such as Devanagari, is crucial for multilingual document digitization, educational tools, and the preservation of cultural heritage. The script's complex structure and limited annotated datasets pose significant challenges to conventional models. This paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical architecture for Devanagari handwritten digit recognition, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction with a 10-qubit variational quantum circuit (VQC) for quantum-enhanced classification. Trained and evaluated on the Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD), the proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art test accuracy for quantum implementation of 99.80% and a test loss of 0.2893, with an average per-class F1-score of 0.9980. Compared to equivalent classical CNNs, our model demonstrates superior accuracy with significantly fewer parameters and enhanced robustness. By leveraging quantum principles such as superposition and entanglement, this work establishes a novel benchmark for regional script recognition, highlighting the promise of quantum machine learning (QML) in real-world, low-resource language settings.

Title: Enhancing quantum noise characterization via extra energy levels
Authors: Senrui Chen, Akel Hashim, Noah Goss, Alireza Seif, Irfan Siddiqi, Liang Jiang
Abstract: Noise is a major challenge for building practical quantum computing systems. Precise characterization of quantum noise is crucial for developing effective error mitigation and correction schemes. However, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors on many current platforms can introduce large ambiguity into conventional noise characterization methods. In this work, we propose a scheme for enhancing quantum noise characterization using additional energy levels. We first develop a comprehensive theory on the identifiability of n-qudit SPAM noise given high-quality single-qudit control, showing the existence of gauge freedoms which can be completely described using subsystem depolarizing maps. We then show how to use these extra energy levels to reduce the gauge ambiguity in characterizing both SPAM and gate noise in the qubit subspace. We experimentally implement these ideas on a superconducting quantum computing device and demonstrate a qutrit-enabled enhancement in noise characterization precision.

Title: Complexity of Contextuality
Authors: Theodoros Yianni, Farid Shahandeh
Abstract: Generalized contextuality is a hallmark of nonclassical theories like quantum mechanics. Yet, three fundamental computational problems concerning its decidability and complexity remain open. First, determining the complexity of deciding if a theory admits a noncontextual ontological model; Second, determining the complexity of deciding if such a model is possible for a specific dimension $k$; Third, efficiently computing the smallest such model when it exists, given that finding the smallest ontological model is NP-hard. We address the second problem by presenting an algorithm derived from a geometric formulation and its reduction to the intermediate simplex problem in computational geometry. We find that the complexity of deciding the existence of a noncontextual ontological model of dimension $k$ is at least exponential in the dimension of the theory and at most exponential in $k$. This, in turn, implies that computing the smallest noncontextual ontological model is inefficient in general. Finally, we demonstrate the fundamental difference between finding the smallest noncontextual ontological model and the smallest ontological model using an explicit example wherein the respective minimum ontic sizes are five and four.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Noisy Quantum Networks
Authors: Ferran Riera-Sàbat, Jorge Miguel-Ramiro, Wolfgang Dür
Abstract: Complex quantum networks are not only hard to establish, but also difficult to simulate due to the exponentially growing state space and noise-induced imperfections. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that leverage quantum computers and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices as simulators for quantum networks, including noisy quantum devices, channels, and protocols. Rather than considering noise as an undesired property that needs to be mitigated, we demonstrate how imperfections in quantum hardware can be utilized to simulate real-world communication devices under realistic conditions beyond classical simulation capabilities. Our approach allows NISQ devices with modest noise to simulate devices with more significant imperfections enabling large-scale, detailed simulations of quantum networks, where exact error models can be treated. It also improves over direct implementation and benchmarking of real networks, as waiting times for information transmission, locality, and memory restrictions do not apply. This framework can offer advantages in flexibility, scalability, and precision, demonstrating that NISQ devices can serve as natural testbeds for complex quantum networks, and paving the way for more efficient quantum network simulations.

Title: State-preparation and measurement error mitigation with non-computational states
Authors: Conrad J. Haupt, Almudena Carrera Vazquez, Laurin E. Fischer, Stefan Woerner, Daniel J. Egger
Abstract: Error mitigation has enabled quantum computing applications with over one hundred qubits and deep circuits. The most general error mitigation methods rely on a faithful characterization of the noise channels of the hardware. However, fundamental limitations lead to unlearnable degrees of freedom of the underlying noise models when considering qubits. Here, we show how to leverage non-computational states as an additional resource to learn state-preparation errors in superconducting qubits. This allows one to fully constrain the noise models. We can thus independently and accurately mitigate state-preparation errors, gate errors and measurement errors. Our proposed method is also applicable to dynamic circuits with mid-circuit measurements. This work opens the door to improved error mitigation for measurements, both at the end of the circuit and mid-circuit.

Title: The Quantum Paldus Transform: Efficient Circuits with Applications
Authors: Jędrzej Burkat, Nathan Fitzpatrick
Abstract: We present the Quantum Paldus Transform: an efficient quantum algorithm for block-diagonalising fermionic, spin-free Hamiltonians in the second quantisation. Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation number basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin (GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \times SU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and error mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur transform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion principle. Alongside self-contained derivations of the underlying dualities, we provide fault-tolerant circuit compilation methods for the Paldus transform with $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ Toffoli complexity, paving the way for significant advancements in quantum simulation on quantum computers enabled by the UGA paradigm.

Title: Low-Level and NUMA-Aware Optimization for High-Performance Quantum Simulation
Authors: Ali Rezaei, Luc Jaulmes, Maria Bahna, Oliver Thomson Brown, Antonio Barbalace
Abstract: Scalable classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for advancing both quantum algorithm development and hardware validation. In this work, we focus on performance enhancements through meticulous low-level tuning on a single-node system, thereby not only advancing the performance of classical quantum simulations but also laying the groundwork for scalable, heterogeneous implementations that may eventually bridge the gap toward noiseless quantum computing. Although similar efforts in low-level tuning have been reported in the literature, such implementations have not been released as open-source software, thereby impeding independent evaluation and further development. We introduce an open-source, high-performance extension to the QuEST simulator that brings state-of-the-art low-level and NUMA optimizations to modern computers. Our approach emphasizes locality-aware computation and incorporates hardware-specific optimizations such as NUMA-aware memory allocation, thread pinning, AVX-512 vectorization, aggressive loop unrolling, and explicit memory prefetching. Experiments demonstrate significant speedups - 5.5-6.5x for single-qubit gate operations, 4.5x for two-qubit gates, 4x for Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), and 1.8x for Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), demonstrating that rigorous performance tuning can substantially extend the practical simulation capacity of classical quantum simulators on current hardware.

Title: Genetic Transformer-Assisted Quantum Neural Networks for Optimal Circuit Design
Authors: Haiyan Wang
Abstract: We introduce Genetic Transformer Assisted Quantum Neural Networks (GTQNNs), a hybrid learning framework that combines a transformer encoder with a shallow variational quantum circuit and automatically fine tunes the circuit via the NSGA-II multi objective genetic algorithm. The transformer reduces high-dimensional classical data to a compact, qubit sized representation, while NSGA-II searches for Pareto optimal circuits that (i) maximize classification accuracy and (ii) minimize primitive gate count an essential constraint for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Experiments on four benchmarks (Iris, Breast Cancer, MNIST, and Heart Disease) show that GTQNNs match or exceed state of the art quantum models while requiring much fewer gates for most cases. A hybrid Fisher information analysis further reveals that the trained networks operate far from barren plateaus; the leading curvature directions increasingly align with the quantum subspace as the qubit budget grows, confirming that the transformer front end has effectively condensed the data. Together, these results demonstrate that GTQNNs deliver competitive performance with a quantum resource budget well suited to present-day NISQ devices.

Title: Classical algorithm inspired by the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization and local counterdiabatic driving
Authors: Takuya Hatomura
Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems, named the counterdiabaticity-assisted classical algorithm for optimization (CACAO). In this algorithm, a solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem is heuristically searched with classical spin dynamics based on quantum Lyapunov control of local counterdiabatic driving. We compare the performance of CACAO with that of quantum time-evolution algorithms, i.e., quantum annealing, the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization (known as FALQON), and the counterdiabatic feedback-based quantum algorithm (known as CD-FQA). We also study the performance of CACAO applied to large systems up to $10,000$ spins.

Title: Effective criteria for entanglement witnesses in small dimensions
Authors: Łukasz Grzelka, Łukasz Skowronek, Karol Życzkowski
Abstract: We present an effective set of necessary and sufficient criteria for block-positivity of matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{C}$. The approach is based on Sturm sequences and quartic polynomial positivity conditions presented in recent literature. The procedure allows us to test whether a given $4\times 4$ complex matrix corresponds to an entanglement witness, and it is exact when the matrix coefficients belong to the rationals, extended by $\mathrm{i}$. The method can be generalized to $\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\mathcal{H}_d$ systems for $d>2$ to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity. We also outline an alternative approach to the problem relying on Gröbner bases.

Title: Canonical Partition Function on a Quantum Computer through Trotter Interpolation
Authors: Taozhi Guo, Gumaro Rendon, Rutuja Kshirsagar
Abstract: In this work, we present a Gibbs state observable estimation algorithm based on Trotter interpolation, which reaches a state-of-the-art quantum computational cost of $ \tilde{O}(\beta \log{1/\epsilon})$. Our approach saves $\log(\Gamma)$ ancilla qubits compared with the qubitization-based methods for Hamiltonian with $\Gamma$ stages. To provide a robust assessment of our approach, we benchmark our results against state-of-the-art methodology using the SYK model as a testbed. Our method provides an efficient alternative method for Gibbs-state accessing based on Trotterization in the context of quantum state preparation and estimation of thermal observables.

Title: Accelerating quantum adiabatic evolution with $π$-pulse sequences
Authors: Tonghao Xing, Jiang Zhang, Guilu Long
Abstract: In quantum information processing, the development of fast and robust control schemes remains a central challenge. Although quantum adiabatic evolution is inherently robust against control errors, it typically demands long evolution times. In this work, we propose to achieve rapid adiabatic evolution, in which nonadiabatic transitions induced by fast changes in the system Hamiltonian are mitigated by flipping the nonadiabatic transition matrix using $\pi$ pulses. This enables a faster realization of adiabatic evolution while preserving its robustness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in both two-level and three-level systems. Numerical simulations show that, for the same evolution duration, our scheme achieves higher fidelity and significantly suppresses nonadiabatic transitions compared to the traditional STIRAP protocol.

Title: Toward Scalable Quantum Compilation for Modular Architecture: Qubit Mapping and Reuse via Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Sokea Sang, Leanghok Hour, Youngsun Han
Abstract: Modular quantum architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling quantum computing systems by connecting multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). However, this approach introduces significant challenges due to costly inter-core operations between chips and quantum state transfers, which contribute to noise and quantum decoherence. This paper presents QARMA, a novel Qubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for Modular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that incorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an attention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal qubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core communications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a transformer-based encoder that captures both the global circuit structure and local qubit interactions and (2) a dynamic qubit reuse compilation mechanism that leverages mid-circuit measurement and reset operations to reduce inter-operation and qubit requirements. Our experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular architecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to 100% (on average 85%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger circuits without reuse. Against traditional modular qubit mapping, our approach achieves 96.4-100% reduction in inter-core operation. The proposed methods advance quantum circuit compilation techniques and enable the execution of more extensive quantum algorithms on resource-constrained modular quantum systems, contributing to the growing body of research on scalable quantum computing architectures.

Title: Speeding up adiabatic holonomic quantum gates via $π$-pulse modulation
Authors: Jiang Zhang, Tonghao Xing, Guilu Long
Abstract: Holonomic quantum computation (HQC) offers an inherently robust approach to quantum gate implementation by exploiting quantum holonomies. While adiabatic HQC benefits from robustness against certain control errors, its long runtime limits practical utility due to increased exposure to environmental noise. Nonadiabatic HQC addresses this issue by enabling faster gate operations but compromises robustness. In this work, we propose a scheme for fast holonomic quantum gates based on the $\pi$-pulse method, which accelerates adiabatic evolution while preserving its robustness. By guiding the system Hamiltonian along geodesic paths in the parameter space and applying phase-modulating $\pi$ pulses at discrete points, we realize a universal set of holonomic gates beyond the conventional adiabatic limit. Our scheme allows for arbitrary single-qubit and two-qubit controlled gates within a single-loop evolution and provides additional tunable parameters for flexible gate design. These results demonstrate a promising path toward high-fidelity, fast, and robust quantum computation.

Title: Efficient Implementation of a Quantum Algorithm with a Trapped Ion Qudit
Authors: Xiaoyang Shi, Jasmine Sinanan-Singh, Timothy J. Burke, John Chiaverini, Isaac L. Chuang
Abstract: Demonstration of quantum advantage remains challenging due to the increased overhead of controlling large quantum systems. While significant effort has been devoted to qubit-based devices, qudits ($d$-level systems) offer potential advantages in both hardware efficiency and algorithmic performance. In this paper, we demonstrate multi-tone control of a single trapped ion qudit of up to eight levels, as well as the first implementation of Grover's search algorithm on a qudit with dimension five and eight, achieving operation fidelity of 96.8(3)$\%$ and 69(6)$\%$, respectively, which correspond to 99.9(1)\% and 97.1(3) \% squared statistical overlap (SSO), respectively, with the expected result for a single iteration of the Grover search algorithm. The performance is competitive when compared to qubit-based systems; moreover, the sequence requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$ single qudit gates and no entangling gates. This work highlights the potential of using qudits for efficient implementations of quantum algorithms.

Title: Conclusive Local State Marking: More Nonlocality With No Entanglement
Authors: Samrat Sen
Abstract: Nonlocality exhibited by ensembles of composite quantum states, wherein local operations and classical communication (LOCC) yield suboptimal discrimination probabilities compared to global strategies, is one of the striking nonclassical features of quantum theory. A variant of this phenomenon arises in conclusive local state discrimination, where the correct state must be identified with zero error, albeit allowing for inconclusive outcomes. More recently, the notion of local state marking has been introduced with the focus shifted to correctly identifying permutation of a subset of states random chosen from a given set of multipartite states under LOCC. In this work, we unify these two approaches by introducing the task of conclusive local state marking, which reveals a finer hierarchy of nonlocality in multipartite quantum state ensembles. Notably, we demonstrate that certain ensembles of product states can exhibit a stronger form of nonlocality than entangled ensembles traditionally considered highly nonlocal.

Title: Local surrogates for quantum machine learning
Authors: Sreeraj Rajindran Nair, Christopher Ferrie
Abstract: Surrogates have been proposed as classical simulations of the pretrained quantum learning models, which are capable of mimicking the input-output relation inherent in the quantum model. Quantum hardware within this framework is used for training and for generating the classical surrogates. Inference is relegated to the classical surrogate, hence alleviating the extra quantum computational cost once training is done. Taking inspiration from interpretable models, we introduce a local surrogation protocol based on reuploading-type quantum learning models, including local quantum surrogates as cost-efficient intermediate quantum learning models. When the training and inference are only concerned with a subregion of the data space, deploying a local quantum surrogate offers qubit cost reductions and the downstream local classical surrogate achieves dequantization of the inference phase. Several numerical experiments are presented.

Title: Optimal quantum metrology under energy constraints
Authors: Longyun Chen, Yuxiang Yang
Abstract: Quantum metrology promises enhanced precision in parameter estimation by exploiting quantum effects. The traditional framework of metrology commonly assumes unlimited access to resources, overlooking resource constraints in realistic scenarios. As such, the optimal strategies therein are often infeasible in practice. Here, we investigate quantum metrology where the total energy consumption of the probe state preparation, intermediate control operations, and the final measurement is subject to an energy constraint. We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for characterizing energy-constrained quantum multi-step processes, which can be applied to other tasks of quantum information processing beyond metrology. Based on the framework, we develop a general optimization method for energy-constrained quantum metrology that determines the optimal precision as well as the corresponding optimal strategy. Applying our method to phase estimation, we show that while the estimation precision can benefit arbitrarily from increasing dimension with unconstrained energy, energy constraints result in an ultimate precision scaling of $1/E^2$ in an infinite-dimensional system, where $E$ is the available energy, which reveals that limited energy could be an essential barrier to precision improvement.

Title: Covert Entanglement Generation over Bosonic Channels
Authors: Evan J. D. Anderson, Michael S. Bullock, Ohad Kimelfeld, Christopher K. Eyre, Filip Rozpędek, Uzi Pereg, Boulat A. Bash
Abstract: We explore covert entanglement generation over the lossy thermal-noise bosonic channel, which is a quantum-mechanical model of many practical settings, including optical, microwave, and radio-frequency (RF) channels. Covert communication ensures that an adversary is unable to detect the presence of transmissions, which are concealed in channel noise. We show that a $\textit{square root law}$ (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method. We additionally analyze the performance of covert entanglement generation using single- and dual-rail photonic qubits, which may be more practical for physical implementation.

Title: Generation of frequency entanglement by rotating Doppler effect
Authors: Bolong Yi, Ling Chen, Baocheng Zhang
Abstract: We propose a method to generate the frequency entanglement, allowing a continuous generation of entangled two-photon states in a hybrid degree of freedom by post-manipulation. Our method is based on type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal and the rotation Doppler effect by rotating the q-plates, without preset discrete frequency entanglement. This allows the arbitrary modification of frequency entangled photons in a wide frequency range at room temperature, offering enhanced flexibility for quantum information tasks and quantum metrology. We also analyze the entanglement state by a combined calculation for the joint spectrum and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of the two photons, which can be used to reconstruct a restricted density matrix in the frequency space.

Title: Quantum mixture-density network for multimodal probabilistic prediction
Authors: Jaemin Seo
Abstract: Multimodal probability distributions are common in both quantum and classical systems, yet modeling them remains challenging when the number of modes is large or unknown. Classical methods such as mixture-density networks (MDNs) scale poorly, requiring parameter counts that grow quadratically with the number of modes. We introduce a Quantum Mixture-Density Network (Q-MDN) that employs parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently model multimodal distributions. By representing an exponential number of modes with a compact set of qubits and parameters, Q-MDN predicts Gaussian mixture components with high resolution. We evaluate Q-MDN on two benchmark tasks: the quantum double-slit experiment and chaotic logistic bifurcation. In both cases, Q-MDN outperforms classical MDNs in mode separability and prediction sharpness under equal parameter budgets. Our results demonstrate a practical quantum advantage in probabilistic regression and highlight the potential of quantum machine learning in capturing complex stochastic behavior beyond the reach of classical models.

Title: Spatial and Pulse Efficiency Constraints in Atom Interferometric Gravitational Wave Detectors
Authors: Patrik Schach, Enno Giese
Abstract: Currently planned and constructed terrestrial detectors for gravitational waves and dark matter based on differential light-pulse atom interferometry are designed around three primary strategies to enhance their sensitivity: (i) Resonant-mode enhancement using multiple diamonds, (ii) large-momentum-transfer techniques to increase arm separation within the interferometer, and (iii) very-long baseline schemes that increase the distance between the two interferometers. Both resonant-mode enhancement and large-momentum-transfer techniques result in a greater number of light pulses, making high pulse fidelity during atom-light interactions imperative. At the same time, increasing the number of diamonds in vertical configurations leads to taller atomic fountains, which consequently reduces the available distance between interferometers. As a result, the number of diamonds, large-momentum-transfer pulses, and the fountain height are interdependent parameters that must be carefully balanced. In this work, we present optimal configurations for multi-diamond geometries, explicitly accounting for the spatial extent of a single interferometer, considering constraints imposed by the baseline dimensions and atomic losses due to imperfect pulses. We provide practical analytical relations to estimate the optimal number of pulses that should be applied. Many proposals beyond demonstrator experiments require pulse numbers that demand efficiencies not yet demonstrated with state-of-the-art momentum transfer techniques. As a result, the observed sensitivity falls short of expectations - an effect caused by both arm separation and atom loss per pulse - highlighting the urgent need for research aimed at improving pulse fidelities.

Title: Out of Tune: Demystifying Noise-Effects on Quantum Fourier Models
Authors: Maja Franz, Melvin Strobl, Leonid Chaichenets, Eileen Kuehn, Achim Streit, Wolfgang Mauerer
Abstract: The field of variational quantum algorithms, in particular quantum machine learning (QML), produced numerous theoretical and empirical insights in recent years. As variational quantum circuits (VQCs) can be represented by Fourier series that contain an exponentially large spectrum in the number of input features, hope for quantum advantage remains. Nevertheless, properties of quantum Fourier models (QFMs) are not yet fully understood, in particular how they could potentially outperform classical alternatives. Viewing VQCs with Fourier lenses opens up possibilities to analyse which classes of functions can be tackled by variational algorithms such as QML, while also illuminating and quantifying remaining constraints and challenges. Considering that noise and imperfections remain dominant factors in the development trajectory from noisy intermediate-scale to fault-tolerant quantum computers, the aim of this work is to shed light on key properties of QFMs when exposed to noise. In particular, we systematically analyse the effect of noise on the Fourier spectrum, expressibility and entangling capability of QFMs by conducting large-scale numerical simulations of quantum systems. This may help to better utilise hardware resources, and guide the construction of tailored error correction schemes. We find that decoherent noise exerts a uniform deleterious effect on all the tested ansätze, manifesting in the vanishing of Fourier coefficients, expressibility and entangling capability. We note however, that the detrimental influence of noise is less pronounced in some ansätze than in others, suggesting that these might possess greater resilience to noise.

Title: More entropy from shorter experiments using polytope approximations to the quantum set
Authors: Hyejung H. Jee, Florian Curchod, Mafalda Almeida
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method for constructing polytope approximations to the quantum set in a variety of device-independent quantum random number generation (DI-QRNG) protocols. Our approach relies on two general-purpose algorithms that iteratively refine an initial outer-polytope approximation, guided by typical device behaviour and cryptographic intuition. These refinements strike a balance between computational tractability and approximation effectiveness. By integrating these approximations into the probability estimation (PE) framework [Zhang et al., PRA 2018], we obtain significantly improved certified entropy bounds in the finite-size regime. We test our method on various bipartite and tripartite DI-QRNG protocols, using both simulated and experimental data. In all cases, it yields notably higher entropy rates with fewer device uses than the existing techniques. We further extend our analysis to the more demanding task of randomness amplification, demonstrating major performance gains without added complexity. These results offer an effective and ready-to-use method to prove security-with improved certified entropy rates-in the most common practical DI-QRNG protocols. Our algorithms and entropy certification with PE tools are publicly available under a non-commercial license at this https URL.

Title: Quench dynamics of negativity Hamiltonians
Authors: Riccardo Travaglino, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quench dynamics of the negativity and fermionic negativity Hamiltonians in free fermionic systems. We do this by generalizing a recently developed quasiparticle picture for the entanglement Hamiltonians to tripartite geometries. We obtain analytic expressions for these quantities which are then extensively checked against previous results and numerics. In particular, we find that the standard negativity Hamiltonian contains both non-local hopping terms and four fermion interactions, whereas the fermionic version is purely quadratic. However, despite their marked difference, we show that the logarithmic negativity obtained from either are identical in the ballistic scaling limit, as are their symmetry resolution.

Abstract: The fidelity of operations on a solid-state quantum processor is ultimately bounded by decoherence effects induced by a fluctuating environment. Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the acquisition time of experimental protocols limits the precision with which the environment can be measured and may obscure the detailed structure of these fluctuations. Here we present a real-time Bayesian method for estimating the relaxation rate of a qubit, leveraging a classical controller with an integrated field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Using our FPGA-powered Bayesian method, we adaptively and continuously track the relaxation-time fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally exceed 0.5 ms. Our technique allows for the estimation of these relaxation times in a few milliseconds, more than two orders of magnitude faster than previous nonadaptive methods, and allows us to observe fluctuations up to 5 times the qubit's average relaxation rates on significantly shorter timescales than previously reported. Our statistical analysis reveals that these fluctuations occur on much faster timescales than previously understood, with two-level-system switching rates reaching up to 10 Hz. Our work offers an appealing solution for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device screening and for improved understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.

Title: Bipartite entanglement extracted from multimode squeezed light generated in lossy waveguides
Authors: Denis A. Kopylov, Torsten Meier, Polina R. Sharapova
Abstract: Entangled two-mode Gaussian states constitute an important building block for continuous variable quantum computing and communication protocols and are thus of high demand for many experiments. In this work, we study such kind of states which are extracted from multimode light generated via type-II parametric down-conversion (PDC) in lossy waveguides. For such states, we demonstrate that the squeezing quantifies entanglement and we construct a measurement basis which results in the maximal bipartite entanglement. We illustrate our findings by numerically solving the spatial master equation for PDC in a Markovian environment. The optimal measurement modes are compared with two widely-used broadband bases: the Mercer-Wolf basis (the first-order coherence basis) and the Williamson-Euler basis.

Abstract: Quantumness imposes a fundamental limit on measurement accuracy. The paradigmatic cases are Heisenberg's uncertainty relation in the original formulation, Robertson's formulation, and improved uncertainty relations. However, the more universal measures are given in terms of quantum entropies. Uncertainties of measurements done on one quantum system correlated with another quantum system constitute a more intriguing question. Quantum correlations can influence the lower bound of uncertainties, and the reason for this is the quantum memory. In this article, we study uncertainties of measurements performed on one quantum dot correlated with the second one through the superconductor, hosting the Majorana boundary modes. We prove that the Majorana quasiparticles allow the uncertainties to reach the minimal possible lower bound. By rigorous theoretical considerations, we obtain the result of experimental relevance expressed in terms of only two parameters: the overlap between Majorana modes and their coupling strength with the quantum dots. We show that the overlap between Majorana modes reduces quantum uncertainties, which is a general result of fundamental importance. We also propose the protocol to measure spins in both quantum dots, consecutively, and demonstrate that the result of the second measurement would depend on the presence of Majorana quasiparticles. This could serve as an indirect tool for their empirical observation, which is of importance for the ongoing discussions concerning unambiguous detection of the Majorana quasiparticles in nanoscopic hybrid structures.

Title: K-ADAPT-VQE: Optimizing Molecular Ground State Searches by Chunking Operators
Authors: Tatiana Bespalova, Oumaya Ladhari, Guido Masella
Abstract: Classical simulation of molecular systems is limited by exponential scaling, a hurdle quantum algorithms like Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) aim to overcome. Although ADAPT-VQE enhances VQEs by dynamically building ansätze, it can remain computationally intensive. This work presents K-ADAPT-VQE, which improves efficiency by adding operators in chunks of K at each iteration. Our results from simulating small molecular systems show that K-ADAPT-VQE substantially reduces the total number of VQE iterations and quantum function calls required to achieve chemical accuracy in molecular ground state calculations.

Authors: Jae-Weon Lee, Zae Young Kim
Abstract: We explore a potential connection between the black hole information paradox and the double descent phenomenon in quantum machine learning. Information retrieval from Hawking radiation can be viewed through the lens of quantum linear regression over black hole microstates, with the Page time corresponding to the interpolation threshold, beyond which test error decreases despite overparameterization. Using the Marchenko-Pastur law, we derive the variance in test error for the quantum linear regression problem and show that the transition across the Page time is associated with a change in the rank structure of subsystems. This observation suggests a conceptual parallel between black hole physics and machine learning that may provide new perspectives for both fields.

Title: Multi-Qubit Parity Gates for Rydberg Atoms in Various Configurations
Authors: Javad Kazemi, Michael Schuler, Christian Ertler, Wolfgang Lechner
Abstract: We present a native approach for realizing multi-qubit parity phase gates in neutral atom systems through global phase modulation of a Rydberg excitation laser. By shaping the temporal profile of the laser's phase, we enable high fidelity, time efficient entangling operations between multiple qubits without requiring individual qubit addressing. To mitigate intrinsic noise sources including spontaneous decay and motional effects, we develop a noise-aware optimal control framework that reduces gate errors under the presence of noise while maintaining smooth pulse profiles suitable for experimental implementation. In addition to equidistant qubit arrangements, we explore the impact of non-equidistant atomic configurations, where interaction inhomogeneity becomes significant. In these cases, the flexibility of our control approach helps to compensate for such variations, supporting reliable gate performance across different spatial layouts. These results facilitate the practical implementation of complex, multi-qubit quantum operations in near-term neutral atom quantum processors.

Title: Accidental coincidences in camera-based high-dimensional entanglement certification

Abstract: High-dimensional entangled states, such as spatially-entangled photon pairs produced by Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), are a key resource for quantum technologies. In recent years, camera-based coincidence counting approaches have considerably improved the ability to characterize them in terms of speed and dimensionality. However, these methods have limitations, including in most of them the necessity to subtract accidental coincidences. Here, we study the role of these accidentals in entanglement certification for a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array and an intensified time-stamping (Tpx3Cam) camera. Using both Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) and entropy-based criteria, we show that the level of accidental coincidences - determined by the temporal characteristics of the camera - and whether they are subtracted critically impact entanglement certification. In particular, we demonstrate that current single-photon camera technologies enable entanglement certification without accidental subtraction only if a Gaussian approximation is applied to the measured two-photon state. Our work is important for developing quantum-optics application in adversarial scenarios, such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD), and also for loophole-free experimental testing of quantum foundations.

Title: Quantifying imaginarity of quantum operations
Authors: Chuanfa Wu, Zhaoqi Wu
Abstract: Complex numbers are theoretically proved and experimentally confirmed as necessary in quantum mechanics and quantum information, and a resource theory of imaginarity of quantum states has been established. In this work, we establish a framework to quantify the imaginarity of quantum operations from the perspective of the ability to create or detect imaginarity, following the idea by Theurer {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{122}, 190405 (2019)] used in coherence theory. We present two types of imaginarity measures of quantum operations based on the norm and the weight, investigate their properties and relations, and derive the analytical formulas of the measure under the trace norm for qubit unitary operations. The results provide new insights into imaginarity of operations and deepen our understanding of dynamical imaginarity.

Title: Upper Bound on Quantum Fisher Information in Pseudo-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Ievgen I. Arkhipov, F. Nori, Ş. K. Özdemir
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have attracted considerable interest over the last few decades due to their unique spectral and dynamical properties not encountered in Hermitian counterparts. An intensely debated question is whether non-Hermitian systems, described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra, can offer enhanced sensitivity for parameter estimation when they are operated at or close to exceptional points. However, much of the current analysis and conclusions are based on mathematical formalism developed for Hermitian quantum systems, which is questionable when applied to pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose Hilbert space is intrinsically curved. Here, we develop a covariant formulation of quantum Fisher information (QFI) defined on the curved Hilbert space of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This covariant framework ensures the preservation of the state norm and enables a consistent treatment of parameter sensitivity. We further show that the covariant QFI of pseudo-Hermitian systems can be mapped to the ordinary QFI of corresponding Hermitian systems, and establish conditions when they become dual to each other, thus revealing a deeper geometric connection between the two. Importantly, this correspondence naturally imposes an upper bound on the covariant QFI and identifies the criteria under which quantum sensing in pseudo-Hermitian systems can exhibit supremacy over Hermitian ones.

Abstract: In this contribution, we describe the status of our experiment aimed at measuring the gravitationally induced phase shift on path-entangled photons. We use a kilometer-scale fiber interferometer whose arms are vertically displaced in the Earth gravitational potential, allowing photons propagating at different heights to accumulate different phases. To date, this is the first experiment to measure this effect on massless particles, thereby experimentally combining general relativity and quantum mechanics.

Title: Device Independent Quantum Key Activation
Authors: Bora Ulu, Nicolas Brunner, Mirjam Weilenmann
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) allows two distant parties to establish a secret key, based only on the observed Bell nonlocal distribution. It remains however, unclear what the minimal resources for enabling DIQKD are and how to maximize the key rate from a given distribution. In the present work, we consider a scenario where several copies of a given quantum distribution are jointly processed via a local and classical wiring operation. We find that, under few assumptions, it is possible to activate device-independent key. That is, starting from a distribution that is useless in a DIQKD protocol, we obtain a positive key rate by wiring several copies together. We coin this effect device-independent key activation. Our analysis focuses on the standard DIQKD protocol with one-way post-processing, and we resort to semi-definite programming techniques for computing lower bounds on the key rate.

Title: Uncertainty relations for unified ($α$,$β$)-relative entropy of coherence under mutually unbiased equiangular tight frames
Authors: Baolong Cheng, Zhaoqi Wu
Abstract: Uncertainty relations based on quantum coherence is an important problem in quantum information science. We discuss uncertainty relations for averaged unified ($\alpha$,$\beta$)-relative entropy of coherence under mutually unbiased equiangular tight frames, and derive an interesting result for different parameters. As consequences, we obtain corresponding results under mutually unbiased bases, equiangular tight frames or based on Tsallis $\alpha$- relative entropies and Rényi-$\alpha$ relative entropies. We illustrate the derived inequalities by explicit examples in two dimensional spaces, showing that the lower bounds can be regarded as good approximations to averaged coherence quantifiers under certain circumstances.

Title: Wasserstein Distances on Quantum Structures: an Overview
Authors: Emily Beatty
Abstract: The theory of optimal transport of probability measures has wide-ranging applications across a number of different fields, including concentration of measure, machine learning, Markov chains, and economics. The generalisation of optimal transport tools from probability measures to quantum states has shown great promise over the last few years, particularly in the development of the theory of Wasserstein-style distances and divergences between quantum states. Such distances have already led to a broad range of developments in the quantum setting such as functional inequalities, convergence of solutions in many-body physics, improvements to quantum generative adversarial networks, and more. However, the literature in this field is quite scattered, with very few links between different works and no real consensus on a `true' quantum Wasserstein distance. The aim of this review is to bring these works together under one roof and give a full overview of the state of the art in the development of quantum Wasserstein distances. We also present a variety of open problems and unexplored avenues in the field, and examine the future directions of this promising line of research. This review is written for those interested in quantum optimal transport in coming from both the fields of classical optimal transport and of quantum information theory, and as a resource for those working in one area of quantum optimal transport interested in how existing work may relate to their own.

Title: Two imaginarity monotones induced by unified $(α,β)$-relative entropy
Authors: Chuanfa Wu, Zhaoqi Wu
Abstract: Complex numbers play a pivotal role in both mathematics and physics, particularly in quantum mechanics, and are extensively utilized to depict the behavior of microscopic particles. Recognizing the significance of complex numbers, a framework of imaginarity resource theory has recently been established. In this work, we propose two types of imaginarity monotones induced by the unified $(\alpha,\beta)$-relative entropy and investigate their properties. Moreover, we give explicit examples to illustrate our results.

Title: Multi-FPGA Synchronization and Data Communication for Quantum Control and Measurement
Authors: Yilun Xu, Abhi D. Rajagopala, Neelay Fruitwala, Gang Huang
Abstract: In the last decade, quantum computing has grown from novel physics experiments with a few qubits to commercial systems with hundreds of qubits. As quantum computers continue to grow in qubit count, the classical control systems must scale correspondingly. While a few expensive multi-board commercial solutions exist, most open-source solutions are limited to single-board radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC). The essential requirements for a multi-board solution are clock synchronization among multiple boards and the ability to transfer data with low latency for performing real-time feedback. In this work, we design a clock synchronization framework to distribute deterministic clock and synchronize the clock counters across multiple RFSoC boards to generate time-aligned radio frequency (RF) pulses used to control qubits. We also develop a data communication system over a fiber link to transfer quantum measurement data among multiple field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This clock synchronization and data communication module has been integrated into the open-source quantum control system, QubiC, to enable the execution of quantum algorithms across multiple boards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design through bench tests with a room-temperature qubit readout emulator.

Title: Rydberg atom arrays as quantum simulators for molecular dynamics
Authors: Simon Euchner, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezer arrays combine vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom which can be coupled and manipulated at a microscopic level. This opens opportunities for the quantum simulation of artificial molecular systems and offers in particular a platform for probing complex vibronic dynamics in controlled settings with increasing complexity. Tailored interatomic interactions and electron-phonon couplings yield handles for designing electronic state manifolds, for studying structural transitions, and for exploring non-classical vibrational states near molecular instabilities. Furthermore, this quantum simulator opens opportunities for testing and quantifying the validity of fundamental concepts, such as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and quantum corrections to it.

Title: Experimental observation of subabsorption
Authors: D. C. Gold, U. Saglam, S. Carpenter, A. Yadav, M. Beede, T. G. Walker, M. Saffman, D. D. Yavuz
Abstract: We predict and experimentally demonstrate a new type of collective (cooperative) coupling effect where a disordered atomic ensemble absorbs light with a rise-time longer (i. e., at a rate slower) than what is dictated by single-atom physics. This effect, which we name subabsorption, can be viewed as the absorptive analog of subradiance. The experiment is performed using a dilute ensemble of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms with a low optical depth, and time-resolving the absorption of a weak (tens of photons per pulse) resonant laser beam. In this dilute regime, the collective interaction relies on establishing dipole-dipole correlations over many atoms; i.e., the interaction is not dominated by the nearest neighbors. As a result, subabsorption is highly susceptible to motional dephasing: even a temperature increase of 60 $\mu$K is enough to completely extinguish the subabsorption signal. We also present a theoretical model whose results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental observations. The model uses density-dependent dephasing rate of the long-range dipole-dipole correlations as a single adjustable parameter. Experiment-theory comparison indicates a dephasing coefficient of $\beta/2 \pi = 4.9 \times 10^{-5}$ Hz~cm$^3$, which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the known dipole-dipole line broadening coefficient in $^{87}$Rb.

Title: Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum
Authors: Bin-Bin Mao, Zhe Wang, Bin-Bin Chen, Zheng Yan
Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.

Title: Entanglement structure for finite system under dual-unitary dynamics
Authors: Gaurav Rudra Malik, Rohit Kumar Shukla, Sudhanva Joshi, S. Aravinda, Sunil Kumar Mishra
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum many-body systems in the chaotic regime are of particular interest due to the associated phenomena of information scrambling and entanglement generation within the system. While these systems are typically intractable using traditional numerical methods, an effective framework can be implemented based on dual-unitary circuits which have emerged as a minimal model for maximally chaotic dynamics. In this work, we investigate how individual two-body operators influence the global dynamics of circuits composed of dual-unitaries. We study their effect on entanglement generation while examining it from both bipartite and multipartite perspectives. Here we also highlight the significant role of local unitaries in the dynamics when paired with operators from the dual-unitary class, showing that systems with identical entangling power can exhibit a range of differing entanglement growth rates. Furthermore, we present calculations establishing time-step-dependent lower bounds, which depend on both the initial state and the entangling power of the constituent operators. Finally, we find that time-evolving an initial state composed of pair products generates a state with nearly maximal multipartite entanglement content, approaching the bounds established by Absolutely Maximally Entangled (AME) states.

A. Norcia
Abstract: Quantum processors based on neutral atoms trapped in arrays of optical tweezers have appealing properties, including relatively easy qubit number scaling and the ability to engineer arbitrary gate connectivity with atom movement. However, these platforms are inherently prone to atom loss, and the ability to replace lost atoms during a quantum computation is an important but previously elusive capability. Here, we demonstrate the ability to measure and re-initialize, and if necessary replace, a subset of atoms while maintaining coherence in other atoms. This allows us to perform logical circuits that include single and two-qubit gates as well as repeated midcircuit measurement while compensating for atom loss. We highlight this capability by performing up to 41 rounds of syndrome extraction in a repetition code, and combine midcircuit measurement and atom replacement with real-time conditional branching to demonstrate heralded state preparation of a logically encoded Bell state. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to replenish atoms in a tweezer array from an atomic beam while maintaining coherence of existing atoms -- a key step towards execution of logical computations that last longer than the lifetime of an atom in the system.

Title: Certifying asymmetry in the configuration of three qubits
Authors: Abdelmalek Taoutioui, Gábor Drótos, Tamás Vértesi
Abstract: We certify asymmetry in the configuration of the Bloch vectors of a set of three unknown qubit states within the dimensionally bounded prepare-and-measure scenario. To do this, we construct a linear witness from three simpler witnesses as building blocks, each featuring, along with two binary measurement settings, three preparations; two of them are associated with the certification task, while the third one serves as an auxiliary. The final witness is chosen to self-test some target configuration. We numerically derive a bound $Q_{\text{mirror}}$ for any mirror-symmetric configuration, thereby certifying asymmetry if this bound is exceeded (e.g. experimentally) for the unknown qubit configuration. We also consider the gap $(Q_{\text{max}}-Q_{\text{mirror}})$ between the analytically derived overall quantum maximum $Q_{\text{max}}$ and the mirror-symmetric bound, and use it as a quantifier of asymmetry in the target configuration. Numerical optimization shows that the most asymmetric configuration then forms a right scalene triangle on the unit Bloch sphere. Finally, we implement our protocol on a public quantum processor, where a clear violation of the mirror-symmetric bound certifies asymmetry in the configuration of our experimental triple of qubit states.

Title: Refining ensemble $N$-representability of one-body density matrices from partial information
Authors: Julia Liebert, Anna O. Schouten, Irma Avdic, Christian Schilling, David A. Mazziotti
Abstract: The $N$-representability problem places fundamental constraints on reduced density matrices (RDMs) that originate from physical many-fermion quantum states. Motivated by recent developments in functional theories, we introduce a hierarchy of ensemble one-body $N$-representability problems that incorporate partial knowledge of the one-body reduced density matrices (1RDMs) within an ensemble of $N$-fermion states with fixed weights $w_i$. Specifically, we propose a systematic relaxation that reduces the refined problem -- where full 1RDMs are fixed for certain ensemble elements -- to a more tractable form involving only natural occupation number vectors. Remarkably, we show that this relaxed problem is related to a generalization of Horn's problem, enabling an explicit solution by combining its constraints with those of the weighted ensemble $N$-representability conditions. An additional convex relaxation yields a convex polytope that provides physically meaningful restrictions on lattice site occupations in ensemble density functional theory for excited states.

Title: Quantum block Krylov subspace projector algorithm for computing low-lying eigenenergies
Authors: Maria Gabriela Jordão Oliveira, Nina Glaser
Abstract: Determining eigenvalues is a computationally expensive task that is crucial for countless applications in natural sciences. Toward this end, we introduce the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm, a multireference quantum variant of the Lanczos algorithm designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenvalues, including degenerate states. We present three different compact quantum circuits to evaluate the required expectation values, each suited to different problem settings. To investigate the impact of the number and fidelity of the initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. The results demonstrate that using multiple initial reference states improves the convergence of the algorithm, especially in realistic precision-limited simulations and in cases where a single reference fails to simultaneously retrieve all desired eigenvalues. Furthermore, the QBKSP algorithm enables the computation of degenerate eigenstates and respective multiplicity by imposing appropriate convergence criteria.

Title: Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators
Authors: Fabian Pichler, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moiré materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.

Title: GPa Pressure Imaging Using Nanodiamond Quantum Sensors
Authors: Ryotaro Suda, Kenshin Uriu, Kouki Yamamoto, Misaki Sasaki, Kento Sasaki, Mari Einaga, Katsuya Shimizu, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: We demonstrate wide-field optical microscopy of the pressure distribution at approximately 20 GPa in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) as quantum sensors. Pressure and non-hydrostaticity maps are obtained by fitting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra with models incorporating hydrostatic and uniaxial stress conditions. Two methods for introducing NDs with a pressure-transmitting medium are compared, revealing that the embedding approach affects the degree of non-hydrostaticity. This ND-based technique offers a powerful imaging platform for probing pressure-induced phenomena and is extendable to other physical quantities such as magnetic fields.

Title: MetaTT: A Global Tensor-Train Adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
Authors: Javier Lopez-Piqueres, Pranav Deshpande, Archan Ray, Mattia J. Villani, Marco Pistoia, Niraj Kumar
Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines -- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the core tensor.

Title: Unification of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in a Highly Tunable Magnon-Photon Dimer
Authors: Alexander S. Carney, Juan S. Salcedo-Gallo, Salil K. Bedkihal, Mattias Fitzpatrick
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.

Title: (2+1)d Lattice Models and Tensor Networks for Gapped Phases with Categorical Symmetry
Authors: Kansei Inamura, Sheng-Jie Huang, Apoorv Tiwari, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider ``All boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.

Title: Droplet-gas phases and their dynamical formation in particle imbalanced mixtures
Authors: Jose Carlos Pelayo, George A. Bougas, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Simeon I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We explore the ground state phase diagram and nonequilibrium dynamics of genuine two-component particle-imbalanced droplets in both isotropic and anisotropic three-dimensional confinements. A gradual transition from mixed droplet-gas to gas configurations is revealed as the average intercomponent attraction decreases or the transverse confinement becomes tighter. Within the mixed structures, a specific majority fragment binds to the minority droplet, satisfying the density ratio locking condition, while the remaining atoms are in a gas state. Our extended Gross-Pitaevskii numerical results are corroborated by a suitable variational approximation capturing the shape and characteristics of droplet-gas fragments. The tunability of the relatively low gas fraction is showcased through parametric variations of the atom number, the intercomponent imbalance, the trap aspect ratio, or the radius of a box potential. To validate the existence and probe the properties of these exotic phases, we simulate the standard time-of-flight and radio frequency experimental techniques. These allow to dynamically identify the resilience of the droplet fragment and the expansion of the gas fraction. Our results, amenable to current experimental cold atom settings, are expected to guide forthcoming investigations aiming to reveal unseen out-of-equilibrium droplet dynamics.

Title: Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Synthetic Magnetic Field with Tunable Orientation
Authors: Fengtao Pang, Huaxin He, Yongping Zhang, Chunlei Qu
Abstract: We systematically investigate the ground state and dynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates subject to a position-dependent detuning. This detuning induces three related quantities-a synthetic magnetic field, an angular velocity, and an angular momentum-which, due to trap anisotropy, may point in different directions. When the dipole frequencies along the three symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling controllable Foucault-like precession or bi-conical trajectories depending on the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of the synthetic magnetic field and the excitations of the collective mode in quantum fluids, providing a foundation for future developments in quantum simulation and high-precision sensing technologies.

Title: QuGrav: Bringing gravitational waves to light with Qumodes
Authors: Dmitri E. Kharzeev, Azadeh Maleknejad, Saba Shalamberidze
Abstract: We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound. With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.

Title: Hybrid Classical-Quantum Sampling for Lattice Scalar Field Theory
Authors: Hee-Cheol Kim, Jangho Kim
Abstract: We investigate lattice scalar field theory in two-dimensional Euclidean space via a quantum annealer. To accommodate the quartic interaction terms, we introduce three schemes for rewriting them as quadratic polynomials through the use of auxiliary qubits. These methods are applied on D-Wave quantum annealer, and their effectiveness is assessed by examining the annealer-generated distributions. Using these distributions, we perform Monte Carlo sampling via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and compare the outcomes with those from classical Metropolis simulations.

Title: Dynamic structure factor of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Subhanka Mal, Anushree Dey, Kingshuk Adikary, Bimalendu Deb
Abstract: Dynamic structure factor (DSF) is important for understanding excitations in many-body physics; it reveals information about the spectral and spatial correlations of fluctuations in quantum systems. Collective phenomena like quantum phase transitions of ultracold atoms are addressed by harnessing density fluctuations. Here, we calculate the DSF of a nonequilibrium spinless Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) from the perspective of dissipative phase transition (DPT) in a steady state. Our methodology uses a homogeneous mean-field approximation to make the single-site hierarchy simpler and applies the Lindbladian perturbation method (LPM) to go beyond the single site, limited by the ratio of the inter-site hopping term to the Liouvillian gap as a small parameter. Our results show that the DSF near a DPT point is characteristically different from that away from the transition point, providing a clear density spectral signature of the DPT. In addition to comparing the two numerical frameworks, the mean-field results serve as a benchmark for proof-of-principle robustness of LPM. Despite the numerical difficulty, our methodology provides a computationally accessible route for studying density fluctuations in an open lattice quantum system without requiring large-scale computation.

Abstract: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is a strong and readily accessible optical nonlinearity enabling a wide array of applications and research directions. For instance, the three-wave mixing process has been employed to great success for narrow-linewidth lasers, sensing applications, microscopy, and signal processing. While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation, there is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering mechanism's significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at low temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in standard single-mode telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne detection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK to 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid helium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin temperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interaction with microscopic defects of the amorphous material - two-level-systems (TLS) - which has not been previously observed in optical fiber. The measured behaviour of the linewidth with temperature is in agreement with well-established models of ultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic scattering, thermally-activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS interaction. This work provides a foundation for a wide range of applications and further research including sensing applications, new approaches to investigate TLS physics, and Brillouin-scattering-based quantum science and technology.

Title: Photo-induced directional transport in extended SSH chains
Authors: Usham Harish Kumar Singha, Kallol Mondal, Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-Büttiker framework.

Title: Anomalous slow-down of the bound state dynamics in a non-locally coupled quantum circuit
Authors: Biswajit Paul, Suman Mondal, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: Additional hopping channels in a tight-binding lattice is known to introduce faster dynamics of a quantum mechanical particle. However, we show that in the case of a repulsively bound state, the dynamics becomes abnormally slow when next-nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping is allowed for the particles. We show that such slowing down occurs for some magic strength of the NNN hopping at which the bound state band exhibits a quasi-flatband feature. We reveal this anomalous dynamical behavior by analyzing the quench dynamics of two nearest neighbor (NN) spin excitations (magnons) on a ferromagnetic chain by allowing both NN and NNN couplings. By implementing digital quantum computing simulations on a NISQ device, we obtain such non-trivial signatures and complement the results with exact numerical calculations. Moreover, through perturbative arguments, we reveal that the slowing down is due to the destructive interference between different paths associated to the bound state dynamics.

Title: Guided Graph Compression for Quantum Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Mikel Casals, Vasilis Belis, Elias F. Combarro, Eduard Alarcón, Sofia Vallecorsa, Michele Grossi
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

Title: Dynamic Hypergraph Partitioning of Quantum Circuits with Hybrid Execution
Authors: Shane Sweeney, Krishnendu Guha
Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for a range of computational problems. The fundamental mechanisms underlying quantum computation required the development and construction of quantum computers. These devices are referred to as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices. Not only are NISQ devices extremely limited in their qubit count but they also suffer from noise during computation and this problem only gets worse as the size of the circuit increases which limits the practical use of quantum computers for modern day applications. This paper will focus on utilizing quantum circuit partitioning to overcome the inherent issues of NISQ devices. Partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits has allowed for the execution of quantum circuits that are too large to fit on one quantum device. There have been many previous approaches to quantum circuit partitioning and each of these approaches differ in how they work with some focusing on hardware-aware partitioning, optimal graph-based partitioning, multi-processor architectures and many more. These approaches achieve success in their objective but they often fail to scale well which impacts cost and noise. The ultimate goal of this paper is to mitigate these issues by minimizing 3 important metrics; noise, time and cost. To achieve this we use dynamic partitioning for practical circuit cutting and we take advantage of the benefits of hybrid execution where classical computation will be used alongside quantum hardware. This approach has proved to be beneficial with respect to noise with classical execution enabling a 42.30% reduction in noise and a 40% reduction in the number of qubits required in cases where a mixture of classical and quantum computation were required.

Title: Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum States with Single-Copy Measurements
Authors: Angus Lowe, Ashwin Nayak
Abstract: We study the problems of quantum tomography and shadow tomography using measurements performed on individual, identical copies of an unknown $d$-dimensional state. We first revisit a known lower bound due to Haah et al. (2017) on quantum tomography with accuracy $\epsilon$ in trace distance, when the measurements choices are independent of previously observed outcomes (i.e., they are nonadaptive). We give a succinct proof of this result. This leads to stronger lower bounds when the learner uses measurements with a constant number of outcomes. In particular, this rigorously establishes the optimality of the folklore ``Pauli tomography" algorithm in terms of its sample complexity. We also derive novel bounds of $\Omega(r^2 d/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(r^2 d^2/\epsilon^2)$ for learning rank $r$ states using arbitrary and constant-outcome measurements, respectively, in the nonadaptive case. In addition to the sample complexity, a resource of practical significance for learning quantum states is the number of different measurements used by an algorithm. We extend our lower bounds to the case where the learner performs possibly adaptive measurements from a fixed set of $\exp(O(d))$ measurements. This implies in particular that adaptivity does not give us any advantage using single-copy measurements that are efficiently implementable. We also obtain a similar bound in the case where the goal is to predict the expectation values of a given sequence of observables, a task known as shadow tomography. Finally, in the case of adaptive, single-copy measurements implementable with polynomial-size circuits, we prove that a straightforward strategy based on computing sample means of the given observables is optimal.

Title: Leggett-Garg inequalities for multitime processes
Authors: Zhiqiang Huang, Xiao-Kan Guo
Abstract: We study some aspects of the Leggett-Garg inequalities by using the operator-state formalism for multitime processes. The process tensor in its Choi-state form, which we call process state, is employed to investigate the Leggett-Garg inequalities and their violations. We find the sufficient conditions on process states for the Leggett-Garg inequalities to hold, based on which we find a new way of characterizing the influences on the violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities through the structure of process states.

Title: Lower bounds on the number of rounds of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm required for guaranteed approximation ratios
Authors: Naphan Benchasattabuse, Andreas Bärtschi, Luis Pedro García-Pintos, John Golden, Nathan Lemons, Stephan Eidenbenz
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm, also known in its generalization as the quantum alternating operator ansatz, (QAOA) is a heuristic hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding high-quality approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, such as maximum satisfiability. While the QAOA is well studied, theoretical results as to its runtime or approximation ratio guarantees are still relatively sparse. We provide some of the first lower bounds for the number of rounds (the dominant component of QAOA runtimes) required for the QAOA. For our main result, we (i) leverage a connection between quantum annealing times and the angles of the QAOA to derive a lower bound on the number of rounds of the QAOA with respect to the guaranteed approximation ratio. We apply and calculate this bound with Grover-style mixing unitaries and (ii) show that this type of QAOA requires at least a polynomial number of rounds to guarantee any constant approximation ratios for most problems. We also (iii) show that the bound depends only on the statistical values of the objective functions, and when the problem can be modeled as a $k$-local Hamiltonian, can be easily estimated from the coefficients of the Hamiltonians. For the conventional transverse-field mixer, (iv) our framework gives a trivial lower bound to all bounded-occurrence local cost problems and for all strictly $k$-local cost Hamiltonians matching known results that constant approximation ratio is obtainable with a constant-round QAOA for a few optimization problems from these classes. Using our proof framework, (v) we recover the Grover lower bound for unstructured search and, with small modification, show that our bound applies to any QAOA-style search protocol that starts in the ground state of the mixing unitaries.

Title: Accurate neural quantum states for interacting lattice bosons
Authors: Zakari Denis, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: In recent years, neural quantum states have emerged as a powerful variational approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy when representing the ground-state wave function of a great variety of quantum many-body systems, including spin lattices, interacting fermions or continuous-variable systems. However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength. We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\times}20$ while achieving the best variational energies reported for this model. This enables us to investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy across the superfluid-to-Mott quantum phase transition, a quantity hard to extract with non-variational approaches.

Title: Hybrid Quantum Algorithm for Simulating Real-Time Thermal Correlation Functions
Authors: Elliot C. Eklund, Nandini Ananth
Abstract: We present a hybrid Path Integral Monte Carlo (hPIMC) algorithm to calculate real-time quantum thermal correlation functions and demonstrate its application to open quantum systems. The hPIMC algorithm leverages the successes of classical PIMC as a computational tool for high-dimensional system studies by exactly simulating dissipation using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional on a classical computer. We achieve a quantum speed-up over the classical algorithm by computing short-time matrix elements of the quantum propagator on a quantum computer. We show that the component of imaginary-time evolution can be performed accurately using the recently developed Probabilistic Imaginary-Time Evolution (PITE) algorithm, and we introduce a novel low-depth circuit for approximate real-time evolution under the kinetic energy operator using a Discrete Variable Representation (DVR). We test the accuracy of the approximation by computing the position-position thermal correlation function of a proton transfer reaction.

Title: Distinguishing Graph States by the Properties of Their Marginals
Authors: Lina Vandré, Jarn de Jong, Frederik Hahn, Adam Burchardt, Otfried Gühne, Anna Pappa
Abstract: Graph states are a class of multi-partite entangled quantum states that are ubiquitous in quantum information. We study equivalence relations between graph states under local unitaries (LU) to obtain distinguishing methods both in local and in networked settings. Based on the marginal structure of graph states, we introduce a family of easy-to-compute LU-invariants. We show that these invariants uniquely identify the entanglement classes of every graph state up to 8 qubits and discuss their reliability for larger numbers of qubits. To handle larger graphs, we generalize tools to test for local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states that work by condensing large graphs into smaller graphs. In turn, we show that statements on the equivalence of these smaller graphs (which are easier to compute) can be used to infer statements on the equivalence of the original, larger graphs. We analyze LU-equivalence in two key settings - with and without allowing for the permutation of qubits. We identify entanglement classes, whose marginal structure does not allow us to distinguish them. As a result, we increase the bound on the number of qubits where the LU-LC conjecture holds from 8 to 10 qubits in the setting where qubit permutations are allowed.

Title: Repeater-like asynchronous measurement-device-independent quantum conference key agreement
Authors: Yu-Shuo Lu, Hua-Lei Yin, Yuan-Mei Xie, Yao Fu, Zeng-Bing Chen
Abstract: Quantum conference key agreement enables secure communication among multiple parties by leveraging multipartite entanglement, which is expected to play a crucial role in future quantum networks. However, its practical implementation has been severely limited by the experimental complexity and low efficiency associated with the requirement for synchronous detection of multipartite entangled states. In this work, we propose a measurement-device-independent quantum conference key agreement protocol that employs asynchronous Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state measurement. Our protocol enables a linear scaling of the conference key rate among multiple parties, demonstrating performance comparable to that of the single-repeater scheme in quantum networks. Additionally, we achieve intercity transmission distances with composable security under finite-key conditions. By adopting the generalized asynchronous pairing strategy, our approach eliminates the need for complex global phase locking techniques. Furthermore, by integrating asynchronous pairing with ring-interference network structure, our method provides insights for various quantum tasks beyond quantum communication, including multiparty computing and quantum repeaters.

Title: Imaging-based Quantum Optomechanics
Authors: Christian M. Pluchar, Wenhua He, Jack Manley, Nicolas Deshler, Saikat Guha, Dalziel J. Wilson
Abstract: In active imaging protocols, information about an object is encoded into the spatial mode of a scattered photon. Recently the quantum limits of active imaging have been explored with levitated nanoparticles, which experience a multimode radiation pressure backaction (the photon recoil force) due to radiative scattering of the probe field. Here we extend the analysis of multimode backaction to compliant surfaces, accessing a broad class of mechanical resonators and fruitful analogies to quantum imaging. As an example, we consider imaging of the flexural modes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its surface. We show that backaction in this setting can be understood to arise from spatiotemporal photon shot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We also derive the imprecision-backaction product in the limit of purely spatial (intermodal) coupling, revealing it to be equivalent to the standard quantum limit for single-mode optomechanical coupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatiotemporal backaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light, providing a mechanism for entangling desired pairs of spatial modes. In conjunction with high-Q nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks enhanced by spatial mode entanglement.

Title: Uncertain Quantum Critical Metrology: From Single to Multi Parameter Sensing
Authors: George Mihailescu, Steve Campbell, Karol Gietka
Abstract: Critical quantum metrology relies on the extreme sensitivity of a system's eigenstates near the critical point of a quantum phase transition to Hamiltonian perturbations. This means that these eigenstates are extremely sensitive to all the parameters of the Hamiltonian. In realistic settings, there is always some degree of uncertainty in the control parameters used to tune the system to criticality. These uncertainties, while not the target of estimation, can significantly affect the attainable precision, effectively acting as nuisance parameters in the estimation process. Despite being a practically relevant source of noise, their impact on critical metrology has been largely overlooked. In this work we present a general framework that interpolates between single- and multiparameter estimation settings, enabling a systematic analysis of how such uncertainties influence sensitivity. We apply this framework to the paradigmatic transverse field Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, explicitly demonstrating how uncertainty in control parameters affects the metrological performance of critical sensors. For finite-size systems, we identify a fundamental trade-off between robustness to uncertainty and the ability to retain a quantum advantage at the critical point. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the practical limitations of critical quantum metrology and provide a route toward its more resilient implementation.

Title: Decoherence Cancellation through Noise Interference
Authors: Giuseppe D'Auria, Giovanna Morigi, Fabio Anselmi, Fabio Benatti
Abstract: We propose a novel, feedback-free method to cancel the effects of decoherence in the dynamics of open quantum systems subject to dephasing. The protocol makes use of the coupling with an auxiliary system when they are both subject to the same noisy dynamics, in such a way that their interaction leads to cancellation of the noise on the system itself. This requires tuning the strength of the coupling between main and auxiliary systems as well as the ability to prepare the auxiliary system in a Fock state, which solely depends on the coupling strength. We investigate the protocol's efficiency to protect NOON states against dephasing in setups such as tweezers arrays of cold atoms. We show that the protocol's efficiency is robust against fluctuations of the optimal parameters and, remarkably, that it is independent of the temporal noise features. Therefore, it can be applied to cancel both Markovian and non-Markovian noise effects, in the regime where error-correction protocols become inefficient.

Title: Space-time correlations in monitored kinetically constrained discrete-time quantum dynamics
Authors: Marcel Cech, María Cea, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.

Title: Statistics of topological defects across a phase transition in a digital superconducting quantum processor
Authors: Oriel Kiss, Daniil Teplitskiy, Michele Grossi, Antonio Mandarino
Abstract: When a quantum phase transition is crossed within a finite time, critical slowing down disrupts adiabatic dynamics, resulting in the formation of topological defects. The average density of these defects scales with the quench rate, adhering to a universal power law as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we aim to investigate the counting statistics of kink density in the 1D transverse-field quantum Ising model. We demonstrate on multiple quantum processing units up to 100 qubits, that higher-order cumulants follow a universal power law scaling as a function of the quench time. We also show the breakdown of the KZM for short quenches for finite-size systems. Tensor network simulations corroborate our quantum simulation results for bigger systems not in the asymptotic limit.

Title: Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data
Authors: Stewart Wallace, Yoann Altmann, Brian D. Gerardot, Erik M. Gauger, Cristian Bonato
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.

Title: The Aharonov-Casher Phase: Topological or Geometric?
Authors: Igor Kuzmenko, Y. B. Band, Yshai Avishai
Abstract: It is demonstrated that the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase is a geometric phase that, in general, depends on the details of the closed path taken by a particle with a magnetic moment that is subject to an electric field. Consequently, it is not a topological phase. The proof of this statement is obtained by developing a counterexample that elucidates the dependence of the AC phase on the details of the path. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the particular example considered here, paths having an Abelian AC phase factor, also have an AC phase that is path-independent, whereas paths having a non-Abelian AC phase factor may have an AC phase that is path-dependent (i.e., not topological).

Title: The time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillator: a pedagogical approach via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method
Authors: Stanley S. Coelho, Lucas Queiroz, Danilo T. Alves
Abstract: In quantum mechanics courses, students often solve the Schrödinger equation for the harmonic oscillator with time-independent parameters. However, time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillators are relevant in modeling several problems as, for instance, the description of quantum motion of particles in traps, shortcuts to adiabaticity, generation of squeezed states, as well as quantum scalar fields evolving in expanding universes. In the present paper, we discuss, with a pedagogical approach, the quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method, revisiting the main steps to obtain the wave function associated with this model, and briefly discussing the relation between this oscillator and the generation of squeezed states. As examples of didactic applications of time-dependent harmonic oscillators and the Lewis-Riesenfeld method in quantum mechanics courses, we solve the following problems: the calculation of the transition probability associated with a harmonic oscillator which undergoes jumps in its frequency, and the analysis of the dynamics of a quantum particle in a Paul trap.

Title: Interface-sensitive microwave loss in superconducting tantalum films sputtered on c-plane sapphire
Authors: Anthony P. McFadden, Jinsu Oh, Lin Zhou, Trevyn F.Q. Larson, Stephen Gill, Akash V. Dixit, Raymond Simmonds, Florent Lecocq
Abstract: Quantum coherence in superconducting circuits has increased steadily over the last decades as a result of a growing understanding of the various loss mechanisms. Recently, tantalum (Ta) emerged as a promising material to address microscopic sources of loss found on niobium (Nb) or aluminum (Al) surfaces. However, the effects of film and interface microstructure on low-temperature microwave loss are still not well understood. Here we present a systematic study of the structural and electrical properties of Ta and Nb films sputtered on c-plane sapphire at varying growth temperatures. As growth temperature is increased, our results show that the onset of epitaxial growth of alpha-phase Ta correlates with lower Ta surface roughness, higher critical temperature, and higher residual resistivity ratio, but surprisingly also correlates with a significant increase in loss at microwave frequency. Notably, this high level of loss is not observed in Nb films prepared in the same way and having very similar structure. By experimentally controlling the surface on which the Ta film is nucleated, we determine that the source of loss is only present in samples having an epitaxial Ta/sapphire interface and show that it is apparently mitigated by either growing a thin, epitaxial Nb inter-layer between the Ta film and the substrate or by intentionally treating, and effectively damaging, the sapphire surface with an in-situ argon plasma before Ta growth. In addition to elucidating this interfacial microwave loss, this work provides adequate process details to aid reproducible growth of low-loss Ta films across fabrication facilities.

Title: Perfect state transfer between real pure states
Authors: Chris Godsil, Stephen Kirkland, Hermie Monterde
Abstract: Pure states correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$ represented by unit vectors. In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state $\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real pure state $\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state transfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\tau$, there exists a real symmetric matrix $M$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect state transfer relative to $M$ at time $\tau$. We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that amongst all $n$-vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the Laplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the adjacency matrix.

Title: A polychromatic continuous-variable quantum communication network enabled by optical frequency combs
Authors: Yuehan Xu, Qijun Zhang, Junpeng Zhang, Xiaojuan Liao, Ziyi Shen, Xu Liu, Beibei Zhang, Zicong Tan, Zehao Zhou, Jisheng Dai, Xueqin Jiang, Peng Huang, Tao Wang, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: In classical communication, the introduction of polychromatic resources has rapidly boosted classical networks' rate and scale. Quantum communication is now at a similar critical stage in its development, and therefore, it is essential to investigate polychromatic quantum communication networks. In this letter, we report a polychromatic continuous-variable quantum communication network enabled by optical frequency combs. The multi-mode density matrices constituted by polychromatic quantum networks are studied. Considering the limited mode isolation, the maximum amount of information that eavesdroppers can obtain is recalculated, therefore, the total secret key rate is provided. We have also demonstrated that, compared to other multiplexing techniques, polychromatic quantum networks can theoretically achieve a secret key rate without decreasing with the increase in users. In the experiment, direct-transmission type and round-trip type quantum communication networks were built using optical frequency combs and dual-comb interference detection technology. The Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol has been validated, with a network capacity of 19 and a total secret key rate of 8.75 Gbps at a uniform distance of 5 km (asymptotic case), 0.82 Mbps at 120 km (finite-size effect), 89.10 Mbps at 40 km (compsable security), 13.66 Mbps at 40 km (compsable finite-size security). This implementation not only provides technical support for a high-speed multi-node quantum network, but also provides a solution for the future quantum Internet with continuous variables.

Title: Metrological symmetries in singular quantum multi-parameter estimation
Authors: George Mihailescu, Saubhik Sarkar, Abolfazl Bayat, Steve Campbell, Andrew K. Mitchell
Abstract: The theoretical foundation of quantum sensing is rooted in the Cramér-Rao formalism, which establishes quantitative precision bounds for a given quantum probe. In many practical scenarios, where more than one parameter is unknown, the multi-parameter Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) applies. Since this is a matrix inequality involving the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), the formalism breaks down when the QFIM is singular. In this paper, we examine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result from an over-parametrization on the metrological level. This is itself caused by emergent metrological symmetries, whereby the same set of measurement outcomes are obtained for different combinations of system parameters. Although the number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM eigenvalues, the Cramér-Rao formalism typically does not provide information about the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a series of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights. In particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior distribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of unknown parameters. These lines are contour lines of the effective parameters which, through suitable parameter transformations, can be estimated and follow their own effective CRBs.

Title: Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst
Authors: Heekun Nho, Thomas Connolly, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Spencer Diamond, Charlotte G. L. Bøttcher, Leonid I. Glazman, Michel H. Devoret
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts temporarily degrade qubit coherence which can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allowed us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of a few. This reduction falls several orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.

Title: Partitewise Entanglement
Authors: Yu Guo, Ning Yang
Abstract: It is known that $\rho^{AB}$ as a bipartite reduced state of the 3-qubit GHZ state is separable, but part $A$ and part $B$ are indeed entangled with each other without tracing out part $C$. Namely, whether a state containing entanglement is always dependent on the global system it lives in. We explore here such entanglement in any $n$-partite system with arbitrary dimensions, $n\geqslant3$, and call it partitewise entanglement (PWE) which contains pairwise entanglement (PE) proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 032420(2024)] as a special case. In particular, we investigate the partitewise entanglement extensibility and give a measure of such extensibility, and from which we find that the reduced state of a genuine entangled state could be any mixed state without pure reduced states, and that the maximal partitewise entanglement extension is its purification. We then propose three classes of the partitewise entanglement measures which are based on the genuine entanglement measure, minimal bipartition measure, and the minimal distance from the partitewise separable states, respectively. The former two methods are far-ranging since all of them are defined by the reduced functions. Consequently, we establish the framework of the resource theory of the partitewise entanglement and the genuine partitewise entanglement for which the free states are the states with pure reduced states.

Authors: Heather Leitch, Alastair Kay
Abstract: The discovery of the family of balanced product codes was pivotal in the subsequent development of 'good' low density quantum error correcting codes that have optimal scaling of the key parameters of distance and storage density. We review this family, giving a completely different presentation to the original, minimising the abstraction and technicalities wherever possible. The target audience is anyone familiar with the stabilizer formalism for error correction wanting to understand how parity-check matrices can be constructed for high storage density quantum codes.

Title: The Entropy Characterization of Quantum MDS Codes
Authors: Hua Sun
Abstract: An $[[n,k,d]]$ quantum maximum-distance-separable code maps $k$ source qudits to $n$ coded qudits such that any $n-(d-1)$ coded qudits may recover all source qudits and $n = k + 2 (d-1)$. The entropy of the joint state of the reference system of $k$ qudits and the $n$ coded qudits is fully characterized - the joint state must be pure, i.e., has entropy zero; and any sub-system whose number of qudits is at most half of $k+n$, the total number of qudits in the joint state must be maximally mixed, i.e., has entropy equal to its size.

Abstract: As quantum devices continue to scale, distributed quantum computing emerges as a promising strategy for executing large-scale tasks across modular quantum processors. A central challenge in this paradigm is verifying the correctness of computational outcomes when subcircuits are executed independently following circuit cutting. Here we propose a cross-platform fidelity estimation algorithm tailored for modular architectures. Our method achieves substantial reductions in sample complexity compared to previous approaches designed for single-processor systems. We experimentally implement the protocol on modular superconducting quantum processors with up to 6 qubits to verify the similarity of two 11-qubit GHZ states. Beyond verification, we show that our algorithm enables a federated quantum kernel method that preserves data privacy. As a proof of concept, we apply it to a 5-qubit quantum phase learning task using six 3-qubit modules, successfully extracting phase information with just eight training samples. These results establish a practical path for scalable verification and trustworthy quantum machine learning of modular quantum processors.

Title: Projective error models: Stabilizer codes, Clifford codes, and weak stabilizer codes
Authors: Jonas Eidesen
Abstract: We introduce more general notions of Clifford codes and stabilizer codes, the latter we call weak stabilizer codes. This is all formulated in the language of projective representation theory of finite groups and we give a novel description of the detectable errors for a Clifford code. We give a complete characterization of when a Clifford code is also a weak stabilizer code in the case where the considered error model is a nice error basis. We also give examples of infinite families of non-stabilizer Clifford codes as well as examples of non-Clifford weak stabilizer codes. The latter of these types of examples is a class of codes that have not been studied in the same systematic framework as Clifford codes and stabilizer codes.

Title: The optical Bloch equation for the finite-temperature fluctuations
Authors: Weitao Liu
Abstract: In this work, I analyze the quantum fluctuations and the thermal fluctuations in the framework of quantum mechanics. Being recognized as incoherent perturbations with different features, fluctuations of these two types lead to dissipative terms in the optical Bloch equations. The method allows one to use the optical Bloch equation to analyze time-dependent processes in the finite-temperature fluctuations. The numerical results show that the deexcitation is the limit of the equilibration at zero temperature. The impact of the fluctuations on the coherent excitations are also discussed.

Title: Protein folding with an all-to-all trapped-ion quantum computer
Authors: Sebastián V. Romero, Alejandro Gomez Cadavid, Pavle Nikačević, Enrique Solano, Narendra N. Hegade, Miguel Angel Lopez-Ruiz, Claudio Girotto, Masako Yamada, Panagiotis Kl. Barkoutsos, Ananth Kaushik, Martin Roetteler
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that the bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm, implemented on IonQ's fully connected trapped-ion quantum processors, offers an efficient approach to solving dense higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. Specifically, we tackle protein folding on a tetrahedral lattice for up to 12 amino acids, representing the largest quantum hardware implementations of protein folding problems reported to date. Additionally, we address MAX 4-SAT instances at the computational phase transition and fully connected spin-glass problems using all 36 available qubits. Across all considered cases, our method consistently achieves optimal solutions, highlighting the powerful synergy between non-variational quantum optimization approaches and the intrinsic all-to-all connectivity of trapped-ion architectures. Given the expected scalability of trapped-ion quantum systems, BF-DCQO represents a promising pathway toward practical quantum advantage for dense HUBO problems with significant industrial and scientific relevance.

Title: Network nonlocality with continuous variables: probing nonbilocality through pseudospin measurements
Authors: Sudip Chakrabarty, Amit Kundu, A. S. Majumdar
Abstract: Quantum networks offer a compelling platform for probing nonlocal correlations beyond the Bell scenario. While network nonlocality has been well studied in discrete-variable (DV) systems, its exploration in continuous-variable (CV) systems remains limited. In this work, we study the bilocal scenario, the simplest quantum network, in a CV framework using pseudospin measurements. We show that two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states violate the bilocality inequality for any nonzero squeezing, with the violation increasing monotonically and reaching the maximum in the infinite squeezing limit. The robustness of this violation is explored in the presence of local thermal noise. Next, we demonstrate nonbilocality in two key non-Gaussian states, viz., the entangled coherent state and the CV Werner state. Finally, we investigate the enhancement of nonbilocal correlations through photon subtraction applied to the TMSV state. We show that a coherent superposition of single-photon subtractions across modes enables maximal bilocality violation even at zero squeezing, demonstrating non-Gaussianity as a strong resource in the low-squeezing regime. Our findings underscore the potential of CV systems for realizing network-based quantum correlations.

Title: Universality of Photonic Interlacing Architectures for Learning Discrete Linear Unitaries
Authors: Matthew Markowitz, Mohammad-Ali Miri, Alexey Ovchinnikov, Kevin Zelaya
Abstract: Recent investigations suggest that the discrete linear unitary group $U(N)$ can be represented by interlacing a finite sequence of diagonal phase operations with an intervening unitary operator. However, despite rigorous numerical justifications, no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that elements of $U(N)$ can be decomposed into a sequence of $N$-parameter phases alternating with $1$-parameter propagators of a lattice Hamiltonian. The proof is based on building a Lie group by alternating these two operators and showing its completeness to represent $U(N)$ for a finite number of layers, which is numerically found to be exactly $N$. This architecture can be implemented using elementary optical components and can successfully reconstruct arbitrary unitary matrices. We propose example devices such as optical logic gates, which perform logic gate operations using a single-layer lossless and passive optical circuit design.

Title: Interactions in Quantum Networks with Pulse Propagation Delays
Authors: Victor Rueskov Christiansen, Klaus Mølmer
Abstract: The finite speed of light of pulses implies propagation delays between the generation of light, the interaction with different elements along its path and the final detection at the output of networks and interferometers. We show that it is possible to take these delays into account with a theoretical method which evades quantization of the full continuum of field modes. We illustrate the use of this method by analyzing Ramsey excitation of an atom by a split and delayed quantum pulse.

Title: Observation of Power Superbroadening of Spectral Line Profiles on IBM Quantum
Authors: Ivo S. Mihov, Nikolay V. Vitanov
Abstract: Power broadening refers to the widening of the spectral line profile in a two-state quantum transition as the strength of the driving field increases. This phenomenon commonly arises in continuous-wave driving when the radiation field's intensity exceeds the transition's saturation intensity and it has been extensively studied in spectroscopy. For pulsed-field excitation, the spectral response of the quantum system may differ significantly: while a rectangular-shaped pulse leads to a linear power broadening, pulses with smooth shapes show significantly reduced power broadening, for instance, logarithmic for the Gaussian shape and none for the hyperbolic-secant shape. Recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 020802 (2024)], in a dramatic paradigm shift, we have demonstrated experimentally that for Lorentzian-shaped pulses, the opposite effect - power narrowing - takes place: the width of the spectral profile decreases when the driving pulse amplitude increases, with a narrowing factor of as much as 10 observed. While in high-resolution spectroscopy the push is for eliminating or even inverting the power broadening, there are applications where it is used to an advantage for it facilitates off-resonance excitation. Here, we present a number of shaped pulses that exhibit power broadening much greater than that of the rectangular pulse of the same pulse area. They are grouped in two families of pulse shapes. In particular, in regard to the width of the second Rabi oscillation maximum, the quadratic pulse family shows an increase by a factor of 3.3 whereas the even-exponent pulse family exhibits an increase by a factor of more than 3.5.

Title: Second-Order Coherence Across the Brillouin Lasing Threshold
Authors: E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, G. Enzian, L. Freisem, N. Moroney, J. J. Price, A. Ø. Svela, K. D. Major, M. R. Vanner
Abstract: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is one of the most accessible nonlinear optical phenomena and has been widely studied since its theoretical discovery one hundred years ago. The scattering mechanism is a three-wave-mixing process between two optical fields and one acoustic field and has found a broad range of applications spanning microscopy to ultra-narrow-linewidth lasers. Building on the success of utilizing this nonlinearity at a classical level, a rich avenue is now being opened to explore Brillouin scattering within the paradigm of quantum optics. Here, we take a key step in this direction by employing quantum optical techniques yet to be utilized for Brillouin scattering to characterize the second-order coherence of Stokes scattering across the Brillouin lasing threshold. We use a silica microsphere resonator and single-photon counters to observe the expected transition from bunched statistics of thermal light below the lasing threshold to Poissonian statistics of coherent light above the threshold. Notably, at powers approaching the lasing threshold, we also observe super-thermal statistics, which arise due to instability and a "flickering" in and out of lasing as the pump field is transiently depleted. The statistics observed across the transition, including the "flickering", are a result of the full nonlinear three-wave-mixing process and cannot be captured by a linearized model. These measurements are in good agreement with numerical solutions of the three-wave Langevin equations and are well demarcated by analytical expressions for the instability and the lasing thresholds. These results demonstrate that applying second-order-coherence and photon-counting measurements to Brillouin scattering provides new methods to advance our understanding of Brillouin scattering itself and progress toward quantum-state preparation and characterization of acoustic modes.

Title: $H \to ZZ$ as a double-slit experiment
Authors: J. A. Aguilar-Saavedra
Abstract: The decay $H \to ZZ \to 4\ell$, with $\ell = e,\mu$, can be used to test quantum interference in analogy to the famous double-slit experiment. The observations corresponding to `covering a slit' can be extracted from data in the $ee\mu\mu$ channel, while the observations when both `slits' are open, which include the interference, are measured in the $4e/4\mu$ channels. In this way, this process offers a unique opportunity to investigate identical-particle effects at high energies, and provide the first evidence of identical-particle behaviour for muons. Sensitivity at the $4\sigma$ level could be achieved at the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider.

Title: Critical Limitations in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction Methods
Authors: Peter Reinholdt, Karl Michael Ziems, Erik Rosendahl Kjellgren, Sonia Coriani, Stephan P. A. Sauer, Jacob Kongsted
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr{ö}dinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we perform numerical analysis to show that QSCI methods face critical limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality configuration interaction (CI) expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a significant drawback in QSCI methods when sampling from the ground-state distribution as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications, as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.

Title: Coxeter codes: Extending the Reed-Muller family
Authors: Nolan J. Coble, Alexander Barg
Abstract: Binary Reed-Muller (RM) codes are defined via evaluations of Boolean-valued functions on $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$. We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the RM family by replacing the domain $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Like RM codes, this class is closed under duality, forms a nested code sequence, satisfies a multiplication property, and has asymptotic rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. Coxeter codes also give rise to a family of quantum codes for which transversal diagonal $Z$ rotations can perform non-trivial logic.

Title: Fully numerical Hartree-Fock calculations for atoms and small molecules with quantics tensor trains
Authors: Paul Haubenwallner, Matthias Heller
Abstract: We present a fully numerical framework for the optimization of molecule-specific quantum chemical basis functions within the quantics tensor train format using a finite-difference scheme. The optimization is driven by solving the Hartree-Fock equations (HF) with the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm on Cartesian grids that are iteratively refined. In contrast to the standard way of tackling the mean-field problem by expressing the molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) our method only requires as much basis functions as there are electrons within the system. Benchmark calculations for atoms and molecules with up to ten electrons show excellent agreement with LCAO calculations with large basis sets supporting the validity of the tensor network approach. Our work therefore offers a promising alternative to well-established HF-solvers and could pave the way to define highly accurate, fully numerical, molecule-adaptive basis sets, which, in the future, could lead to benefits for post-HF calculations.

Title: Quantum Entanglement is Quantum: ZZ Production at the LHC
Authors: Dorival Gonçalves, Ajay Kaladharan, Frank Krauss, Alberto Navarro
Abstract: Polarization and spin correlations in diboson systems serve as powerful tools for precision tests and searches for new physics. Recently, interpreting these observables through the lens of quantum information, for instance by examining whether the diboson systems exhibit entanglement, has introduced a compelling new dimension to these studies. We analyze the angular coefficients in the processes $pp\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ and $h\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$, incorporating higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections. Guided by the fundamental properties of the spin density matrix, we assess the stability of the two-qutrit interpretation under radiative effects. For the $pp \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ process, NLO QCD corrections preserve the two-qutrit structure but weaken entanglement indicators, an effect that can be partially mitigated by jet binning. In contrast, electroweak corrections introduce non-factorizable contributions that modify the quantum properties of the system. While these effects can be largely depleted by selecting events with a double-resonant $ZZ$ structure, such a kinematic handle is not available for Higgs decays. In the $h \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ channel, singly-resonant NLO electroweak corrections substantially distort the angular coefficients, challenging the description of these events as a two-qutrit system.

Title: The QTF-Backbone: Proposal for a Nationwide Optical Fibre Backbone in Germany for Quantum Technology and Time and Frequency Metrology

Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in the distribution of quantum information and high-precision time and frequency (T&F) signals over long-haul optical fibre networks have transformative potential for physically secure communications, resilience of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and fundamental physics. However, so far these capabilities remain confined to isolated testbeds, with quantum and T&F signals accessible, for example in Germany, to only a few institutions. We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment. As a national and European hub, it will position Germany and Europe at the forefront of quantum networking, as well as time and frequency transfer.

Title: Krylov Complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac Field Theories
Authors: Hamid R. Imani, K. Babaei Velni, M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent z. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of Krylov complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems.

Title: Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings
Authors: Tao-Ran Hu, Katsuyoshi Sone, Feng-Kun Guo, Tetsuo Hyodo, Ian Low
Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.
