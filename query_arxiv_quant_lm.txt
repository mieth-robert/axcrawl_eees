Title: Loschmidt Echo for edge of chaos and chaotic sea in Standard Map: Cases Study
Authors: Wenjun Shi
Abstract: Using the Standard Map model, this study explores the quantum Loschmidt Echo (LE) decay laws for mixed-type phase spaces, including edge of chaos and chaotic sea regimes. A universal decay law is proposed and numerically verified, characterizing the intricate dynamics of LE decay processes with a semi-classical statistical approach. Key findings include three typical decay stages and time-scale relations as well as the critical perturbations for comparing the decay extent, with critical insights into classical-quantum correspondences through the construction of classical ensemble from the uncertainty of quantum state. This work provides analytical and numerical advancements in understanding dynamical stability in quantum systems.

Title: Transfer Learning Analysis of Variational Quantum Circuits
Authors: Huan-Hsin Tseng, Hsin-Yi Lin, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Shinjae Yoo
Abstract: This work analyzes transfer learning of the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC). Our framework begins with a pretrained VQC configured in one domain and calculates the transition of 1-parameter unitary subgroups required for a new domain. A formalism is established to investigate the adaptability and capability of a VQC under the analysis of loss bounds. Our theory observes knowledge transfer in VQCs and provides a heuristic interpretation for the mechanism. An analytical fine-tuning method is derived to attain the optimal transition for adaptations of similar domains.

Title: Developing a practical model for noise in entangled photon detection
Authors: Taman Truong, Christian Arenz, Joseph M. Lukens
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive model for the effective two-photon density matrix produced by a parametric source of entangled photon pairs under a variety of detector configurations commonly seen in a laboratory setting: two and four photon number-resolving (PNR) and threshold detectors. We derive the probability of obtaining a single coincidence assuming Poisson-distributed photon pairs, non-unit detection efficiency, and dark counts; obtain the effective density matrix; and use this quantity to compute the fidelity of the generated quantum state. The 4 PNR case admits an analytic result valid for any combination of parameters, while all other cases leverage low-efficiency approximations to arrive at closed-form expressions. Interestingly, our model reveals appreciable fidelity improvements from four detectors as opposed to two yet minimal advantages for PNR over threshold detectors in the regimes explored. Overall, our work provides a valuable tool for the quantitative design of two-photon experiments under realistic nonidealities.

Abstract: We present pyBoLaNO, a Python symbolic package based on SymPy to quickly normal-order (Wick-order) any polynomial in bosonic ladder operators. By extension, this package offers the normal ordering of commutators of any two polynomials in bosonic ladder operators and the evaluation of the normal-ordered expectation value evolution in the Lindblad master equation framework for open quantum systems. The package also supports multipartite descriptions and multiprocessing. We describe the package's workflow, show examples of use, and discuss its computational performance. All codes and examples are available on our GitHub repository.

Title: Noise-Mitigated Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Pre-training and Zero-Noise Extrapolation
Authors: Wanqi Sun, Jungang Xu, Chenghua Duan
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver, as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is widely applied in quantum chemistry simulations, especially in computing the electronic structure of complex molecular systems. However, on existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, factors such as quantum decoherence, measurement errors, and gate operation imprecisions are unavoidable. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an efficient noise-mitigating variational quantum eigensolver for accurate computation of molecular ground state energies in noisy environments. We design the quantum circuit with reference to the structure of matrix product states and utilize it to pre-train the circuit parameters, which ensures circuit stability and mitigates fluctuations caused by initialization. We also employ zero-noise extrapolation to mitigate quantum noise and combine it with neural networks to improve the accuracy of the noise-fitting function, which significantly eliminates noise interference. Furthermore, we implement intelligent grouping measurements of Hamiltonian Pauli strings, which not only reduces measurement errors but also improves sampling efficiency. We conduct experiments to solve the ground state energy of the $H_4$ molecule on the Mindquantum quantum computing platform, and the results demonstrate that our algorithm can constrain noise errors within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}) \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$, outperforming mainstream variational quantum eigensolver methods. This work provides a new strategy for high-precision quantum chemistry calculations on near-term noisy quantum hardware.

Title: Quantum state transfer of superposed multi-photon states via phonon-induced dynamic resonance in an optomechanical system
Authors: Xuanloc Leu, Xuan-Hoai Thi Nguyen, Jinhyoung Lee
Abstract: We propose a method to transfer macroscopically superposed states between two optical cavities mediated by a mechanical oscillator, which works in a nonlinear regime of optomechanical interaction. Our approach relies on the phonon-induced dynamic resonance, where the motion of mechanical oscillator dynamically sets on/off the resonance between two cavities. Our method assumes high amplitude limit of oscillator, weak coupling between optical cavities, and adiabatic approximation. We show that, under these conditions, various multi-photon quantum states, especially, Schr{ö}dinger cat states, can be transferred with nearly perfect fidelity in a deterministic process. We show that transfer fidelity of 0.99 can be achieved using the experimental parameters in currently available technology.

Title: Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms
Authors: Husain Ahmed, Andrea Litvinov, Pauline Guesdon, Etienne Maréchal, John H. Huckans, Benjamin Pasquiou, Bruno Laburthe-Tolra, Martin Robert-de-Saint-Vincent
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.

Title: Topological quantum compilation of metaplectic anyons
Authors: Jiangwei Long, Jianxin Zhong, Lijun Meng
Abstract: Topological quantum computing holding global anti-interference ability is realized by braiding some anyons, such as well-known Fibonacci anyon. Here, based on F-matrices and R-symbols and fusion rules of metaplectic anyon model, we obtained two anyon models V112_2 and V133_1. We study systematically the compilation of the metaplectic anyon model through elementary braiding matrices obtained analytically. For one-qubit case, the classical H- and T-gate can be well constructed using the genetic algorithm enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA) by V112_2/V133_1, and the obtained accuracy of the H/T-gate is slightly inferior to the corresponding gates of Fibonacci anyon model, but it also can meet the requirements of fault-tolerant quantum computing. For two-qubit case, we use the exhaustive method for short length and the GA for long length to obtain braidword for both V112_2 and V133_1 models. The resulting matrix for the CNOT-gate can approximate the local equivalence class of the CNOT-gate well and demonstrates a much smaller error than the Fibonacci model especially for V133_1.

Title: Genetic algorithm enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm for quantum compiling
Authors: Jiangwei Long, Xuyang Huang, Jianxin Zhong, Lijun Meng
Abstract: Quantum compiling trying to approximate the target qubit gate by finding an optimal sequence (braid word) of basic braid operations is a fundamental problem in quantum computing. We develop a genetic algorithm (GA) enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (SKA) to approximate single qubit gates with four basic braid matrices of Fibonacci anyons. The GA-enhanced SKA demonstrates that the algorithm performs strongly and can easily find the ideal braid word from an exponentially large space. The resulting precision of the approximate single-qubit quantum gate is superior to that of the Monte Carlo (MC) enhanced SKA, as well as comparable to that of the deep reinforcement learning (RL) for the length of braid word greater than 25. The 2(3)-order approximation of GA-enhanced SKA for basic braiding length l0=50(30) leads to an optimal braid word at a distance of 5.9*10-7, which is sufficient for most cases of quantum computing. Our work provides an alternative approach to solving and optimizing quantum compilation of non-Abelian anyon quantum gates and is useful for realizing topological quantum computation in the future.

Title: Speeding up Lindblad dynamics via time-rescaling engineering
Authors: Bertúlio de Lima Bernardo
Abstract: We introduce a universal method for accelerating Lindblad dynamics that preserves the original trajectory. The technique provides exact fast processes analytically, which are Markovian with time-independent Lindblad operators, by time-rescaling a reference dynamics. In particular, the engineered control protocols are based only on local interactions, and no additional control fields are required compared to the reference protocol. We demonstrate the scheme with two examples: a driven two-level system in an amplitude damping channel and the dissipative transverse field Ising model. Our approach can help advance techniques for quantum control and computation towards more complex noisy systems.

Title: A stable phase-locking-free single beam optical lattice with multiple configurations
Authors: Yirong Wang, Xiaoyu Dai, Xue Zhao, Guangren Sun, Kuiyi Gao, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Optical lattices formed by interfering laser beams are widely used to trap and manipulate atoms for quantum simulation, metrology, and computation. To stabilize optical lattices in experiments, it is usually challenging to implement delicate phase-locking systems with complicated optics and electronics to reduce the relative phase fluctuation of multiple laser beams. Here we report a phase-locking-free scheme to implement optical lattices by passing a single laser beam through a prism with n-fold symmetric facets and large apex angles. The scheme ensures a stable optical lattice since the interference occurs among different deflected parts of a single laser beam without any moving component. Various lattice configurations, including a triangular lattice and a quasi-crystal lattice with ten-fold symmetry are demonstrated. In both cases, stability measurements show a change of lattice constant in less than 1.14%, and a drift of lattice position in less than 1.61%.

Title: Entanglement transfer between giant atoms in waveguide-QED systems
Authors: Jie Liu, Zhi-Qiang Liu, Yu Sang, Lei Tan
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement transfer between giant atoms in waveguide-QED systems. The system consists of two pairs of two-level giant atoms, $ab$ and $cd$, each independently coupled to its respective one-dimensional waveguide. Initially, entangled states are stored in atom pair $ac$. There we consider three giant atom coupling configurations: separated, braided, and nested. For comparison, the entanglement transfer for small atoms configuration is also studied here. We focus on the entanglement transfer from atom pair $ac$ to atoms pair $bd$ and atom pair $ab$ in these four coupling configurations. It is shown that the transfer of entanglement in each coupling configuration strongly depends on phase shift. In particular, the braided configuration demonstrates superior performance in entanglement transfer. For the entanglement transfer from atom pair $ac$ to atom pair $bd$, complete entanglement transfer is presented in braided configuration, a behavior not found in small atom or other giant atom configurations. For the entanglement transfer from atom pair $ac$ to atom pair $ab$, although the maximum entanglement transferred to atom pair $ab$ in the braided configuration is half of that one to atom pair $bd$, it is still higher than that in the small atom, separated, and nested configurations. This study lays the foundation for entanglement transfer between giant atoms in waveguide-QED platforms.

Title: Two-cavity-mediated photon-pair emission by one atom
Authors: Gianvito Chiarella, Tobias Frank, Pau Farrera, Gerhard Rempe
Abstract: Photon-pair sources are widely used in quantum optics and quantum information experiments. Despite their broad deployment, there has not yet been an on-demand implementation with efficient into-fiber photon generation and high single-photon purity. Here we report on such a source based on a single atom with three energy levels in ladder configuration and coupled to two optical fiber cavities. We efficiently generate photon pairs with in-fiber emission efficiency of $\eta_{\mathrm{pair}}=16(1)\%$ and study their temporal correlation properties. We simulate theoretically a regime with strong atom-cavity coupling and find that photons are directly emitted from the ground state, i.e. without atomic population in any intermediate state. We propose a scenario to observe such a double-vacuum-stimulated effect experimentally.

Title: Restoring Heisenberg-Limited Precision in Non-Markovian Open Quantum Systems via Dynamical Decoupling
Authors: Bakmou Lahcen, Ke Zeng, Yu Jiang, Kok Chuan Tan
Abstract: Non-classical resources enable measurements to achieve a precision that exceeds the limits predicted by the central limit theorem. However, environmental noise arising from system-environment interactions severely limits the performance of such resources through decoherence. While significant progress has been made in mitigating Markovian noise, the extent to which non-Markovian noise can be mitigated remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that Heisenberg Scaling, the ultimate quantum limit on measurement precision, can be recovered in quantum metrology under non-Markovian noise by leveraging carefully designed Dynamical Decoupling Techniques. Importantly, our approach does not rely on assumptions of Markovian dynamics. By imposing appropriate conditions on the control Hamiltonian, we show that HS can be achieved irrespective of whether the noise is Markovian or non-Markovian. We also prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such control Hamiltonians. As an illustrative example, we apply our framework to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model, successfully mitigating memory effects and maintaining measurement precision in complex, non-Markovian environments. These findings highlight the power of quantum control to overcome decoherence challenges and enhance metrological performance in realistic, noisy quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Error Correction Without Encoding via the Circulant Structure of Pauli Noise and the Fast Fourier Transform
Authors: Alvin Gonzales
Abstract: This work introduces a method for correcting the output distribution of a quantum computer that does not require encoding of the logical qubits into more physical qubits. Thus, it avoids the encoding overhead of standard quantum error correction codes. If the noise affecting the circuit is a Pauli channel (we can bias the noise with twirling), the ideal output distribution and noisy distribution in the standard basis are related by a stochastic matrix. We prove that this matrix has a circulant block structure. Thus, the ideal distribution can be retrieved from the noisy output distribution by applying the Fast Fourier Transform. Moreover, due to its circulant structure, characterization of this matrix can be achieved by sampling a single circuit. The results are corroborated with quantum hardware executions consisting of 20-qubit and 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, 5-qubit Grover, 6-qubit and 10-qubit quantum phase estimation, and 10-qubit and 20-qubit Dicke state preparation circuits. The correction process dramatically improves the accuracies of the output distributions. For 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, a corrected distribution fidelity of 97.7% is achieved from an initial raw fidelity of 23.2%.

Title: Tantum Gravity
Authors: Florian Ecker, Adrien Fiorucci, Daniel Grumiller
Abstract: We argue there is an interesting triple-scaling limit of quantum gravity, namely when Planck's constant scales to infinity while Newton's constant and the speed of light tend to zero, keeping fixed the gravitational coupling $G_N\,c^{-4}$ and the combination $\hbar\,c$. We refer to this limiting theory as ``tantum gravity'' and describe in this Letter some of its main properties and prospects for physics. Most notably, the laws of black hole thermodynamics survive this limit, which means that puzzles related to black holes and their evaporation could be addressed more easily in tantum gravity than in fully-fledged quantum gravity.

Title: Simulating Bell inequalities with Qibo
Authors: Isabella Masina, Giuseppe Lo Presti, Matteo Robbiati, Michele Grossi
Abstract: We present educational material about Bell inequalities in the context of quantum computing. In particular, we provide software tools to simulate their violation, together with a guide for the classroom discussion. The material is organized in three modules of increasing difficulty, and the relative implementation has been written in Qibo, an open-source software suite to simulate quantum circuits with the ability to interface with quantum hardware. The topic of inequalities allows not only to introduce undergraduate or graduate students to crucial theoretical issues in quantum mechanics -- like entanglement, correlations, hidden variables, non-locality --, but also to practically put hands on tools to implement a real simulation, where statistical aspects and noise coming from current quantum chips also come into play.

Title: Innovative Approaches to Teaching Quantum Computer Programming and Quantum Software Engineering
Authors: Majid Haghparast, Enrique Moguel, Jose Garcia-Alonso, Tommi Mikkonen, Juan Manuel Murillo
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field that promises to revolutionize various domains, such as simulation optimization, data processing, and more, by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. This paper outlines innovative pedagogical strategies developed by university lecturers in Finland and Spain for teaching quantum computer programming and quantum software engineering. Our curriculum integrates essential tools and methodologies such as containerization with Docker, Qiskit, PennyLane, and Ocean SDK to provide a comprehensive learning experience. The approach consists of several steps, from introducing the fundamentals of quantum mechanics to hands-on labs focusing on practical use cases. We believe quantum computer programming is an important topic and one that is hard to teach, so having a teaching agenda and guidelines for teaching can be of great help.

Title: Quantum Error Correction with Goppa Codes from Maximal Curves: Design, Simulation, and Performance
Authors: Vahid Nourozi
Abstract: This paper characterizes Goppa codes of certain maximal curves over finite fields defined by equations of the form $y^n = x^m + x$. We investigate Algebraic Geometric and quantum stabilizer codes associated with these maximal curves and propose modifications to improve their parameters. The theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive simulation results, which validate the performance of these codes under various error rates. We provide concrete examples of the constructed codes, comparing them with known results to highlight their strengths and trade-offs. The simulation data, presented through detailed graphs and tables, offers insights into the practical behavior of these codes in noisy environments. Our findings demonstrate that while the constructed codes may not always achieve optimal minimum distances, they offer systematic construction methods and interesting parameter trade-offs that could be valuable in specific applications or for further theoretical study.

Title: Electron hopping induced phonon pumping in opto-mechanical molecular nanocavities
Authors: Yu Bai, Ilya Razdolski, Zhizi Guan, Ping Tang, Xiu Liang, David J. Srolovitz, Anatoly V. Zayats, Dangyuan Lei
Abstract: Plasmonic molecular nanojunctions exhibit opto-mechanical coupling at the nanoscale, enabling intertwined optical, vibrational and electronic phenomena. Here, we demonstrate plasmon-mediated phonon pumping, driven by inelastic electron hopping in conductive molecules, which results in strong Raman nonlinearity at the light intensities almost three orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional opto-mechanical systems and up to four-fold enhancement of the effective Raman polarizability due to vibrational electron-phonon coupling. We also developed a microscopic framework of opto-mechanical electron-phonon coupling in molecular nanojunctions based on the Marcus electron hopping. Systematically varying electrical conductance of the molecules in the junction and laser intensity, we observed the transition between a photo-assisted tunnelling regime and an electron hopping process. Our findings provide a microscopic description for vibrational, optical, and electronic phenomena in plasmonic nanocavities, representing the first attempt to exploit conductive molecules as practically implementable quantum-mechanical oscillators.

Title: Enhanced Condensation Through Rotation
Authors: Maxim Chernodub, Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We argue that the rotation of a thin superconducting cylinder can increase the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition substantially. The phenomenon can be interpreted as an effective negative moment of inertia associated with condensation of Cooper pairs. We give quantitative estimates for a thin cylinder of aluminum.

Title: Ohm's law, Joule heat, and Planckian dissipation
Authors: Hiroyasu Koizumi
Abstract: We will show that the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals including cuprate superconductors can be attributed to the dissipation due to the gauge fluctuation of the Berry connection. In the due course, we revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in metallic wires. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heat enters from the outside of the wire as radiation; and consumed in the wire. This explanation is rectified by considering the generation of the chemical potential gradient inside the wire by the battery connection. Then, the Joule heat is obtained as the energy of the emitted radiation from the wire with its energy supplied by the connected battery. We also examine discharging of a capacitor and supercurrent flow through the Josephson junction.

Title: Exciton Dynamics and Quantum Efficiencies in Optically Coupled OLEDs: A Unified Quantum Master Equation Approach
Authors: Olli Siltanen, Kimmo Luoma, Konstantinos S. Daskalakis
Abstract: The primary function of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to convert electrons into photons. However, only 25 % of the electronic states (singlets) in electrically excited fluorescent molecules can emit light, which is why triplet harvesting has attracted significant attention. Specifically, one often aims to maximize the rate of triplet-to-singlet conversion, while at the same time, it is crucial to depopulate the singlets fast enough -- before they convert to triplets or interact with other excited states, potentially breaking molecular bonds. Planar microcavities provide a viable architecture to address these issues. By confining the emitters within planar microcavities one can couple the excitons to cavity modes and engineer the population dynamics to one's liking. While the weak-coupling regime is renowned for Purcell-enhanced emission, strongly coupled excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates known as polaritons. To fully understand and optimize exciton-photon interactions and light-emission mechanisms across various coupling regimes, a unified theory of optically coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs is needed. In this article, we introduce a quantum master equation model spanning the zero-, weak-, and strong-coupling regimes. We derive the different rates using Fermi's golden rule and Marcus theory, show how the different regimes converge, and finally evaluate the internal quantum efficiencies in all cases.

Title: Projected ensemble in a system with conserved charges with local support
Authors: Sandipan Manna, Sthitadhi Roy, G. J. Sreejith
Abstract: The investigation of ergodicity or lack thereof in isolated quantum many-body systems has conventionally focused on the description of the reduced density matrices of local subsystems in the contexts of thermalization, integrability, and localization. Recent experimental capabilities to measure the full distribution of quantum states in Hilbert space and the emergence of specific state ensembles have extended this to questions of {\textit{deep thermalization}}, by introducing the notion of the {\textit{projected ensemble}} -- ensembles of pure states of a subsystem obtained by projective measurements on its complement. While previous work examined chaotic unitary circuits, Hamiltonian evolution, and systems with global conserved charges, we study the projected ensemble in systems where there are an extensive number of conserved charges all of which have (quasi)local support. We employ a strongly disordered quantum spin chain which shows many-body localized dynamics over long timescales as well as the $\ell$-bit model, a phenomenological archetype of a many-body localized system, with the charges being $1$-local in the latter. In particular, we discuss the dependence of the projected ensemble on the measurement basis. Starting with random direct product states, we find that the projected ensemble constructed from time-evolved states converges to a Scrooge ensemble at late times and in the large system limit except when the measurement operator is close to the conserved charges. This is in contrast to systems with global conserved charges where the ensemble varies continuously with the measurement basis. We relate these observations to the emergence of Porter-Thomas distribution in the probability distribution of bitstring measurement probabilities.

Title: Responses for one-dimensional quantum spin systems via tensor networks
Authors: Jiayin Gu
Abstract: Tensor networks are adopted to calculate the responses for one-dimensional quantum spin systems that are initially in thermal equilibrium. The Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal fields is used as the benchmarking system. The linear and second-order responses of the magnetization in $z$-direction induced by the time-dependent force conjugated with the magnetization in $x$-direction are calculated. In addition, the magnetization in $z$-direction is also exactly calculated in response to this excitation. As expected, the first two responses are shown to be excellent corrections to the equilibrium magnetization in $z$-direction when the excitation is weak. This result represents an illustrative example of the response theory for nontrivial quantum many-body systems.

Title: Fast algorithms for classical specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates
Authors: Nadish de Silva, Wilfred Salmon, Ming Yin
Abstract: The stabiliser formalism plays a central role in quantum computing, error correction, and fault tolerance. Conversions between and verifications of different specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates are important components of many classical algorithms in quantum information, e.g. for gate synthesis, circuit optimisation, and simulating quantum circuits. These core functions are also used in the numerical experiments critical to formulating and testing mathematical conjectures on the stabiliser formalism. We develop novel mathematical insights concerning stabiliser states and Clifford gates that significantly clarify their descriptions. We then utilise these to provide ten new fast algorithms which offer asymptotic advantages over any existing implementations. We show how to rapidly verify that a vector is a stabiliser state, and interconvert between its specification as amplitudes, a quadratic form, and a check matrix. These methods are leveraged to rapidly check if a given unitary matrix is a Clifford gate and to interconvert between the matrix of a Clifford gate and its compact specification as a stabiliser tableau. For example, we extract the stabiliser tableau of a $2^n \times 2^n$ matrix, promised to be a Clifford gate, in $O(n 2^n)$ time. Remarkably, it is not necessary to read all the elements of a Clifford gate matrix to extract its stabiliser tableau. This is an asymptotic speedup over the best-known method that is exponential in the number of qubits. We provide implementations of our algorithms in $\texttt{Python}$ and $\texttt{C++}$ that exhibit vastly improved practical performance over existing algorithms in the cases where they exist.

Title: Simplest bipartite perfect quantum strategies
Authors: Adán Cabello
Abstract: A bipartite perfect quantum strategy (BPQS) allows two players who cannot communicate with each other to always win a nonlocal game. BPQSs are rare but fundamental in light of some recent results in quantum information, computation, and foundations. A more than 40-year-old open problem is how many inputs (measurement settings) a BPQS requires. A related problem is how many inputs are needed if, in addition, the quantum system has minimum dimension. A third, apparently unrelated, problem is what is the connection between BPQSs and state-independent contextuality, which inspired the first BPQSs. Here, we solve the third problem: we prove that {\em every} BPQS defines a Kochen-Specker set. We use this result to identify the BPQS with the smallest number of inputs, both in the general case and in the case of minimum dimension, and solve some related problems. We conjecture that the BPQSs presented here are the solutions to the first two problems.

Title: Piecewise Polynomial Tensor Network Quantum Feature Encoding
Authors: Mazen Ali, Matthias Kabel
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for embedding continuous variables into quantum circuits via piecewise polynomial features, utilizing low-rank tensor networks. Our approach, termed Piecewise Polynomial Tensor Network Quantum Feature Encoding (PPTNQFE), aims to broaden the applicability of quantum algorithms by incorporating spatially localized representations suited for numerical applications like partial differential equations and function regression. We demonstrate the potential of PPTNQFE through efficient point evaluations of solutions of discretized differential equations and in modeling functions with localized features such as jump discontinuities. While promising, challenges such as unexplored noise impact and design of trainable circuits remain. This study opens new avenues for enhancing quantum models with novel feature embeddings and leveraging TN representations for a wider array of function types in quantum machine learning.

Title: Empirical learning of dynamical decoupling on quantum processors
Authors: Christopher Tong, Helena Zhang, Bibek Pokharel
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a low-overhead method for quantum error suppression. Despite extensive work in DD design, finding pulse sequences that optimally decouple computational qubits on noisy quantum hardware is not well understood. In this work, we describe how learning algorithms can empirically tailor DD strategies for any quantum circuit and device. We use a genetic algorithm-inspired search to optimize DD (GADD) strategies for IBM's superconducting-qubit based quantum processors. In all observed experimental settings, we find that empirically learned DD strategies significantly improve error suppression relative to canonical sequences, with relative improvement increasing with problem size and circuit sophistication. We leverage this to study mirror randomized benchmarking on 100 qubits, GHZ state preparation on 50 qubits, and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm on 27 qubits. We further demonstrate that our empirical learning method finds strategies, in time constant with increasing circuit width and depth, that provide stable performance over long periods of time without retraining and generalize to larger circuits when trained on small sub-circuit structures.

Title: Unlocking Heisenberg Sensitivity with Sequential Weak Measurement Preparation
Authors: T. B. Lantaño, Dayou Yang, K. M. R. Audenaert, S. F. Huelga, M. B. Plenio
Abstract: We propose a state preparation protocol based on sequential measurements of a central spin coupled with a spin ensemble, and investigate the usefulness of the generated multi-spin states for quantum enhanced metrology. Our protocol is shown to generate highly entangled spin states, devoid of the necessity for non-linear spin interactions. The metrological sensitivity of the resulting state surpasses the standard quantum limit, reaching the Heisenberg limit under symmetric coupling strength conditions. We also explore asymmetric coupling strengths, identifying specific preparation windows in time for optimal sensitivity. Our findings introduce a novel method for generating large-scale, non-classical, entangled states, enabling quantum-enhanced metrology within current experimental capabilities.

Title: Non-Hermitian sensing in the absence of exceptional points
Authors: Lei Xiao, Yaoming Chu, Quan Lin, Haiqing Lin, Wei Yi, Jianming Cai, Peng Xue
Abstract: Open systems possess unique potentials in high-precision sensing, yet the majority of previous studies rely on the spectral singularities known as exceptional points. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate universal non-Hermitian sensing in the absence of exceptional points. The scheme makes use of the intrinsic sensitivity of a non-Hermitian probe to weak external fields, which can be understood as the direct consequence of non-Hermiticity. We confirm the basic mechanism by simulating the sensor-field dynamics using photon interferometry, and, as a concrete example, demonstrate the enhanced sensing of signals encoded in the setting angle of a wave plate. While the sensitivity of the probe is ultimately limited by the measurement noise, we find the non-Hermitian sensor showing superior performance under background noises that cannot be suppressed through repetitive measurements. Our experiment opens the avenue of enhanced sensing without exceptional points, complementing existing efforts aimed at harnessing the unique features of open systems.

Title: Current, quantum transport and entropic force of bosonic systems interacting with two thermal reservoirs
Authors: Jayarshi Bhattacharya, Sunandan Gangopadhyay, Gautam Gangopadhyay
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of current and quantum transport factor in a bosonic system consisting of a central system interacting with two reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive a master equation describing the time evolution of the density matrix of the system, accounting for the interactions and energy transfer between the components. We quantify the current, representing the flow of bosons through the system and analyse its dependence on the system's parameters and temperatures of the thermal reservoirs. In the steady state regime, we derived an expression for the quantum transport factor of the energy transfer process. Our analysis show that quantum effects, such as the dependence on temperature can significantly impact this factor. In particular, we observe that the transport factor of the quantum system is greater than the corresponding factor when the temperature goes to infinity, where the factor has an identical form with the Carnot efficiency of an ideal heat engine. We then derived the Fokker-Planck equation to find out the Glauber-Sudarsan $P$-representation. In the steady state of the equation, the probability distribution comes out to be in Gaussian form. We then calculated the entropic force for this probability distribution which gives the Hooke's law in the steady state, in agreement with the fact that our system is a harmonic oscillator.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing, the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical FPGA-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local, multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both protocols for implementing an unbounded fan-out (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT) gate in constant depth between three non-local qubits. Finally, we demonstrate deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on opposite side of our quantum processor.

Title: Properties and Applications of the Kirkwood-Dirac Distribution
Authors: David R. M. Arvidsson-Shukur, William F. Braasch Jr., Stephan De Bievre, Justin Dressel, Andrew N. Jordan, Christopher Langrenez, Matteo Lostaglio, Jeff S. Lundeen, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: Recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity, coherence and observables' incompatibility.

Title: Conditions for separability in multiqubit systems with an accelerating qubit using a conditional entropy
Authors: Harsha Miriam Reji, Hemant Shreepad Hegde, R. Prabhu
Abstract: We study the separability in multiqubit pure and mixed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states with an accelerating qubit using the Abe-Rajagopal (AR) $ q $-conditional entropy. We observe that the pure multiqubit GHZ and W states in the inertial : non-inertial bipartition with one of their qubits accelerated will remain non-separable irrespective of the qubit's acceleration. In these systems, we captured the variation of their non-separability with respect to the acceleration of the qubit and the AR $ q $-conditional entropy parameter $ q $. However, in the corresponding multiqubit mixed states obtained by introducing a global noise to the above pure states, one could get stronger conditions on their separability in the inertial : non-inertial bipartition, in terms of the acceleration of the qubit, noise parameter, and the number of qubits in the system, in the asymptotic limit of parameter $ q $. These conditions obtained from the AR $ q $-conditional entropy serve as necessary conditions for separability in such multiqubit states with a relativistic qubit.

Title: Qubit-assisted quantum metrology under a time-reversal strategy
Authors: Peng Chen, Jun Jing
Abstract: We propose a quantum metrology protocol based on a two-step joint evolution of the probe system and an ancillary qubit and quantum measurement. With a proper initial state of the ancillary qubit and an optimized evolution time, the quantum Fisher information (QFI) about the phase parameter encoded in the probe system is found to be determined by the expectation value of the square of a phase generator, irrespective of the probe initial state. Consequently, even if the probe is prepared as a finite-temperature state, faraway from the so-called resource state, e.g., the squeezed spin state or the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state in atomic systems, the QFI in our protocol can approach the Heisenberg scaling $N^2$ with respect to the probe size $N$. This quadratic scaling behavior shows robustness against the imperfections about the initial state of the ancillary qubit and the optimized evolution time of the whole system. Also it is not sensitive to the deviation in system parameters and the qubit decoherence. Using the time-reversal strategy and a single-shot projective measurement, the classical Fisher information (CFI) in our metrology protocol is saturated with its quantum counterpart. Our work thus provides an economical method to reach the Heisenberg limit in metrology precision with no input of entanglement or squeezing.

Title: Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation of Electron Transfer Models with Tunable Dissipation
Authors: Visal So, Midhuna Duraisamy Suganthi, Abhishek Menon, Mingjian Zhu, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Peter G. Wolynes, José N. Onuchic, Guido Pagano
Abstract: Electron transfer is at the heart of many fundamental physical, chemical, and biochemical processes essential for life. The exact simulation of these reactions is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. Here, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multispecies trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. By manipulating both the ground-state and optical qubits, we observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.

Title: Lindbladian dynamics with loss of quantum jumps
Authors: Yu-Guo Liu, Shu Chen
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation (LME) describing the Markovian dynamics of the quantum open system can be understood as the evolution of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian balanced with random quantum jumps. Here we investigate the balance-breaking dynamics by partly eliminating jumps from postselection experiments. To describe this dynamics, a non-linear Lindblad master equation (NLME) is derived from quantum trajectory method. However, the NLME shows significant advantages in analytical analysis over quantum trajectory method. Using the NLME, we classify the dynamics into two classes. In the trivial class, the process of reducing jumps is completely equivalent to weakening the coupling from the environment. In contrast, the nontrivial class presents more complex dynamics. We study a prototypical model within this class and demonstrate the existence of the postselected skin effect whose steady state is characterized by the accumulation of particles on one side. The steady-state distribution can be fitted by a scale-invariant tanh function which is different from the uniform distribution of LME. Furthermore, the NLME can give a reasonable framework for studying the interplay and competition between the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and dissipative terms. We show this by capturing the characteristics of the trajectory-averaged entanglement entropy influenced by non-Hermitian skin effect and Zeno effect in the model of postselected skin effect.

Title: Enhancing entangled two-photon absorption of Nile Red via temperature-controlled SPDC
Authors: Aleksa Krstić, Tobias Bernd Gäbler, Nitish Jain, Patrick Then, Valerio Flavio Gili, Sina Saravi, Frank Setzpfandt, Christian Eggeling, Markus Gräfe
Abstract: Entangled two-photon absorption can enable a linear scaling of fluorescence emission with the excitation power. In comparison to classical two-photon absorption with a quadratic scaling, this can allow fluorescence imaging or photolithography with high axial resolution at minimal exposure intensities. However, most experimental studies on two-photon absorption were not able to show an unambiguous proof of fluorescence emission driven by entangled photon pairs. On the other hand, existing theoretical models struggle to accurately predict the entangled two-photon absorption behavior of chemically complex dyes. In this paper, we introduce an approach to simulate entangled two-photon absorption in common fluorescence dyes considering their chemical properties. Our theoretical model allows a deeper understanding of experimental results and thus the occurrence of entangled two-photon absorption. In particular, we found a remarkable dependency of the absorption probability on the phase-matching temperature of the nonlinear material. Further, we compared results of our theoretical approach to experimental data for Nile Red.

Title: Relative descriptors for quantum agents
Authors: David Möckli, Lorenzo Spies Perraro
Abstract: We use the Heisenberg picture of Everettian quantum mechanics to work out the relative descriptors for the Frauchiger-Renner thought experiment. While Everettian mechanics reveals no paradox within the thought experiment, the decoherence-free setup offers an instructive branching tree. Traditionally, branching structures derived from the Schrödinger picture suggest that foliations are always sharply defined. However, the Heisenberg picture demonstrates that the tree contains regions with inherently non-sharp foliations, leading to the conclusion that, in Everettian mechanics, quantum agents possess a history with a non-sharp memory registry.

Title: Ambiguity Clustering: an accurate and efficient decoder for qLDPC codes
Authors: Stasiu Wolanski, Ben Barber
Abstract: Error correction allows a quantum computer to preserve states long beyond the decoherence time of its physical qubits. Key to any scheme of error correction is the decoding algorithm, which estimates the error state of qubits from the results of syndrome measurements. The leading proposal for quantum error correction, the surface code, has fast and accurate decoders, but several recently proposed quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes allow more logical information to be encoded in significantly fewer physical qubits. The state-of-the-art decoder for general qLDPC codes, BP-OSD, has a cheap Belief Propagation stage, followed by linear algebra and search stages which can each be slow in practice. We introduce the Ambiguity Clustering decoder (AC) which, after the Belief Propagation stage, divides the measurement data into clusters that can be decoded independently. We benchmark AC on the recently proposed bivariate bicycle qLDPC codes and find that, with 0.3% circuit-level depolarising noise, AC is up to 27x faster than BP-OSD with matched accuracy. Our implementation of AC decodes the 144-qubit Gross code in 135us per round of syndrome extraction on an M2 CPU, already fast enough to keep up with neutral atom and trapped ion systems.

Title: Optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubit generation via approximate squeezed coherent state superposition breeding
Authors: Andrew J. Pizzimenti, Daniel Soh
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits, known for their exceptional error-correction capabilities, are highly coveted in quantum computing. However, generating optical GKP qubits has been a significant challenge. Measurement-based methods, where a portion of entangled squeezed vacuum modes are measured with photon number resolving detectors heralding a desired state in the undetected modes, have emerged as leading candidates for optical GKP qubit generation due their minimal resource requirements. While the current measurement-based methods can produce high-quality GKP qubits, they suffer from low success probabilities limiting experimental realization. The heart of the problem lies in the duality of photon number resolving measurements, being both the source of nonlinearity needed to generate quality GKP qubits and the component driving down their probability of successful production. Our method, breeding approximate squeezed coherent state superpositions created by generalized photon subtraction, overcomes this problem by supplementing two photon number resolving measurements with a single high success probability homodyne measurement. This scheme achieves success probabilities $\geq 10^{-5}$, two orders of magnitude higher than strictly photon number resolving measurement-based methods, while still producing states with high fidelity, possessing error-correction capabilities equivalent to up to a 10 dB squeezed GKP qubit. This breakthrough significantly advances the practical use of the optical GKP qubit encoding.

Title: On-Chip Verified Quantum Computation with an Ion-Trap Quantum Processing Unit
Authors: Cica Gustiani, Dominik Leichtle, Daniel Mills, Jonathan Miller, Ross Grassie, Elham Kashefi
Abstract: We present and experimentally demonstrate a novel approach to verification and benchmarking of quantum computing, implementing it on an ion-trap quantum computer. Unlike previous information-theoretically secure verification protocols, which typically require quantum communication between client and server, our approach is implemented entirely on-chip. This eliminates the need for a quantum client and significantly enhances practicality. We perform tomography to justify the additionally required assumption that the noise is independent of the secret used to prepare the Server's single-qubit states. We quantify the soundness error which may be caused by residual secret dependencies. We demonstrate our protocol on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processing unit, using qubit measurements and resets to construct measurement patterns with up to 52 vertices. To our knowledge, these are the largest verified measurement-based quantum computations performed to date. Our results pave the way for more accessible and efficient verification and benchmarking strategies in near-term quantum devices, enabling robust performance assessment without the added cost of external quantum infrastructure.

Title: Protocols for Creating Anyons and Defects via Gauging
Authors: Anasuya Lyons, Chiu Fan Bowen Lo, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Ashvin Vishwanath, Ruben Verresen
Abstract: Creating and manipulating anyons and symmetry defects in topological phases, especially those with a non-Abelian character, constitutes a primitive for topological quantum computation. We provide a physical protocol for implementing the ribbon operators of non-Abelian anyons and symmetry defects. We utilize dualities, in particular the Kramers-Wannier or gauging map, which have previously been used to construct topologically ordered ground states by relating them to simpler states. In this work, ribbon operators are implemented by applying a gauging procedure to a lower-dimensional region of such states. This protocol uses sequential unitary circuits or, in certain cases, constant-depth adaptive circuits. We showcase this for anyons and defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ toric code and $S_3$ quantum double. The general applicability of our method is demonstrated by deriving unitary expressions for ribbon operators of various (twisted) quantum doubles.

Title: GPU-accelerated Effective Hamiltonian Calculator
Authors: Abhishek Chakraborty, Taylor L. Patti, Brucek Khailany, Andrew N. Jordan, Anima Anandkumar
Abstract: Effective Hamiltonian calculations for large quantum systems can be both analytically intractable and numerically expensive using standard techniques. In this manuscript, we present numerical techniques inspired by Nonperturbative Analytical Diagonalization (NPAD) and the Magnus expansion for the efficient calculation of effective Hamiltonians. While these tools are appropriate for a wide array of applications, we here demonstrate their utility for models that can be realized in circuit-QED settings. Our numerical techniques are available as an open-source Python package, ${\rm qCH_{eff}}$ (this https URL), which uses the CuPy library for GPU-acceleration. We report up to 15x speedup on GPU over CPU for NPAD, and up to 42x speedup for the Magnus expansion (compared to QuTiP), for large system sizes.

Title: Corrections to the Optomechanical Hamiltonian from Quadratic Fluctuations of a Moving Mirror
Authors: Salvatore Butera
Abstract: We extend the theory of the radiation pressure to include quadratic fluctuations in the position of a moving mirror. This enables the introduction of a generalized radiation pressure operator that captures higher-order effects in the mirror-field coupling. For mechanical resonators with frequencies comparable to the fundamental cavity frequency, the resulting corrections to the optomechanical Hamiltonian are quadratic in the standard radiation pressure coupling. These corrections are expected to play a significant role in the strong coupling regime of optomechanics, electromechanics, and superconducting circuit analogs.

Title: Millikelvin Nb nanoSQUID-embedded tuneable resonator fabricated with a neon focused-ion-beam
Authors: Jamie A. Potter, Laith Meti, Gemma Chapman, Ed Romans, John Gallop, Ling Hao
Abstract: SQUID-embedded superconducting resonators are of great interest due to their potential for coupling highly scalable superconducting circuits with quantum memories based on solid-state spin ensembles. Such an application requires a high-$Q$, frequency-tuneable resonator which is both resilient to magnetic field, and able to operate at millikelvin temperatures. These requirements motivate the use of a higher $H_{c}$ metal such as niobium, however the challenge then becomes to sufficiently reduce the operating temperature. We address this by presenting a monolithic Nb nanoSQUID-embedded resonator, where neon focused-ion-beam fabrication of the nanoSQUID results in a device displaying frequency tuneability at $T = 16$ mK. In order to assess the applicability of the device for coupling to small spin clusters, we characterise the flux sensitivity as a function of microwave drive power and externally applied magnetic field, and find that the noise is dominated by dielectric noise in the resonator. Finally, we discuss improvements to the device design which can dramatically improve the flux sensitivity, which highlights the promise of Nb SQUID-embedded resonators for hybrid superconductor-spin applications.

Title: Kramers-protected hardware-efficient error correction with Andreev spin qubits
Authors: Haoran Lu, Isidora Araya Day, Anton R. Akhmerov, Bernard van Heck, Valla Fatemi
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers' point, reflectometry off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective measurement of multiple stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of logical quantum gates. The concept is experimentally feasible.

Title: E-LoQ: Enhanced Locking for Quantum Circuit IP Protection
Authors: Yuntao Liu, Jayden John, Qian Wang
Abstract: In recent years, quantum computing has started to demonstrate superior efficiency to classical computing. In quantum computing, quantum circuits that implement specific quantum algorithms are usually not directly executable on quantum computer hardware. Quantum circuit compilers decompose high-level quantum gates into the hardware's native gates and optimize the circuits for accuracy and performance. However, untrusted quantum compilers risk stealing original quantum designs (quantum circuits), leading to the theft of sensitive intellectual property (IP). In classical computing, logic locking is a family of techniques to secure integrated circuit (ICs) designs against reverse engineering and IP piracy. This technique involves inserting a keyed value into the circuit, ensuring the correct output is achieved only with the correct key. To address similar issues in quantum circuit protection, we propose an enhanced locking technique for quantum circuits (E-LoQ) where multiple key bits can be condensed into one key qubit. Compared to previous work that used one qubit for each key bit, our approach achieves higher security levels. We have demonstrated the practicality of our method through experiments on a set of benchmark quantum circuits. The effectiveness of E-LoQ was measured by assessing the divergence distance from the original circuit. Our results demonstrate that E-LoQ effectively conceals the function of the original quantum circuit, with an average fidelity degradation of less than 1%.

Title: Comparative Performance Analysis of Quantum Machine Learning Architectures for Credit Card Fraud Detection
Authors: Mansour El Alami, Nouhaila Innan, Muhammad Shafique, Mohamed Bennai
Abstract: As financial fraud becomes increasingly complex, effective detection methods are essential. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) introduces certain capabilities that may enhance both accuracy and efficiency in this area. This study examines how different quantum feature map and ansatz configurations affect the performance of three QML-based classifiers-the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), the Sampler Quantum Neural Network (SQNN), and the Estimator Quantum Neural Network (EQNN)-when applied to two non-standardized financial fraud datasets. Different quantum feature map and ansatz configurations are evaluated, revealing distinct performance patterns. The VQC consistently demonstrates strong classification results, achieving an F1 score of 0.88, while the SQNN also delivers promising outcomes. In contrast, the EQNN struggles to produce robust results, emphasizing the challenges presented by non-standardized data. These findings highlight the importance of careful model configuration in QML-based financial fraud detection. By showing how specific feature maps and ansatz choices influence predictive success, this work guides researchers and practitioners in refining QML approaches for complex financial applications.

Title: Genuine quantum non-Gaussianity and metrological sensitivity of Fock states prepared in a mechanical resonator
Authors: Q. Rumman Rahman, Igor Kladarić, Max-Emanuel Kern, Yiwen Chu, Radim Filip, Matteo Fadel
Abstract: Fock states of the quantum harmonic oscillator are fundamental to quantum sensing and information processing, serving as key resources for exploiting bosonic degrees of freedom. Here, we prepare high Fock states in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) by coupling it to a superconducting qubit and applying microwave pulses designed using quantum optimal control. We characterize the experimentally realized states by employing a criterion for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity (QNG) designed to reveal multiphonon contributions. Although energy relaxation and decoherence limit the achievable fidelities, we demonstrate genuine QNG features compatible with Fock state $\vert 6\rangle$, confirming that the prepared states cannot be generated through Gaussian operations on states with up to Fock state $\vert 5\rangle$ contributions. We further investigate the robustness of these QNG features to losses and their utility in sensing displacement amplitudes. In particular, we introduce a hierarchy based on the quantum Fisher information and show that, despite decoherence and measurement imperfections, the prepared states achieve a displacement sensitivity surpassing that of an ideal Fock state $\vert 3\rangle$. Our results have immediate applications in quantum sensing and simulations with HBAR devices.

Title: Universality class of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate far from equilibrium
Authors: SeungJung Huh, Koushik Mukherjee, Kiryang Kwon, Jihoon Seo, Simeon I. Mistakidis, H. R. Sadeghpour, Jae-yoon Choi
Abstract: Scale invariance and self-similarity in physics provide a unified framework to classify phases of matter and dynamical properties near equilibrium in both classical and quantum systems. This paradigm has been further extended to isolated many-body quantum systems driven far from equilibrium, where physical observables exhibit dynamical scaling with universal scaling exponents. Universal dynamics appear in a wide range of scenarios, including cosmology, quark-gluon matter, ultracold atoms, and quantum spin magnets. However, how universal dynamics depend on the symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian in nonequilibrium systems remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we report on the classification of universal coarsening dynamics in a quenched two-dimensional ferromagnetic spinor Bose gas. We observe spatiotemporal scaling of spin correlation functions with distinguishable scaling exponents that characterize binary and diffusive fluids. The universality class of the coarsening dynamics is determined by the symmetry of the order parameter and the dynamics of the topological defects, such as domain walls and vortices. Our results provide a categorization of the universality classes of far from equilibrium quantum dynamics based on symmetry properties of the system.

Title: Quantum Channel Learning
Authors: Mikhail Gennadievich Belov, Victor Victorovich Dubov, Alexey Vladimirovich Filimonov, Vladislav Gennadievich Malyshkin
Abstract: The problem of an optimal mapping between Hilbert spaces $IN$ and $OUT$, based on a series of density matrix mapping measurements $\rho^{(l)} \to \varrho^{(l)}$, $l=1\dots M$, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing the total fidelity $\mathcal{F}=\sum_{l=1}^{M} \omega^{(l)} F\left(\varrho^{(l)},\sum_s B_s \rho^{(l)} B^{\dagger}_s\right)$ subject to probability preservation constraints on Kraus operators $B_s$. For $F(\varrho,\sigma)$ in the form that total fidelity can be represented as a quadratic form with superoperator $\mathcal{F}=\sum_s\left\langle B_s\middle|S\middle| B_s \right\rangle$ (either exactly or as an approximation) an iterative algorithm is developed. The work introduces two important generalizations of unitary learning: 1. $IN$/$OUT$ states are represented as density matrices. 2. The mapping itself is formulated as a mixed unitary quantum channel $A^{OUT}=\sum_s |w_s|^2 \mathcal{U}_s A^{IN} \mathcal{U}_s^{\dagger}$ (no general quantum channel yet). This marks a crucial advancement from the commonly studied unitary mapping of pure states $\phi_l=\mathcal{U} \psi_l$ to a quantum channel, what allows us to distinguish probabilistic mixture of states and their superposition. An application of the approach is demonstrated on unitary learning of density matrix mapping $\varrho^{(l)}=\mathcal{U} \rho^{(l)} \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$, in this case a quadratic on $\mathcal{U}$ fidelity can be constructed by considering $\sqrt{\rho^{(l)}} \to \sqrt{\varrho^{(l)}}$ mapping, and on a quantum channel, where quadratic on $B_s$ fidelity is an approximation -- a quantum channel is then obtained as a hierarchy of unitary mappings, a mixed unitary channel. The approach can be applied to studying quantum inverse problems, variational quantum algorithms, quantum tomography, and more.

Title: Phase-space localization at the lowest Landau level
Authors: Ben Craps, Marine De Clerck, Oleg Evnin, Maxim Pavlov
Abstract: We consider bosons with weak contact interactions in a harmonic trap and focus on states at the lowest Landau level. Motivated by the known nontrivial phase-space topography of the energy functional of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we explore Husimi distributions of quantum energy eigenstates in the classical phase space of the Schroedinger field. With interactions turned off, the energy levels are highly degenerate and the Husimi distributions do not manifest any particular localization properties. With interactions turned on, the degeneracy is lifted, and a selection of energy levels emerges whose Husimi distributions are localized around low-dimensional surfaces in the phase space.

Title: Deformation of a one dimensional ferromagnetic domain wall due to double exchange interaction with a free electron system
Authors: K. Seremetas, X. Zotos
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the energy and conductance of a Bloch or Néel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron system via a double exchange interaction. Minimization of the total energy indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic field larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall system the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall systems the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The energy and conductance are identical for Bloch and Néel magnetic domain walls within this prototype model.

Title: Nonlinear skin modes and fixed-points
Authors: C. Yuce
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice with asymmetrical couplings and various type of nonlinearities to study nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect. Our focus is on the exploration of nonlinear skin modes through a fixed-point perspective. Nonlinearities are shown to have no impact on the spectral region in the semi-infinite system; however, they induce considerable changes when boundaries are present. The spectrum under open boundary conditions is found not to be a subset of the corresponding spectrum under the semi-infinite boundary conditions. We identify distinctive features of nonlinear skin modes, such as power-energy dependence, degeneracy, and power-energy discontinuity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a family of localized modes that are neither skin nor scale-free localized modes is formed with the introduction of a coupling impurity. Additionally, we show that an impurity can induce discrete dark and anti-dark solitons.

Title: SFFT-Based Homogenization: Using Tensor Trains to Enhance FFT-Based Homogenization
Authors: Sascha H. Hauck, Matthias Kabel, Mazen Ali, Nicolas R. Gauger
Abstract: Homogenization is a key technique for approximating the macroscopic properties of materials with microscale heterogeneity. The FFT-based Homogenization method has gained widespread usage due to its computational efficiency and accuracy in handling complex microstructures. However, despite its advantages, the method is limited by speed and memory constraints, particularly when applied to high-resolution discretizations. These limitations affect its scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale simulations or when dealing with highly detailed microstructures. These challenges arise from the fundamental reliance on the Fast Fourier Transform, which imposes inherent restrictions on further advancements. In this paper, we propose a novel SFFT-based Homogenization algorithm that utilizes a Quantized Tensor Train variant of the Quantum Fourier Transform. This method is tailored to the geometry under consideration and offers significant improvements in time complexity and memory efficiency compared to the traditional FFT-based approach while remaining executable on classical hardware. The method is applicable only if a suitable Quantized Tensor Train representation exists for the stiffness operator associated with the underlying geometry.
