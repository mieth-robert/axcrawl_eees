Title: Stratified Cohomological Quantum Codes via Colimits in Ch(R)
Authors: William Boone Samuels
Abstract: We introduce \emph{stratified colimit codes}: stabiliser codes obtained by taking the degree-wise colimit $\mathcal C_\bullet(X):=\operatorname*{colim}_{\sigma\in X}F(\sigma)$ of a functor $F\colon X\to\mathbf{Ch}(R)$ from a finite poset into the category of chain complexes over a commutative ring~$R$. Axioms requiring only transitivity and boundary-compatibility of the morphisms in $F$ ensure that $\partial^2=0$, so the homology $H_\bullet$ and cohomology $H^\bullet$ furnish the usual CSS $Z$- and $X$-type logical sectors; torsion in $H_\bullet$ classifies qudit charges via the universal coefficient sequence. Varying $F$ recovers classical surface and color codes, $\mathbb{RP}^2$ torsion codes, twisted toric families with rate $k\sim d$, and X-cube style fracton models, all without referencing an ambient cell complex. Matrix Smith normal form (PID case) and sparse Gaussian elimination (field case) compute $H_\bullet$ directly, giving LDPC parameters that inherit the sparsity of $F$. Because the construction is ring agnostic and functorial, it extends naturally to code surgery (push-outs) and, at the next categorical level, to bicomplex domain walls. Stratified colimit codes therefore supply a concise algebraic chassis for designing, classifying, and decoding topological and fractal quantum codes without ever drawing a lattice.

Title: No Global Counterfactual Consistency: A Universal epsilon-Robust Quantum No-Go Principle
Authors: Maximilian Ralph Peter von Liechtenstein
Abstract: In this article, we introduce No Global Counterfactual Consistency (NGCC), a new foundational no-go principle generalizing the recently proposed Circular Interaction-Free Paradox (CIFP). NGCC asserts that in any single-world interpretation of quantum mechanics that permits bounded-disturbance (epsilon-counterfactual) measurements, one cannot have a globally consistent assignment of outcomes for a closed network of counterfactual inferences. In essence, if multiple observers perform nearly interaction-free measurements around a closed loop (or any network containing cycles), their locally certain conclusions cannot all be mutually consistent in a single classical narrative. We formalize this as a circular consistency theorem and a family of exclusivity inequalities that any non-contextual, single-world hidden-variable model must satisfy. These constraints extend the CIFP beyond an n-lab ring to arbitrary network topologies, enforcing an NGCC bound on joint outcome probabilities. Quantum mechanics violates these bounds for sufficiently small epsilon, implying that no single-world, non-contextual model (even one allowing slight measurement disturbance) can reproduce the quantum predictions in such scenarios. Rigorous proofs are provided using graph-theoretic methods, semidefinite duality, and multi-cycle exclusivity structures.

Title: Variational Quantum Linear Solver for Simulating Quantum Transport in Nanoscale Semiconductor Devices
Authors: Qimao Yang, Jing Guo
Abstract: This work develops simulation methods that enable the application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) to simulate quantum transport in nanoscale semiconductor devices. Most previous work on VQLS applications in semiconductor device simulations focuses on solving the Poisson equation, where the coefficient matrix of the sparse linear system is real and symmetric. Solving the quantum transport equation, however, leads to coefficient matrices that are complex and non-symmetric. This work addresses the challenges of applying VQLS to quantum transport simulations. We propose new forms of cost functions to solve complex and non-symmetric linear systems with faster computing speed. We further develop efficient decomposition methods for cost function evaluation, which target reducing the quantum circuit complexity and improving noise robustness when solving the quantum transport equation using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. While classical computation faces the challenge of the "curse of dimensionality" as the spatial-energy numerical grid dimensions grow, the proposed quantum-computing-based method scales logarithmically with the grid size, which offers a promising opportunity for addressing the computational challenges of solving quantum transport in semiconductor devices.

Title: Quantum Arithmetic Algorithms: Implementation, Resource Estimation, and Comparison
Authors: Dmytro Fedoriaka, Brian Goldsmith, Yingrong Chen
Abstract: As quantum computing technology advances, the need for optimized arithmetic circuits continues to grow. This paper presents the implementation and resource estimation of a library of quantum arithmetic algorithms, including addition, multiplication, division, and modular exponentiation. Using the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator, we evaluate runtime, qubit usage, and space-time trade-offs and identify the best-performing algorithm for each arithmetic operation. We explore the design space for division, optimize windowed modular exponentiation, and identify the tipping point between multipliers, demonstrating effective applications of resource estimation in quantum research. Additionally, we highlight the impact of parallelization, reset operations, and uncomputation techniques on implementation and resource estimation. Our findings provide both a practical library and a valuable knowledge base for selecting and optimizing quantum arithmetic algorithms in real-world applications.

Title: A Quantum Bagging Algorithm with Unsupervised Base Learners for Label Corrupted Datasets
Authors: Neeshu Rathi, Sanjeev Kumar
Abstract: The development of noise-resilient quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms is critical in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we propose a quantum bagging framework that uses QMeans clustering as the base learner to reduce prediction variance and enhance robustness to label noise. Unlike bagging frameworks built on supervised learners, our method leverages the unsupervised nature of QMeans, combined with quantum bootstrapping via QRAM-based sampling and bagging aggregation through majority voting. Through extensive simulations on both noisy classification and regression tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed quantum bagging algorithm performs comparably to its classical counterpart using KMeans while exhibiting greater resilience to label corruption than supervised bagging methods. This highlights the potential of unsupervised quantum bagging in learning from unreliable data.

Title: Nested Grover's Algorithm for Tree Search
Authors: Andreas Wichert
Abstract: We investigate optimizing quantum tree search algorithms by employing a nested Grover Algorithm. This approach seeks to enhance results compared to previous Grover-based methods by expanding the tree of partial assignments to a specific depth and conducting a quantum search within the subset of remaining assignments. The study explores the implications and constraints of this approach, providing a foundation for quantum artificial intelligence applications. Instead of utilizing conventional heuristic functions that are incompatible with quantum tree search, we introduce the partial candidate solution, which indicates a node at a specific depth of the tree. By employing such a function, we define the concatenated oracle, which enables us to decompose the quantum tree search using Grover algorithm.

Title: Fourier Neural Operators for Time-Periodic Quantum Systems: Learning Floquet Hamiltonians, Observable Dynamics, and Operator Growth
Authors: Zihao Qi, Yang Peng, Christopher Earls
Abstract: Time-periodic quantum systems exhibit a rich variety of far-from-equilibrium phenomena and serve as ideal platforms for quantum engineering and control. However, simulating their dynamics with conventional numerical methods remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension and rapid spreading of entanglement. In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures temporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of time. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary learning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting expectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information spreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while attaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover, FNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different temporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO can extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling access to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the computational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size. Our results establish FNO as a versatile and scalable surrogate for predicting non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing data from near-term quantum computers.

Title: Scaling Bound Entanglement through Local Extensions
Authors: Robin Krebs, Mariami Gachechiladze
Abstract: Entanglement is a central resource in quantum information science, yet its structure in high dimensions remains notoriously difficult to characterize. One of the few general results on high-dimensional entanglement is given by peel-off theorems, which relate the entanglement of a state to that of its lower-dimensional local projections. We build on this idea by introducing local extensions, the inverse process to peel-off projections, which provide a systematic way to construct higher-dimensional entangled states from lower-dimensional ones. This dual perspective leads to general bounds on how the Schmidt number can change under projections and extensions, and reveals new mechanisms for generating bound entangled states of higher dimensionality. As a concrete application, we construct a positive-partial-transpose state of Schmidt number three in local dimensions $4\times 5$, the smallest system known to host such entanglement. We further extend this approach to identify an elegant family of generalized grid states with increasing Schmidt number, including explicit examples of a $7\times 7$ state with Schmidt number four and a $9\times 9$ state with Schmidt number five, suggesting $(d+1)/2$ scaling in odd local dimensions $d\times d$. Taken together, our results provide a constructive toolkit for probing the scaling of bound entanglement in high dimensions.

Title: Quantum algorithms for general nonlinear dynamics based on the Carleman embedding
Authors: David Jennings, Kamil Korzekwa, Matteo Lostaglio, Andrew T Sornborger, Yigit Subasi, Guoming Wang
Abstract: Important nonlinear dynamics, such as those found in plasma and fluid systems, are typically hard to simulate on classical computers. Thus, if fault-tolerant quantum computers could efficiently solve such nonlinear problems, it would be a transformative change for many industries. In a recent breakthrough [Liu et al., PNAS 2021], the first efficient quantum algorithm for solving nonlinear differential equations was constructed, based on a single condition $R<1$, where $R$ characterizes the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation. This result, however, is limited to the class of purely dissipative systems with negative log-norm, which excludes application to many important problems. In this work, we correct technical issues with this and other prior analysis, and substantially extend the scope of nonlinear dynamical systems that can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer in a number of ways. Firstly, we extend the existing results from purely dissipative systems to a much broader class of stable systems, and show that every quadratic Lyapunov function for the linearized system corresponds to an independent $R$-number criterion for the convergence of the Carlemen scheme. Secondly, we extend our stable system results to physically relevant settings where conserved polynomial quantities exist. Finally, we provide extensive results for the class of non-resonant systems. With this, we are able to show that efficient quantum algorithms exist for a much wider class of nonlinear systems than previously known, and prove the BQP-completeness of nonlinear oscillator problems of exponential size. In our analysis, we also obtain several results related to the Poincaré-Dulac theorem and diagonalization of the Carleman matrix, which could be of independent interest.

Title: An Egorov Theorem for Wasserstein Distances
Authors: Jordan Cotler, Felipe Hernández
Abstract: We prove a new version of Egorov's theorem formulated in the Schrödinger picture of quantum mechanics, using the $p$-Wasserstein metric applied to the Husimi functions of quantum states. The special case $p=1$ corresponds to a "low-regularity" Egorov theorem, while larger values $p>1$ yield progressively stronger estimates. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove an optimal transport inequality analogous to a result of Golse and Paul in the context of mean-field many-body quantum mechanics.

Title: Quantum Filtering and Stabilization of Dissipative Quantum Systems via Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
Authors: Shahid Qamar, Rana Imran Mushtaq, Bo Li, Ho-Kin Tang
Abstract: Modeling open quantum dynamics without full knowledge of the system Hamiltonian or noise model is a key challenge in quantum control and quantum state estimation. We introduce an Augmented Quantum Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (AQNODE) framework that learns quantum trajectories and dissipation parameters directly from partial continuous measurement data. By embedding the system into a latent space evolved via neural ODEs, AQNODE captures both observable and hidden non-Markovian dynamics with temporal smoothness and physical consistency. Our approach integrates weak measurement data to reconstruct qubit states and time-dependent decoherence rates, enabling accurate state prediction and parameter inference without explicit physical equations. Furthermore, we incorporate AQNODE-based feedback control techniques, including proportional-derivative and time-varying linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies, to steer the quantum system toward target states in real time. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate AQNODE's ability to generalize across system configurations, achieve low prediction errors, and perform robust quantum filtering and control. These results establish AQNODE as a scalable, differentiable, and experimentally compatible framework for real-time modeling and control of dissipative quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Approximate and Quantum Walk Optimization Approaches to Set Balancing
Authors: Nikhil Kowshik, Sayan Manna, Sudebkumar Prasant Pal
Abstract: We explore the application of variational quantum algorithms to the NP-hard set balancing problem, a critical challenge in clinical trial design and experimental scheduling. The problem is mapped to an Ising model, with tailored Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations and cost Hamiltonians expressed in Pauli-Z form. We implement both the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Quantum Walk Optimization Algorithm (QWOA), evaluating them in separate experimental settings. For QAOA, we perform a comparative analysis of six mixer Hamiltonians (X, XY, Full-SWAP, Ring-SWAP, Grover, and Warm-Started), employing scaled-exponential Pauli-string realizations of the mixer unitaries, which yield superior performance over conventional circuit decompositions. Additionally, we introduce a Shannon-entropy-based post-processing technique that refines solutions by maximizing feature-distribution uniformity across partitions. These results underscore the importance of mixer choice and circuit implementation in enhancing QAOA performance for combinatorial optimization.

Title: Locality, Micro- vs. Macro-, Particle Interpretations and All That: A Lagrangian Approach to the Measurement Problem
Authors: W. David Wick
Abstract: In 2017, this author proposed, as a resolution of the Measurement Problem, that terms be added to Schrodinger's wavefunction equation, rendering it nonlinear. Said equation derived from a trick employed by S. Weinberg in 1989 which may be unfamiliar to most physicists, as well as uninterpretable in terms of local ("particle") interactions. Motivated by A. O. Barut's work on electrodynamics, here I analyze which kinds of nonlinear theories can be derived from Lagrangian field-theory by integrating out some fields. The issues of "What is a local interaction?" and "Might there be Micro- and Macro-fields?" arise. In the end, I will argue that my 2017 theory cannot be given a "particle" interpretation, nor be derived from a splitting into the two categories of fields.

Title: Construction of the Jaynes-Cummings interaction over the finite two-dimensional oscillator
Authors: Alejandro R. Urzúa
Abstract: The interaction between a two-level atom and the finite two-dimensional oscillator in the Cartesian coordinate system is addressed. The construction of the coupling between the degenerate energy states of the finite oscillator and the two levels of the atom allows the identification of an excitation-conserved eigenbasis. A dynamical approach to the evolution of mean values of the fields mediated by the atom is shown in the interaction picture. As an example, the eigenenergies states and $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ coherent states are studied. Perspectives and prospectives are given to settle a path in the study of atomic systems coupled to finite versions of the harmonic oscillator.

Title: Time evolution of controlled many-body quantum systems with matrix product operators
Authors: Llorenç Balada Gaggioli, Jakub Mareček
Abstract: We present a method for describing the time evolution of many-body controlled quantum systems using matrix product operators (MPOs). Existing techniques for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) with an MPO Hamiltonian often rely on time discretization. In contrast, our approach uses the Magnus expansion and Chebyshev polynomials to model the time evolution, and the MPO representation to efficiently encode the system's dynamics. This results in a scalable method that can be used efficiently for many-body controlled quantum systems. We apply this technique to quantum optimal control, specifically for a gate synthesis problem, demonstrating that it can be used for large-scale optimization problems that are otherwise impractical to formulate in a dense matrix representation.

Title: Demonstrating an unconditional separation between quantum and classical information resources
Authors: William Kretschmer, Sabee Grewal, Matthew DeCross, Justin A. Gerber, Kevin Gilmore, Dan Gresh, Nicholas Hunter-Jones, Karl Mayer, Brian Neyenhuis, David Hayes, Scott Aaronson
Abstract: A longstanding goal in quantum information science is to demonstrate quantum computations that cannot be feasibly reproduced on a classical computer. Such demonstrations mark major milestones: they showcase fine control over quantum systems and are prerequisites for useful quantum computation. To date, quantum advantage has been demonstrated, for example, through violations of Bell inequalities and sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments. However, both forms of advantage come with important caveats: Bell tests are not computationally difficult tasks, and the classical hardness of sampling experiments relies on unproven complexity-theoretic assumptions. Here we demonstrate an unconditional quantum advantage in information resources required for a computational task, realized on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer operating at a median two-qubit partial-entangler fidelity of 99.941(7)%. We construct a task for which the most space-efficient classical algorithm provably requires between 62 and 382 bits of memory, and solve it using only 12 qubits. Our result provides the most direct evidence yet that currently existing quantum processors can generate and manipulate entangled states of sufficient complexity to access the exponentiality of Hilbert space. This form of quantum advantage -- which we call quantum information supremacy -- represents a new benchmark in quantum computing, one that does not rely on unproven conjectures.

Title: Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma for Classical-Quantum Dynamical Resources
Authors: Masahito Hayashi, Hayata Yamasaki
Abstract: Channel conversion constitutes a pivotal paradigm in information theory and its applications to quantum physics, providing a unified problem setting that encompasses celebrated results such as Shannon's noisy-channel coding theorem. Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a general framework to study such problems under a prescribed class of operations, such as those for encoding and decoding. In QRTs, quantum states serve as static resources, while quantum channels give rise to dynamical resources. A recent major advance in QRTs is the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which characterizes the optimal error exponent in hypothesis testing to discriminate resource states from free states, enabling a reversible QRT framework for static resources where asymptotic conversion rates are fully determined by the regularized relative entropy of resource. However, applications of QRTs to channel conversion require a framework for dynamical resources. The earlier extension of the reversible framework to a fundamental class of dynamical resources, represented by classical-quantum (CQ) channels, relied on state-based techniques and imposed an asymptotic continuity assumption on operations, which prevented its applicability to conventional channel coding scenarios. To overcome this problem, we formulate and prove a generalized quantum Stein's lemma directly for CQ channels, by developing CQ-channel counterparts of the core proof techniques used in the state setting. Building on this result, we construct a reversible QRT framework for CQ channel conversion that does not require the asymptotic continuity assumption, and show that this framework applies to the analysis of channel coding scenarios. These results establish a fully general toolkit for CQ channel discrimination and conversion, enabling their broad application to core conversion problems for this fundamental class of channels.

Title: Quantum Advantage via Solving Multivariate Polynomials
Authors: Pierre Briaud, Itai Dinur, Riddhi Ghosal, Aayush Jain, Paul Lou, Amit Sahai
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new way to (non-interactively, verifiably) demonstrate quantum advantage by solving the average-case $\mathsf{NP}$ search problem of finding a solution to a system of (underdetermined) constant degree multivariate equations over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$ drawn from a specified distribution. In particular, for any $d \geq 2$, we design a distribution of degree up to $d$ polynomials $\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\}_{i\in [m]}$ for $m<n$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ for which we show that there is a expected polynomial-time quantum algorithm that provably simultaneously solves $\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=y_i\}_{i\in [m]}$ for a random vector $(y_1,\ldots,y_m)$. On the other hand, while solutions exist with high probability, we conjecture that for constant $d > 2$, it is classically hard to find one based on a thorough review of existing classical cryptanalysis. Our work thus posits that degree three functions are enough to instantiate the random oracle to obtain non-relativized quantum advantage. Our approach begins with the breakthrough Yamakawa-Zhandry (FOCS 2022) quantum algorithmic framework. In our work, we demonstrate that this quantum algorithmic framework extends to the setting of multivariate polynomial systems. Our key technical contribution is a new analysis on the Fourier spectra of distributions induced by a general family of distributions over $\mathbb{F}_2$ multivariate polynomials -- those that satisfy $2$-wise independence and shift-invariance. This family of distributions includes the distribution of uniform random degree at most $d$ polynomials for any constant $d \geq 2$. Our analysis opens up potentially new directions for quantum cryptanalysis of other multivariate systems.

Title: Recursive algorithm for constructing antisymmetric fermionic states in first quantization mapping
Authors: E. Rule, I. A. Chernyshev, I. Stetcu, J. Carlson, R. Weiss
Abstract: We devise a deterministic quantum algorithm to produce antisymmetric states of single-particle orbitals in the first quantization mapping. Unlike sorting-based antisymmetrization algorithms, which require ordered input states and high Clifford-gate overhead, our approach initializes the state of each particle independently. For a system of $N$ particles and $N_s$ single-particle states, our algorithm prepares antisymmetrized states of non-trivial localized (e.g., Hartree-Fock) orbitals using $O(N^2\sqrt{N_s})$ $T$-gates, outperforming alternative algorithms when $N\lesssim \sqrt{N_s}$. To achieve such scaling, we require $O(\sqrt{N_s})$ dirty ancilla qubits for intermediate calculations. Knowledge of the single-particle states to be antisymmetrized can be leveraged to further improve the efficiency of the circuit, and a measurement-based variant reduces gate cost by roughly a factor of two. We show example circuits for two- and three-particle systems and discuss the generalization to an arbitrary number of particles. For a specific three-particle example, we decompose the circuit into Clifford$+T$ gates and study the impact of noise on the prepared state.

Title: Compressing Syndrome Measurement Sequences
Authors: Benjamin Anker, Milad Marvian
Abstract: In this work, we analyze a framework for constructing fault-tolerant measurement schedules of varying lengths by combining stabilizer generators, and prove results about the distance of such schedules by combining according to classical codes. Using this framework, we produce explicit measurement schedules sufficient for fault-tolerant error correction of quantum codes of distance $d$ with $r$ independent stabilizer generators using only $O(d \log{r})$ measurements if the code is LDPC, and $O(d \log d \log r)$ measurements if the code is produced via concatenating a smaller code with itself $O(\log d)$ times. In both of these cases the number of measurements can be asymptotically fewer than the number of stabilizer generators which define the code. Although optimizing our construction to use the fewest measurements produces high-weight stabilizers, we also show that we can reduce the number of measurements used for specific examples while maintaining low-weight stabilizer measurements. We numerically examine the performance of our construction on the surface code under several noise models and demonstrate the exponential error suppression with increasing distance which is characteristic of weak fault tolerance.

Title: Performance enhancement in Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers by tailoring the relative distance between junctions
Authors: M.A. Gali Labarias, T. Yamada, Y. Nakashima, Y. Urade, J. Claramunt, K. Inomata
Abstract: Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers with heterogeneously spaced junctions are theoretically investigated. We consider unit cells with three junctions and characterize their interaction by spatially displaced fields defined by node fluxes. To solve this problem we define the system action and apply the variational principle to obtain the static action, which determines the equations of motion. This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be increased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same unit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an optimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth, while equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this method does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at different pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve gains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase matching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998 junctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal sub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can still be achieved at sub-optimal sizes.

Title: Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators
Authors: Valerica Raicu
Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.

Title: Near optimal quantum algorithm for estimating Shannon entropy
Authors: Myeongjin Shin, Kabgyun Jeong
Abstract: We present a near-optimal quantum algorithm, up to logarithmic factors, for estimating the Shannon entropy in the quantum probability oracle model. Our approach combines the singular value separation algorithm with quantum amplitude amplification, followed by the application of quantum singular value transformation. On the lower bound side, we construct probability distributions encoded via Hamming weights in the oracle, establishing a tight query lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Consequently, our results show that the tight query complexity for estimating the Shannon entropy within $\epsilon$-additive error is given by $\tilde{\Theta}\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{n}}{\epsilon}\right)$.

Title: Large-scale Efficient Molecule Geometry Optimization with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing
Authors: Yajie Hao, Qiming Ding, Xiaoting Wang, Xiao Yuan
Abstract: Accurately and efficiently predicting the equilibrium geometries of large molecules remains a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, even with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Two major obstacles hinder progress: the large number of qubits required and the prohibitive cost of conventional nested optimization. In this work, we introduce a co-optimization framework that combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to address these limitations. This approach substantially reduces the required quantum resources, enabling the treatment of molecular systems significantly larger than previously feasible. We first validate our framework on benchmark systems, such as H4 and H2O2, before demonstrating its efficacy in determining the equilibrium geometry of glycolic acid C2H4O3, a molecule of a size previously considered intractable for quantum geometry optimization. Our results show the method achieves high accuracy while drastically lowering computational cost. This work thus represents a significant step toward practical, scalable quantum simulations, moving beyond the small, proof-of-concept molecules that have historically dominated the field. More broadly, our framework establishes a tangible path toward leveraging quantum advantage for the in silico design of complex catalysts and pharmaceuticals.

Title: Carrier-Assisted Entanglement Purification
Authors: Jaemin Kim, Karthik Mohan, Sung Won Yun, Joonwoo Bae
Abstract: Entanglement distillation, a fundamental building block of quantum networks, enables the purification of noisy entangled states shared among distant nodes by local operations and classical communication. Its practical realization presents several technical challenges, including the storage of quantum states in quantum memory and the execution of coherent quantum operations on multiple copies of states within the quantum memory. In this work, we present an entanglement purification protocol via quantum communication, namely a carrier-assisted entanglement purification protocol, which utilizes two elements only: i) quantum memory for a single-copy entangled state shared by parties and ii) single qubits travelling between parties. We show that the protocol, when single-qubit transmission is noiseless, can purify a noisy entangled state shared by parties. When single-qubit transmission is noisy, the purification relies on types of noisy qubit channels; we characterize qubit channels such that the protocol works for the purification. We resolve the limitation by applying multiple qubits over noisy channels, and show that the purification protocol with multi-carrier qubits works through a noisy qubit channel in general, provided that the channels are not entanglement-breaking, i.e., channels that cannot be constructed as measure-and-prepare operations. Our results significantly reduce the experimental overhead needed for distilling entanglement, such as quantum memory and coherent operations, making long-distance pure entanglement closer to a practical realization.

Title: Absorbing detectors meet scattering theory
Authors: Will Cavendish, Siddhant Das
Abstract: Any proposed solution to the "screen problem" in quantum mechanics -- the challenge of predicting the joint distribution of particle arrival times and impact positions -- must align with the extensive data obtained from scattering experiments. In this paper, we conduct a direct consistency check of the Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC) proposal, a prominent approach to address the screen problem, against the predictions derived from scattering theory (ST). Through a series of exactly solvable one- and two-dimensional examples, we demonstrate that the ABC proposal's predictions are in tension with the well-established results of ST. Specifically, it predicts sharp momentum- and screen-orientation-dependent detection probabilities, along with secondary reflections that contradict existing experimental data. We conclude that while it remains possible that physical detectors described by the ABC proposal could be found in the future, the proposal is empirically inadequate as a general solution to the screen problem, as it is inconsistent with the behavior of detectors in standard experimental settings.

Title: Receiver Noise Calibration in CV-QKD accounting for Noise Dynamics
Authors: Guillaume Ricard, Yves Jaouën, Romain Alléaume
Abstract: Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) relies on accurate noise calibration at the receiver to ensure the security of quantum communication. Traditional calibration methods often oversimplify noise characteristics, neglecting the impact of local oscillator (LO) noise and the critical role of noise spectral properties, which can lead to imprecise Shot Noise Calibration (SNC). Our contributions are threefold: 1) we propose an operational framework for calibration, relying on the notion of stationarity 2) in this framework, we give a method allowing us to derive the optimal calibration duration for a given experiment 3) leveraging our knowledge of noise spectral properties, we introduce a novel SNC method. This work also formalizes the calibration procedures, addressing implicit assumptions and providing a better foundation for the certification of CV-QKD protocols, of which calibration is a fundamental part. We demonstrate that our improved calibration technique offers higher performance and higher tolerance to receiver imperfections, which can enhance the performance and cost-effectiveness of CV-QKD systems.

Title: Path Integral Approach to Input-Output Theory
Authors: Aaron Daniel, Matteo Brunelli, Aashish A. Clerk, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: Input-output theory is a well-known tool in quantum optics and ubiquitous in the description of quantum systems probed by light. Owing to the generality of the setup it describes, the theory finds application in a wide variety of experiments in circuit and cavity QED. We present an approach to input-output theory using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism that gives us direct access to the full output field statistics such as the first and second order coherence functions. By making the rich toolbox of non-equilibrium quantum field theory accessible, our formalism greatly simplifies the treatment of nonlinear systems and provides a uniform way of obtaining perturbative results. We showcase this particular strength by computing the output field statistics of a Kerr nonlinear oscillator at finite temperatures through the use of diagrams and diagram summation techniques. We find a reduction in reflection that is not due to photon leakage but rather associated to the squeezing of the output light.

Title: On the Complexity of Quantum States and Circuits from the Orthogonal and Symplectic Groups
Authors: Oxana Shaya, Zoë Holmes, Christoph Hirche, Armando Angrisani
Abstract: Understanding the complexity of quantum states and circuits is a central challenge in quantum information science, with broad implications in many-body physics, high-energy physics and quantum learning theory. A common way to model the behaviour of typical states and circuits involves sampling unitary transformations from the Haar measure on the unitary group. In this work, we depart from this standard approach and instead study structured unitaries drawn from other compact connected groups, namely the symplectic and special orthogonal groups. By leveraging the concentration of measure phenomenon, we establish two main results. We show that random quantum states generated using symplectic or orthogonal unitaries typically exhibit an exponentially large strong state complexity, and are nearly orthogonal to one another. Similar behavior is observed for designs over these groups. Additionally, we demonstrate the average-case hardness of learning circuits composed of gates drawn from such classical groups of unitaries. Taken together, our results demonstrate that structured subgroups can exhibit a complexity comparable to that of the full unitary group.

Abstract: We present a framework for simultaneously estimating all four real parameters of a general two-channel unitary U(2) with Heisenberg-scaling precision. We derive analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information matrix and show that all parameters attain the 1/N scaling in the precision by using experimentally feasible Gaussian probes such as two-mode squeezed states or two single-mode squeezed states. Our results extend multiparameter metrology to its most general two-mode setting and establish concrete design principles for experimental implementations of Heisenberg-scaling, multi-parameter optical interferometry with experimentally feasible resources. It not only sheds light on the fundamental interface between quantum interference of squeezed light and quantum metrological advantage in multiparameter estimation, but it also provides an important stepstone towards the development of a wide range of quantum technologies based on distributed quantum metrology in arbitrary optical networks.

Title: All you need is controlled-V: universality of a standard two-qubit gate by catalytic embedding
Authors: Robin Kaarsgaard
Abstract: We present an encoding that renders the controlled-V gate (also known as controlled-$\sqrt{X}$) computationally universal in isolation. Specifically, we show that this gate can simulate the universal Clifford+Toffoli gate set with at most two clean auxiliary qubits and a constant overhead in gate count, and that an additional auxiliary qubit suffices to simulate Clifford+T. Our result settles an open question on the expressiveness of De Vos' gate set based on Negators, and shows that the two-qubit gate $SU^{(\tau)}$ due to Sleator and Weinfurter is capable of universal quantum computation even for rational choices of $\tau$.

Title: From Classical Data to Quantum Advantage -- Quantum Policy Evaluation on Quantum Hardware
Authors: Daniel Hein, Simon Wiedemann, Markus Baumann, Patrik Felbinger, Justin Klein, Maximilian Schieder, Jonas Stein, Daniëlle Schuman, Thomas Cope, Steffen Udluft
Abstract: Quantum policy evaluation (QPE) is a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm which is quadratically more efficient than an analogous classical Monte Carlo estimation. It makes use of a direct quantum mechanical realization of a finite Markov decision process, in which the agent and the environment are modeled by unitary operators and exchange states, actions, and rewards in superposition. Previously, the quantum environment has been implemented and parametrized manually for an illustrative benchmark using a quantum simulator. In this paper, we demonstrate how these environment parameters can be learned from a batch of classical observational data through quantum machine learning (QML) on quantum hardware. The learned quantum environment is then applied in QPE to also compute policy evaluations on quantum hardware. Our experiments reveal that, despite challenges such as noise and short coherence times, the integration of QML and QPE shows promising potential for achieving quantum advantage in RL.

Title: Variational Quantum Circuits in Offline Contextual Bandit Problems
Authors: Lukas Schulte, Daniel Hein, Steffen Udluft, Thomas A. Runkler
Abstract: This paper explores the application of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for solving offline contextual bandit problems in industrial optimization tasks. Using the Industrial Benchmark (IB) environment, we evaluate the performance of quantum regression models against classical models. Our findings demonstrate that quantum models can effectively fit complex reward functions, identify optimal configurations via particle swarm optimization (PSO), and generalize well in noisy and sparse datasets. These results provide a proof of concept for utilizing VQCs in offline contextual bandit problems and highlight their potential in industrial optimization tasks.

Title: Process Tensor Approaches to Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Jonathan Keeling, E. Miles Stoudenmire, Mari-Carmen Bañuls, David R. Reichman
Abstract: The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the system of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective environment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of quantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common approach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches based on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are indeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread application of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by accuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases, such as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is structured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes of the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation of information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real problems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as it is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be practical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of techniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the notion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process tensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door to the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a wide range of open quantum systems.

Title: On-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in tantalum superconducting circuits on silicon for scalable quantum technologies
Authors: Shima Poorgholam-Khanjari, Paniz Foshat, Mingqi Zhang, Valentino Seferai, Martin Weides, Kaveh Delfanazari
Abstract: The performance and scalability of superconducting quantum circuits are fundamentally constrained by non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which induce microwave losses that limit resonator quality factors and qubit coherence times. Understanding and mitigating these excitations is therefore central to advancing scalable quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate on-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in high-Q {\alpha}-tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon, operated in the single-photon regime. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal persistent non-equilibrium quasiparticles at millikelvin temperatures, producing a measurable suppression of the internal quality factor (Qi) relative to theoretical expectations. By benchmarking across materials, we find that the quasiparticle density in {\alpha}-Ta is approximately one-third that of NbN at equivalent normalised temperatures (T/Tc), directly correlating with reduced microwave loss. Our methodology establishes a scalable platform for probing quasiparticle dynamics and points towards new routes for engineering superconducting circuits with improved coherence, with impact on qubit readout resonators, kinetic-inductance detectors, and emerging quantum processors and sensors.

Title: Simulation of one and two qubit superconducting quantum gates under the non-Markovian $1/f$ noise
Authors: Yinjia Chen, Shuocang Zhang, Qiang Shi
Abstract: Non-Markovian $1/f$ noise consists a dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits, yet its slow nature poses a significant challenge for accurate simulation. Here we develop a hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) framework that enables efficient and reliable modeling of qubit dynamics and gate operations under $1/f$ noise. By using the approach, it is first shown that perturbative quantum master equations may fail to reproduce the correct dephasing dynamics of a qubit coupled to slow baths. We then analyze dynamical decoupling sequences by including effects of finite pulse duration. It is found that different pulse sequences results in different behavior in error accumulation: all X-CPMG sequences exhibit linear scaling with parity effects, Y-CPMG follows quadratic growth, and alternating XY-type sequences can suppress the error accumulation significantly. Finally, we extend the framework to two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gates, reconstructing the full Choi matrix and Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) to identify the incoherent error induced by $1/f$ noise. Together, these results establish HEOM as a robust methodology for simulating the environmental noise in superconducting circuits and provide new insights into error mechanisms in both single- and two-qubit gates.

Title: Weakly-Driven Quantum Walks for Memory-Constrained Pauli Channel Learning
Authors: Yuan-Zhuo Wang, Yi-Ran Xiao, Ming-Yang Li, Shengjun Wu, Zeng-Bing Chen
Abstract: Accurate characterization of quantum noise, exemplified by the Pauli channel, is a cornerstone for building fault-tolerant quantum computers. A recent protocol (PRX Quantum 6, 020323 (2025)) combining channel concatenation and quantum memory has achieved an exponential reduction in measurement complexity for Pauli channel estimation. This efficiency, however, hinges on using logarithmic quantum memory to suppress hypothesis test errors. In this work, we introduce a mechanism termed the ``weakly-driven quantum walk'' to mitigate the demand for high-quality quantum memory. By exploiting the distinct dynamical properties of quantum walks under biased versus unbiased driving, our algorithm lowers the quantum memory overhead to a constant order while preserving the exponential advantage in measurement complexity. By analogy with weak measurement, our introduced concept of ``weak driving'' preserves pointer coherence even when driven by classical probabilistic information, a principle that may inspire new approaches to similar quantum algorithm design and quantum sensing of weak signals in resource-constrained scenarios.

Title: A Tensor Network Framework for Lindbladian Spectra and Steady States
Authors: Philipp Westhoff, Mattia Moroder, Ulrich Schollwöck, Sebastian Paeckel
Abstract: Quantum systems coupled to (non-)Markovian environments attract increasing attention due to their peculiar physical properties. Exciting prospects such as unconventional non-equilibrium phases beyond the Mermin-Wagner limit, or the environment-assisted, robust preparation of highly entangled states, demand a systematic analysis of quantum many-body phases out of equilibrium. Akin to the equilibrium case, this requires the computation of the low-lying eigenstates of Lindbladians, a problem challenging conventional approaches for simulating quantum many-body systems. Here, we undertake a first step to overcome this limitation and introduce a tensor-network-based framework to compute systematically not only steady states, but also low-lying excited states with unprecedented precision for large, driven quantum many-body systems. Our framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems, suitable also for non-Markovian environments.

Title: Measuring the non-Abelian Quantum Phase with the Algorithm of Quantum Phase Estimation
Authors: Seng Ghee Tan, Son Hsien Chen, Ying-Cheng Yang, Yen-Fu Chen, Yen-Lin Chen, Chia-Hsiu Hsieh
Abstract: We propose an approach to measure the quantum phase of an electron in a non-Abelian system using the algorithm of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The discrete-path systems were previously studied in the context of square or rectangular rings. Present focus is on measuring the quantum phases. The merit of the algorithm approach is two-fold. First off, it eliminates the need for an interferometric set up. Quantum phase is measured by reading off of measurable qubit states of the QPE modules. Secondly, the QPE works by subjecting the quantum state to a sequence of quantum computing operations that eventually map the phase information into measurable qubit states. All the operations are realizable by standard quantum computer gates and algorithms, placing the new effort within the reach of standard quantum computational framework.

Title: Computation of the Smooth Max-Mutual Information via Semidefinite Programming
Authors: Christopher Popp, Tobias C. Sutter, Beatrix C. Hiesmayr
Abstract: We present an iterative algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) for computing the quantum smooth max-mutual information $I^\varepsilon_{\max}(\rho_{AB})$ of bipartite quantum states in any dimension. The algorithm is accurate if a rank condition for marginal states within the smoothing environment is satisfied and provides an upper bound otherwise. Central to our method is a novel SDP, for which we establish primal and dual formulations and prove strong duality. With the direct application of bounding the one-shot distillable key of a quantum state, this contribution extends SDP-based techniques in quantum information theory. Thereby it improves the capabilities to compute or estimate information measures with application to various quantum information processing tasks.

Title: Toward Quantum Utility in Finance: A Robust Data-Driven Algorithm for Asset Clustering
Authors: Shivam Sharma, Supreeth Mysore Venkatesh, Pushkin Kachroo
Abstract: Clustering financial assets based on return correlations is a fundamental task in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage. However, classical clustering methods often fall short when dealing with signed correlation structures, typically requiring lossy transformations and heuristic assumptions such as a fixed number of clusters. In this work, we apply the Graph-based Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) to directly cluster signed, weighted graphs without relying on such transformations. GCS-Q formulates each partitioning step as a QUBO problem, enabling it to leverage quantum annealing for efficient exploration of exponentially large solution spaces. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world financial data, benchmarking against state-of-the-art classical algorithms such as SPONGE and k-Medoids. Our experiments demonstrate that GCS-Q consistently achieves higher clustering quality, as measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties, while dynamically determining the number of clusters. These results highlight the practical utility of near-term quantum computing for graph-based unsupervised learning in financial applications.

Title: Modeling Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers with electromagnetic and circuit co-simulation
Authors: Likai Yang, Jennifer Wang, Mohamed Awida Hassan, Philip Krantz, Kevin P. O'Brien
Abstract: Optimizing the performance of cryogenic quantum amplifiers is a key step toward achieving high-fidelity and scalable qubit readout. In this work, we present efficient and accurate modeling of a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) based on electromagnetic (EM) and circuit co-simulation. In contrast to conventional simulation methods where an equivalent lumped-element circuit model of the JTWPA is required, we directly perform full EM analysis of the device to faithfully determine the linear response. The extracted S-parameters are then fed into a nonlinear harmonic balance simulator with Josephson junctions represented as circuit elements. The simulated linear and gain properties are compared with experimental results and show good agreement.

Title: Nonlinear Co-simulation for Designing Kinetic Inductance Parametric Amplifiers
Authors: Likai Yang, Yufeng Wu, Chaofan Wang, Mingrui Xu, Hong X. Tang, Mohamed A. Hassan, Eric T. Holland
Abstract: Kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers (KIPAs) have been widely studied for small-signal detection in superconducting quantum circuits. In this work, we demonstrate the modeling of a niobium nitride nanowire based KIPA using electromagnetic (EM) and circuit co-simulation, and compare the outcomes with experimental results. EM analysis is first performed on the device layout, taking into account the linear part of the kinetic inductance. The results are then integrated into a harmonic balance circuit simulator, in which the current-dependent inductance is modeled by representing the nanowire as a nonlinear inductor. Both linear and nonlinear responses of the device, including temperature-dependent resonance spectra and parametric gain, are extracted and show good agreement with experiments. We further show that when the KIPA operates as a degenerate amplifier, its phase-sensitive behavior can be accurately reproduced by the simulation. Our technique can serve as a valuable enabler for the simulation and design of quantum parametric amplifiers and superconducting kinetic inductance devices.

Title: An analysis of Wigner's friend in the framework of quantum mechanics based on the principle of typicality
Authors: Kohtaro Tadaki
Abstract: The notion of probability plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. It appears in quantum mechanics as the Born rule. In modern mathematics which describes quantum mechanics, however, probability theory means nothing other than measure theory, and therefore any operational characterization of the notion of probability is still missing in quantum mechanics. In our former works [K. Tadaki, arXiv:1804.10174], based on the toolkit of algorithmic randomness, we presented a refinement of the Born rule, called the principle of typicality, for specifying the property of results of measurements in an operational way. The Wigner's friend paradox is a Gedankenexperiment regarding when and where the reduction of the state vector occurs in a chain of the measurements by several observers where the state of the consciousness of each observer is measured by the subsequent observer, except for the last observer in the chain. It is one of the central open questions in the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we make an analysis of the Wigner's friend paradox in the framework of quantum mechanics based on the principle of typicality. We then draw common sense conclusions about the Wigner's friend paradox. In addition, we make a prediction, which is testable in principle, about its variant proposed by Deutsch.

Title: Existence and nonexistence of commutativity gadgets for entangled CSPs
Authors: Eric Culf, Josse van Dobben de Bruyn, Matthijs Vernooij, Peter Zeman
Abstract: Commutativity gadgets allow NP-hardness proofs for classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) to be carried over to undecidability proofs for the corresponding entangled CSPs. This has been done, for instance, for NP-complete boolean CSPs and 3-colouring in the work of Culf and Mastel. For many CSPs over larger alphabets, including $k$-colouring when $k \geq 4$, it is not known whether or not commutativity gadgets exist, or if the entangled CSP is decidable. In this paper, we study commutativity gadgets and prove the first known obstruction to their existence. We do this by extending the definition of the quantum automorphism group of a graph to the quantum endomorphism monoid of a CSP, and showing that a CSP with non-classical quantum endomorphism monoid does not admit a commutativity gadget. In particular, this shows that no commutativity gadget exists for $k$-colouring when $k \geq 4$. However, we construct a commutativity gadget for an alternate way of presenting $k$-colouring as a nonlocal game, the oracular setting. Furthermore, we prove an easy to check sufficient condition for the quantum endomorphism monoid to be non-classical, extending a result of Schmidt for the quantum automorphism group of a graph, and use this to give examples of CSPs that do not admit a commutativity gadget. We also show that existence of oracular commutativity gadgets is preserved under categorical powers of graphs; existence of commutativity gadgets and oracular commutativity gadgets is equivalent for graphs with no four-cycle; and that the odd cycles and the odd graphs have a commutative quantum endomorphism monoid, leaving open the possibility that they might admit a commutativity gadget.

Title: Dynamic LOCC Circuits for Automated Entanglement Manipulation
Authors: Xia Liu, Jiayi Zhao, Benchi Zhao, Xin Wang
Abstract: Due to the limited qubit number of quantum devices, distributed quantum computing is considered a promising pathway to overcome this constraint. In this paradigm, multiple quantum processors are interconnected to form a cohesive computational network, and the most natural set of free operations is local operations and classical communication (LOCC). However, designing a practical LOCC protocol for a particular task has been a tough problem. In this work, we propose a general and flexible framework called dynamic LOCCNet (DLOCCNet) to simulate and design LOCC protocols. We demonstrate its effectiveness in two key applications: entanglement distillation and distributed state discrimination. The protocols designed by DLOCCNet, in contrast to conventional ones, can solve larger-sized problems with reduced training time, making the framework a practical and scalable tool for current quantum devices. This work advances our understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LOCC while providing a powerful methodology for protocol design.

Title: Improving fermionic variational quantum eigensolvers with Majorana swap networks
Authors: D.E. Fisher, S.A. Fldzhyan, D.V. Minaev, S.S. Straupe, M.Yu. Saygin
Abstract: Simulating computationally hard fermionic systems is a promising application of quantum computing. However, mapping nonlocal fermionic operators to qubits often produces deep circuits, rendering such simulations impractical on near-term hardware. We introduce two Majorana swap network techniques for variational quantum eigensolvers that reduce circuit depth and two-qubit gate count, thereby limiting error accumulation. First, we develop a cyclic compilation algorithm that localizes all two-particle interaction terms in a general fermionic Hamiltonian that contains $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ such terms, using only $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ auxiliary Majorana-swap gates, where $n$ is the number of fermionic modes. This algorithm targets all-to-all qubit connectivity (e.g., trapped-ion processors) and can be used to compactify UCCGSD circuits. Second, we design a Majorana swap network for the UpCCGSD variational ansatz, which is already more compact than UCCGSD. Our network achieves asymptotic reductions in circuit depth and gate count of approximately 50% and 20%, respectively, under all-to-all connectivity. For the more restricted $2\times N$ connectivity, the reductions are even larger -- about 55% (circuit depth) and 40% (gate count). These improvements translate directly into increased robustness to hardware noise, as demonstrated by numerical simulations on representative examples.

Title: The Compressed Oracle is a Worthy (Multiplicative) Adversary
Authors: Stacey Jeffery, Sebastian Zur
Abstract: The compressed oracle technique, introduced in the context of quantum cryptanalysis, is the latest method for proving quantum query lower bounds, and has had an impressive number of applications since its introduction, due in part to the ease of importing classical lower bound intuition into the quantum setting via this method. Previously, the main quantum query lower bound methods were the polynomial method, the adversary method, and the multiplicative adversary method, and their relative powers were well understood. In this work, we situate the compressed oracle technique within this established landscape, by showing that it is a special case of the multiplicative adversary method. To accomplish this, we introduce a simplified restriction of the multiplicative adversary method, the MLADV method, that remains powerful enough to capture the polynomial method and exhibit a strong direct product theorem, but is much simpler to reason about. We show that the compressed oracle technique is also captured by the MLADV method. This might make the MLADV method a promising direction in the current quest to extend the compressed oracle technique to non-product distributions.

Title: Effective approach to open systems with probability currents and the Grothendieck formalism
Authors: A. Vourdas
Abstract: An effective approach to open systems and irreversible phenomena is presented, where an open system $\Sigma(d)$ with $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, is a subsystem of a larger isolated system $\Sigma(2d)$ (the `full universe') with $2d$-dimensional Hilbert space. A family of Bargmann-like representations (called $z$-Bargmann representations) introduces naturally the larger space. The $z$-Bargmann representations are defined through semi-unitary matrices (which are a coherent states formalism in disguise). The `openness' of the system is quantified with the probability current that flows from the system to the external world. The Grothendieck quantity ${\cal Q}$ is shown to be related to the probability current, and is used as a figure of merit for the `openness' of a system. ${\cal Q}$ is expressed in terms of `rescaling transformations' which change not only the phase but also the absolute value of the wavefunction, and are intimately linked to irreversible phenomena (e.g., damping/amplification). It is shown that unitary transformations in the isolated system $\Sigma(2d)$ (full universe), reduce to rescaling transformations when projected to its open subsystem $\Sigma(d)$. The values of the Grothendieck ${\cal Q}$ for various quantum states in an open system, are compared with those for their counterpart states in an isolated system.

Title: Quantum Walks for Chemical Reaction Networks
Authors: Seenivasan Hariharan, Sebastian Zur, Sachin Kinge, Lucas Visscher, Kareljan Schoutens, Stacey Jeffery
Abstract: We lay the foundation for a quantum algorithmic framework to analyse fixed-structure chemical reaction networks (CRNs) using quantum random walks (QRWs) via electrical circuit theory. We model perturbations to CRNs, such as, species injections that shift steady-state concentrations, while keeping the underlying species-reaction graph fixed. Under physically meaningful mass-action constraints, we develop quantum algorithms that (i) decide reachability of target species after perturbation, (ii) sample representative reachable species, (iii) approximate steady-state fluxes through reactions, and (iv) estimate total Gibbs free-energy consumption. Our approach offers new tools for analysing the structure and energetics of complex CRNs, and opens up the prospect of scalable quantum algorithms for chemical and biochemical reaction networks.

Title: Quartz phononic crystal resonators for hybrid acoustic quantum memories
Authors: Yang Hu, Angad Gupta, Jacob Repicky, Michael Hatridge, Thomas P. Purdy
Abstract: Circuit quantum acoustodynamics systems have emerged as a promising platform for quantum information by coupling superconducting qubits to mechanical resonators, with their long-lived mechanical modes serving as quantum memories. We demonstrate suspended quartz phononic crystal resonators at 100 MHz with millisecond lifetimes at 8 K. With a contactless electrode geometry suppressing both two-level system losses and other electrode-induced energy dissipation, we evaluate the piezoelectric coupling rate between the mechanical modes and fluxonium qubits (resonant coupling) and transmon qubits (parametric coupling mediated by a Josephon-junction-based three-wave mixer). We further discuss multi-period defect geometries for enhancing these coupling rates.

Title: A Non-Monotonic Relationship: An Empirical Analysis of Hybrid Quantum Classifiers for Unseen Ransomware Detection
Authors: Huu Phu Le, Phuc Hao Do, Vo Hoang Long Nguyen, Nang Hung Van Nguyen
Abstract: Detecting unseen ransomware is a critical cybersecurity challenge where classical machine learning often fails. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents a potential alternative, its application is hindered by the dimensionality gap between classical data and quantum hardware. This paper empirically investigates a hybrid framework using a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) interfaced with a high-dimensional dataset via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our analysis reveals a dual challenge for practical QML. A significant information bottleneck was evident, as even the best performing 12-qubit VQC fell short of the classical baselines 97.7\% recall. Furthermore, a non-monotonic performance trend, where performance degraded when scaling from 4 to 8 qubits before improving at 12 qubits suggests a severe trainability issue. These findings highlight that unlocking QMLs potential requires co-developing more efficient data compression techniques and robust quantum optimization strategies.

Title: Cross-Resonant Gates in Hybrid Fluxonium-Transmon Systems
Authors: Nikola D. Dimitrov, Chen Wang, Vladimir E. Manucharyan, Maxim G. Vavilov
Abstract: We propose a scalable fluxonium-transmon-fluxonium (FTF) system that utilizes a central transmon to mediate high-fidelity gates and parity checks between two fluxonium qubits without the need for strong non-local interactions. This approach suppresses unwanted long-range interactions, which is critical for developing larger quantum processors. First, we analyze the performance of cross-resonance (CR) CNOT gates between a fluxonium and a transmon. We show that even in the presence of a spectator qubit, these gates maintain high fidelity with coherent errors on the order of $10^{-5}$. We then demonstrate that these gates, when applied sequentially, enable high-fidelity parity checks and logical fluxonium-fluxonium CNOT gates. In addition, the central transmon can facilitate the readout of the neighboring fluxoniums, consolidating multiple critical functions into a single ancilla. Our work establishes the viability of a dual-species architecture as a promising path toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Improved Hamiltonian learning and sparsity testing through Bell sampling
Authors: Savar D. Sinha, Yu Tong
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning an $M$-sparse Hamiltonian and the related problem of Hamiltonian sparsity testing. Through a detailed analysis of Bell sampling, we reduce the total evolution time required by the state-of-the-art algorithm for $M$-sparse Hamiltonian learning to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(M/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the $\ell^{\infty}$ error, achieving an improvement by a factor of $M$ (ignoring the logarithmic factor) while only requiring access to forward time-evolution. We then establish a connection between Hamiltonian learning and Hamiltonian sparsity testing through Bell sampling, which enables us to propose a Hamiltonian sparsity testing with state-of-the-art total evolution time scaling.

Title: Iterative model of self-referential quantum evolution
Authors: Andrei Galiautdinov
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a toy model of a quantum physical device capable of internal, self-referential deliberation, realized through iterative, branch-dependent unitary evolution tracked by control, memory, and policy registers. The key idea is to represent ``deliberation'' as a coherent branching process, in which alternative candidate evolutions are maintained in superposition across registers, rather than by placing the system itself under a literal superposition of Hamiltonians. We provide explicit quantum circuit realizations, carry through detailed step-by-step derivations of the entangled memory--policy dynamics, and analyze the constraints imposed by the no-cloning theorem on coherent information flow. We also briefly discuss categorical reformulations and their conceptual implications. Taken together, this frames the model as a plausible setting for exploring how such devices may maintain multiple alternatives in parallel, providing a formal framework for investigating internally coherent decision processes through coherent branching, entanglement, and self-modifying unitary dynamics.

Title: Circuit Knitting for Continuous-Variable Quantum States
Authors: Shao-Hua Hu, Ray-Kuang Lee
Abstract: In finite-dimensional systems, circuit knitting can be used to simulate non-classical quantum operations using a limited set of resources. In this work, we extend circuit knitting techniques to infinite-dimensional quantum systems. We develop a general theoretical framework for simulating non-Gaussian states from the given set of available states. Also, we establish fundamental constraints with the no-go theorem on the circuit knitting of multi-mode Gaussian operations, by showing that the exact knitting with separable operations requires infinite sampling overhead. We further explore several applications of our theory, including simulation of approximate Fock states, GKP state generation, and cat-state amplification.

Title: The thermodynamics of readout devices and semiclassical gravity
Authors: Samuel Fedida, Adrian Kent
Abstract: We analyse the common claim that nonlinear modifications of quantum theory necessarily violate the second law of thermodynamics. We focus on hypothetical extensions of quantum theory that contain readout devices. These black boxes provide a classical description of quantum states without perturbing them. They allow quantum state cloning, though in a way consistent with the relativistic no-signalling principle. We review the existence of such devices in the context of Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity, which postulates that the gravitational field remains classical and is sourced by the expectation value of a quantum energy-momentum tensor. We show that the definition of information in the models examined in this paper deviates from that given by von Neumann entropy, and that claims of second law violations based on the distinguishability of non-orthogonal states or on violations of uncertainty principles fail to hold in such theories.

Title: Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras
Authors: Meng Sun, Bowen Yang, Zongyuan Wang, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l+1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l-2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l+1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l-1)$ dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.

Title: Quantum control of exciton motion in electric field
Authors: Yingjia Li, Jorge Casanova, Xi Chen, E. Ya. Sherman
Abstract: We study quantum control of classical motion of a two-dimensional exciton by optimizing the time-dependent electric field of a stripe-like gate acting on the exciton and inducing its time-dependent quantum dipole moment. We propose a search method that significantly reduces computational requirements while efficiently identifying optimal control parameters. By leveraging this method, one can precisely manipulate the exciton's final position and velocity over a specified evolution time. These results can be applied for control of exciton fluxes and population, and for spatially resolved light emission in two-dimensional semiconducting structures.

Title: Exact large deviations and emergent long-range correlations in sequential quantum East circuits
Authors: Jimin Li, Bruno Bertini, Juan P. Garrahan, Robert L. Jack
Abstract: Exploiting quantum measurements is a promising route for preparation of correlated quantum states. We use methods from large deviation theory to solve this problem exactly for a specific system: the deterministic quantum East circuit with boundary measurements. We show that conditioning on measurement outcomes generates a long-range correlated state, despite typical trajectories being trivial. We derive the channel that optimally realizes the rare measurement trajectories, and establish a formal connection with the Petz recovery (time-reversal) map. We compute one- and two-point correlation functions in the conditioned state, revealing finite two-body correlations at arbitrarily large separations, and an underlying fractal structure, related to the Sierpiński triangle. These results demonstrate explicitly how boundary measurements can be used to control bulk properties of a quantum system.

Abstract: Optical systems capable of generating fields with sub-wavelength spatial features have become standard in science and engineering research and industry. Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales. We use a single trapped atomic ion, confined to approximately 40 nm X 40 nm X 180 nm to sense a laser light field at a wavelength of 370 nm. With its spatial extent smaller than the absorption cross-section of a resonant detector, the ion-sensor operates at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution. Our technique relies on developing an analytical model of the ion-light interaction and using the model to extract the intensity and polarization. An important insight provided in this work is also that the inverse of this model can be learned, in a restricted sense, on a deep neural network, speeding up the intensity and polarization readout by five orders of magnitude. This speed-up makes the technique field-deployable to characterize optical instruments by probing light at the sub-wavelength scale.

Title: Quantum Fisher Information as a Measure of Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Shion Yamashika, Shimpei Endo, Hiroyasu Tajima
Abstract: Symmetry breaking underlies diverse phenomena from phase transitions in condensed matter to fundamental interactions in gauge theories. Despite many proposed indicators, a general quantification of symmetry breaking that is faithful, computable, and valid in the thermodynamic limit has remained elusive. Here, within quantum resource theory, we propose the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as such a measure. We demonstrate its utility by computing QFI for paradigmatic models: in the BCS superconductor, the QFI counts the number of Cooper pairs; in the transverse-field XY spin chains, it captures topological phase transition that has no local order parameter; and in quantum quench dynamics, it allows us to exactly derive the microscopic origin and conditions of the quantum Mpemba effect in terms of excitation propagation, including in the thermodynamic limit--beyond the reach of previous analyses. Our results show that the QFI, which is a complete resource monotone in the resource theory of asymmetry that plays the role of entanglement entropy in entanglement theory, faithfully captures symmetry breaking in condensed-matter systems. These results highlight the QFI as a universal and physically meaningful diagnostic of symmetry breaking in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

Title: Steady state diagram of interacting fermionic atoms coupled to dissipative cavities
Authors: Luisa Tolle, Ameneh Sheikhan, Thierry Giamarchi, Corinna Kollath, Catalin-Mihai Halati
Abstract: We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.

Title: Different Phases in a Dissipative Rydberg Lattice : Roles of Occupancy and On-site Interaction
Authors: Suvechha Indu, Aniruddha Biswas, Raka Dasgupta
Abstract: We study a two-level dissipative non-equilibrium bosonic Rydberg system in an optical lattice, where multiple atoms can occupy a single site. The system is treated using two different approaches: solution of the master equation using a mean-field approximation, and direct numerical simulation of an equivalent quantum model. It is found that, depending on the on-site interaction strength, the system can either be uniform or have an antiferromagnet-like density-wave structure in terms of the Rydberg excitation distribution. Our mean-field treatment detects an interesting oscillatory phase as well, but the numerical simulation in 1D does not capture it. The origin of all these phases are investigated by studying the spatial correlations, and by calculating the fixed points of the dynamics. It is observed that an initial population difference across the sublattices helps to enhance the density-wave order. The scaling behavior of the system is also analyzed and a signature of weak universality is obtained.

Title: Fluctuation-dissipation bounds for time-dependently driven conductors
Authors: Ludovico Tesser, José Balduque, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: We analyze the noise in a multi-terminal multi-channel conductor under arbitrary time-dependent driving and subject to -- possibly large -- static potential and temperature biases. We show that the full out-of-equilibrium zero-frequency noise is constrained by a fluctuation-dissipation bound. It consists of an upper bound expressed in terms of weighted current components of the separate Floquet bands arising from the time-dependent driving. In the limit of large static temperature bias, it has an intuitive interpretation in terms of the dissipated powers due to the static potential bias and due to the time-dependent driving. Furthermore, we show the existence of a second bound that relies on the specific shape of the electron distribution resulting from the driving, which is often even tighter than the fluctuation-dissipation bound. We show the implications of our bounds at the simple, but experimentally relevant example of a two-terminal conductor in the presence of an ac bias.

Title: Particle Collisions & Quantum Entanglement in High-Energy Collisions
Authors: Emidio Gabrielli
Abstract: The exploration of fundamental quantum phenomena, such as entanglement and Bell inequality violations$-$extensively studied in low-energy regimes$-$has recently extended to high-energy particle collisions. Experimentally, Bell inequality violations, which challenge Einstein's principle of local realism, were first observed in low-energy entangled photon systems by A. Aspect, J. F. Clauser, and A. Zeilinger, earning them the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Particle colliders provide a novel setting for probing quantum information theory, operating at energies over ten orders of magnitude higher than previous experiments and in the presence of electroweak and strong interactions. Additionally, collider detectors offer unique advantages for quantum state reconstruction via quantum state tomography. This book chapter reviews key theoretical and experimental advancements in this emerging field, highlighting its challenges, objectives, and potential impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.

Title: Chirality-Induced Orbital Selectivity through Linear-Orbital Coupling
Authors: Namgee Cho, James Lim, Martin B. Plenio
Abstract: This work investigates electron transport through chiral electrostatic potentials by modeling the system in three spatial dimensions and demonstrates that chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS) produces pronounced enantiospecific transmission, dependent on the electron's initial orbital angular momentum (OAM) state. The results show that transverse electron motion in a chiral environment, captured by OAM dynamics, gives rise to strong orbital selectivity that reverses upon inversion of the handedness of the chiral potential. This behavior originates from a coupling between the electron's linear and orbital angular momenta, leading to effects that are significantly stronger than those arising from spin-phonon and bare spin-orbit interactions under realistic physical conditions. Moreover, the CIOS effect is shown to increase with the length of the chiral region and remains robust against static disorder. The orbital selectivity can give rise to spin selectivity when initial correlations exist between spin and OAM states. These findings underscore the importance of orbital contributions to enantiospecific electron transport in chiral systems and suggest that CIOS plays a critical role alongside existing spin-based mechanisms.

Title: Emergence of Entropic Time in a Tabletop Wheeler-DeWitt Universe
Authors: Giovanni Barontini
Abstract: We implement an analogue Wheeler-DeWitt mini-universe constituted by a well-isolated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a time-independent conservative potential. In exact analogy with the Wheeler-DeWitt framework for the actual universe, our system has the fundamental problem of defining from within a meaningful time variable over which to order the events. Here, we partition the mini-universe into a bright and a dark sector, enabling entropy exchange between them through a potential barrier. We show that the Hamiltonian of the condensate in the bright sector is analogous to the one in canonical minisuperspace models. We define an entropic time and show with experimental data that it is robustly monotonic even when the bright sector undergoes several cycles that begin with a 'big bang' and end with a 'big crunch'. By tuning the barrier height, we control the rate of entropy production and thus the speed of the emergent entropic time and the dynamics of the bright universe. We finally derive an entropic time-dependent Schroedinger equation that could be considered as a generalization of the standard one, and use it to reproduce our data. This work experimentally validates the proposition that time in quantum cosmological models may not be fundamental, but instead emerges from thermodynamic gradients, while establishing a concrete experimental platform for evaluating several aspects of quantum gravity theories.

Title: Quantum Computing for Large-scale Network Optimization: Opportunities and Challenges
Authors: Sebastian Macaluso, Giovanni Geraci, Elías F. Combarro, Sergi Abadal, Ioannis Arapakis, Sofia Vallecorsa, Eduard Alarcón
Abstract: The complexity of large-scale 6G-and-beyond networks demands innovative approaches for multi-objective optimization over vast search spaces, a task often intractable. Quantum computing (QC) emerges as a promising technology for efficient large-scale optimization. We present our vision of leveraging QC to tackle key classes of problems in future mobile networks. By analyzing and identifying common features, particularly their graph-centric representation, we propose a unified strategy involving QC algorithms. Specifically, we outline a methodology for optimization using quantum annealing as well as quantum reinforcement learning. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges that QC algorithms and hardware must overcome to effectively optimize future networks.

Title: High-temperature growth of ultra thin NbTiN films on lithium niobate for integrated single photon detection
Authors: Sjoerd Telkamp, Odiel Hooybergs, Myriam Rihani, Giovanni Finco, Tummas Napoleon Arge, Robin N. Dür, Victor Mougel, Daniel Scheffler, Filip Krizek, Rachel Grange, Robert J. Chapman, Werner Wegscheider
Abstract: Lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) is an emerging photonic platform with high potential for scalable quantum information processing due to its strong second-order nonlinearity. However, little progress has been made in developing on-chip single-photon detectors on LNOI. Niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN) superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a promising candidate for this application. In this work, we use DC reactive magnetron sputtering to grow high-quality NbTiN thin films using an ultra-high vacuum deposition system with a base pressure lower than $2\times 10^{-10}$ mbar. Enabled by the low concentration of background impurities in this system, we investigate the impact of substrate temperature during NbTiN growth. We achieve four nm thick superconducting films with a critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of 12.3 K grown at a substrate temperature of 825 K. We find that the NbTiN films grow in the (111) orientation and evolve from a porous pillar structure when grown at low temperatures to densely packed fibrous grains at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increased substrate temperature reduces the oxygen concentration in our films and improves the overall stoichiometry. In addition, we integrate these films with the LNOI platform and investigate the obtained interface quality. Lastly, we fabricate SNSPDs from the NbTiN film on LNOI and characterize the detector performance.

Title: Generalised Geometric Phase
Authors: Vivek M. Vyas
Abstract: A generalised notion of geometric phase for pure states is proposed and its physical manifestations are shown. An appreciation of fact that the interference phenomenon also manifests in the average of an observable, allows us to define the argument of the matrix element of an observable as a generalised relative phase. This identification naturally paves the way for defining an operator generalisation of the geometric phase following Pancharatnam. The notion of natural connection finds an appropriate operator generalisation, and the generalised geometric phase is indeed found to be the (an)holonomy of the generalised connection. It is shown that in scenarios wherein the usual geometric phase is not defined, the generalised geometric phase manifests as a global phase acquired by a quantum state in course of time evolution. The generalised geometric phase is found to contribute to the shift in the energy spectrum due perturbation, and to the forward scattering amplitude in a scattering problem.

Title: Dissipative Quantum Chaos unveiled by Stochastic Quantum Trajectories
Authors: Filippo Ferrari, Luca Gravina, Debbie Eeltink, Pasquale Scarlino, Vincenzo Savona, Fabrizio Minganti
Abstract: We define quantum chaos and integrability in open quantum many-body systems as a dynamical property of single stochastic realizations, referred to as quantum trajectories. This definition relies on the predictions of random matrix theory applied to the subset of the Liouvillian spectrum involved in each quantum trajectory. Our approach, which we name spectral statistics of quantum trajectories (SSQT), enables a natural distinction between transient and steady-state quantum chaos as general phenomena in open setups. We test the generality and reliability of the SSQT criterion on several dissipative systems, further showing that an open system with a chaotic structure can evolve towards either a chaotic or integrable steady state. We apply our theoretical framework to two driven-dissipative bosonic systems. First, we study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, an example of quantum simulator, clarifying the interplay of integrability, transient, and steady-state chaos across its phase diagram. Our analysis shows the existence of an emergent dissipative quantum chaotic phase, whereas the classical and semi-classical limits display integrable behavior. In this regime, chaos arises from the quantum and classical fluctuations associated with the dissipation mechanisms. Second, we investigate dissipative quantum chaos in the dispersive readout of a transmon qubit: a measurement technique ubiquitous in superconducting-based quantum hardware. Through the SSQT, we distinguish regimes where the performance of the measurement instrument can be connected to the integrable or chaotic nature of the underlying driven-dissipative bosonic system. Our work offers a general understanding of the integrable and chaotic dynamics of open quantum systems and paves the way for the investigation of dissipative quantum chaos and its consequences on state-of-the-art noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Title: Building Trust in the Quantum Cloud with Physical Unclonable Functions
Authors: Behnam Tonekaboni, Pranav Gokhale, Kaitlin N. Smith
Abstract: As cloud-based quantum computing expands, securing access to quantum hardware is increasingly critical. We present an authentication protocol that leverages intrinsic quantum device properties to construct Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (Q-PUFs). Using frequency fingerprints from fixed-frequency transmon qubits, we prototype our approach on IBM quantum devices with both real and simulated data. We employ fuzzy extractors to generate stable cryptographic keys that tolerate measurement noise and conceal raw hardware data. To support scalability, we introduce q tuples (qubit subsets) that enable challenge response generation for strong PUF behavior. We also outline extensions to neutral atom platforms and propose future directions including logical Q-PUFs. Our work lays the groundwork for secure, hardware-rooted authentication in hybrid quantum-classical systems.

Title: Expanding Hardware-Efficiently Manipulable Hilbert Space via Hamiltonian Embedding
Authors: Jiaqi Leng, Joseph Li, Yuxiang Peng, Xiaodi Wu
Abstract: Many promising quantum applications depend on the efficient quantum simulation of an exponentially large sparse Hamiltonian, a task known as sparse Hamiltonian simulation, which is fundamentally important in quantum computation. Although several theoretically appealing quantum algorithms have been proposed for this task, they typically require a black-box query model of the sparse Hamiltonian, rendering them impractical for near-term implementation on quantum devices. In this paper, we propose a technique named Hamiltonian embedding. This technique simulates a desired sparse Hamiltonian by embedding it into the evolution of a larger and more structured quantum system, allowing for more efficient simulation through hardware-efficient operations. We conduct a systematic study of this new technique and demonstrate significant savings in computational resources for implementing prominent quantum applications. As a result, we can now experimentally realize quantum walks on complicated graphs (e.g., binary trees, glued-tree graphs), quantum spatial search, and the simulation of real-space Schrödinger equations on current trapped-ion and neutral-atom platforms. Given the fundamental role of Hamiltonian evolution in the design of quantum algorithms, our technique markedly expands the horizon of implementable quantum advantages in the NISQ era.

Title: On the structure of Completely Reducible States
Authors: Daniel Cariello
Abstract: The complete reducibility property for bipartite states reduced the separability problem to a proper subset of positive under partial transpose states and was used to prove several theorems inside and outside entanglement theory. So far only three types of bipartite states were proved to possess this property. In this work, we provide some procedures to create states with this property, we call these states by the name of completely reducible states. The convex combination of such states is the first procedure, showing that the set of completely reducible states is a convex cone. We also provide a complete description of the extreme rays of this set. Then we show that powers, roots and partial traces of completely reducible states result in states of the same type. Finally, we consider a shuffle of states that preserves this property. This shuffle allows us to construct states with the complete reducibility property avoiding the only three conditions known to date that imply this property. We conclude this paper by showing a connection between our results and the distillability problem. All these results were possible due to a simplification of the description of this property also presented here for the first time.

Title: Non-Markovian Multiphoton Chiral Dynamics with Giant Systems
Authors: Yue Chang
Abstract: Chiral interactions enable directional control of quantum light, providing new routes for nonreciprocal photon dynamics. While previous studies focused on single photon regimes, this work explores the non-Markovian multiphoton regime in a giant nonlinear system nonlocally coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide, with a tunable phase difference breaking parity symmetry. We show that single-photon transport remains reciprocal, but multiphoton dynamics become chiral, generating direction-dependent higher-order correlations and enabling deterministic creation of multiphoton states with nontrivial statistics from a single input direction, even under strong dissipation. The non-Markovian nature allows tuning of transmitted photon statistics via the coupling-point separation. At a specific phase, internal dynamics become Markovian while output photons retain non-Markovian features. Under strong coherent driving, we uncover nonreciprocal dissipative phase transitions and demonstrate how non-Markovianity shapes the critical response. This framework offers a general strategy for controlling chiral multiphoton dynamics in nonlocally coupled waveguide QED systems.

Title: Emergent broadband polarization entanglement from electronic and phononic Stokes-anti-Stokes indistinguishability
Authors: Diego Sier, Lucas Valente, Tiago A. Freitas, Marcelo F. Santos, Carlos H. Monken, Raul Corrêa, Ado Jorio
Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it was shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes (SaS) entangled photons. While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.

Title: Grover Adaptive Search with Spin Variables
Authors: Shintaro Fujiwara, Naoki Ishikawa
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to Grover adaptive search (GAS) for a combinatorial optimization problem whose objective function involves spin variables. While the GAS algorithm with a conventional design of a quantum dictionary subroutine handles a problem associated with an objective function with binary variables $\{0,1\}$, we reformulate the problem using spin variables $\{+1,-1\}$ to simplify the algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a novel quantum dictionary subroutine that is designed for this spin-based formulation. A key benefit of this approach is the substantial reduction in the number of CNOT gates required to construct the quantum circuit. We theoretically demonstrate that, for certain problems, our proposed approach can reduce the gate complexity from an exponential order to a polynomial order, compared to the conventional binary-based approach. This improvement has the potential to enhance the scalability and efficiency of GAS, particularly in larger quantum computations.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning of Molecular Energies with Hybrid Quantum-Neural Wavefunction
Authors: Weitang Li, Shi-Xin Zhang, Zirui Sheng, Cunxi Gong, Jianpeng Chen, Zhigang Shuai
Abstract: Quantum computational chemistry holds great promise for simulating molecular systems more efficiently than classical methods by leveraging quantum bits to represent molecular wavefunctions. However, current implementations face significant limitations in accuracy due to hardware noise and algorithmic constraints. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns molecular wavefunction using a combination of an efficient quantum circuit and a deep neural network. This approach enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, surpassing traditional quantum computational chemistry methods. Numerical benchmarking on molecular systems shows that our hybrid quantum-neural wavefunction approach achieves near-chemical accuracy, comparable to advanced quantum and classical techniques. Experimental validation on a superconducting quantum computer, using the isomerization reaction of cyclobutadiene, further demonstrates its practical applicability, with high accuracy in energy estimation and significant resilience to noise.

Title: Advancing quantum imaging through learning theory
Authors: Yunkai Wang, Changhun Oh, Junyu Liu, Liang Jiang, Sisi Zhou
Abstract: We study quantum imaging by applying the resolvable expressive capacity (REC) formalism developed for physical neural networks (PNNs). In this paradigm of quantum learning, the imaging system functions as a physical learning device that maps input parameters to measurable features, while complex practical tasks are handled by training only the output weights, enabled by the systematic identification of well-estimated features (eigentasks) and their corresponding sample thresholds. Using this framework, we analyze both direct imaging and superresolution strategies for compact sources, defined as sources with sizes bounded below the Rayleigh limit. In particular, we introduce the orthogonalized SPADE method-a nontrivial generalization of existing superresolution techniques-that achieves superior performance when multiple compact sources are closely spaced. This method relaxes the earlier superresolution studies' strong assumption that the entire source must lie within the Rayleigh limit, marking an important step toward developing more general and practically applicable approaches. Using concrete examples involving complex structured sources and classification tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of our orthogonalized SPADE method and highlight key advantages of the quantum learning approach-its ability to tackle complex imaging tasks and enhance performance by selectively extracting well-estimated features.

Title: Fabrication and characterization of vacuum-gap microstrip resonators
Authors: Christian Schlager, Romain Albert, Gerhard Kirchmair
Abstract: In traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) low-loss capacitors are necessary to provide 50 $\Omega$ impedance matching to the increased inductance that is brought in by the nonlinear elements used for amplification, be it Josephson junctions or high kinetic inductance materials. Here we report on the development of a fabrication process for vacuum-gap microstrips, a design in which the ground plane is suspended in close proximity above the center conductor without the support of a dielectric. In addition to high-capacitance transmission lines, this architecture also enables air-bridges and compact parallel-plate capacitors. The performance of the fabrication is examined using distributed aluminum and granular aluminum resonators in a cryogenic dilution refrigerator setup, showing quality factors on par with the fabrication processes used in state-of-the-art TWPAs. In addition to characterizing the dependence of the quality factors on power, also their behavior with respect to temperature is explored, applying a model based on thermal quasi-particles and saturable two-level systems (TLS), showing that the quality factors of the resonators are limited by TLS.

Title: Position-correlated biphoton wavefront sensing for quantum adaptive imaging
Authors: Yi Zheng, Zhao-Di Liu, Jian-Shun Tang, Jin-Shi Xu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo
Abstract: Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counter-intuitive phenomena, while a biphoton spatial aberration generally degrades its performance. Biphoton aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons if the source is unreachable. Here, a new method named position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing is introduced, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the back focal plane of a microlens array. Experimentally, biphoton phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film are demonstrated. This single-shot method is a more direct and efficient approach toward quantum adaptive optics, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy, remote imaging, and communication.

Title: Entanglement islands in 1D and 2D lattices with defects
Authors: Ivan P. Christov
Abstract: We investigate the spatial structure of quantum entanglement in one- and two-dimensional lattice systems containing structural defects, using the Time-Dependent Quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method. By constructing reduced density matrices from ensembles of guide waves, we resolve spatial variations in both Coulomb-mediated entanglement and coherence without requiring full many-body wavefunctions. This approach reveals localized regions, entanglement islands, where quantum correlations are enhanced or suppressed due to the presence of vacancies or interaction inhomogeneities. In 1D systems, entanglement tends to concentrate near defects, while in 2D we observe bridge-like and radially symmetric domains. Our results demonstrate that TDQMC offers a scalable and physically transparent framework for real-space quantum information analysis, with implications for quantum materials, entanglement-based sensing, and coherent state engineering.

Title: On the quantum computational complexity of classical linear dynamics with geometrically local interactions: Dequantization and universality
Authors: Kazuki Sakamoto, Keisuke Fujii
Abstract: The simulation of large-scale classical systems in exponentially small space on quantum computers has gained attention. The prior work demonstrated that a quantum algorithm offers an exponential speedup over any classical algorithm in simulating classical dynamics with long-range interactions. However, many real-world classical systems, such as those arising from partial differential equations, exhibit only local interactions. The question remains whether quantum algorithms can still provide exponential speedup under this condition. In this work, we thoroughly characterize the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for simulating such geometrically local systems. First, we dequantize the quantum algorithm for simulating short-time (polynomial-time) dynamics of such systems. This implies that the problem of simulating this dynamics does not yield any exponential quantum advantage. Second, we show that quantum algorithms for short-time dynamics have the same computational complexity as polynomial-time probabilistic classical computation. Third, we show that the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for long-time (exponential-time) dynamics is captured by exponential-time and polynomial-space quantum computation. This suggests a super-polynomial time advantage when restricting the computation to polynomial-space, or an exponential space advantage otherwise. This work offers new insights into the complexity of classical dynamics governed by partial differential equations, providing a pathway for achieving quantum advantage in practical problems.

Title: Fusion for High-Dimensional Linear Optical Quantum Computing with Improved Success Probability
Authors: Gözde Üstün, Eleanor G. Rieffel, Simon J. Devitt, Jason Saied
Abstract: Type-II fusion is a probabilistic entangling measurement that is essential to measurement-based linear optical quantum computing and can be used for quantum teleportation more broadly. However, it remains under-explored for high-dimensional qudits. Our main result gives a Type-II fusion protocol with proven success probability approximately $2/d^2$ for qudits of arbitrary dimension $d$. This generalizes a previous method which only applied to even-dimensional qudits. We believe this protocol to be the most efficient known protocol for Type-II fusion, with the $d=5$ case beating the previous record by a factor of approximately $723$. We discuss the construction of the required $(d-2)$-qudit ancillary state using a silicon spin qudit ancilla coupled to a microwave cavity through time-bin multiplexing. We then introduce a general framework of extra-dimensional corrections, a natural technique in linear optics that can be used to non-deterministically correct non-maximally-entangled projections into Bell measurements. We use this method to analyze and improve several different circuits for high-dimensional Type-II fusion and compare their benefits and drawbacks.

Title: Towards an Experimental Device-Independent Verification of Indefinite Causal Order
Authors: Carla M. D. Richter, Michael Antesberger, Huan Cao, Philip Walther, Lee A. Rozema
Abstract: In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8328 \pm 0.0045$, which is 18 standard deviations above the classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.

Title: Conditions for Large-Sample Majorization of Pairs of Flat States in Terms of α-z Relative Entropies
Authors: Frits Verhagen, Marco Tomamichel, Erkka Haapasalo
Abstract: We offer the first operational interpretation of the {\alpha}-z relative entropies, a measure of distinguishability between two quantum states introduced by Jakšić et al. and Audenaert and Datta. We show that these relative entropies appear when formulating conditions for large-sample or catalytic relative majorization of pairs of flat states and certain generalizations of them. Indeed, we show that such transformations exist if and only if all the {\alpha}-z relative entropies of the two pairs are ordered. In this setting, the {\alpha} and z parameters are truly independent from each other. These results also yield an expression for the optimal rate of converting one flat state pair into another. Our methods use real-algebraic techniques involving preordered semirings and certain monotone homomorphisms and derivations on them.

Title: Characterizing the Kirkwood-Dirac positivity on second countable LCA groups
Authors: Matéo Spriet
Abstract: We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized (non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution. They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups. We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.

Title: Cybersecurity of Quantum Key Distribution Implementations
Authors: Ittay Alfassi, Ran Gelles, Rotem Liss, Tal Mor
Abstract: Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) often deviate from the theoretical protocols, exposing the implementations to various attacks even when the underlying (ideal) protocol is proven secure. We present new analysis tools and methodologies for quantum cybersecurity, adapting the concepts of vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and exploits from classical cybersecurity to QKD implementation attacks. We also present three additional concepts, derived from the connection between classical and quantum cybersecurity: "Quantum Fuzzing", which is the first tool for black-box vulnerability research on QKD implementations; "Reversed-Space Attacks", which are a generic exploit method using the attack surface of imperfect receivers; and concrete quantum-mechanical definitions of "Quantum Side-Channel Attacks" and "Quantum State-Channel Attacks", meaningfully distinguishing them from each other and from other attacks. Using our tools, we analyze multiple existing QKD attacks and show that the "Bright Illumination" attack could have been found even with minimal knowledge of the device implementation. This work begins to bridge the gap between current analysis methods for experimental attacks on QKD implementations and the decades-long research in the field of classical cybersecurity, improving the practical security of QKD products and enhancing their usefulness in real-world systems.

Title: Quantum Reservoir GAN
Authors: Hikaru Wakaura
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is known as one of the promising applications of quantum computers. Many types of quantum machine learning methods have been released, such as Quantum Annealer, Quantum Neural Network, Variational Quantum Algorithms, and Quantum Reservoir Computers. They can work, consuming far less energy for networks of equivalent size. Quantum Reservoir Computers, in particular, have no limit on the size of input data. However, their accuracy is not enough for practical use, and the effort to improve accuracy is mainly focused on hardware improvements. Therefore, we propose the approach from software called Quantum Reservoir Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which uses Quantum Reservoir Computers as a generator of GAN. We performed the generation of handwritten single digits and monochrome pictures on the CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. As a result, Quantum Reservoir GAN is confirmed to be more accurate than Quantum GAN, Classical Neural Network, and ordinary Quantum Reservoir Computers.

Title: Detecting $k$-nonstretchability via a class of informationally complete symmetric measurements
Authors: Yan Hong, Mengjia Zhang, Limin Gao, Huaqi Zhou, Limei Zhang
Abstract: Characterizing multipartite entanglement is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory. The concept of $k$-stretchability [Szalay, Quantum 3, 204 (2019)] provides a framework for describing multipartite entanglement structures. We investigate the detection of $k$-nonstretchability using informationally complete $(s,t)$-POVMs [Siudzi$\textrm{ń}$ska, Phys. Rev. A 105, 042209 (2022)], which encompass GSIC-POVMs and MUMs. Several criteria for $k$-nonstretchability in multipartite quantum systems are established. These criteria identify classes of $k$-nonstretchable states, and their applicability and advantages are demonstrated through explicit examples.

Title: Nonlinear-linear duality for multipath quantum interference
Authors: Yi Zheng, Jin-Shi Xu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo
Abstract: In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.

Title: Noise-induced Zeno-like effect in a spin-chain quantum battery
Authors: Maulana M. Fajar, Beta N. Pratiwi, Subur Pramono, Gagus K. Sunnardianto, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha
Abstract: Quantum batteries, which are energy-storage or state-storage devices that exploit unique quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here, we demonstrate that suitably engineered noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization effect of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery within the Heisenberg XYZ model. Focusing on a system size N=6, which balances computational cost and storage capacity, we find that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio W(t)/E_B(t) attains a maximum value of about 0.99 at a certain time parameter value. Then, by varying the noise strength in each channel, we find that not only does decoherence merely degrade performance but it may also stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the high noise strength regime. For instance, the phase-flip channel slows charging and reduces charging power, but its discharging behavior releases energy and ergotropy more slowly, allowing the battery to be used for longer times compared to bit-flip and bit-phase-flip channels. In contrast, the bit-flip channel enables fast charging, but yields low storage and rapid energy release. Remarkably, the bit-phase-flip channel can combine the advantages of both bit-flip and phase-flip channels in the high-noise-strength regime. The bit-phase-flip channel supports accelerated charging together with enhanced storage capacity, while its discharging behavior resembles that of the bit-flip channel with rapid energy release. These results reveal that, under sufficiently strong noise, environmental decoherence induces a Zeno-like stabilization, allowing it to achieve enhanced charging performance and to stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the spin-chain quantum battery.

Title: Geometric Discord of any arbitrary dimensional bipartite system and its application in quantum key distribution
Authors: Rashi Jain, Satyabrata Adhikari
Abstract: Entangled quantum states are regarded as a key resource in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, we derive the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ in terms of GQD when two communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. The lower bound of $K_D$ depends upon the GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$ are the density matrices. We find that for a certain range of GQD, the successful generation of the secret key is not guaranteed. We further study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples. Moreover, we find that even when $\sigma_i$'s are separable or positive partial transpose entangled states, the distillable key can still be generated.

Title: Another generalization of Hadamard test: Optimal sample complexities for learning functions on the unitary group
Authors: Daiki Suruga
Abstract: Estimating properties of unknown unitary operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. While full unitary tomography requires a number of samples to the unknown unitary scaling linearly with the dimension (implying exponentially with the number of qubits), estimating specific functions of a unitary can be significantly more efficient. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the sample-efficient estimation of arbitrary square integrable functions $f: \mathbf{U}(d) \to \mathbb{C}$, using only access to the controlled-unitary operation. We first provide a tight characterization of the optimal sample complexity when the accuracy is measured by the averaged bias over the unitary $\mathbf{U}(d)$. We then construct a sample-efficient estimation algorithm that becomes optimal under the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning criterion for various classes of functions. Applications include optimal estimation of matrix elements of irreducible representations, the trace, determinant, and general polynomial functions on $\mathbf{U}(d)$. Our technique generalize the Hadamard test and leverage tools from representation theory, yielding both lower and upper bound on sample complexity.

Title: Time-frequency Entangled Photon Mediated CCZ Gate
Authors: Chenhui Wang, Weilong Wang, Yangyang Fei, Zhiqiang Fan, Hanshi Zhao, Yuyan Mage, Zheng Shan
Abstract: High-fidelity native multi-qubit operations are crucial to efficient quantum circuit compilation due to their ability of shortening circuit depth and enhence the performance. However, the design and implementation of these gates remain a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a hardware-efficient scalable scheme for direct CCZ gate implementation based on two-photon absorption phenomenon, which is applicable to current superconducting quantumcomputing platforms. By carefully optimizing the parameters of qubits and couplers, we achieve a simulated fidelity over 99% within 194ns, surpassing the decomposed methods with single-qubit and two-qubit gates in both latency and overall fidelity. Crucially, the scheme is robust against parameter drifts and can be extended to CCPhase({\theta}) gates with arbitrary angles and multi-qubit operations. All these results highlight the advantages of our scheme which paves the way for substantial depth compression of complex quantum circuits for practical application in transformative quantum algorithms and simulations.

Title: Enhancing Fault-Tolerant Surface Code Decoding with Iterative Lattice Reweighting
Authors: Yi Tian, Y. Zheng, Xiaoting Wang, Ching-Yi Lai
Abstract: Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical post-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum noise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce the Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder, which systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error correction. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting: correlated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional probabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative procedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a hardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in finite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results under circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\geq 17$ and physical error rates $\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates by over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold from 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding. Extrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$, IRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a major reduction in qubit overhead.

Title: Discreteness of asymptotic tensor ranks
Authors: Jop Briët, Matthias Christandl, Itai Leigh, Amir Shpilka, Jeroen Zuiddam
Abstract: Tensor parameters that are amortized or regularized over large tensor powers, often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in several areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets, sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values of such tensor parameters. We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of order-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field (and in fact any finite set of coefficients in any field), the asymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points, and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation points. Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound says that any concise three-tensor that is "narrow enough" (has one dimension much smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank. Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions. We prove that for any concise tensor, the product of any two such maximum ranks must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions with large max-rank.

Title: Upper bound hierarchies for noncommutative polynomial optimization
Authors: Igor Klep, Victor Magron, Gaël Massé, Jurij Volčič
Abstract: This work focuses on minimizing the eigenvalue of a noncommutative polynomial subject to a finite number of noncommutative polynomial inequality constraints. Based on the Helton-McCullough Positivstellensatz, the noncommutative analog of Lasserre's moment-sum of squares hierarchy provides a sequence of lower bounds converging to the minimal eigenvalue, under mild assumptions on the constraint set. Each lower bound can be obtained by solving a semidefinite program. We derive complementary converging hierarchies of upper bounds. They are noncommutative analogues of the upper bound hierarchies due to Lasserre for minimizing polynomials over compact sets. Each upper bound can be obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem.

Title: Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point
Authors: Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.

Title: Quantum annealing eigensolver as a NISQ era tool for probing strong correlation effects in quantum chemistry
Authors: Aashna Anil Zade, Kenji Sugisaki, Matthias Werner, Ana Palacios, Jordi Riu, Jan Nogue, Artur Garcia-Saez, Arnau Riera, V. S. Prasannaa
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is arguably the most popular noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era approach to quantum chemistry. We consider the underexplored quantum annealing eigensolver (QAE) algorithm as a worthy alternative. We use a combination of numerical calculations for a system where strong correlation effects dominate, and conclusions drawn from our preliminary scaling analysis for QAE and VQE to make the case for QAE as a NISQ era contender to VQE for quantum chemistry. For the former, we pick the representative example of computing avoided crossings in the H4 molecule in a rectangular geometry, and demonstrate that we obtain results to within about 1.2% of the full configuration interaction value on the D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Following our numerical results, we carry out a detailed yet preliminary analysis of the scaling behaviours of both the QAE and the VQE algorithms. We analyze the non-recurring and recurring costs involved in both the algorithms and arrive at their net scaling behaviours.

Title: Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems
Authors: Xiaotian Nie, Wei Zheng
Abstract: Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We show that, similar to the closed case, the first-order deviation from the instantaneous steady state is memoryless -- it depends only on the final parameters and not on the initial state or ramping path. When ramping the Hamiltonian, the linear response of observables is governed by the derivative of the retarded Green's function, as in closed systems. In contrast, ramping the dissipation gives rise to a different response, characterized by a high-order correlation function defined in the steady state. Our results offer a compact and physically transparent formulation of non-adiabatic response in open systems, and demonstrate that ramping dynamics can serve as a versatile tool for probing many-body correlations beyond equilibrium.

Title: Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal
Authors: Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a novel phase of periodically driven matter that exhibits robust subharmonic oscillations without requiring disorder. However, previous realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of polarization, either spontaneous or induced. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed ``unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals'' (UPDTCs) that arise without any uniform/staggered polarization and propose an experiment to observe them in current trapped-ion quantum simulators. By studying a model of trapped ions using a quantum circuit simulator, we demonstrate that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization, even though its expectation value does not exhibit such dynamics. The period-doubled dynamics is not explained by the classical picture of flipping spins but by quantum fluctuations. We establish that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, a hallmark of prethermalization. These results expand the known phenomenology and mechanism of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases.

Title: Exploring Quantum Responsible Innovation efforts in Canada and the world
Authors: Ria Chakraborty, Bruna S. de Mendonça, Katya Driscoll, Rodolfo R. Soldati, Ray Laflamme
Abstract: The global landscape for quantum technologies (QTs) is rapidly changing, and proper understanding of their impact and subsequent regulations need to match this pace. A Responsible Innovation (RI) approach and guiding principles have been proposed to accompany this development. We examine practical efforts globally and in Canada, from industry to research to governments, and analyze the current status of quantum technological advances under the RI framework. We analyze and compare what is being done internationally, identify gaps in the Canadian strategy, propose initiatives to fill those gaps, and highlight areas where Canada is leading or where more work is needed.

Title: Revisiting the operator extension of strong subadditivity
Authors: Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming
Abstract: We give a new proof of the operator extension of the strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy $\rho_{AB} \otimes \sigma_{C}^{-1} \leq \rho_{A} \otimes \sigma_{BC}^{-1}$ by identifying the mathematical structure behind it as Connes' theory of spatial derivatives. This immediately generalizes the inequality to arbitrary inclusions of von Neumann algebras. In the case of standard representations, it reduces to the monotonicity of the relative modular operator.

Title: A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation
Authors: Weitang Li, Jiajun Ren, Jun Yan
Abstract: Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.
