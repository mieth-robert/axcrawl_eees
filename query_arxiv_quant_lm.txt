Title: HQCNN: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network for Medical Image Classification
Authors: Shahjalal, Jahid Karim Fahim, Pintu Chandra Paul, Md Robin Hossain, Md. Tofael Ahmed, Dulal Chakraborty
Abstract: Classification of medical images plays a vital role in medical image analysis; however, it remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data, class imbalances, and the complexity of medical patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The architecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone with a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state encoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum attention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and 99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy datasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior generalization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with significantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid quantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks.

Title: QLook:Quantum-Driven Viewport Prediction for Virtual Reality
Authors: Niusha Sabri Kadijani, Yoga Suhas Kuruba Manjunath, Xiaodan Bi, Lian Zhao
Abstract: We propose QLook, a quantum-driven predictive framework to improve viewport prediction accuracy in immersive virtual reality (VR) environments. The framework utilizes quantum neural networks (QNNs) to model the user movement data, which has multiple interdependent dimensions and is collected in six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) VR settings. QNN leverages superposition and entanglement to encode and process complex correlations among high-dimensional user positional data. The proposed solution features a cascaded hybrid architecture that integrates classical neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs)-enhanced quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) networks. We utilize identity block initialization to mitigate training challenges commonly associated with VQCs, particularly those encountered as barren plateaus. Empirical evaluation of QLook demonstrates a 37.4% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art (SoTA), showcasing superior viewport prediction.

Title: Measuring dark state number in the Tavis-Cummings model
Authors: L. Theerthagiri, Rajesh Narayanan, R. Ganesh
Abstract: Quantum mechanics allows for light-matter setups that hold excitations without releasing them as light. Arising from destructive interference processes, they are best seen in a Tavis-Cummings-like setup where two-level atoms (or qubits) are placed within a lossy cavity. If the system is initialized with some qubits excited and some in the ground state, there is a non-zero probability that no photons will be emitted. This can be framed as a Stern-Gerlach measurement, with a detector to measure if one or more photons leave the cavity. If no photons are detected, the qubits collapse onto a dark state. This can be viewed as heralding of a dark state based on zero photon detection. Building upon this idea, we propose a protocol to measure the number of independent dark states. Moreover, we show that this quantity is robust to arbitrary levels of disorder in the qubit-photon coupling constants. We then discuss a phase transition where the number of dark states plays the role of an order parameter. This provides an exciting example of a phase transition that is completely insensitive to disorder.

Title: Anyonic membranes and Pontryagin statistics
Authors: Yitao Feng, Hanyu Xue, Yuyang Li, Meng Cheng, Ryohei Kobayashi, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5\!+\!1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.

Title: Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Surajit Bera, Igor V. Gornyi, Sumilan Banerjee, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.

Title: Full programmable quantum computing with trapped-ions using semi-global fields
Authors: Yakov Solomons, Yotam Kadish, Lee Peleg, Jonathan Nemirovsky, Amit Ben Kish, Yotam Shapira
Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum computing can utilize all motional modes of the ion-crystal, to entangle multiple qubits simultaneously, enabling universal computation with multi-qubit gates supplemented by single-qubit rotations. Using multiple tones to drive each ion individually induces Ising-type interactions, forming a multi-qubit gate, where the coupling matrix of all ion pairs is fully controllable. This reduces the total gate count while maintaining high fidelity, as opposed to traditional methods that rely on a single type of two-qubit gate, such as the well-known Mølmer-Sørensen gate. However, scaling to large ion chains, individual addressing can be technically challenging in terms of optical delivery and signal generation. We explore global and semi-global drives combined with single-qubit flips and show that these can reproduce the full set of multi-qubit gates. Although optimizing the combination of single-qubit flips is a computationally hard problem, we propose an efficient scheme to implement any desired couplings in large ion chains, yielding a concatenation scheme that uses at most $N/2$ multi-qubit gates, with $N$ being the number of ions. In addition, we show that by using $B<N$ independent semi-global fields, each driving a set of $N/B$ ions, the number of maximal multi-qubit gates is reduced to approximately $\frac{N^2}{B^2 (N-1)}$. We show how to design the driving fields that support these schemes and investigate their properties. Our results pave the way for efficient implementations of quantum algorithms in large-scale trapped-ion quantum systems.

Title: Quantum advantage without exponential concentration: Trainable kernels for symmetry-structured data
Authors: Laura J. Henderson, Kerstin Beer, Salini Karuvade, Riddhi Gupta, Angela White, Sally Shrapnel
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods promise enhanced expressivity for learning structured data, but their usefulness has been limited by kernel concentration and barren plateaus. Both effects are mathematically equivalent and suppress trainability. We analytically prove that covariant quantum kernels tailored to datasets with group symmetries avoid exponential concentration, ensuring stable variance and guaranteed trainability independent of system size. Our results extend beyond prior two-coset constructions to arbitrary coset families, broadening the scope of problems where quantum kernels can achieve advantage. We further derive explicit bounds under coherent noise models - including unitary errors in fiducial state preparation, imperfect unitary representations, and perturbations in group element selection - and show through numerical simulations that the kernel variance remains finite and robust, even under substantial noise. These findings establish a family of quantum learning models that are simultaneously trainable, resilient to coherent noise, and linked to classically hard problems, positioning group-symmetric quantum kernels as a promising foundation for near-term and scalable quantum machine learning.

Title: Finite-size secret-key rates of discrete modulation CV QKD under passive attacks
Authors: Gabriele Staffieri, Giovanni Scala, Cosmo Lupo
Abstract: Quantum conditional entropies play a fundamental role in quantum information theory. In quantum key distribution, they are exploited to obtain reliable lower bounds on the secret-key rates in the finite-size regime, against collective attacks and coherent attacks under suitable assumptions. We consider continuous-variable communication protocols, where the sender Alice encodes information using a discrete modulation of phase-shifted coherent states, and the receiver Bob decodes by homodyne or heterodyne detection. We compute the Petz-Rényi and sandwiched Rényi conditional entropies associated with these setups, under the assumption of a passive eavesdropper who collects the quantum information leaked through a lossy communication line of known or bounded transmissivity. Whereas our results do not directly provide reliable key-rate estimates, they do represent useful ball-park figures. We obtain analytical or semi-analytical expressions that do not require intensive numerical calculations. These expressions serve as bounds on the key rates that may be tight in certain scenarios. We compare different estimates, including known bounds that have already appeared in the literature and new bounds. The latter are found to be tighter for very short block sizes.

Title: Photonic Spin Hall Effect using bilayer Graphene in Nano Optomechanical Cavities
Authors: Muqaddar Abbas, Muhammad Awais Altaf, Pei Zhang, Muhammad Waseem
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model to obtain the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) in an optomechanical nanocavity using a graphene bilayer as the intracavity medium. In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first mirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the radiation pressure. We show that the right- and left-circular polarization components of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle become spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of incidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the optomechanical interaction, cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE are equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe field to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe field detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into three windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction when probe field detuning is non-zero. The photonic SHE in bilayer graphene integrated with an optomechanical cavity may enable further studies of spin-dependent photonic effects and quantum sensing applications.

Title: Electron distributions of molecular domains: canonical ensemble, and charge transfer electronegativity relationship
Authors: Roberto Carlos Bochicchio
Abstract: The principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) applies to the canonical ensemble related to the number of particles, known as the $\mathcal{N}$-ensemble. This concept pertains to physical domains (or basins) that are treated as open systems capable of transferring charge through the exchange of electrons. In this context, fractional occupation numbers of electrons indicate a net charge, represented as $\nu$. This principle outlines the convex expansion of the density matrix (DM), based on three distinct electronic states: the neutral state and two ionic edge states, each with a charge limit of $\pm q$. The coefficients of expansion and the charge transference fraction $\nu$, are crucial for understanding electron distribution. We express the quantities discussed as functions of the chemical potential derived from the statistical ensemble. Our analysis focuses on the donor and acceptor characteristics of different domains in relation to these parameters. The physical compatibility of the current equilibrium states of the system is discussed within this statistical framework and the electronegativity of the domains is inferred from the physical behavior of the associated populations.

Title: Comparing Quantum Annealing and BF-DCQO
Authors: Pau Farré, Erika Ordog, Kevin Chern, Catherine C. McGeoch
Abstract: Recent work [1] has claimed that a gate-model quantum-classical hybrid algorithm called bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) [2] outperforms D-Wave's annealing quantum computers in optimization tasks. We find the opposite to be true, and demonstrate that D-Wave's quantum annealers find solutions of far greater quality than claimed in Ref. [1], while using far less computation time. We also present evidence that suggests the quantum component of the hybrid approach makes minimal contributions to solution quality.

Title: Circuit Partitioning for the Quantum Internet
Authors: Leo Sünkel, Thomas Gabor, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien
Abstract: In a quantum internet, quantum processing units (QPUs) with varying architectures and capabilities may be connected through quantum communication channels, enabling new applications such as distributed quantum computing (DQC), a paradigm in which multiple QPUs execute a single circuit. However, remote operations between QPUs are expensive as they require the creation and distribution of entanglement throughout the network. It is therefore crucial to assign qubits to QPUs and partition circuits in such a way that the overall communication between QPUs is minimized. In this paper, we apply and evaluate simulated annealing and an evolutionary algorithm for this problem. We consider quantum networks with 25 nodes arranged in different topologies and QPUs with varying qubit capacities. The circuits evaluated contain 50 and 100 qubits. We show that the different metaheuristics all significantly outperform the baselines by drastically reducing the communication cost by over 40%.

Title: Warm-Starting PCE for Traveling Salesman Problem
Authors: Rafael S. do Carmo, Renato Gomes dos Reis, Samuel Fernando F Silva, Luiz Gustavo E. Arruda, Felipe F. Fanchini
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are promising for combinatorial optimization, but their scalability is often limited by qubit-intensive encoding schemes. To overcome this bottleneck, Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) has emerged as one of the most promising algorithms in this scenario. The method offers not only a polynomial reduction in qubit count and a suppression of barren plateaus but also demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on Maxcut. In this work, we propose a warm-start PCE, an extension that incorporates a classical bias from the Goemans-Williamson (GW) randomized rounding algorithm into the loss function to guide the optimization toward improved approximation ratios. We evaluated this method on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a QUBO-to-MaxCut transformation for up to $5$ layers. Our results show that Warm-PCE consistently outperforms standard PCE, achieving the optimum solution in $28\text{--}64\%$ of instances, versus $4\text{--}26\%$ for PCE, and attaining higher mean approximation ratios that improve with circuit depth. These findings highlight the practical value of this warm-start strategy for enhancing PCE-based solvers on near-term hardware.

Title: On the Complexity of Decoded Quantum Interferometry
Authors: Kunal Marwaha, Bill Fefferman, Alexandru Gheorghiu, Vojtech Havlicek
Abstract: We study the complexity of Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), a recently proposed quantum algorithm for approximate optimization. We argue that DQI is hard to classically simulate, and that the hardness comes from locating an exponentially large hidden subset. This type of hardness is shared by Shor's algorithm, but the hidden subset here has no apparent group structure. We first prove that DQI can be simulated in a low level of the polynomial hierarchy, ruling out hardness arguments related to quantum supremacy. Instead, we show that DQI implements an existential coding theory bound based on the MacWilliams identity, and that it prepares a state within an obfuscated quantum harmonic oscillator. Both viewpoints require a coherent application of a discrete Hermite transform, which has no natural classical analog.

Title: Coherent Control of Quantum-Dot Spins with Cyclic Optical Transitions

Abstract: Solid-state spins are promising as interfaces from stationary qubits to single photons for quantum communication technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots have excellent optical coherence, exhibit near unity collection efficiencies when coupled to photonic structures, and possess long-lived spins for quantum memory. However, the incompatibility of performing optical spin control and single-shot readout simultaneously has been a challenge faced by almost all solid-state emitters. To overcome this, we leverage light-hole mixing to realize a highly asymmetric lambda system in a negatively charged heavy hole exciton in Faraday configuration. By compensating GHz-scale differential Stark shifts, induced by unequal coupling to Raman control fields, and by performing nuclear-spin cooling, we achieve quantum control of an electron-spin qubit with a $\pi$-pulse contrast of 97.4% while preserving spin-selective optical transitions with a cyclicity of 409. We demonstrate this scheme for both GaAs and InGaAs quantum dots, and show that it is compatible with the operation of a nuclear quantum memory. Our approach thus enables repeated emission of indistinguishable photons together with qubit control, as required for single-shot readout, photonic cluster-state generation, and quantum repeater technologies.

Title: Quasi-Monte Carlo Method for Linear Combination Unitaries via Classical Post-Processing
Authors: Yuya Kawamata, Kosuke Mitarai, Keisuke Fujii
Abstract: We propose the quasi-Monte Carlo method for linear combination of unitaries via classical post-processing (LCU-CPP) on quantum applications. The LCU-CPP framework has been proposed as an approach to reduce hardware resources, expressing a general target operator $F(A)$ as $F(A) = \int_V f(t) G(A, t)dt$, where each $G(A, t)$ is proportional to a unitary operator. On a quantum device, $Re[Tr(G(A, t)\rho)]$ can be estimated using the Hadamard test and then combined through classical integration, allowing for the realization of nonunitary functions with reduced circuit depth. While previous studies have employed the Monte Carlo method or the trapezoid rule to evaluate the integral in LCU-CPP, we show that the quasi-Monte Carlo method can achieve even lower errors. In two numerical experiments, ground state property estimation and Green's function estimation, the quasi-Monte Carlo method achieves the lowest errors with a number of Hadamard test shots per unitary that is practical for real hardware implementations. These results indicate that quasi-Monte Carlo is an effective integration strategy within the LCU-CPP framework.

Title: Bell Meets General Philosophers of Science : Reassessing Measurement Independence
Authors: Yuichiro Kitajima
Abstract: Bell's inequality is derived from three assumptions: measurement independence, outcome independence, and parameter independence. Among these, measurement independence, often taken for granted, holds that hidden variables are statistically uncorrelated with measurement settings. Under this assumption, the violation of Bell's inequality implies that either outcome independence or parameter independence fails to hold, meaning that local hidden variables do not exist. In this paper, we refer to this interpretive stance as the nonfactorizable position. In contrast, superdeterminism represents the view that measurement independence does not hold. Despite its foundational role, this assumption has received relatively little philosophical scrutiny. This paper offers a philosophical reassessment of measurement independence through three major frameworks in the philosophy of science: de Regt's contextual theory of scientific understanding, Kuhn's criteria for theory choice, and Lakatos's methodology of scientific research programmes. Using these lenses, we evaluate the two major responses to the violation of Bell's inequality, the nonfactorizable position and superdeterminism, and argue that the nonfactorizable position currently fares better across all three criteria. Beyond this binary, we introduce a spectrum of intermediate positions that allow for partial violations of measurement independence, modeled via mutual information. These positions modify the ``positive heuristic'' of superdeterminism, a crucial component in Lakatos's definition of research programmes, offering avenues for progressive research. This analysis reframes the debate surrounding Bell's inequality and illustrates how methodological tools can effectively guide theory evaluation in physics.

Title: Efficiently learning depth-3 circuits via quantum agnostic boosting
Authors: Srinivasan Arunachalam, Arkopal Dutt, Alexandru Gheorghiu, Michael de Oliveira
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum agnostic learning of phase states with respect to a function class $\mathsf{C}\subseteq \{c:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}\}$: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\textsf{opt}$ with a phase state $|\phi_c\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{x\in \{0,1\}^n}(-1)^{c(x)}|x\rangle$ for some $c\in \mathsf{C}$, output $|\phi\rangle$ which has fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \textsf{opt}-\varepsilon$. To this end, we give agnostic learning protocols for the following classes: (i) Size-$t$ decision trees which runs in time $\textsf{poly}(n,t,1/\varepsilon)$. This also implies $k$-juntas can be agnostically learned in time $\textsf{poly}(n,2^k,1/\varepsilon)$. (ii) $s$-term DNF formulas in near-polynomial time $\textsf{poly}(n,(s/\varepsilon)^{\log \log s/\varepsilon})$. Our main technical contribution is a quantum agnostic boosting protocol which converts a weak agnostic learner, which outputs a parity state $|\phi\rangle$ such that $|\langle \phi|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt}/\textsf{poly}(n)$, into a strong learner which outputs a superposition of parity states $|\phi'\rangle$ such that $|\langle \phi'|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt} - \varepsilon$. Using quantum agnostic boosting, we obtain the first near-polynomial time $n^{O(\log \log n)}$ algorithm for learning $\textsf{poly}(n)$-sized depth-$3$ circuits (consisting of $\textsf{AND}$, $\textsf{OR}$, $\textsf{NOT}$ gates) in the uniform quantum $\textsf{PAC}$ model using quantum examples. Classically, the analogue of efficient learning depth-$3$ circuits (and even depth-$2$ circuits) in the uniform $\textsf{PAC}$ model has been a longstanding open question in computational learning theory. Our work nearly settles this question, when the learner is given quantum examples.

Title: Scaling Hybrid Quantum-HPC Applications with the Quantum Framework
Authors: Srikar Chundury, Amir Shehata, Seongmin Kim, Muralikrishnan Gopalakrishnan Meena, Chao Lu, Kalyana Gottiparthi, Eduardo Antonio Coello Perez, Frank Mueller, In-Saeng Suh
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-high performance computing (Q-HPC) workflows are emerging as a key strategy for running quantum applications at scale in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These workflows must operate seamlessly across diverse simulators and hardware backends since no single simulator offers the best performance for every circuit type. Simulation efficiency depends strongly on circuit structure, entanglement, and depth, making a flexible and backend-agnostic execution model essential for fair benchmarking, informed platform selection, and ultimately the identification of quantum advantage opportunities. In this work, we extend the Quantum Framework (QFw), a modular and HPC-aware orchestration layer, to integrate multiple local backends (Qiskit Aer, NWQ-Sim, QTensor, and TN-QVM) and a cloud-based quantum backend (IonQ) under a unified interface. Using this integration, we execute a number of non-variational as well as variational workloads. The results highlight workload-specific backend advantages: while Qiskit Aer's matrix product state excels for large Ising models, NWQ-Sim not only leads on large-scale entanglement and Hamiltonian but also shows the benefits of concurrent subproblem execution in a distributed manner for optimization problems. These findings demonstrate that simulator-agnostic, HPC-aware orchestration is a practical path toward scalable, reproducible, and portable Q-HPC ecosystems, thereby accelerating progress toward demonstrating quantum advantage.

Title: Strong coupling of a microwave photon to an electron on helium
Authors: G. Koolstra, E.O. Glen, N.R. Beysengulov, H. Byeon, K.E. Castoria, M. Sammon, S.A. Lyon, D.G. Rees, J. Pollanen
Abstract: Electrons bound to the surface of superfluid helium have been proposed for scalable charge and spin-based quantum computing. However single electron quantum measurement in this system has remained elusive. Here we use a hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic (cQED) device that comprises a quantum dot and a high-impedance superconducting resonator to demonstrate, for the first time, strong coupling between the resonator microwave field and the motional quantum state of the electron. We find a coupling strength between the electron motion and a resonator photon of $g/2\pi=118$ MHz, exceeding both the electron motional state decoherence and the resonator loss. These experiments open new avenues for investigating light-matter interaction at the single electron level, and are a key step towards measurement and control of electrons on helium-based spin qubits.

Title: Decoded Quantum Interferometry Requires Structure
Authors: Eric R. Anschuetz, David Gamarnik, Jonathan Z. Lu
Abstract: We study the performance of Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) on typical instances of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT when the transpose of the constraint matrix is drawn from a standard ensemble of LDPC parity check matrices. We prove that if the decoding step of DQI corrects up to the folklore efficient decoding threshold for LDPC codes, then DQI is obstructed by a topological feature of the near-optimal space of solutions known as the overlap gap property (OGP). As the OGP is widely conjectured to exactly characterize the performance of state-of-the-art classical algorithms, this result suggests that DQI has no quantum advantage in optimizing unstructured MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. We also give numerical evidence supporting this conjecture by showing that approximate message passing (AMP)--a classical algorithm conjectured to saturate the OGP threshold--outperforms DQI on a related ensemble of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. Finally, we prove that depth-$1$ QAOA outperforms DQI at sufficiently large $k$ under the same decoding threshold assumption. Our result follows by showing that DQI is approximately Lipschitz under the quantum Wasserstein metric over many standard ensembles of codes. We then prove that MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT exhibits both an OGP and a related topological obstruction known as the chaos property; this is the first known OGP threshold for MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT at fixed $k$, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we prove that both of these topological properties inhibit approximately Lipschitz algorithms such as DQI from optimizing MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT to large approximation ratio.

Title: Support-Projected Petz Monotone Geometry of Two-Qubit Families: Three-Channel Identity and Non-Reduction of Curvatures
Authors: Gunhee Cho, Jeongwoo Jae
Abstract: We investigate the information geometry of pure two-qubit variational families by pulling back arbitrary Petz monotone quantum metrics to circuit-defined submanifolds and making them intrinsic via support projection onto the active numerical range of the quantum Fisher information tensor. This framework strictly generalizes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD/Bures) case and includes, as special examples, the Wigner-Yanase and Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori metrics among many others. Our first main theorem proves a universal three-channel decomposition for every Petz monotone metric on any smooth two-parameter slice in terms of the population, coherence, and concurrence of the one-qubit reduction. Second, we show that neither the slice Gaussian curvature nor the ambient scalar curvature of the support-projected metric can, on any nonempty open set, be written as functions solely of concurrence or of the one-qubit entropy. Third, an entanglement-orthogonal gauge isolates the pure entanglement derivative channel and provides intrinsic curvature diagnostics. These results rigorously disprove the expectation that scalar or Gaussian curvatures of finite-dimensional monotone metrics could serve as universal entanglement monotones, extending the counterexamples previously known for the SLD/Bures metric, and complementing recent analyses in Gaussian quantum states. They also furnish a Petz-metric foundation for curvature-aware natural-gradient methods in variational quantum algorithms.

Title: Improving the efficiency of quantum engineering of SCSs by adding two demultiplexed input photons
Authors: Mikhail S. Podoshvedov, Sergey A. Podoshvedov
Abstract: Conditional addition and subtraction of photons is a powerful tool for quantum engineering of continuous variable (CV) states that forms the fundamental building blocks of advanced photonic technologies. For high fidelity information processing, precise control of quantum engineering of CV states is highly demanded. We propose a scheme for measurement induced quantum engineering of even/odd superposition of coherent states (SCSs) of amplitude>2.5 and with fidelity exceeding>0.99. It includes single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) state and two separate photons. The output parameters of the SCSs are tuned using initial squeezing of the SMSV states and the beam splitter (BS) parameter and depend on number of subtracted photons in two measurement channels. The introduction of two demultiplexed photons is a key element to improving the efficiency of quantum engineering of SCSs. When using two additional photons, both an increase in the fidelity of the output CV state and a gain in probability at least by an order of magnitude compared to the case without auxiliary input photons are observed.

Title: Open-system analogy of Berry conjecture
Authors: Yaohua Li, Yunhan Wang, Yong-Chun Liu
Abstract: Berry conjecture is central to understanding quantum chaos in isolated systems and foundational for the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Here we establish an open-system analogy of the Berry conjecture, connecting quantum steady states to classical dissipative attractors in the semiclassical limit. We demonstrate that the Wigner distribution of quantum steady states delocalizes over classical chaotic attractors in the semiclassical limit. We validate this correspondence using a Floquet Kerr oscillator. In the chaotic phase, the quasi-steady state is dominated by the chaotic delocalization instead of the quantum fluctuations, resulting in entropy divergence in the semiclassical limit. This entropy divergence provides a robust chaos signature beyond non-Hermitian random matrix approaches. We further identify dissipative phase transitions via Liouvillian gap closures, revealing a discrete time crystal phase and its breakdown into chaos at strong driving. Our framework thus establishes a universal paradigm for quantum chaos in open systems.

Title: The superconducting grid-states qubit
Authors: Long B. Nguyen, Hyunseong Kim, Dat T. Le, Thomas Ersevim, Sai P. Chitta, Trevor Chistolini, Christian Jünger, W. Clarke Smith, T. M. Stace, Jens Koch, David I. Santiago, Irfan Siddiqi
Abstract: Decoherence errors arising from noisy environments remain a central obstacle to progress in quantum computation and information processing. Quantum error correction (QEC) based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) protocol offers a powerful strategy to overcome this challenge, with successful demonstrations in trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonics. Beyond active QEC, a compelling alternative is to engineer Hamiltonians that intrinsically enforce stabilizers, offering passive protection akin to topological models. Inspired by the GKP encoding scheme, we implement a superconducting qubit whose eigenstates form protected grid states - long envisioned but not previously realized - by integrating an effective Cooper-quartet junction with a quantum phase-slip element embedded in a high-impedance circuit. Spectroscopic measurements reveal pairs of degenerate states separated by large energy gaps, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Remarkably, our observations indicate that the circuit tolerates small disorders and gains robustness against environmental noise as its parameters approach the ideal regime, establishing a new framework for exploring superconducting hardware. These findings also showcase the versatility of the superconducting circuit toolbox, setting the stage for future exploration of advanced solid-state devices with emergent properties.

Title: Composable logical gate error in approximate quantum error correction: reexamining gate implementations in Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes
Authors: Lukas Brenner, Beatriz Dias, Robert Koenig
Abstract: Quantifying the accuracy of logical gates is paramount in approximate error correction, where perfect implementations are often unachievable with the available set of physical operations. To this end, we introduce a single scalar quantity we call the (composable) logical gate error. It captures both the deviation of the logical action from the desired target gate as well as leakage out of the code space. It is subadditive under successive application of gates, providing a simple means for analyzing circuits. We show how to bound the composable logical gate error in terms of matrix elements of physical unitaries between (approximate) logical computational basis states. In the continuous-variable context, this sidesteps the need for computing energy-bounded norms. As an example, we study the composable logical gate error for linear optics implementations of Paulis and Cliffords in approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We find that the logical gate error for implementations of Paulis depends linearly on the squeezing parameter. This implies that their accuracy improves monotonically with the amount of squeezing. For some Cliffords, however, linear optics implementations which are exact for ideal GKP codes fail in the approximate case: they have a constant logical gate error even in the limit of infinite squeezing. This shows that findings applicable to ideal GKP codes do not always translate to the realm of physically realizable approximate GKP codes.

Title: Suppressing Degradation in Quantum Batteries by Electromagnetically-induced Transparency
Authors: Jin-Tian Zhang, Cheng-Ge Liu, Qing Ai
Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs), as emerging quantum devices for energy storage and transfer, have attracted significant attention due to their potential to surpass classical batteries in charging efficiency and energy density. However, interactions between a QB and its environment result in decoherence, which significantly reduces its operational lifespan. In this work, we propose suppressing the aging of QBs by introducing the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). Specifically, we model a four-level atom as a QB with an effective two-level system enabled by the EIT, while the photons in the cavity serve as the energy charger. By comparing the energy and extractable work of the QB with and without the EIT effect, we demonstrate that the QBs incorporating the EIT exhibit enhanced resistance to spontaneous decay as compared to their counterparts without the EIT. We believe that our findings may provide valuable insights and shed the light on the design principles for mitigating the degradation of the QBs.

Title: Proposal of cavity quantum acoustodynamics platform based on Lithium Niobate-on-Sapphire chip
Authors: Xin-Biao Xu, Lintao Xiao, Bo Zhang, Weiting Wang, Jia-Qi Wang, Yu Zeng, Yuan-Hao Yang, Bao-Zhen Wang, Xiaoxuan Pan, Guang-Can Guo, Luyan Sun, Chang-Ling Zou
Abstract: A scalable hybrid cavity quantum acoustodynamics (QAD) platform is proposed. The architecture integrates superconducting transmon qubits with phononic integrated circuits on a single chip made by lithium niobate-on-sapphire substrate. The platform supports tightly confined and guided phononic modes in unsuspended waveguides and microring structures, while the superconducting qubits reside on the sapphire substrate. Efficient piezoelectric coupling between the phononic modes and transmon qubits can be achieved using interdigital transducers as part of the qubit's shunt capacitance. Numerical calculations demonstrate the feasibility of achieving strong coupling between the phononic microring resonator and the transmon qubit. This hybrid cavity QAD platform opens up new opportunities for quantum information processing and the study of novel quantum acoustic phenomena.

Title: Quantum eigenpair solver with minimal sampling overhead
Authors: Sven Danz
Abstract: The advantage that many quantum algorithms have over their classical counterparts may be lost when the results are extracted as classical data (output problem). One example are eigenpair solvers, which encode the eigenpairs in a quantum state. Extracting these states results in significant sampling overheads. We propose an amplitude-amplification-based post-filtering process that reduces the number of eigenpairs encoded in the final state to a feasible amount. Often for practical applications, computing a subset of all eigenpairs is sufficient, which drastically reduces the sampling overhead. We show, that our adapted eigenpair solver does not only compete with classical alternatives but outperforms them in terms of memory requirements, runtime, and versatility. This makes it an efficient end-to-end quantum algorithm with real-world application in science and engineering.

Title: State-to-Hamiltonian conversion with a few copies
Authors: Kaito Wada, Jumpei Kato, Hiroyuki Harada, Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a general procedure that converts an unknown quantum state into the Hamiltonian evolution. This enables state-dependent operations and can reveal nontrivial properties of the state, among other applications, without full tomography. However, it has been proven that for any physical process, the DME requires $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ state copies in error $\varepsilon$. In this work, we go beyond the lower bound and propose a procedure called the virtual DME that achieves $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ or $\mathcal{O}(1)$ state copies, by using non-physical processes. Using the virtual DME in place of its conventional counterpart realizes a general-purpose quantum algorithm for property estimation, that achieves exponential circuit-depth reductions over existing protocols across tasks including quantum principal component analysis, quantum emulator, calculation of nonlinear functions such as entropy, and linear system solver with quantum precomputation. In such quantum algorithms, the non-physical process for virtual DME can be effectively simulated via simple classical post-processing while retaining a near-unity measurement overhead. We numerically verify this small constant overhead together with the exponential reduction of copy count in the quantum principal component analysis task. The number of state copies used in our algorithm essentially saturates the theoretical lower bound we proved.

Title: Quantum router of silicon-vacancy centers via a diamond waveguide
Authors: Wen-Jie Zhang, Xi Yan, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: As a key component of quantum networks, quantum router distributes quantum information among different quantum nodes. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) center in diamond offers a promising platform for quantum technology due to its strong strain-induced coupling with phonons. However, the development of practical quantum router faces challenges of achieving long-range entanglement and suppressing decoherence. Here, we propose a non-Markovian quantum router based on a diamond waveguide embedded with an array of SiV centers as the quantum nodes. Unlike conventional channel-switching methods, our design enables parallel quantum-state transfer from a single input node to multiple target nodes, analogous to a classical WiFi router. We demonstrate that persistent entanglement and suppressed decoherence of the SiV centers over long distances are achievable when bound states are present in the energy spectrum of the total system formed by the SiV centers and the phonon waveguide. Our scheme enriches the implementation of quantum routing and prompts the development of solid-state quantum networks.

Title: Resource-efficient linear-optical generation of GHZ-like states
Authors: Suren A. Fldzhyan, Stanislav S. Straupe, Mikhail Yu. Saygin
Abstract: Heralded multi-photon entanglement generation is a central bottleneck for photonic quantum computing, where resource costs typically skyrocket with target size. We explore efficient methods for generating photon states with tunable entanglement, providing a flexible tool for quantum state engineering. We introduce a theoretical framework that has been numerically validated, demonstrating the capacity to generate GHZ-like states incrementally from non-logical intermediate states. We demonstrate that in certain scenarios $-$ such as reducing the resource cost for building large maximally entangled GHZ states $-$ these variable-entanglement states can outperform their fixed-entanglement counterparts. By adjusting intermediate states and optimizing interferometer schemes, we improve photon number cost efficiency of GHZ-like states generation. Our findings indicate that while not a universal solution, non-maximally entangled states offer practical advantages for specific photonic quantum information tasks.

Title: Coupling 4H-Silicon Carbide spins to a microwave resonator at milli-Kelvin temperature
Authors: Ali Fawaz, Jeremy Bourhill, Stefania Castelletto, Hiroshi Abe, Takeshi Ohshima, Michael Tobar, Thomas Volz, Maxim Goryachev, Sarath Raman Nair
Abstract: Coupling microwave cavity modes with spin qubit transitions is crucial for enabling efficient qubit readout and control, long-distance qubit coupling, quantum memory implementation, and entanglement generation. We experimentally observe the coupling of different spin qubit transitions in Silicon Carbide (SiC) material to a 3D microwave (MW resonator mode around 12.6~GHz at a temperature of 10~mK. Tuning the spin resonances across the cavity resonance via magnetic-field sweeps, we perform MW cavity transmission measurements. We observe spin transitions of different spin defects that are detuned from each other by around 60-70~MHz. By optically exciting the SiC sample placed in the MW cavity with an 810~nm laser, we observe the coupling of an additional spin resonance to the MW cavity, also detuned by around 60-70 MHz from the centre resonance. We perform complementary confocal optical spectroscopy as a function of temperature from 4~K to 200~K. Combining the confocal spectroscopy results and a detailed analysis of the MW-resonator-based experiments, we attribute the spin resonances to three different paramagnetic defects: positively-charged carbon antisite vacancy pair (CAV$^+$), and the negatively-charged silicon vacancy spins located at two different lattice sites, namely V$_1$ and V$_2$ spins. The V$_1$ and V$_2$ lines in SiC are interesting qubit transitions since they are known to be robust to decoherence. Additionally, the CAV$^+$-transition is known to be a bright single-photon source. Consequently, the demonstration of the joint coupling of these spin qubits to a MW cavity mode could lead to interesting new modalities: The microwave cavity could act as an information bus and mediate long-range coupling between the spins, with potential applications in quantum computing and quantum communication, which is an attractive proposition in a CMOS-compatible material such as SiC.

Title: No-go theorem for quantum realization of extremal correlations
Authors: Sujan V.K, Ravi Kunjwal
Abstract: The study of quantum correlations is central to quantum information and foundations. The paradigmatic case of Bell scenarios considers product measurements implemented on a multipartite state. The more general case of contextuality scenarios--where the measurements do not have to be of product form or even on a composite system--has been studied for the case of projective measurements. While it is known that in any Bell scenario extremal indeterministic correlations (e.g., Popescu-Rohrlich or PR boxes) are unachievable quantumly, the case of general contextuality scenarios has remained open. Here we study quantum realizations of extremal correlations in arbitrary contextuality scenarios and prove that, for all such scenarios, no extremal indeterministic correlation can be achieved using projective quantum measurements, i.e., there exists no quantum state and no set of projective measurements, for any contextuality scenario, that can achieve such correlations. This no-go result follows as a corollary of a more general no-go theorem that holds when the most general set of quantum measurements (i.e., positive operator-valued measures, or POVMs) is taken into account. This general no-go theorem entails that no non-trivial quantum realization of an extremal indeterministic correlation exists, i.e., any "quantum" realization must be simulable by classical randomness. We discuss implications of this no-go theorem and the open questions it raises.

Title: Imaging of electrical signals in a quantum SiC microscope
Authors: A. Suhana, T. A. U. Svetikova, C. Schneider, M. Helm, A. N. Anisimov, G. V. Astakhov
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a quantum silicon carbide microscope (QSiCM) and demonstrate its functionality by imaging magnetic fields generated by electrical currents. We employ a dual-frequency sensing protocol to enhance the readout contrast and suppress noise arising from strain and temperature fluctuations. This approach enables spatial imaging of current-induced magnetic fields with a field of view of $50 \times 50 $ virtual pixels, temporal resolution of $50\,\mathrm{ms}$, spatial resolution of $30\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ and sensitivity of about $2\,\mathrm{\mu T \, Hz^{-1/2}}$ per pixel. Further sensitivity enhancement is anticipated through the use of isotopically purified SiC and improved light collection in crystallographically optimized wafer orientations. In addition, we implement a microwave-free imaging protocol based on spin level anticrossing, offering simplified operation with enhanced sensitivity. The demonstrated platform is compatible with commercial, wafer-scale fabrication and holds strong potential for applications in biomedical imaging and diagnostics, as well as non-invasive current and temperature mapping in high-power electronic devices.

Title: Quantum Gambling: Best-Arm Strategies for Generator Selection in Adaptive Variational Algorithms
Authors: Rick Huang, Artur F. Izmaylov
Abstract: Adaptive variational algorithms suffer from prohibitively high measurement costs during the generator selection step, since energy gradients must be estimated for a large operator pool. This scaling bottleneck limits their applicability to larger molecular systems on near-term quantum devices. We address this challenge by reformulating generator selection as a Best Arm Identification (BAI) problem, where the goal is to identify the generator with the largest energy gradient using as few measurements as possible. To solve it, we employ the Successive Elimination algorithm, which adaptively allocates measurements and discards unpromising candidates early. Numerical experiments on molecular systems demonstrate that this approach substantially reduces the number of measurements required while preserving ground-state energy accuracy. By cutting measurement overhead without sacrificing performance, our method makes adaptive variational algorithms more practical for near-term quantum simulations.

Title: Ghost Imaging with Free Electron-Photon Pairs
Authors: Sergei Bogdanov, Alexander Preimesberger, Harsh Mishra, Dominik Hornof, Thomas Spielauer, Florian Thajer, Max Maurer, Pia Falb, Leo Stöger, Thomas Schachinger, Friedrich Bleicher, Michael S. Seifner, Isobel C. Bicket, Philipp Haslinger
Abstract: Coincidence imaging, also known as ghost imaging, is a technique that exploits correlations between two particles to reconstruct information about a specimen. The particle that relays the spatial information about the object remains completely non-interacting, while the particle used to probe the object is not spatially resolved. While ghost imaging has been primarily implemented on photonic platforms, it becomes particularly intriguing when applied to particles with fundamentally different properties, such as massive, charged electrons and massless, neutral photons, especially considering the role of both particles as cornerstones of highly advanced microscopic platforms. In this work, we investigate coincidence imaging using electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission electron microscope. Utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence setup, we demonstrate ghost imaging of complex patterns. We are able to obtain a spatial resolution down to 2 $\mu$m, paving the way for adaptation of quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron microscopy.

Title: Quantum Metrology of Spin Sensing with Free Space Electrons
Authors: Santiago Beltrán-Romero, Michael Gaida, Philipp Haslinger, Dennis Rätzel, Stefan Nimmrichter
Abstract: Recent advances in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have opened the path toward spin resonance spectroscopy with single-spin sensitivity. To assess this potential, we investigate the quantum precision limits for sensing magnetic moments with free-electron probes. Using a scattering model where an electron wavepacket interacts with a localized spin, we study two metrological tasks: estimating the magnitude of the magnetic moment and discriminating the presence of a spin. The sensitivity for a given measurement setting is generally determined by the classical Fisher information, which we benchmark against the quantum bound optimized over all measurements. We find that conventional TEM imaging can saturate the quantum bound when backaction of the probe electron onto the spin state is negligible. We also find that, when backaction is relevant, one could do better by realizing a measurement of the electron's orbital angular momentum state. These results establish the quantum limits of spin sensing in TEM and guide the development of future experiments probing individual electron spins or nanoscale ensembles of nuclear spins.

Title: Magnetic-Field and Temperature Limits of a Kinetic-Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier
Authors: Lucas M. Janssen, Farzad Faramarzi, Henry G. LeDuc, Sahil Patel, Gianluigi Catelani, Peter K. Day, Yoichi Ando, Christian Dickel
Abstract: Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.

Title: Dynamical decoupling protection for three-level systems
Authors: P. Z. Zhao, Lei Qiao
Abstract: In addition to the traditional two-level system, the three-level system serves as another important elemental building block for the manipulation of qubits. However, the quantum information processing in the three-level system is also subject to the decoherence induced by the interaction between the quantum system and its environment or by the crosstalk between different qutrits. In this work, we construct a sequence of physically feasible dynamical decoupling operators for the three-level system to mitigate not only the transverse dephasing between the excited state and ground states but also the longitudinal relaxation among them. Combining the Hamiltonian engineering and our constructed dynamical decoupling sequence, we further realize the dynamical decoupling protection of qutrit-based quantum gates. Our scheme can effectively enhance the fidelity of three-level-based quantum gates through filtering out the environmental noises, which may provide a new horizon to improve the accuracy of three-level-based quantum manipulation.

Title: Simplified scheme for continuous-variable entanglement distillation: multicopy distillation of Gaussian entanglement without heralding Gaussian measurements
Authors: Jaromír Fiurášek
Abstract: Entanglement of continuous-variable Gaussian states can be distilled by combination of de-Gaussifying operation such as single-photon subtraction and iterative heralded Gaussification. Here we present and analyze a simplified equivalent version of such entanglement distillation protocol, where the Gaussian measurements utilized in heralded Gaussification are eliminated and are absorbed into the preparation of suitable input Gaussian states of the simplified protocol. The simplified scheme contains less detectors and its overall success probability increases in comparison with the original scheme, while producing completely equivalent outputs. Our simplification of the entanglement distillation protocol closely parallels the recently proposed simplification of a scheme for breeding optical single-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states [H. Aghaee Rad et al., Nature 638, 912 (2025)]. We investigate operation of the simplified entanglement distillation scheme for both pure and mixed input states and clarify how multicopy distillation of Gaussian entanglement emerges in a setup without any heralding Gaussian measurements.

Title: Geometric optimization for quantum communication
Authors: Chengkai Zhu, Hongyu Mao, Kun Fang, Xin Wang
Abstract: Determining the ultimate limits of quantum communication, such as the quantum capacity of a channel and the distillable entanglement of a shared state, remains a central challenge in quantum information theory, primarily due to the phenomenon of superadditivity. This work develops Riemannian optimization methods to establish significantly tighter, computable two-sided bounds on these fundamental quantities. For upper bounds, our method systematically searches for state and channel extensions that minimize known information-theoretic bounds. We achieve this by parameterizing the space of all possible extensions as a Stiefel manifold, enabling a universal search that overcomes the limitations of ad-hoc constructions. Combined with an improved upper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined continuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new state-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing channel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the previously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian optimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish lower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum instruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by parameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical results for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our methods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results. Together, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and powerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication limits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel coherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity lower bounds in general.

Title: Sampled-Based Guided Quantum Walk: Non-variational quantum algorithm for combinatorial optimization
Authors: Ugo Nzongani, Dylan Laplace Mermoud, Giuseppe Di Molfetta, Andrea Simonetto
Abstract: We introduce SamBa-GQW, a novel quantum algorithm for solving binary combinatorial optimization problems of arbitrary degree with no use of any classical optimizer. The algorithm is based on a continuous-time quantum walk on the solution space represented as a graph. The walker explores the solution space to find its way to vertices that minimize the cost function of the optimization problem. The key novelty of our algorithm is an offline classical sampling protocol that gives information about the spectrum of the problem Hamiltonian. Then, the extracted information is used to guide the walker to high quality solutions via a quantum walk with a time-dependent hopping rate. We investigate the performance of SamBa-GQW on several quadratic problems, namely MaxCut, maximum independent set, portfolio optimization, and higher-order polynomial problems such as LABS, MAX-$k$-SAT and a quartic reformulation of the travelling salesperson problem. We empirically demonstrate that SamBa-GQW finds high quality approximate solutions on problems up to a size of $n=20$ qubits by only sampling $n^2$ states among $2^n$ possible decisions. SamBa-GQW compares very well also to other guided quantum walks and QAOA.

Title: TITAN: A Trajectory-Informed Technique for Adaptive Parameter Freezing in Large-Scale VQE
Authors: Yifeng Peng, Xinyi Li, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Kaining Zhang, Zhiding Liang, Ying Wang, Yuxuan Du
Abstract: Variational quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading candidate for harnessing quantum computers to advance quantum chemistry and materials simulations, yet its training efficiency deteriorates rapidly for large Hamiltonians. Two issues underlie this bottleneck: (i) the no-cloning theorem imposes a linear growth in circuit evaluations with the number of parameters per gradient step; and (ii) deeper circuits encounter barren plateaus (BPs), leading to exponentially increasing measurement overheads. To address these challenges, here we propose a deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive parameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of Hamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy. The motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of parameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics. Its design combines a theoretically grounded data construction strategy, ensuring each training example is informative and BP-resilient, with an adaptive neural architecture that generalizes across ansatze of varying sizes. Across benchmark transverse-field Ising models, Heisenberg models, and multiple molecule systems up to 30 qubits, Titan achieves up to 3 times faster convergence and 40% to 60% fewer circuit evaluations than state-of-the-art baselines, while matching or surpassing their estimation accuracy. By proactively trimming parameter space, Titan lowers hardware demands and offers a scalable path toward utilizing VQE to advance practical quantum chemistry and materials science.

Title: Strong converse exponent of channel interconversion
Authors: Aadil Oufkir, Yongsheng Yao, Mario Berta
Abstract: In their seminal work, Bennett et al. [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory (2002)] showed that, with sufficient shared randomness, one noisy channel can simulate another at a rate equal to the ratio of their capacities. We establish that when coding above this channel interconversion capacity, the exact strong converse exponent is characterized by a simple optimization involving the difference of the corresponding Rényi channel capacities with Hölder dual parameters. We further extend this result to the entanglement-assisted interconversion of classical-quantum channels, showing that the strong converse exponent is likewise determined by differences of sandwiched Rényi channel capacities. The converse bound is obtained by relaxing to non-signaling assisted codes and applying Hölder duality together with the data processing inequality for Rényi divergences. Achievability is proven by concatenating refined channel coding and simulation protocols that go beyond first-order capacities, attaining an exponentially small conversion error, remaining robust under small variations in the input distribution, and tolerating a sublinear gap between the conversion rates.

Title: Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices
Authors: Aabhas Gulati, Ion Nechita, Sang-Jun Park
Abstract: The characterization of positive, non-CP linear maps is a central problem in operator algebras and quantum information theory, where such maps serve as entanglement witnesses. This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the classical cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the well-studied theory of copositive forms and the structure of positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of symmetric states, such as the Dicke states. We prove that the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy. Leveraging this duality, we provide an explicit construction of bipartite (mixture of) Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $\mathcal{K}_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.

Title: Circuit-based chatacterization of finite-temperature quantum phases and self-correcting quantum memory
Authors: Ruochen Ma, Vedika Khemani, Shengqi Sang
Abstract: Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition, which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.

Title: Mixed Quantum-Classical Approaches to Spin Current and Polarization Dynamics in Chiral Molecular Junctions
Authors: Yu Wang, Ruihao Bi, Wei Liu, Jiayue Han, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic devices.

Title: Towards a European Quantum Act: A Two-Pillar Framework for Regulation and Innovation
Authors: Mauritz Kop
Abstract: Quantum technologies promise transformative advancements but pose significant dual-use risks. Realizing their potential while mitigating risks necessitates a robust, anticipatory, and harmonized EU regulatory framework, grounded in the precautionary principle. Such a framework must be sui generis, as foundational quantum mechanical phenomena -incl. superposition, entanglement, and tunneling -defy the intuitive classical assumptions of factual certainty, causality, and locality that underpin existing legal paradigms, demanding a bespoke regulatory architecture that contributes to the emerging lex specialis for quantum information technologies. Responding to the Quantum Europe Strategy, this contribution outlines the rationale for a dedicated European Quantum Act. Drawing lessons from legislative strategies in the semiconductor (EU/US Chips Acts) and AI (EU AI Act) domains, and analyzing US and Chinese technology policy, we argue the EU needs a 'full-stack' industrial policy. We propose the EU Quantum Act should be a two-pillar instrument, combining New Legislative Framework-style regulation with an ambitious Chips Act-style industrial and security policy. This dual approach fosters innovation through strategic investment (e.g. via a DARPA-style agency) while managing risk through clear, risk-based tiers and regulatory sandboxes. This strategy is presented as essential for EU technological sovereignty and for building a strong transatlantic tech alliance. On the international stage, we advocate for a global non-proliferation framework for quantum and AI wmd's inspired by the IAEA/NPT model and overseen by an 'International Quantum Agency'. This vision culminates in the 'Qubits for Peace' initiative, a global governance structure to ensure quantum technologies are developed safely and ethically. The article concludes by consolidating the analysis into a detailed legislative blueprint.

Title: Resisting Quantum Key Distribution Attacks Using Quantum Machine Learning
Authors: Ali Al-kuwari, Noureldin Mohamed, Saif Al-kuwari, Ahmed Farouk, Bikash K. Behera
Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing poses significant risks to the security of modern communication networks as it breaks today's public-key cryptographic algorithms. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers a promising solution by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to establish secure keys. However, practical QKD implementations remain vulnerable to hardware imperfections and advanced attacks such as Photon Number Splitting and Trojan-Horse attacks. In this work, we investigate the potential of using quantum machine learning (QML) to detect popular QKD attacks. In particular, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) model to improve the detection of common QKD attacks. By combining quantum-enhanced learning with classical deep learning, the model captures complex temporal patterns in QKD data, improving detection accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model, we introduce a realistic QKD dataset simulating normal QKD operations along with seven attack scenarios, Intercept-and-Resend, Photon-Number Splitting (PNS), Trojan-Horse attacks Random Number Generator (RNG), Detector Blinding, Wavelength-dependent Trojan Horse, and Combined attacks. The dataset includes quantum security metrics such as Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER), measurement entropy, signal and decoy loss rates, and time-based metrics, ensuring an accurate representation of real-world conditions. Our results demonstrate promising performance of the quantum machine learning approach compared to traditional classical machine learning models, highlighting the potential of hybrid techniques to enhance the security of future quantum communication networks. The proposed Hybrid QLSTM model achieved an accuracy of 93.7.0\% after 50 training epochs, outperforming classical deep learning models such as LSTM, and CNN.

Title: Probing the meV QCD Axion with the $\texttt{SQWARE}$ Quantum Semiconductor Haloscope
Authors: Jaanita Mehrani, Tao Xu, Andrey Baydin, Michael J. Manfra, Henry O. Everitt, Andrew J. Long, Kuver Sinha, Junichiro Kono, Shengxi Huang
Abstract: We propose the Semiconductor-Quantum-Well Axion Radiometer Experiment ($\texttt{SQWARE}$) -- a new experimental platform for direct detection of axion dark matter in the meV mass range -- based on resonantly enhanced axion-photon conversion through the inverse Primakoff effect in engineered quantum semiconductor heterostructures. The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.

In this work, we present a play on quantum science and technologies aimed at a science-curious audience, which aims to lift the curtains on different researchers' perspectives on this rapidly evolving field. These notes expand on the ideas presented in the play and provide additional sources that may be useful for educators and directors in future productions. In "A Quantum of Hope", the end of the world has never looked so bureaucratic. When an alien civilization announces that Earth will be demolished to make way for a research station, humanity is given five years to prove its value. The evaluation criteria? Randomly chosen to be quantum science and technologies. Five experts, sampled from quantum academia and industry, are locked in a room to select a single project proposal to unite global efforts. Douglas Adams meets 12 Angry Men in a galactic-grade grant review committee, where scientific ideas, moral convictions, and unruly egos clash.

Title: Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Dimitrios Charamis, Manas Kulkarni, Jorge Kurchan, Laura Foini
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.

Title: Zero-energy resonances in ultracold hydrogen sticking to liquid helium films of finite thickness
Authors: R. Karahanyan, A. Voronin, V. Nesvizhevsky, A. Semakin, S. Vasiliev
Abstract: We investigated quantum states of ultracold hydrogen atoms in a combined potential comprising the H-He film interaction in the presence of a substrate and the Earth gravitational field. We show that the shift and width of the gravitational quantum states are determined by the complex scattering length for the H-He film-substrate potential. We demonstrate that for specific helium film thicknesses above a substrate, zero-energy resonances occur if the combined potential supports a bound state exactly at the threshold. This effect leads to a complete restructuring of the bound states spectrum. The dynamics of gravitational levels as a function of the van der Waals interaction depth controlled by the helium film thickness is analyzed. It reveals the critical thicknesses at about 6.1 and 1.8 nm, at which resonances appear in the case of the conductive substrate. With imaginary integral operators, we incorporate non-perturbatively the inelastic effects originating from the ripplon coupling. The inelastic effects show dramatic changes in the sticking-coefficient behavior near the critical points. The enhanced sticking coefficients provide a probe for studying critical phenomena and measuring atom-surface interaction parameters with unprecedented sensitivity.

Title: Multiple many-body localization transitions in a driven non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chain
Authors: Sanchayan Banerjee, Ayan Banerjee, Tapan Mishra, Flore K. Kunst
Abstract: We investigate the fate of a many-body localized phase in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic model of hardcore bosons subjected to periodic driving. While in general, the many-body localized system is known to thermalize with increasing driving period due to Floquet heating, in this case, we demonstrate that the initially localized system first delocalizes and then localizes again, resulting in a re-entrant many-body localization (MBL) transition as a function of the driving period. Strikingly, further increase in the driving period results in a series of localization-delocalization transitions leaving behind traces of extended regimes (islands) in between MBL phases. Furthermore, non-Hermiticity renders the extended islands boundary-sensitive, resulting in a Floquet many-body skin effect under open boundaries. We present numerical evidence from spectral and dynamic studies, confirming these findings. Our study opens new pathways for understanding the interplay between non-Hermiticity and quasiperiodicity in driven systems.

Title: Distances between pure quantum states induced by a distance matrix
Authors: Tomasz Miller, Rafał Bistroń
Abstract: With the help of a given distance matrix of size $n$, we construct an infinite family of distances $d_p$ (where $p \geq 2$) on the the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, modelling the space of pure states of an $n$-dimensional quantum system. The construction can be seen as providing a natural way to isometrically embed any given finite metric space into the space of pure quantum states 'spanned' upon it. In order to show that the maps $d_p$ are indeed distance functions -- in particular, that they satisfy the triangle inequality -- we employ methods of analysis, multilinear algebra and convex geometry, obtaining a non-trivial convexity result in the process. The paper significantly extends earlier work, resolving an important question about the geometry of quantum state space imposed by the quantum Wasserstein distances and solidifying the foundation for applications of distances $d_p$ in quantum information science.

Title: Large-order perturbation theory of linear eigenvalue problems
Authors: Stephen Jonathan Chapman
Abstract: We consider a class of linear eigenvalue problems depending on a small parameter epsilon in which the series expansion for the eigenvalue in powers of epsilon is divergent. We develop a new technique to determine the precise nature of this divergence. We illustrate the technique through its application to four examples: the anharmonic oscillator, a simplified model of equitorially-trapped Rossby waves, and two simplified models based on quasinormal modes of Reissner-Normstrom de Sitterblack holes.

Title: Krylov Complexity for Open Quantum System: Dissipation and Decoherence
Authors: Arpan Bhattacharyya, Sayed Gool, S. Shajidul Haque
Abstract: We investigate Krylov complexity in open quantum systems using Lindblad master equations for bosonic bath models, with particular emphasis on the Caldeira--Leggett model. Krylov complexity is computed from the moments of the two-point function within the standard master equation framework. For the damped harmonic oscillator, the results reveal clear dissipative features in Krylov complexity. In the Caldeira--Leggett model, in the high-temperature limit, we find that Krylov complexity saturates in the full system and reproduces the expected dissipative behavior when the decoherence term is suppressed in the master equation. Conversely, when the dissipative term is suppressed, the contribution from decoherence exhibits the familiar oscillatory dynamics of the coherent system, along with additional novel features. However, Krylov complexity appears insensitive to the onset of decoherence, as no clear distinctive signature is observed. We attribute this to the fact that Krylov complexity is defined in the Krylov basis, which does not coincide with the conventional basis typically used to study decoherence.

Title: Spin-photon coupling using circular double quantum dots
Authors: Ferdinand Omlor, Florinda Viñas Boström, Martin Leijnse
Abstract: We propose and analyze a microwave spin-photon interface based on a circular double quantum dot, inspired by recent experimental observations of anisotropic g-factors and ring states in InAs nanowires. We develop an effective theoretical model capturing the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic flux through the ring and show how ring states form at crossings of odd and even geometrical parity orbital states. Similar to bonding and antibonding states of conventional double quantum dots, the ring eigenstates can be changed into single dot states by detuning the dots, which enables a high degree of control over the system's properties. Applying a tilted magnetic field induces spin-charge hybridization which enables spin-photon coupling. For low disorder, the photons couple states of simultaneously (almost) opposite spin and angular momentum. With increasing disorder, the spin-photon coupling becomes analogous to the flopping mode mechanism of conventional double quantum dots where the spin is hybridized with the bonding and antibonding orbital states without angular momentum. We show that the system exhibits a second-order charge-noise sweet spot at a specific magnetic field angle, which lowers the system's sensitivity to dephasing while retaining a substantial spin-photon coupling strength. Moreover, the photon coupling mechanism can be switched off either electrically, by detuning to the single-dot regime, or magnetically, by rotating the field to disable the spin-charge hybridization.

Title: On Finite-Blocklength Noisy Classical-Quantum Channel Coding With Amplitude Damping Errors
Authors: Tamás Havas, Hsuan-Yin Lin, Eirik Rosnes, Ching-Yi Lai
Abstract: We investigate practical finite-blocklength classical-quantum channel coding over the quantum amplitude damping channel (ADC), aiming to transmit classical information reliably through quantum outputs. Our findings indicate that for any finite blocklength, a naive (uncoded) approach fails to offer any advantage over the ADC. Instead, sophisticated encoding strategies that leverage both classical error-correcting codes and quantum input states are crucial for realizing quantum performance gains at finite blocklengths.

Title: Fermat's Spiral-Based Characterization of Squeezed Nonlinear Motional States of Levitated Nanoparticle
Authors: Martin Duchaň, Alexandr Jonáš, Radim Filip, Jan Ježek, Petr Jákl, Pavel Zemánek, Martin Šiler
Abstract: Controlling the state of motion of optically levitated nanoparticles is crucial for the advancement of precision sensing, fundamental tests of physics, and the development of hybrid classical-quantum technologies. Experimentally, such control can be achieved by pulsed modifications of the optical potential confining the nanoparticle. Most frequently, the applied potential pulses are parabolic in nanoparticle position, and they expand/squeeze or displace the initial Gaussian state of motion to a modified Gaussian state. The time-dependent mean values and covariance matrix of the phase-space variables can fully characterize such a state. However, quasi-parabolic optical potentials with added weak Duffing-type nonlinearity, encountered in real-world experiments, can generally distort the state of motion to a non-Gaussian one, for which the description based solely on the mean values and covariance matrix fails. Here, we introduce a nonlinear transformation of the phase-space coordinates using the concept of Fermat's spiral, which effectively removes the state distortion induced by the Duffing-type nonlinearity and enables characterization of the state of motion by the standard Gaussian-state metrics. Comparisons of the experimental data with theoretical models show that the proposed coordinate transformation can recover the ideal behavior of a harmonic oscillator even after extended evolution of the system in the nonlinear potential. The presented scheme enables the separation of the effects of the applied state manipulation, the system's gradual thermalization, and the nonlinearity of the confinement on the experimentally observed dynamics of the system, thereby facilitating the design of advanced protocols for levitated optomechanics.

Title: Exploring dark matter with quantum-enhanced haloscopes and time projection chambers
Authors: David Díez-Ibáñez
Abstract: This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies. The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors. Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.

Title: Simultaneous Matching of Phase and Amplitude for Spontaneous Parametric Down-conversion in Semiconductor Waveguides
Authors: Albert Peralta Amores, Marcin Swillo
Abstract: We propose a non-uniform modulation of $\chi^{(2)}_{xyz}$ to significantly enhance photon pair generation efficiency via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in modal phase-matched semiconductor waveguides. This approach enables amplitude-matching in the transverse direction while preserving the phase-matching along the waveguide propagation axis. Our analysis predicts a tenfold efficiency increase in comparison to the most efficient non-modulated waveguide, and up to 13 orders of magnitude efficiency enhancements relative to solely phase-matched waveguides. Furthermore, we explore the implementation of a highly efficient compact twin-photon source, tunable across the communication band, using an amplitude- and phase-matched structure.

Title: Julia Set in Quantum Evolution: The case of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Manmeet Kaur, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the fractal boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, and the sensitivity of DQPTs to changes in boundary conditions is examined. In particular, it is demonstrated how the topology of the spin chain influences the occurrence of DQPTs. Additionally, aqualitative argument based on quantum speed limits is provided to explain the suppression of DQPTs under certain boundary modifications.

Title: Can Hawking effect of multipartite state protect quantum resources in Schwarzschild black hole?
Authors: Shu-Min Wu, Xiao-Wei Teng, Hui-Chen Yang, Rui-Yang Xu, P. H. M. Barros, H. A. S. Costa
Abstract: Most previous studies on relativistic quantum information have primarily focused on the vacuum state $|0\rangle$ and the first excited state $|1\rangle$ in two-mode entangled systems. In this work, we go beyond these limitations by considering arbitrary $q$-th excited states $|q\rangle$, aiming to investigate their role in preserving quantum resources. We analyze the influence of the Hawking effect on multipartite quantum states in the Schwarzschild spacetime, with particular attention to quantum entanglement and coherence. Our results show that, under the influence of the Hawking effect, increasing the excitation number $q$ leads to a reduction in quantum entanglement and mutual information, while enhancing quantum coherence. This indicates that the Hawking effect on excited multipartite states tends to degrade quantum correlations but simultaneously protects quantum coherence in curved spacetime. Therefore, when implementing quantum information protocols in gravitational settings, reducing the excitation number $q$ is favorable for maintaining entanglement, whereas increasing $q$ may be advantageous for tasks that rely on quantum coherence in relativistic quantum information processing.

Title: Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Rahul S, Giandomenico Palumbo
Abstract: Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable against non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the regimes where this robustness persists. Remarkably, we find that the zero indirect gap induces a suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect distinct from other physical mechanics already discussed in the literature. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.

Title: Rounding near-optimal quantum strategies for nonlocal games to strategies using maximally entangled states
Authors: Connor Paddock
Abstract: We establish approximate rigidity results for several well-known families of nonlocal games. In particular, we show that near-perfect quantum strategies for boolean constraint system (BCS) games are approximate representations of the corresponding BCS algebra. Likewise, for the class of XOR nonlocal games, we show that near-optimal quantum strategies are approximate representations of the corresponding $*$-algebra associated with optimal quantum values for the game. In both cases, the approximate representations are with respect to the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt norm and independent of the Hilbert space or quantum state employed in the strategy. We also show that approximate representation of the BCS (resp.~XOR-algebra) yields measurement operators for near-perfect (resp.~near-optimal) quantum strategies where the players employ a maximally entangled state in the game. As a corollary, every near-perfect BCS (resp.~near-optimal XOR) quantum strategy is close to a near-perfect (resp.~near-optimal) quantum strategy using a maximally entangled state. Lastly, we establish that every synchronous algebra is $*$-isomorphic to a certain BCS algebra called the SynchBCS algebra. This allows us to apply our BCS rigidity results to the class of synchronous games as well.

Jamieson, Andrea Morello
Abstract: Scalable quantum processors require high-fidelity universal quantum logic operations in a manufacturable physical platform. Donors in silicon provide atomic size, excellent quantum coherence and compatibility with standard semiconductor processing, but no entanglement between donor-bound electron spins has been demonstrated to date. Here we present the experimental demonstration and tomography of universal 1- and 2-qubit gates in a system of two weakly exchange-coupled electrons, bound to single phosphorus donors introduced in silicon by ion implantation. We surprisingly observe that the exchange interaction has no effect on the qubit coherence. We quantify the fidelity of the quantum operations using gate set tomography (GST), and we use the universal gate set to create entangled Bell states of the electrons spins, with fidelity ~ 93%, and concurrence 0.91 +/- 0.08. These results form the necessary basis for scaling up donor-based quantum computers.

Title: Trade-offs between classical and quantum space using spooky pebbling
Authors: Arend-Jan Quist, Alfons Laarman
Abstract: Pebble games are used to study space/time trade-offs. Recently, spooky pebble games were introduced to study classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs for simulation of classical circuits on quantum computers. In this paper, the spooky pebble game framework is applied for the first time to general circuits. Using this framework we prove an upper bound for quantum space in the spooky pebble game. We also prove that solving the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we present a solver for the spooky pebble game based on satisfiability solvers combined with heuristic optimizers. This spooky pebble game solver was empirically evaluated by calculating optimal classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs. Within limited runtime, the solver could find a strategy reducing quantum space when classical space is taken into account, showing that the spooky pebble model is useful to reduce quantum space.

Title: Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Phase Recognition in Two Dimensions
Authors: Leon C. Sander, Nathan A. McMahon, Petr Zapletal, Michael J. Hartmann
Abstract: Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are quantum circuits for characterizing complex quantum states. They have been proposed for recognizing quantum phases of matter at low sampling cost and have been designed for condensed matter systems in one dimension. Here we construct a QCNN that can perform phase recognition in two dimensions and correctly identify the phase transition from a Toric Code phase with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological order to the paramagnetic phase. The network also exhibits a noise threshold up to which the topological order is recognized. Furthermore, it captures correlations between all stabilizer elements of the Toric Code, which cannot be accessed by direct measurements. This increases the threshold for errors leading to such correlations and allows for correctly identifying the topological phase in the presence of strong correlated errors. Our work generalizes phase recognition with QCNNs to higher spatial dimensions and intrinsic topological order, where exploration and characterization via classical numerics become challenging.

Title: Quantum Computing Universal Thermalization Dynamics in a (2+1)D Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Niklas Mueller, Tianyi Wang, Or Katz, Zohreh Davoudi, Marko Cetina
Abstract: Simulating non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems, including thermalization, is a promising application of near-term and future quantum computation. By performing experiments on a digital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled trapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics of a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using randomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical approximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution and the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables exhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for thermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust tools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body systems, including in gauge theories.

Title: On the complexity of unique quantum witnesses and quantum approximate counting
Authors: Anurag Anshu, Jonas Haferkamp, Yeongwoo Hwang, Quynh T. Nguyen
Abstract: We study the long-standing open question on the power of unique witnesses in quantum protocols, which asks if $\textsf{UniqueQMA}$, a variant of $\textsf{QMA}$ whose accepting witness space is 1-dimensional, contains $\mathsf{QMA}$ under quantum reductions. This work rules out any black-box reduction from $\mathsf{QMA}$ to $\mathsf{UniqueQMA}$ by showing a quantum oracle separation between $\mathsf{BQP}^\mathsf{UniqueQMA}$ and $\mathsf{QMA}$. This provides a contrast to the classical case, where the Valiant-Vazirani theorem shows a black-box randomized reduction from $\mathsf{UniqueNP}$ to $\mathsf{NP}$, and suggests the need for studying the structure of the ground space of local Hamiltonians in distilling a potential unique witness. Via similar techniques, we show, relative to a quantum oracle, that $\mathsf{QMA}^\mathsf{QMA}$ cannot decide quantum approximate counting, ruling out a quantum analogue of Stockmeyer's algorithm in the black-box setting. We then ask a natural question; what structural properties of the local Hamiltonian problem can we exploit? We introduce a physically motivated candidate by showing that the ground energy of local Hamiltonians that satisfy a computational variant of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) can be estimated through a $\mathsf{UniqueQMA}$ protocol. Our protocol can be viewed as a quantum expander test in a low energy subspace of the Hamiltonian and verifies a unique entangled state across two copies of the subspace. This allows us to conclude that if $\mathsf{UniqueQMA}$ is not equivalent to $\mathsf{QMA}$, then $\mathsf{QMA}$-hard Hamiltonians must violate ETH under adversarial perturbations. This also serves as evidence that chaotic local Hamiltonians, such as the SYK model may be computationally simpler than general local Hamiltonians.

Title: Harnessing quantum back-action for time-series processing
Authors: Giacomo Franceschetto, Marcin Płodzień, Maciej Lewenstein, Antonio Acín, Pere Mujal
Abstract: Quantum measurements affect the state of the observed systems via back-action. While projective measurements extract maximal classical information, they drastically alter the system's configuration. In contrast, indirect measurements balance information extraction with the degree of disturbance. Considering the prevalent use of projective measurements in quantum computing and communication protocols, the potential benefits of indirect measurements in these fields remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating indirect measurements into a quantum machine-learning protocol known as quantum reservoir computing provides advantages in both execution time scaling and overall performance. We analyze different measurement settings by varying the measurement strength across two benchmarking tasks. Our results reveal that carefully optimizing both the reservoir Hamiltonian parameters and the measurement strength can significantly improve the quantum reservoir computing algorithm performance. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates improved memory performance when compared with state-of-the-art classical feedback protocols. This work provides a comprehensive and practical recipe to promote the implementation of indirect measurement-based protocols in quantum reservoir computing. Moreover, our findings motivate further exploration of experimental protocols that leverage the back-action effects of indirect measurements.

Title: Capturing the Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics of Black Holes in Quantum Computers
Authors: Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Kwangmin Yu, Muhammad Asaduzzaman, Raza Sabbir Sufian
Abstract: Quantum computers are emerging technologies expected to become important tools for exploring various aspects of fundamental physics in the future. Therefore, we pose the question of whether quantum computers can help us to study the Page curve and the black hole information dynamics, which has been a key focus in fundamental physics. In this regard, we rigorously examine the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation on IBM's superconducting quantum computers, to shed light on this question. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in this model. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques into our challenging implementation of entanglement entropy measurement protocols on the IBM quantum hardware, we accurately determine the Rényi entropy in the qubit transport model, thus showcasing the utility of quantum computers for future investigations of complex quantum systems.

Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Subspace-based quantum diagonalization methods offer a viable alternative for pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing the largest ground-state quantum simulation of impurity models using a Heron quantum processors and the Frontier supercomputer. We consider both the single-impurity Anderson model with 41 bath sites, and a system with 4 impurities and 7 bath sites per impurity. Our results are in excellent agreement with Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations.

Title: Scalable entanglement of nuclear spins mediated by electron exchange

Abstract: The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely upon coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit Control-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atoms binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepare and measure a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 +/- 5 $\%$ and a concurrence of 0.67 +/- 0.05. With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear-spin based quantum computers.

Title: Partial Quantum Shadow Tomography for Structured Operators and its Experimental Demonstration using NMR
Authors: Aniket Sengupta, Arijit Chatterjee, G. J. Sreejith, T. S. Mahesh
Abstract: Quantum shadow tomography based on the classical shadow representation provides an efficient way to estimate properties of an unknown quantum state without performing a full quantum state tomography. In scenarios where estimating the expectation values for only certain classes of observables is required, obtaining information about the entire density matrix is unnecessary. We propose a partial quantum shadow tomography protocol that estimates a subset of density matrix elements relevant to the expectation values of structured observables. Specifically, we identify specific subsets of the tomographically complete set ${\mathrm{Cl}}(2)^{\otimes n}$ and a simple pseudo-inverse of the associated channel, which can be used to estimate all elements of the density matrix with the same active order. By restricting the protocol to smaller subsets of single-qubit Pauli measurements, it becomes experimentally more efficient. We demonstrate the advantage over unitary designs, such as the Clifford, full Pauli basis, and methods utilizing mutually unbiased bases, by analytically deriving error bounds and numerically evaluating the protocol on structured operators. We experimentally demonstrate the partial shadow estimation scheme for a wide class of two-qubit states (pure, entangled, and mixed) in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. The full density matrix, reconstructed experimentally by combining different partial estimators, achieves fidelities around 99%.

Title: Infinite-fold Asymptotic Quantum Advantage in Classical Correlation Sensing
Authors: Janis Nötzel, Pere Munar-Vallespir
Abstract: We study the hypothesis testing problem of distinguishing between correlated thermal noise and uncorrelated thermal noise of the same average energy on $K$ detectors in asymptotic asymmetric hypothesis testing. We compare the performance of heterodyne or homodyne detection with classical post-processing, the most general quantum strategy (involving any arbitrary measurement), and a simple strategy involving a photonic chip and On-Off detection. When the average received energy per detector goes to zero, the photonic chip strategy asymptotically achieves the optimal decrease in the error, while heterodyne/homodyne measurements do not. Thus, we show that linear optics and On-Off measurement are enough to achieve better detection than classical methods when detecting correlations in thermal optical signals.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking for nonautonomous pseudo-Hermitian systems
Authors: L. F. Alves da Silva, M. H. Y. Moussa
Abstract: Here we first present an alternative formulation of the Lewis \& Riesenfeld theorem for solving the Schrödinger equation with nonautonomous Hermitian and pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We then employ this framework to characterize the spontaneous breaking of time-dependent antilinear symmetries of these Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that, under unbroken antilinear symmetries, the Lewis \& Riesenfeld phases are real and odd functions of time, which allows us to recover the well-known real spectra of time-independent pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. However, in the spontaneously broken regime, imaginary components of the Lewis \& Riesenfeld phases arise, leading to coalescence effects analogous to those in the time-independent scenario. Finally, we present an illustrative example of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry for a time-dependent Hamiltonian modeling the non-Hermitian dynamical Casimir effect.

Title: Scalable projected entangled-pair state representation of random quantum circuit states
Authors: Sung-Bin B. Lee, Hee Ryang Choi, Daniel Donghyon Ohm, Seung-Sup B. Lee
Abstract: Classical simulation of a programmable quantum processor is crucial in identifying the threshold of a quantum advantage. We demonstrate the simple update of projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) in the Vidal gauge that represent random quantum circuit states, which center around recent quantum advantage claims. Applied to square lattices of qubits akin to state-of-the-art superconducting processors, the PEPS representation is exact for circuit depths less than $\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{tr}$ = $\beta\log_2\chi$, where $\chi$ is the maximum bond dimension and $2 \lesssim \beta \lesssim 4$ depends on the choice of two-qubit gates, independent of the qubit number $n$. We find the universal scaling behaviors of the state fidelity by treating large-scale circuits of $n \leq 10^{4}$, using $\chi \leq 128$ on a conventional CPU. Our method has a polynomial scaling of computational costs with $n$ for circuit depth $\mathcal{D}=O(\log n)$ and is more advantageous than matrix product state approaches if $n$ is large. This work underscores PEPSs as a scalable tool for benchmarking quantum algorithms with future potential for sampling applications using advanced contraction techniques.

Title: From Polysemy to Quantum Attention: Context, Randomness, and Hilbert Space Perspectives on Large Language Models
Authors: Karl Svozil
Abstract: We trace a conceptual path from linguistic ambiguity to quantum-inspired architectures in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we examine polysemy and show how modern transformer networks resolve multiple word meanings through dynamic, context-dependent embeddings, contrasting this with an alternative framework rooted in quantum contextuality. Next, we consider stochasticity not as a flaw but as a central design principle: randomness in sampling provides the mechanism by which LLMs generate diverse, creative outputs and explore their own representational landscape. Finally, we introduce the notion of quantum attention, a speculative extension of the classical attention mechanism that constrains its transformations to be unitary. This shift reframes attention as a reversible rotation in Hilbert space rather than a dissipative mixture, aligning the processing of meaning in language models with fundamental structures of quantum theory.

Title: Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases
Authors: Xiao-Qi Sun
Abstract: Generalized symmetries have emerged as a powerful organizing principle for exotic quantum phases. However, their role in open quantum systems, especially for non-invertible cases, remains largely unexplored. We address this by applying a unified tensor-network framework for mixed states with fusion categorical symmetry, which encompasses both invertible and non-invertible ones represented as matrix product operators, and reveals novel quantum phases unique to the open-system setting through the lens of quantum anomalies. In contrast to pure states, where anomalies forbid symmetric short-range correlated phases in one dimension, we construct a broad class of renormalization fixed-point mixed states with zero correlation length given arbitrary strong anomalous fusion categorical symmetry. These states, representing nontrivial mixed-state phases of matter, cannot be efficient prepared via local quantum channels, indicating anomaly-enforced long-range entanglement in the absence of local correlations. Despite this obstruction, we further provide constructions of measurement-enhanced quantum circuits to prepare all these constructed states, offering a practical way to realize and probe anomalous generalized symmetries in open quantum systems.

Title: How to be an orthodox quantum mechanic
Authors: Geoff Beck
Abstract: This work sets out to answer a single question: what is the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics? However, we adopt a different approach to that normally used. Rather than surveying physicists, or poring over the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we review a collection of 42 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 12 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints, but also shows some interesting emerging deviations. Moreover, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense the orthodoxy down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has two consistent pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states and these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles. More fully, it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently induces random changes in its state, manifesting as a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.

Title: Inferring Quantum Network Topologies using Genetic Optimisation of Indirect Measurements
Authors: Conall J. Campbell, Matthew Mackinnon, Mauro Paternostro, Diana A. Chisholm
Abstract: The characterisation of quantum networks is fundamental to understanding how energy and information propagates through complex systems, with applications in control, communication, error mitigation and energy transfer. In this work, we explore the use of external probes to infer the network topology in the context of continuous-time quantum walks, where a single excitation traverses the network with a pattern strongly influenced by its topology. The probes act as decay channels for the excitation, and can be interpreted as performing an indirect measurement on the network dynamics. By making use of a Genetic Optimisation algorithm, we demonstrate that the data collected by the probes can be used to successfully reconstruct the topology of any quantum network with high success rates, where performance is limited only by computational resources for large network sizes. Moreover, we show that increasing the number of probes significantly simplifies the reconstruction task, revealing a tradeoff between the number of probes and the required computational power.

Title: A unified picture for quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects -- a review
Authors: Sacha Greenfield, Archana Kamal, Justin Dressel, Eli Levenson-Falk
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect is a striking feature of quantum mechanics with foundational implications and practical applications in quantum control, error suppression, and error correction. In recent years, the effect has branched off into a variety of different interpretations, making it easy to miss its underlying unifying features. In particular, the quantum Zeno effect has been studied in the context of both selective and nonselective measurements; for both pulsed and continuous interactions; for suppression and enhancement of decay (Zeno / anti-Zeno effects); and even in the absence of measurement entirely. This concise review presents a unified picture of these effects by examining how they all arise in the context of a driven qubit subjected to measurements or dissipation. Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are revealed as regimes of a unified effect that appears whenever a measurement-like process competes with a non-commuting evolution. The current landscape of Zeno and anti-Zeno effects is reviewed through this unifying lens, with a focus on experimental applications and implementations. Thus, this review is highly relevant to quantum computing specialists aiming to understand the quantum Zeno effect's applications in adjacent subfields or apply it in a novel way in their own research, while remaining accessible for new researchers interested in learning about cutting-edge tools in quantum control and measurement. The quantum Zeno effect is found to be both ubiquitous and essential for the future of near-term quantum computing.

Title: Trainability of Quantum Models Beyond Known Classical Simulability
Authors: Sabri Meyer, Francesco Scala, Francesco Tacchino, Aurelien Lucchi
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising candidates for near-term quantum computing, yet they face scalability challenges due to barren plateaus, where gradients vanish exponentially in the system size. Recent conjectures suggest that avoiding barren plateaus might inherently lead to classical simulability, thus limiting the opportunities for quantum advantage. In this work, we advance the theoretical understanding of the relationship between the trainability and computational complexity of VQAs, thus directly addressing the conjecture. We introduce the Linear Clifford Encoder (LCE), a novel technique that ensures constant-scaling gradient statistics on optimization landscape regions that are close to Clifford circuits. Additionally, we leverage classical Taylor surrogates to reveal computational complexity phase transitions from polynomial to super-polynomial as the initialization region size increases. Combining these results, we reveal a deeper link between trainability and computational complexity, and analytically prove that barren plateaus can be avoided in regions for which no classical surrogate is known to exist. Furthermore, numerical experiments on LCE transformed landscapes confirm in practice the existence of a super-polynomially complex ``transition zone'' where gradients decay polynomially. These findings indicate a plausible path to practically relevant, barren plateau-free variational models with potential for quantum advantage.

Title: Parametrized Quantum Circuit Learning for Quantum Chemical Applications
Authors: Grier M. Jones, Viki Kumar Prasad, Ulrich Fekl, Hans-Arno Jacobsen
Abstract: In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates -- provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational ans{ä}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits. Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain non-trivial for quantum approaches.

Title: Extending the Limited Performance of the Quantum Refrigerator with Catalysts
Authors: Cong Fu, Ousi Pan, Zhiqiang Fan, Yushun Tang, Shanhe Su, Youhui Lin, Jincan Chen
Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. The previous study in Ref.[1,2] demonstrated that the incorporation of a catalyst can significantly enhance the performance of a heat engine by broadening its operational regime and achieving a more favorable trade-off between work output and efficiency. Building on this powerful framework and innovative idea, here we further extend the concept to a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) and cooling capacity to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. Furthermore, through a comparison with catalytic heat engines, our analysis reveals that two distinct permutation types are necessary to simultaneously enhance the COP and operational range of refrigerators, in contrast to heat engines for which a single permutation suffices. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.

Title: Measuring Multiparticle Indistinguishability with the Generalized Bunching Probability
Authors: Shawn Geller, Emanuel Knill
Abstract: The indistinguishability of many bosons undergoing passive linear transformations followed by number basis measurements is fully characterized by the visible state of the bosons. However, measuring all the parameters in the visible state is experimentally demanding. We argue that the generalized bunching probability--which is the probability that all the input bosons arrive in a given subset of the output modes--provides useful partial information about the indistinguishability of the input bosons, by establishing that it is monotonic with respect to certain partial orders of distinguishability of the bosons. As an intermediate result, we prove that Lieb's permanental-dominance conjecture for immanants is equivalent to the following statement: for states that are invariant under permutations of the occupied visible modes, the generalized bunching probability is maximized when the bosons are perfectly indistinguishable. As a corollary, we show that if Lieb's conjecture holds, then the generalized bunching probability is monotonic with respect to the refinement partial order on what we refer to as partially labelled states. We also prove, unconditionally, that for states such that the single-particle density matrix is the same for each particle, the Haar average of the generalized bunching probability is Schur convex with respect to the eigenvalues of said single-particle density matrix. As an application of the Schur convexity, we show that when the single-particle density matrix is a Gibbs state, the mean generalized bunching probability serves as a thermometer.

Title: Optimizing Quantum Photonic Integrated Circuits using Differentiable Tensor Networks
Authors: Mathias Van Regemortel, Thomas Van Vaerenbergh
Abstract: Recent reports of large photonic nonlinearities in integrated photonic devices, using the strong excitonic light-matter coupling in semiconductors, necessitate a tailored design framework for quantum processing in the limit of low photon occupation. We present a gradient-based optimization method for quantum photonic integrated circuits, which are composed of nonlinear unitary coupling gates and stochastic, nonunitary components for sampling the photonic losses. As core of our method, differentiable tensor-networks are leveraged, which are accurate in the regime of low photonic occupation and modest intermode entanglement. After characterizing the circuit gate architecture with field simulations of GaAs-based samples, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by optimizing quantum photonic circuits for two key use cases: integrated designs for quantum optical state preparation and tailored optimal readout for quantum phase sensing.

Title: Exact Coset Sampling for Quantum Lattice Algorithms
Authors: Yifan Zhang
Abstract: We give a simple and provably correct replacement for the contested ``domain-extension'' in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~\citep{chen2024quantum}. The published Step 9 suffers from a periodicity/support mismatch. Our drop-in subroutine uses a pair-shift difference to cancel all unknown offsets exactly and to synthesize a uniform cyclic subgroup (zero-offset coset) of order $P$ inside $(\mathbb{Z}_{M_2})^n$. A subsequent QFT enforces the intended modular linear relation. The sole structural assumption is the residue accessibility condition, which enables coherent auxiliary cleanup; no amplitude periodicity is used. The unitary is reversible, uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves upstream asymptotics.

Title: A Closeness Centrality-based Circuit Partitioner for Quantum Simulations
Authors: Doru Thom Popovici, Harlin Lee, Mauro Del Ben, Naoki Yoshioka, Nobuyasu Ito, Katherine Klymko, Daan Camps, Anastasiia Butko
Abstract: Simulating quantum circuits (QC) on high-performance computing (HPC) systems has become an essential method to benchmark algorithms and probe the potential of large-scale quantum computation despite the limitations of current quantum hardware. However, these simulations often require large amounts of resources, necessitating the use of large clusters with thousands of compute nodes and large memory footprints. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end framework that provides an efficient partitioning scheme for large-scale QCs alongside a flexible code generator to offer a portable solution that minimizes data movement between compute nodes. By formulating the distribution of quantum states and circuits as a graph problem, we apply closeness centrality to assess gate importance and design a fast, scalable partitioning method. The resulting partitions are compiled into highly optimized codes that run seamlessly on a wide range of supercomputers, providing critical insights into the performance and scalability of quantum algorithm simulations.

Title: Quantum Noise in Amplifiers and Hawking/Dumb-Hole Radiation as Amplifier Noise
Authors: W. G. Unruh
Abstract: The quantum noise in a linear amplifier is shown to be thermal noise. The theory of linear amplifiers is applied first to the simplest, single or double oscillator model of an amplifier, and then to linear model of an amplifier with continuous fields and input and outputs. Finally it is shown that the thermal noise emitted by black holes first demonstrated by Hawking, and of dumb holes (sonic and other analogs to black holes), arises from the same analysis as for linear amplifiers. The amplifier noise of black holes acting as amplifiers on the quantum fields living in the spacetime surrounding the black hole is the radiation discovered by Hawking. For any amplifier, that quantum noise is completely characterized by the attributes of the system regarded as a classical amplifier, and arises out of those classical amplification factors and the commutation relations of quantum mechanics.

Title: Pseudo-real quantum fields
Authors: Maxim N. Chernodub, Peter Millington, Esra Sablevice
Abstract: We introduce the concept of pseudo-reality for complex numbers. We show that this concept, applied to quantum fields, provides a unifying framework for two distinct approaches to pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories. The first approach stems from analytically continuing Hermitian theories into the complex plane, while the second is based on constructing them from first principles. The pseudo-reality condition for bosonic fields resolves a long-standing problem with the formulation of gauge theories involving pseudo-Hermitian currents, sheds new light on the resolution of the so-called Hermiticity Puzzle, and may allow a consistent minimal coupling of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories to gravity. We focus on the $i\phi^3$ cubic scalar theory, obtaining the relevant pseudo-reality conditions up to quadratic order in the coupling; a theory of two complex scalar fields with non-Hermitian mass mixing; and the latter's coupling to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The general principle of pseudo-reality, however, is expected to contribute to the ongoing development of the first-principles construction of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, including their formulation in curved spacetimes.

Title: Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain
Authors: Róbert Juhász
Abstract: Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground state of clusters is either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. A consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, they are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an explanation of the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point, which was implicit in an early approach to the problem by Kibble-Zurek scaling [Dziarmaga, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 74}, 064416 (2006)]. Furthermore, by identifying the accessible excitations, we refine the functional form of the vanishing of the gap at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\tau$, as $n(\tau)\sim \ln^{-2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ln^2\tau}\right)$ for large $\tau$. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the density of defects at intermediate times of the annealing process.

Title: A Black Hole Airy Tail
Authors: Stefano Antonini, Luca V. Iliesiu, Pratik Rath, Patrick Tran
Abstract: In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instanton saddles proposed by Hernández-Cuenca, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why similar one-eigenvalue instanton saddles cannot be used to compute the quenched entropy due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit. Our results show how to use the gravitational path integral to prove that black holes in JT gravity have isolated ground states and to study their properties.
