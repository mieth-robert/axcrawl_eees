Title: Exponential gain in clock precision using quantum correlated ticks
Authors: Florian Meier, Yuri Minoguchi, Gianmichele Blasi, Géraldine Haack, Marcus Huber
Abstract: Creating precise timing devices at ultra-short time scales is not just an important technological challenge, but confronts us with foundational questions about timekeeping's ultimate precision limits. Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.

Title: Elevator Codes: Concatenation for resource-efficient quantum memory under biased noise
Authors: Peter Shanahan, Diego Ruiz
Abstract: Biased-noise qubits, in which one type of error (e.g. $X$- and $Y$-type errors) is significantly suppressed relative to the other (e.g. $Z$-type errors), can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum error correction. Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $\eta \ge 7\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $\eta = 2 \times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches.

Title: Critical non-equilibrium phases from noisy topological memories
Authors: Amir-Reza Negari, Subhayan Sahu, Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri, Timothy H. Hsieh
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of an extended non-equilibrium critical phase, characterized by sub-exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), in the surface code subject to heralded random Pauli measurement channels. By mapping the resulting mixed state to the ensemble of completely packed loops on a square lattice, we relate the extended phase to the Goldstone phase of the loop model. In particular, CMI is controlled by the characteristic length scale of loops, and we use analytic results of the latter to establish polylogarithmic decay of CMI in the critical phase. We find that the critical phase retains partial logical information that can be recovered by a global decoder, but not by any quasi-local decoder. To demonstrate this, we introduce a diagnostic called punctured coherent information which provides a necessary condition for quasi-local decoding.

Title: Parent Hamiltonians for stabilizer quantum many-body scars
Authors: Shane Dooley
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) have attracted considerable interest due to their role in weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems. We present a general construction that embeds stabilizer states as QMBS of local Hamiltonians. The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian.

Title: Charging a quantum battery from the Bloch sphere
Authors: C. A. Downing, M. S. Ukhtary
Abstract: We reconsider the quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics of the charging process of a simple, two-component quantum battery model made up of a charger qubit and a single--cell battery qubit. We allow for the initial quantum state of the charger to lie anywhere on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and find the generalized analytical expressions describing the stored energy, ergotropy and capacity of the battery, all of which depend upon the initial Bloch sphere polar angle in a manner evocative of the quantum area theorem. The origin of the ergotropy produced, as well as the genesis of the battery capacity, can be readily traced back to the quantum coherences and population inversions generated (and the balance between these two mechanisms is contingent upon the starting Bloch polar angle). Importantly, the ergotropic charging power and its associated optimal charging time display notable deviations from standard results which disregard thermodynamic considerations. Our theoretical groundwork may be useful for guiding forthcoming experiments in quantum energy science based upon coupled two-level systems.

Title: Efficient Quantum Circuits for the Hilbert Transform
Authors: Henry Zhang, Joseph Li
Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform and quantum wavelet transform have been cornerstones of quantum information processing. However, for non-stationary signals and anomaly detection, the Hilbert transform can be a more powerful tool, yet no prior work has provided efficient quantum implementations for the discrete Hilbert transform. This letter presents a novel construction for a quantum Hilbert transform in polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth for a signal of length $N$, exponentially fewer operations than classical algorithms for the same mapping. We generalize this algorithm to create any $d$-dimensional Hilbert transform in depth $O(d\log N)$. Simulations demonstrate effectiveness for tasks such as power systems control and image processing, with exact agreement with classical results.

Title: Two-tooth bosonic quantum comb for temporal-correlation sensing
Authors: Shaojiang Zhu, Xinyuan You, Alexander Romanenko, Anna Grassellino
Abstract: We introduce a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures the sequential interactions between a thermal absorber and a long-lived coherent probe. The comb provides a causal, multi-time description of coherence transport, tracking how the probe records both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations. Using a process-tensor formulation, we derive closed form expressions showing that interference between the two interaction windows generates a non-monotonic memory response that reflects a fundamental competition between the absorbers thermal population and its dynamical correlations. By sweeping the temporal separation between the interaction windows, the probe directly samples the absorbers population correlator, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations. The approach is readily compatible with circuit-QED platforms and offers a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments.

Title: Quantum trajectories for time-binned data and their closeness to fully conditioned quantum trajectories
Authors: Nattaphong Wonglakhon, Areeya Chantasri, Howard M. Wiseman
Abstract: Quantum trajectories are dynamical equations for quantum states conditioned on the results of a time-continuous measurement, such as a continuous-in-time current $\vec y_t$. Recently there has been renewed interest in dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with time-intervals of finite size $\Delta t$. Guilmin \emph{et al.} (unpublished) derived such a dynamical map for the (experimentally relevant) case where only the average current $I_t$ over each interval is available. Surprisingly, this binned data still generates a conditioned state $\rho_\text{\faFaucet}$ that is almost pure (for efficient measurements), with an impurity scaling as $(\Delta t)^{3}$. We show that, nevertheless, the typical distance of $\rho_\text{\faFaucet}$ from $\hat{\psi}_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$ -- the projector for the pure state conditioned on the full current -- is as large as $(\Delta t)^{3/2}$. We introduce another finite-interval dynamical map (``$\Phi$-map''), which requires only one additional real statistic, $\phi_t$, of the current in the interval, that gives a conditioned state $\hat{\psi}_\Phi$ which is only $(\Delta t)^{2}$-distant from $\hat{\psi}_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$. We numerically verify these scalings of the error (distance from the true states) for these two maps, as well as for the lowest-order (Itô) map and two other higher-order maps. Our results show that, for a generic system, if the statistic $\phi_t$ can be extracted from experiment along with $I_t$, then the $\Phi$-map gives a smaller error than any other.

Title: The Hilbert-Schmidt norms of quantum channels and matrix integrals over the unit sphere
Authors: Yuan Li, Zhengli Chen, Zhihua Guo, Yongfeng Pang
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems are generally described by a family of quantum channels (linear, completely positive and trace preserving maps). In this note, we mainly study the range of all possible values of $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2^2+\|\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}\|_2^2$ for quantum channels $\mathcal{E}$ and give the equivalent characterizations for quantum channels that achieve these maximum and minimum values, respectively, where $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $\mathcal{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}$ is a complementary channel of $\mathcal{E}.$ Also, we get a concrete description of completely positive maps on infinite dimensional systems preserving pure states. Moreover, the equivalency of several matrix integrals over the unit sphere is demonstrated and some extensions of these matrix integrals are obtained.

Title: The two-time Leggett-Garg inequalities of a superconducting qubit interacting with thermal photons in a cavity
Authors: Hiroo Azuma
Abstract: In this paper, we study the two-time Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities of a quantum optical model that appears in the Josephson-junction quantum bit (qubit) interacting with an external magnetic flux. This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger.

Authors: Anders Høst-Madsen
Abstract: In this paper a central server Charlie has access to a quantum system C and measures it with a POVM $\{\Lambda_x\}$. Alice and Bob are only interested in the partial results $g_A(x)$ respectively $g_B(x)$. Alice, Bob, and Charlie share common randomness and Alice and Bob only need to faithfully simulate their measurements. The paper develops to achievable regions for the amount of communication needed to Alice and Bob.

Title: Stabilizer Code-Generic Universal Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation
Authors: Nicholas J.C. Papadopoulos, Ramin Ayanzadeh
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.

Title: Noise-Aware Quantum Architecture Search Based on NSGA-II Algorithm
Authors: Chenlu Li, Hui Zeng, Dazhi Ding
Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) has emerged to automate the design of high-performance quantum circuits under specific tasks and hardware constraints. We propose a noise-aware quantum architecture search (NA-QAS) framework based on variational quantum circuit design. By incorporating a noise model into the training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) , the proposed framework identifies the noise-robust architectures. We introduce a hybrid Hamiltonian $\varepsilon$ -greedy strategy to optimize evaluation costs and circumvent local optima. Furthermore, an enhanced variable-depth NSGA-II algorithm is employed to navigate the vast search space, enabling an automated trade-off between architectural expressibility and quantum hardware overhead. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through binary classification and iris multi-classification tasks under a noisy condition. Compared to existing approaches, our framework can search for quantum architectures with superior performance and greater resource efficiency under a noisy condition.

Title: Off-resonant preservation and generation of imaginarity in distributed scenarios
Authors: Si-Min Wang, Ming-Liang Hu, Heng Fan
Abstract: We study the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA), which treat imaginarity as a resource in distributed scenarios. For two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, it is shown that both the NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in the presence of large and symmetric detuning between the qubits and the cavity. Moreover, the off-resonant interaction generates a high degree of NAQI and DIA from the initial product states of two qubits having the same detunings and unequal couplings to the cavity. Based on the effective coupling of the qubits induced by the cavity mode, we explain the physical mechanism underlying the validity of this strategy. Our findings shed light on the role that off-resonant interactions have in the efficient control of imaginarity in distributed scenarios.

Title: Certifying entanglement dimensionality by random Pauli sampling
Authors: Changhao Yi
Abstract: We introduce a Pauli-measurement-based algorithm to certify the Schmidt number of $n$-qubit pure states. Our protocol achieves an average-case sample complexity of $\caO(\mathrm{poly}(n)\chi^2)$, a substantial improvement over the $\caO(2^n \chi)$ worst-case bound. By utilizing local pseudorandom unitaries, we ensure the worst case can be transformed into the average-case with high probability. This work establishes a scalable approach to high-dimensional entanglement certification and introduces a proof framework for random Pauli sampling.

Title: Converting qubit relaxation into erasures with a single fluxonium
Authors: Chenlu Liu, Yulong Li, Jiahui Wang, Quan Guan, Lijing Jin, Lu Ma, Ruizi Hu, Tenghui Wang, Xing Zhu, Hai-Feng Yu, Chunqing Deng, Xizheng Ma
Abstract: Qubits that experience predominantly erasure errors offer distinct advantages for fault-tolerant operation. Indeed, dual-rail encoded erasure qubits in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high-fidelity operations by converting physical-qubit relaxation into logical-qubit erasures, but this comes at the cost of increased hardware overhead and circuit complexity. Here, we address these limitations by realizing erasure conversion in a single fluxonium operated at zero flux, where the logical state is encoded in its 0-2 subspace. A single, carefully engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line (EOL) logical measurement. Post-selection on non-erasure outcomes results in more than four-fold increase of the logical lifetime, from $193~\mu$s to $869~\mu$s. Finally, we characterize measurement-induced logical dephasing as a function of measurement power and frequency, and infer that each erasure check contributes a negligible error of $7.2\times 10^{-5}$. These results establish integer-fluxonium as a promising, resource-efficient platform for erasure-based error mitigation, without requiring additional hardware.

Title: UAV-Deployed OAM-BB84 QKD: Turbulence- and Misalignment-Resilient Decoy-State Finite-Key Security with AI-Assisted Calibration
Authors: Linxier Deng
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for quantum key distribution (QKD) using orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoded BB84 on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. A unified channel model captures Kolmogorov turbulence, pointing induced misalignment, and finite aperture clipping, enabling quantitative predictions of inter mode crosstalk and the resulting quantum bit error rate (QBER). Using a weak plus vacuum decoy state formulation, we derive composable finite key lower bounds on the secret key rate that incorporate statistical fluctuations, detector dark counts, efficiency mismatch, and error correction leakage. To stabilize performance under non stationary flight conditions, we introduce a lightweight physics informed learning module that combines physical priors with measured link statistics to classify valid pulses, reject corrupted data, and recommend decoding strategies. We outline a complete evaluation pipeline including UAV system architecture, turbulence driven QBER maps, decoy optimization, finite key scaling, and AI calibration metrics. Simulations indicate that under moderate turbulence and milliradian level pointing jitter, the proposed AI assisted method can improve the secret key rate by 10 percent to 30 percent while preserving composable security.

Title: From three-body resonances to bound states in a continuum: pole trajectories
Authors: Lucas Happ
Abstract: We investigate the formation of three-body bound states in the continuum by tracing pole trajectories in the complex energy plane under variation of system parameters. Using a one-dimensional model of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle interacting via Gaussian potentials, we systematically vary the interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio. Our results confirm the parametric nature of few-body bound states in a continuum (BIC) and extend this characterization to a broader set of system parameters. Specifically, we find that variations of both interaction parameters and the mass ratio can lead to the formation of at least one three-body BIC. However, the exact shape of trajectories differs, and for the mass ratio variation we find a more regular pattern with multiple BIC locations. These results suggest that the mechanism of few-body BIC formation is more sensitive to the kinematic structure of the problem than to the specific details of the two-body interaction.

Title: Concatenated continuous driving of silicon qubit by amplitude and phase modulation
Authors: Takuma Kuno, Takeru Utsugi, Andrew J.

Abstract: The rate of coherence loss is lower for a qubit under Rabi drive compared to a freely evolving qubit, $T_{2}^{\rm{Rabi}}>T_{2}^*$. Building on this principle, concatenated continuous driving (CCD) keeps the qubit under continuous drive to suppress noise and manipulate dressed states by either phase or amplitude modulation. In this work, we propose a new variant of CCD which simultaneously modulates both the amplitude and phase of the driving field to generate a circularly-polarized field in the rotating frame of the carrier frequency. This circular-modulated (CM)-CCD cancels the counter-rotating term in the second rotating frame, eliminating a systematic pulse-area error that arises from an imperfect rotating wave approximation for fast gates. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed CMCCD achieves higher gate fidelity than conventional CCD schemes. We further implement and compare different CCD protocols using an electron spin-qubit in an isotopically purified $^{28}$Si-MOS quantum dot and evaluate its robustness by applying static detuning and Rabi frequency errors. The robustness is significantly improved compared to standard Rabi-drive, showing the effectiveness of this scheme for qubit arrays with variation in qubit frequency, coupling to Rabi drive, and low frequency noise. The proposed scheme can be applied to various physical systems, including trapped atoms, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and NV-centers.

Title: Shortcuts to adiabaticity, unexciting backgrounds, and reflectionless potentials
Authors: Fernando C. Lombardo, Francisco D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: We analyze shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) and their completions for the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) with time-dependent frequency, as well as for quantum field theory (QFT) in non-stationary backgrounds. We exploit the analogy with one-dimensional quantum mechanics, and the well known correspondence between Bogoliubov coefficients in the QHO and transmission/reflection amplitudes in scattering theory. Within this framework, STA protocols for the QHO are equivalent to transmission resonances, while STA in QFT with homogeneous backgrounds correspond to reflectionless potentials. Moreover, using the connection between particle creation and squeezed states, we show how STA completions can be understood in terms of the anti-squeezing operator.

Title: Controlled Parity of Cooper Pair Tunneling in a Hybrid Superconducting Qubit
Authors: David Feldstein-Bofill, Leo Uhre Jacobsen, Ksenia Shagalov, Zhenhai Sun, Casper Wied, Shikhar Singh, Anders Kringhøj, Jacob Hastrup, András Gyenis, Karsten Flensberg, Svend Krøjer, Morten Kjaergaard
Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits derive their nonlinearity from the Josephson energy-phase relation. Besides the fundamental $\cos\phi$ term, this relation can also contain higher Fourier harmonics $\cos(k\phi)$ corresponding to correlated tunneling of $k$ Cooper pairs. The parity of the dominant tunneling process, i.e.~whether an odd or even number of Cooper pairs tunnel, results in qualitatively different properties, and controlling this opens up a wide range of applications in superconducting technology. However, access to even-dominated regimes has remained challenging and has so far relied on complex multi-junction or all-hybrid architectures. Here, we demonstrate a simple "harmonic parity qubit" (HPQ); an element that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel to a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction forming a SQUID, and use spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct its energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points. At half flux quantum, the odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near $\pm\pi/2$. The ability to control harmonic parity enables supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and provides a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits.

Title: Dressed-state relaxation in coupled qubits as a source of two-qubit gate errors
Authors: Ruixia Wang, Jiayu Ding, Chenlu Wang, Yujia Zhang, He Wang, Wuerkaixi Nuerbolati, Zhen Yang, Xuehui Liang, Weijie Sun, Haifeng Yu, Fei Yan
Abstract: Understanding error mechanisms in two-qubit gate operations is essential for building high-fidelity quantum processors. While prior studies predominantly treat dephasing noise as either Markovian or predominantly low-frequency, realistic qubit environments exhibit structured, frequency-dependent spectra. Here we demonstrate that noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting--set by the inter-qubit coupling strength g--induces a distinct relaxation channel that degrades gate performance. Through combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra, we show that two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with the noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, extending the concept of $T_{1\rho}$ relaxation to interacting systems. This frequency-selective relaxation mechanism, universal across platforms, enriches our understanding of decoherence pathways during gate operations. The same mechanism sets coherence limits for dual-rail or singlet-triplet encodings.

Title: Skyrmion Quantum Diode Prototype: Bridging Micromagnetic Simulations and Quantum Models
Authors: Haowen Yang, Gerald Bissell, Han Zhong, Peter Van Kirk, Tiger Cao, Pengcheng Lu, Yingying Wu
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness against perturbations. Their topological stability makes them robust information carriers, ideal for tackling a key challenge in quantum computing: creating reliable, one-way links between different types of qubits. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce a novel device - the skyrmion quantum diode - based on skyrmion qubits. Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors

Title: No quantum solutions to linear constraint systems from monomial measurement-based quantum computation in odd prime dimension
Authors: Markus Frembs, Cihan Okay, Ho Yiu Chung
Abstract: We combine the study of resources in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) with that of quantum solutions to linear constraint systems (LCS). Contextuality of the input state in MBQC has been identified as a key resource for quantum advantage, and in a stronger form, underlies algebraic relations between (measurement) operators which obey classically unsatisfiable (linear) constraints. Here, we compare these two perspectives on contextuality, and study to what extent they are related. More precisely, we associate a LCS to certain MBQC which exhibit strong forms of state-dependent contextuality, and ask if the measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to state-independent contextuality in the form of quantum solutions of its associated LCS. Our main result rules out such quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC. This both sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and further generalises results on the non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimension.

Title: Transmon Architecture for Emission and Detection of Single Microwave Photons
Authors: Daniel L. Campbell, Stephen McCoy, Melinda Andrews, Alexander Madden, Viva R. Horowitz, Bakir Husremović, Samuel Marash, Christopher Nadeau, Man Nguyen, Michael Senatore, Samuel Schwab, Erin Sheridan, Matthew D. LaHaye
Abstract: We showcase the recently developed double transmon coupler (DTC) circuit as a compact, drop-in, tunable and transition-selective link between an otherwise coherent transmon and the continuum of modes in a waveguide. We use these transmon-DTC devices as transmon emitter/dectectors (TEDs) for microwave photons. We highlight the flexibility of these devices by sending photons from a source TED to a measurement TED using a meter of coaxial cable and a circulator, each TED with nominally identical circuit parameters. We detect $60\,\%$ of the photons using this setup where we infer that $95\,\%$ of the photons at the input of the measurement TED are detected. Reset and photon emission/detection each require about $2\,\mu$s, for a minimum protocol duration of $4\,\mu$s, for our choice of TED parameters. Transmon-waveguide links like the DTC serve an important role in quantum information processors: they provide a mechanism for unconditional fast reset, metrology, and as nascent quantum communication interfaces for quantum networking.

Title: Quantum-enhanced optimization for patient stratification in clinical trials
Authors: Laia Domingo, Christine Johnson
Abstract: Clinical trials are notorious for their high failure rates and steep costs, leading to wasted time and resources spend, prolonged development timelines, and delayed patient access to new therapies. A key contributor to these failures is biological uncertainty, which complicates trial design and weakens the ability to detect true treatment effects. In particular, inadequate patient stratification often results in covariate imbalances across treatment arms, masking treatment effects and reducing statistical power, even when therapies are effective for specific patient subpopulations. This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints. Using real clinical trial data, we demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods achieve high-quality stratification while scaling efficiently to larger cohorts. In our benchmark study, the quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over a 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale. This report shows how improved stratification can lead to decision-relevant gains, including up to a fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity. Together, these results show that optimization-driven stratification can strengthen clinical trial design, improve confidence in downstream decisions, and reduce the risk of costly late-stage failure.

Title: Simulating Quantum Walk Hamiltonians without Pauli Decomposition
Authors: Mostafa Atallah, Alvin Gonzales, Daniel Dilley, Igor Gaidai, Zain H. Saleem, Rebekah Herrman
Abstract: In this work, we present a new algorithm for generating quantum circuits that efficiently implement continuous time quantum walks on arbitrary simple sparse graphs. The algorithm, called matching decomposition, works by decomposing a continuous-time quantum walk Hamiltonian into a collection of exactly implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to matchings in the underlying graph followed by a novel graph compression algorithm that merges edges in the graph. Lastly, we convert the walks to a circuit and Trotterize over these components. The dynamics of the walker on each edge in the matching can be implemented in the circuit model as sequences of CX and CRx gates. We do not use Pauli decomposition when implementing walks along each matching. Furthermore, we compare matching decomposition to a standard Pauli-based simulation pipeline and find that matching decomposition consistently yields substantial resource reductions, requiring up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits than Pauli decomposition across multiple graph families. Finally, we also present examples and theoretical results for when matching decomposition can exactly simulate a continuous-time quantum walk on a graph.

Title: Noisy Analysis of Quantum SMOTE on Condition Monitoring and Fault Classification in Industrial and Energy Systems
Authors: Amit S. Patel, Himanshukumar R. Patel, Bikash K. Behera
Abstract: Imbalanced datasets are a fundamental issue in industrial condition monitoring and fault classification pipelines, causing classical machine learning models to overfit the majority classes while failing to learn the minority fault patterns. This work presents a detailed benchmarking and robustness investigation of classical classifiers under class imbalance mitigation using the Quantum Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (QSMOTE) and quantum-inspired perturbations modelled using six noise channels. Four different datasets, the Solar Panel Image Dataset (SPID), the CWRU Bearing Dataset (CWRUBD), the Engine Failure Detection Dataset (EFDD), and the Industrial Fault Detection Dataset (IFDD), are tested across multi-class scenarios to determine the universality of these impacts. The results show that QSMOTE consistently corrects distributional skew and significantly enhances the performance of non-linear classifiers such as Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees (DT), yielding improvements of up to 170% on EFDD and achieving near-perfect accuracy ($\geq$0.99) on IFDD. Linear and probabilistic models, such as Linear Regression (LR) and Naive Bayes (NB), produce mixed results, with significant degradation in overlapping feature spaces due to interpolation-induced boundary distortion. A parallel robustness analysis under different noise models reveals that ensemble models (RF) and margin-based learners (SVM) maintain strong resilience, often preserving over 95% of baseline accuracy even under maximum noise. In contrast, NB and DT show substantial instability, especially on high-variance datasets. The findings establish a rigorous baseline for understanding how classical models behave under realistic imbalance and quantum-inspired noise.

Abstract: Freely propagating electrons may serve as quantum probes that can become coherently correlated with other quantum systems, offering access to advanced metrological resources. We propose a setup that coherently couples free electrons in an electron microscope to a trapped-ion quantum processor, enabling non-destructive, quantum-coherent detection and the accumulation of information across multiple electrons. Our analysis shows that single electrons can induce resolvable qubit excitations, establishing a platform for practical applications such as quantum-enhanced, dose-efficient electron microscopy.

Title: Heat, work, and fluctuations in a driven quantum resonator
Authors: Riya Baruah, Pedro Portugal, Jun-Zhe Chen, Joachim Wabnig, Christian Flindt
Abstract: A central building block of a heat engine is the working fluid, which mediates the conversion of heat into work. In nanoscale heat engines, the working fluid can be a quantum system whose behavior and dynamics are non-classical. A particularly versatile realization is a quantum resonator, which allows for precise control and coupling to thermal reservoirs, making it an ideal platform for exploring quantum thermodynamic processes. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a driven quantum resonator whose temperature is controlled by modulating its natural frequency. We evaluate the work performed by the external drive and the resulting heat flow between the resonator and its environment, both within linear response and beyond. To further elucidate these processes, we determine the full distribution of photon exchanges between the resonator and its environment, characterized by its first few cumulants. Our results provide quantitative insights into the interplay between heat, work, and fluctuations, and may help in designing future heat engines.

Title: Lambert W Function Framework for Graphene Nanoribbon Quantum Sensing: Theory, Verification, and Multi-Modal Applications
Authors: F. A. Chishtie, K. Roberts, N. Jisrawi, S. R. Valluri, A. Soni, P. C. Deshmukh
Abstract: We establish a rigorous mathematical framework connecting graphene nanoribbon quantum sensing to the Lambert W function through the finite square well (FSW) analogy. The Lambert W function, defined as the inverse of $f(W) = We^W$, provides exact analytical solutions to transcendental equations governing quantum confinement. We demonstrate that operating near the branch point at $z = -1/e$ yields sensitivity enhancement factors scaling as $\eta_{\text{enh}} \propto (z - z_c)^{-1/2}$, achieving 35-fold enhancement at $\delta = 0.001$. Comprehensive numerical verification confirms: (i) all seven bound states for strength parameter $R = 10$ satisfying the constraint $u^2 + v^2 = R^2$; (ii) exact agreement between theoretical band gap formula $E_g = 2\pi\hbar v_F/(3L)$ and empirical relation $E_g = 1.38/L$ eV$\cdot$nm; (iii) universal sensitivity scaling across biomedical (SARS-CoV-2, inflammatory markers, cancer biomarkers), environmental (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, NO$_2$, N$_2$O, H$_2$O), and physical (strain, magnetic field, temperature) sensing modalities. This unified framework provides design principles for next-generation graphene quantum sensors with analytically predictable performance.

Title: Towards Tensor Network Models for Low-Latency Jet Tagging on FPGAs
Authors: Alberto Coppi, Ema Puljak, Lorenzo Borella, Daniel Jaschke, Enrique Rico, Maurizio Pierini, Jacopo Pazzini, Andrea Triossi, Simone Montangero
Abstract: We present a systematic study of Tensor Network (TN) models $\unicode{x2013}$ Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) $\unicode{x2013}$ for real-time jet tagging in high-energy physics, with a focus on low-latency deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Motivated by the strict requirements of the HL-LHC Level-1 trigger system, we explore TNs as compact and interpretable alternatives to deep neural networks. Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.

Title: Chemically decisive benchmarks on the path to quantum utility
Authors: Srivathsan Poyyapakkam Sundar, Vibin Abraham, Bo Peng, Ayush Asthana
Abstract: Progress towards quantum utility in chemistry requires not only algorithmic advances, but also the identification of chemically meaningful problems whose electronic structure fundamentally challenges classical methods. Here, we introduce a curated hierarchy of chemically decisive benchmark systems designed to probe distinct regimes of electronic correlation relevant to molecular, bioinorganic, and heavy-element chemistry. Moving beyond minimal toy models, our benchmark set spans multireference bond breaking (N$_2$), high-spin transition-metal chemistry (FeS), biologically relevant iron-sulfur clusters ([2Fe-2S]), and actinide-actinide bonding (U$_2$), which exhibits extreme sensitivity to active-space choice, relativistic treatment, and correlation hierarchy even within advanced multireference frameworks. As a concrete realization, we benchmark a recently developed automated and adaptive quantum algorithm based on generator-coordinate-inspired subspace expansion,ADAPT-GCIM, using a black-box workflow that integrates entropy-based active-space selection via the ActiveSpaceFinder tool. Across this chemically diverse problem set, ADAPT-GCIM achieves high accuracy in challenging correlation regimes. Equally importantly, these benchmarks expose general failure modes and design constraints-independent of any specific algorithm-highlighting the necessity of problem-aware and correlation-specific strategies for treating strongly correlated chemistry on quantum computers. To support systematic benchmarking and reproducible comparisons, the Hamiltonians for all systems studied are made openly available.

Title: Widefield NV Magnetic Field Reconstruction for Probing the Meissner Effect and Critical Current Density under Pressure
Authors: Kin On Ho, Cassandra Dailledouze, Martin Schmidt, Loïc Toraille, Marie-Pierre Adam, Jean-François Roch
Abstract: The spatial distribution of a magnetic field can be determined with micrometer resolution using widefield nitrogen vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging. Nevertheless, reconstructing the magnetic field from the raw data can be challenging due to the degeneracy of the four possible NV axes and the tremendous amount of data. While a qualitative approach is sufficient for most analyses, a quantitative analysis offers deeper insight into the physical system. Here, we apply NV widefield magnetic imaging to a HgBa$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg-1223) superconducting microcrystal at a pressure of 4 GPa. We fit the results with solutions from the Hamiltonian describing the NV center ground state and take into account the relative intensities of the resonances to determine the local magnetic field magnitude and angle. Thus, we reconstruct the temperature-dependent expulsion of the magnetic field due to the Meissner effect around the superconductor. By comparing the resulting parameters to Brandt's model, which describes the magnetic behavior of a type-II superconductor, we extract the critical current density $j_c$. Overall, this work showcases the first widefield quantitative reconstruction of the Meissner effect under pressure and an optical method to study critical current density. Thus, it provides new insights into the application of NV magnetometry to superconductivity research at high pressures.

Title: Experimental study of coupled quantum billiards with integrable and chaotic classical dynamics and test of a special Rosenzweig-Porter model
Authors: Xiaodong Zhang, Jiongning Che, Barbara Dietz
Abstract: We report on the experimental study of the spectral properties of quantum systems consisting of two quantum billiards (QBs), one with chaotic, the other one with integrable classical dynamics, that are coupled to each other via an opening in a common wall. They are compared to those of a special case of the Rosenzweig-Porter model with random matrices composed of two diagonal blocks modeling the spectral properties of the QBs, that are coupled with a tunable parameter. We demonstrate that this model is suitable for the description of the experimental data and thus may be employed to determine the strength of the coupling. It results from the increasing overlap of eigenmodes in the QBs penetrating through the opening into the other one, leading to a mixing of their eigenstates, and the breaking of the symmetry present in the QB with integrable dynamics. This implicates deviations of the spectral properties from those of typical quantum systems with integrable and chaotic dynamics, respectively, and approaches those of a fully chaotic system for sufficiently large coupling strength. In contrast in previous studies the transition from integrable to chaotic dynamics was induced by introducing a random potential of increasing strength into such a QB and applicability of a variant of the Rosenzweig-Porter model was tested.

Title: Microscopic quantum description of surface plasmon polaritons: revealing intrinsic ultrastrong light-matter coupling
Authors: Florian Maurer, Thomas F. Allard, Yanko Todorov, Guillaume Weick, David Hagenmüller
Abstract: We develop a microscopic quantum theory of surface plasmon polaritons valid for arbitrary metal-dielectric geometries. Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics.

Title: Nanofabricated torsion pendulums for tabletop gravity experiments
Authors: Jack Manley, Charles A. Condos, Zachary Fegley, Gayathrini Premawardhana, Thomas Bsaibes, Jacob M. Taylor, Dalziel J. Wilson, Jon R. Pratt
Abstract: Measurement of mutual gravitation on laboratory scales is an outstanding challenge and a prerequisite to probing theories of quantum gravity. A leading technology in tabletop gravity experiments is the torsion balance, with limitations due to thermal decoherence. Recent demonstrations of lithographically defined suspensions in thin-film silicon nitride with macroscale test masses suggest a path forward, as torsion pendulums dominated by gravitational stiffness may achieve higher mechanical quality factors through dilution of material losses. Here we demonstrate a 250 micron by 5 mm by 1.8 micron torsion fiber supporting 87 grams and forming a Cavendish-style torsion pendulum with tungsten test masses that -- to our knowledge -- is the largest thin-film silicon-nitride-based oscillator to date. Torsion pendulums with thin-film, nanofabricated suspensions provide a test bed for near-term tabletop experiments probing classical and quantum gravitational interaction between oscillators.

Title: Convergence Properties of Good Quantum Codes for Classical Communication
Authors: Alptug Aytekin, Mohamed Nomeir, Lei Hu, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: An important part of the information theory folklore had been about the output statistics of codes that achieve the capacity and how the empirical distributions compare to the output distributions induced by the optimal input in the channel capacity problem. Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case. We also extend non-vanishing error probability results to the quantum case on block codes, by using the second-order converses for such codes based on hypercontractivity results for the quantum generalized depolarizing semi-groups.

Title: Hierarchies among genuine multipartite entangling capabilities of quantum gates
Authors: Mrinmoy Samanta, Sudipta Mondal, Samir Kumar Hazra, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: We classify quantum gates according to their capability to generate genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), using a hierarchy based on multipartite separable states. In particular, when a fixed unitary operator acts on the set of k-separable states, the maximal genuine multipartite entanglement content produced via that particular unitary operator is determined after maximizing over the set of k-separable input states. We identify unitary operators that are beneficial for generating high GME when the input states are entangled in some bipartition, although the picture can also be reversed, where such initial entanglement offers no advantage. We investigate the maximum entangling power of a broad range of unitary operators, encompassing special classes of quantum gates, as well as diagonal, permutation, and Haar-uniformly generated unitaries by computing generalized geometric measure (GGM) as a GME quantifier. Additionally, we observe a notable distinction in entangling power based on the nature of the input states: when maximization is restricted to separable states with real coefficients, the entangling power is lower than when the optimization is carried out over arbitrary separable states with complex coefficients, thereby highlighting the role of complex amplitudes in entanglement creation. Furthermore, we determine which unitary operators, along with their corresponding optimal inputs, yield output states with the highest achievable GGM.

Title: Quantum feedback control of a two-atom network closed by a semi-infinite waveguide
Authors: Haijin Ding, Guofeng Zhang, Mu-Tian Cheng, Guoqing Cai
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the delay-dependent coherent feedback dynamics by focusing on one typical realization, i.e., a two-atom quantum network whose feedback loop is closed by a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, an initially excited two-level atom can emit a photon into the waveguide, where the propagating photon can be reflected by the terminal mirror of the waveguide or absorbed by the other atom, thus constructing various coherent feedback loops. We show that there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide, which can be controlled by the feedback loop length and the coupling strengths between the atoms and waveguide. The photonic states in the waveguide are analyzed in both the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions is better understood based on a comprehensive analysis using both domains. Interestingly, we clarify that this quantum coherent feedback network can be mathematically modeled as a linear control system with multiple delays, which are determined by the distances between atoms and the terminal mirror of the semi-infinite waveguide. Therefore, based on time-delayed linear control system theory, the influence of delays on the stability of the quantum state evolution and the steady-state atomic and photonic states is investigated, for both small and large delays.

Title: Making Existing Quantum Position Verification Protocols Secure Against Arbitrary Transmission Loss
Authors: Rene Allerstorfer, Andreas Bluhm, Harry Buhrman, Matthias Christandl, Llorenç Escolà-Farràs, Florian Speelman, Philip Verduyn Lunel
Abstract: Signal loss poses a significant threat to the security of quantum cryptography when the chosen protocol lacks loss-tolerance. In quantum position verification (QPV) protocols, even relatively small loss rates can compromise security. The goal is thus to find protocols that remain secure under practically achievable loss rates. In this work, we modify the usual structure of QPV protocols and prove that this modification makes the potentially high transmission loss between the verifiers and the prover security-irrelevant for a class of protocols that includes a practically-interesting candidate protocol inspired by the BB84 protocol ($\mathrm{QPV}_{\mathrm{BB84}}^{f}$). This modification, which involves photon presence detection, a small time delay at the prover, and a commitment to play before proceeding, reduces the overall loss rate to just the prover's laboratory. The adapted protocol c-$\mathrm{QPV}_{\mathrm{BB84}}^{f}$ then becomes a practically feasible QPV protocol with strong security guarantees, even against attackers using adaptive strategies. As the loss rate between the verifiers and prover is mainly dictated by the distance between them, secure QPV over longer distances becomes possible. We also show possible implementations of the required photon presence detection, making c-$\mathrm{QPV}_{\mathrm{BB84}}^{f}$ a protocol that solves all major practical issues in QPV. Finally, we discuss experimental aspects and give parameter estimations.

Title: Useful entanglement can be extracted from noisy graph states
Authors: Konrad Szymański, Lina Vandré, Otfried Gühne
Abstract: Cluster states and graph states in general offer a useful model of the stabilizer formalism and a path toward the development of measurement-based quantum computation. Their defining structure - the stabilizer group - encodes all possible correlations that can be observed during measurement. The measurement outcomes which are consistent with the stabilizer structure make error correction possible. Here, we leverage both properties to design feasible families of states that can be used as robust building blocks of quantum computation. This procedure reduces the effect of experimentally relevant noise models on the extraction of smaller entangled states from the larger noisy graph state. In particular, we study the extraction of Bell pairs from linearly extended graph states - this has the immediate consequence for state teleportation across the graph. We show that robust entanglement can be extracted by proper design of the linear graph with only a minimal overhead of the physical qubits. This scenario is relevant to systems in which the entanglement can be created between neighboring sites. The results shown in this work provide a mathematical framework for noise reduction in measurement-based quantum computation. With proper connectivity structures, the effect of noise can be minimized for a large class of realistic noise processes.

Title: Spectral invariance and maximality properties of the frequency spectrum of quantum neural networks
Authors: Patrick Holzer, Ivica Turkalj
Abstract: We analyze the frequency spectrum of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) using Minkowski sums, which yields a compact algebraic description and permits explicit computation. Using this description, we prove several maximality results for broad classes of QNN architectures. Under some mild technical conditions we establish a bijection between classes of models with the same area $A:=R\cdot L$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A=RL$ and not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we collect and extend existing results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with an arbitrary number of layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. In the case of arbitrary dimensional generators, where our two introduced notions of maximality differ, we extend existing Golomb ruler based results and introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem, which we call the relaxed turnpike problem. We clarify comprehensively how the generators of a QNN must be chosen in order to obtain a maximal frequency spectrum for a given area $A$, thereby contributing to a deeper theoretical understanding. However, our numerical experiments show that trainability depends not only on $A = RL$, but also on the choice of $(R,L)$, so that knowledge of the maximum frequency spectrum alone is not sufficient to ensure good trainability.

Title: Suppressing spurious transitions using spectrally balanced pulse
Authors: Ruixia Wang, Yaqing Feng, Yujia Zhang, Jiayu Ding, Boxi Li, Felix Motzoi, Yang Gao, Huikai Xu, Zhen Yang, Wuerkaixi Nuerbolati, Haifeng Yu, Weijie Sun, Fei Yan
Abstract: Achieving precise control over quantum systems presents a significant challenge, especially in many-body setups, where residual couplings and unintended transitions undermine the accuracy of quantum operations. In superconducting qubits, parasitic interactions -- both between distant qubits and with spurious two-level systems -- can severely limit the performance of quantum gates. In this work, we introduce a pulse-shaping technique that uses spectrally balanced microwave pulses to suppress undesired transitions. Experimental results demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in spurious excitations between weakly detuned qubits, as well as a substantial decrease in single-qubit gate errors caused by a strongly coupled two-level defect over a broad frequency range. Our method provides a simple yet powerful solution to mitigate adverse effects from parasitic couplings, enhancing the fidelity of quantum operations and expanding feasible frequency allocations for large-scale quantum devices.

Title: The 2D free particle in the phase space quantum mechanics
Authors: Hubert Jóźwiak, Jaromir Tosiek
Abstract: The Wigner eigenfunctions of a free quantum particle propagating on a plane are derived. Two possibilities are analysed. First, the particle with fixed components of the Cartesian momentum is considered. Then the particle of given energy and angular momentum is discussed. In that second case, a special choice of coordinates on the symplectic space $(\mathbb{R}^{4},\,\omega)$ suitable for the representation of eigenstates of the discussed particle is presented. Further, the Moyal $\star_{(\text{M})}$-product on the phase space is derived with the use of the Fedosov algorithm adapted to these coordinates on a flat phase space. Next, the eigenvalue equations for the Wigner eigenfunction are solved and the physically acceptable solutions are identified. Finally, a relationship between the Wigner eigenfunction of the particle with the fixed components of the Cartesian momentum and the cross-Wigner functions of the particle with the given energy and angular momentum is found.

Title: A Pseudo-Unitary Version of Schwinger's Symbolism of Atomic Measurements and a Prospect for a New Relativistic Quantum Information Theory
Authors: J. G. Cardoso
Abstract: The measurement processes that are traditionally described within the realm of non-relativistic quantum mechanics are transcribed into the covariant framework of Cartan's space, the four-valued representation space of the restricted conformal group for special relativity. It is assumed at the outset that the non-relativistic quantum measurement mechanisms of state reductions as well as the definition of Born probabilities should remain unaltered when the passage to the covariant framework is worked out. The correlations between observations registered in different spacetime frames, concerning intermediate steps and outcomes of microscopic measurements, are attained through the implementation of the orthochronous proper Poincaré subgroup of an appropriate realization of SU(2,2). It will be seen that the settlement of such correlations strongly supports the view whereby the physical inner structure of the Schrödinger quantum mechanical picture may be described consistently within special relativity. The overall work likewise affords a fundamental background to the construction of covariant quantum computational gates whilst making it feasible to elaborate upon the predicted and observed formation of entangled states in processes of creation-annihilation pairs. In addition, it is suggested that the usually accepted non-locality feature of the old quantum mechanics should be reconsidered inside an actual relativistic formulation. The important question as to whether quantum computation should bear an invariant character is then raised.

Title: A detailed study on various phases in dissipative anisotropic Dicke model
Authors: Pragna Das, Saptarshi Saha
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of different phases in the Dicke model incorporating both anisotropy and dissipation. We begin with a concise review of the quantum phase transition in this setting, highlighting how these two parameters shift the critical point. We then perform a detailed investigation of the transition from ergodic to nonergodic phases by analyzing the eigenvalue and eigenvector properties of the Liouvillian with the aid of scaling of the Liouvillian gap and the average participation ratio. Our results show that the eigenvector properties of the Liouvillian are consistent with its spectral characteristics, leading to a phase diagram that has similarities with the closed counterpart. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap exhibits distinct scaling behaviors in these two phases. Finally, we extend our study to the driven case by applying a Thue-Morse quasiperiodic drive. In this case, we find that bosonic dissipation plays a crucial role in stabilizing the prethermal plateau, offering an effective mechanism to halt the heating effect arising from the quasi-periodic drive.

Title: Quantum optimization with exact geodesic transport
Authors: André J. Ferreira-Martins, Renato M. S. Farias, Giancarlo Camilo, Thiago O. Maciel, Allan Tosta, Ruge Lin, Abdulla Alhajri, Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita
Abstract: We introduce an architecture for variational quantum algorithms that can be efficiently trained via parameter updates along exact geodesics on the Riemannian state manifold. This features a parameter-optimal circuit ansatz which supersedes known quantum natural gradient methods by removing expensive estimations of the metric tensor and provably reducing gradient estimation costs by $62.5\%$. Moreover, the framework also naturally incorporates conjugate gradients as a built-in feature, giving an accelerated descent method with convergence guarantees that we dub exact geodesic transport with conjugate gradients. Numerical benchmarks against state-of-the-art variational methods for ground-state preparation of molecular Hamiltonians or $1$-dimensional spin chains (both with and without particle-number conservation) up to $n=16$ qubits show reductions of over one order of magnitude in the number of optimization steps, with global convergence even for degenerate cases and competitive quantum-resource scalings. In addition, we perform proof-of-principle demonstrations on IonQ's Forte quantum processor, showcasing deployment of pre-trained circuits for the $H_{3}^{+}$ molecule and experimental training for $H_{2}$. Our work enables quantum machine learning applications with shorter training runtime, with implications at the interface of quantum simulation, differential geometry, and optimal control theory.

Title: Planckian bound on quantum dynamical entropy
Authors: Xiangyu Cao
Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the purification rate are also obtained.

Title: Complexity in multi-qubit and many-body systems
Authors: Imre Varga
Abstract: Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.

Title: Continuous-Time Quantum Markov Chains And Discretizations Of p-Adic Schrödinger Equations: Comparisons And Simulations
Authors: W. A. Zúñiga-Galindo, L. F. Chacón-Cortés
Abstract: The continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) are a fundamental tool in the development of quantum algorithms. Recently, it was shown that discretizations of p-adic Schrödinger equations give rise to continuous-time quantum Markov chains (CTQMCs); this type of Markov chain includes the CTQWs constructed using adjacency matrices of graphs as a particular case. In this paper, we study a large class of p-adic Schrödinger equations and the associated CTQMCs by comparing them with p-adic heat equations and the associated continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). The comparison is done by a mathematical study of the mentioned equations, which requires, for instance, solving the initial value problems attached to the mentioned equations, and through numerical simulations. We conducted multiple simulations, including numerical approximations of the limiting distribution. Our simulations show that the limiting distribution of quantum Markov chains is greater than the stationary probability of their classical counterparts, for a large class of CTQMCs.

Title: Optimized quantum algorithms for simulating the Schwinger effect
Authors: Angus Kan, Jessica Lemieux, Olga Okrut, Burak Şahinoğlu
Abstract: The Schwinger model, which describes lattice quantum electrodynamics in $1+1$ space-time dimensions, provides a valuable framework to investigate fundamental aspects of quantum field theory, and a stepping stone towards non-Abelian gauge theories. Specifically, it enables the study of physically relevant dynamical processes, such as the nonperturbative particle-antiparticle pair production, known as the Schwinger effect. In this work, we analyze the quantum computational resource requirements associated with simulating the Schwinger effect under two distinct scenarios: (1) a quench process, where the initial state is a simple product state of a non-interacting theory and then interactions are turned on at time $t=0$, and (2) a splitting (or scattering) process where two Gaussian states, peaked at given initial momenta, are shot away from (or towards) each other. We explore different physical regimes in which the Schwinger effect is expected to be observable. These regimes are characterized by initial momenta and coupling strengths, as well as simulation parameters such as lattice size and electric-field cutoffs. Leveraging known rigorous bounds for electric-field cutoffs, we find that a reliable simulation of the Schwinger effect is provably possible at high cutoff scales. Furthermore, we provide optimized circuit implementations of both the second-order Trotter formula and an interaction-picture algorithm based on the Dyson series to implement the time evolution. Our detailed resource estimates show the regimes in which the interaction-picture approach outperforms the Trotter approach, and vice versa. The improved theoretical error bounds, optimized quantum circuit designs, and explicitly compiled subroutines developed in this study are broadly applicable to simulations of other lattice models in high-energy physics and beyond.

Title: Building globally controlled quantum processors with ZZ interactions
Authors: Roberto Menta, Francesco Cioni, Riccardo Aiudi, Francesco Caravelli, Marco Polini, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for constructing various architectures of globally driven quantum computers, with a focus on superconducting qubits. Our approach leverages static inhomogeneities in the Rabi frequencies of qubits controlled by a common classical pulse -- a technique we refer to as the "crossed-qubit" method. We detail the essential components and design principles required to realize such systems, highlighting how global control can be harnessed to perform local operations, enabling universal quantum computation. This framework offers a scalable pathway toward quantum processors by striking a balance between wiring complexity and computational efficiency, with potential applications in addressing current challenges to scalability.

Title: Exact Relation Between Wehrl-Rényi Entropy and Many-Body Entanglement
Authors: Pengfei Zhang, Chen Xu, Peng Zhang
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix. Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter, we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-Rényi entropy (WRE) $S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd Rényi entropy of the Husimi function of the entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6\pi)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat \rho}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat \rho}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$ qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems, particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.

Title: Subsystem many-hypercube codes: High-rate concatenated codes with low-weight syndrome measurements
Authors: Ryota Nakai, Hayato Goto
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) require high encoding rate in addition to high threshold unless a sufficiently large number of physical qubits are available. The many-hypercube (MHC) codes defined as the concatenation of the [[6,4,2]] quantum error-detecting code have been proposed as high-performance and high-encoding-rate QECCs. However, the concatenated codes have a disadvantage that the syndrome weight grows exponentially with respect to the concatenation level. To address this issue, here we propose subsystem quantum codes based on the MHC codes. In particular, we study the smallest subsystem MHC codes, namely, subsystem codes derived from the concatenated [[4,2,2]] error-detecting codes. The resulting codes have a constant syndrome-measurement weight of 4, while keeping high encoding rates. We build the block-MAP and neural-network decoders and show that they demonstrate superior performance to the bounded-distance decoder.

Title: Efficient three-qubit gates with giant atoms
Authors: Guangze Chen, Anton Frisk Kockum
Abstract: Three-qubit gates are highly beneficial operations in quantum computing, enabling compact implementations of quantum algorithms and efficient generation of multipartite entangled states. However, realizing such gates with high fidelity remains challenging due to crosstalk, complex control requirements, and the overhead of parametric or tunable couplers. In this work, we propose and analyze the implementation of fast, high-fidelity three-qubit gates using giant atoms -- artificial atoms coupled to a waveguide at multiple spatially separated points. By leveraging interference effects intrinsic to the giant-atom architecture, we demonstrate that native three-qubit gates, such as the controlled-CZ-SWAP (CCZS) and the dual-iSWAP (DIV), can be realized through simple frequency tuning, without the need for complex pulse shaping or additional hardware. We evaluate gate performance under realistic decoherence and show that fidelities exceeding 99.5% are achievable with current experimental parameters in superconducting circuits. As an application, we present a scalable protocol for preparing three- and five-qubit GHZ states using minimal gate depth, achieving high state fidelity within sub-300ns timescales. Our results position giant-atom systems as a promising platform for entangled-state preparation and low-depth quantum circuit design in near-term quantum computers and quantum simulators.

Title: Quantum Strategies to Overcome Classical Multiplexing Limits
Authors: Tzula B. Propp, Jeroen Grimbergen, Emil R. Hellebek, Junior R. Gonzales-Ureta, Janice van Dam, Joshua A. Slater, Anders S. Sørensen, Stephanie D. C. Wehner
Abstract: Near-term quantum networks face a bottleneck due to low quantum communication rates. This degrades performance both by lowering operating speeds and increasing qubit storage time in noisy memories, making some quantum internet applications infeasible. One way to circumvent this bottleneck is multiplexing: combining multiple signals into a single signal to improve the overall rate. Standard multiplexing techniques are classical in that they do not make use of coherence between quantum channels nor account for decoherence rates that vary during a protocol's execution. In this paper, we first derive semiclassical limits to multiplexing for many-qubit protocols, and then introduce two techniques: single click quantum multiplexing and multi-server multiplexing. These can enable beyond-classical multiplexing advantages. We illustrate these techniques through three example applications: 1) entanglement generation between two asymetric quantum network nodes (i.e., repeaters or quantum servers with inequal memories), 2) remote state preparation between many end user devices and a single quantum node, and 3) remote state preparation between one end user device and many internetworked quantum nodes. By utilizing many noisy internetworked quantum devices instead of fewer low-noise devices, our multiplexing strategies enable new paths towards achieving high-speed many-qubit quantum network applications.

Title: Mirrored Entanglement Witnesses for Multipartite and High-Dimensional Quantum Systems
Authors: Jiheon Seong, Anindita Bera, Beatrix C. Hiesmayr, Dariusz Chruscinski, Joonwoo Bae
Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are a versatile tool to detect entangled states and characterize related properties of entanglement in quantum information theory. A witness $W$ corresponds to an observable satisfying $\mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0$ for all separable states $\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}$; entangled states are detected once the inequality is violated. Recently, mirrored EWs have been introduced by showing that there exist non-trivial upper bounds to EWs, \begin{eqnarray} u_W\geq \mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0. \nonumber \end{eqnarray} An upper bound to a witness $W$ signifies the existence of the other one $M$, called a mirrored EW, such that $W+M = u_W I \otimes I$. The framework of mirrored EWs shows that a single EW can be even more useful, as it can detect a larger set of entangled states by lower and upper bounds. In this work, we develop and investigate mirrored EWs for multipartite qubit states and also for high-dimensional systems, to find the efficiency and effectiveness of mirrored EWs in detecting entangled states. We provide mirrored EWs for $n$-partite GHZ states, graph states such as two-colorable states, and tripartite bound entangled states. We also show that optimal EWs can be reflected with each other. For bipartite systems, we present mirrored EWs for existing optimal EWs and also construct a mirrored pair of optimal EWs in dimension three. Finally, we generalize mirrored EWs such that a pair of EWs can be connected by another EW, i.e., $W+M =K$ is also an EW. Our results enhance the capability of EWs to detect a larger set of entangled states in multipartite and high-dimensional quantum systems.

Title: Effective quantum reorganization energy for inner- and outer-sphere electron transfer
Authors: Ethan Abraham, Junghyun Yoon, Troy Van Voorhis, Martin Z. Bazant
Abstract: The Marcus theory expression for the rate of non-adiabatic electron transfer is widely used across a range of heterogeneous and homogeneous physical conditions. Although Marcus theory defines the reorganization energy classically, here we show that the reorganization parameter that governs the activation barrier in normal-region electron transfer is most generally a quantum mechanical object that depends on the electronic coupling, coinciding with the Marcus picture when the electronic coupling is small. This result unifies the physical description of electron-transfer activation barriers across the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes and formally predicts that Marcus-like rate expressions remain accurate beyond their traditional non-adiabatic domain of validity. These insights allow us to derive a closed-form expression for the Tafel curvature of electron-transfer-limited reactions at the electrochemical interface, now formally applicable to both inner-sphere and outer-sphere processes.

Title: Transport regimes of biphoton-state quantum walks in ordered and disordered arrays of nonlinear waveguides
Authors: Jefferson Delgado-Quesada, Edgar A. Rojas-González
Abstract: A quantum walk in an ordered medium exhibits ballistic propagation. A related process is the driven quantum walk, in which the number of walkers varies along the propagation. In this work, we show that a driven quantum walk of biphoton states in an array of nonlinear waveguides does not propagate ballistically, but instead presents two transport regimes: superballistic and superdiffusive. We also study the effects of off-diagonal and diagonal disorder. In addition to the observation of Anderson localization, both types of disorder lead to the disappearance of the superballistic regime.

Title: Quantum Mpemba Effect Induced by Non-Markovian Exceptional Points
Authors: Ze-Zhou Zhang, Hong-Gang Luo, Wei Wu
Abstract: Quantum Mpemba effect describes an anomalous phenomenon of accelerated relaxation which is of fundamental interest in the field of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Conventional theories on this phenomenon strongly rely on the Born-Markovian approximation resulting in a Lindblad-type master equation whose evolution is governed by a Liouvillian superoperator. It has been demonstrated that exceptional points of the Liouvillian superoperator can induce the Mpemba effect in Markovian regimes. Moving beyond this Markovian limit, we here propose a mechanism for realizing the quantum Mpemba effect in a general non-Markovian relaxation process by means of non-Markovian exceptional points. We verify the feasibility of this mechanism within a dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator model, which is exactly solvable and experimentally practical. Providing new insight into the interesting non-equilibrium dynamics, our work paves a way to accelerate the transfer of energy and information in quantum systems.

Title: Optimal learning of quantum channels in diamond distance
Authors: Antonio Anna Mele, Lennart Bittel
Abstract: Quantum process tomography, the task of estimating an unknown quantum channel, is a central problem in quantum information theory. A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard metric for distinguishing quantum processes. While the analogous problem of quantum state tomography has been settled over the past decades in both the pure- and mixed-state settings, for general quantum channels it remained largely open beyond the unitary case. Here we design an algorithm showing that any channel with input and output dimensions $d_{\mathrm{in}},d_{\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$ can be learned to constant accuracy in diamond distance using $\Theta(d_{\mathrm{in}}d_{\mathrm{out}}k)$ channel uses, and we prove that this scaling is optimal via a matching lower bound. More generally, achieving accuracy $\varepsilon$ is possible with $O(d_{\mathrm{in}}d_{\mathrm{out}}k/\varepsilon^{2})$ channel uses. Since quantum channels subsume states, unitaries, and isometries as special cases, our protocol provides a unified framework for the corresponding tomography tasks; in particular, it yields the first optimal protocols for isometries and for binary measurement tomography, and it recovers optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach reduces channel tomography to pure-state tomography: we use the channel to prepare copies of its Choi state, purify them in parallel, and run sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the resulting purifications; we then show that the induced diamond-distance error scales essentially linearly with the trace-distance error in estimating the (purified) Choi state. We also resolve an open question by showing that adaptivity does not improve the dimension-optimal query complexity of quantum channel tomography.

Title: Optimal Distributed Similarity Estimation of Quantum Channels
Authors: Congcong Zheng, Kun Wang, Xutao Yu, Ping Xu, Zaichen Zhang
Abstract: We study distributed similarity estimation of quantum channels (DSEC), a primitive for cross-platform verification where two remote quantum devices are compared by estimating the inner product of their Choi states. We show that the optimal channel query complexity of DSEC for two $d$-dimensional quantum channels is $\Theta(\max\{\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon, 1/\varepsilon^2\})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the additive error. We first prove an information-theoretic lower bound with this scaling, which holds even in the strongest setting, allowing adaptive strategies, multiple rounds of classical communication, and coherent access with arbitrary ancillas. We then give a matching upper bound in the weakest setting, namely non-adaptive and ancilla-free incoherent access, via a randomized measurement protocol achieving this bound. Finally, we show that our protocol achieves a quadratic improvement over classical shadow baselines. Our results provide theoretically optimal and practical methods for cross-platform verification, quantum device benchmarking, and distributed quantum learning.

Title: Transversal Clifford-Hierarchy Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes
Authors: Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We present an entirely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this limitation, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\pi/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. In this context we propose a non-abelian stabilizer group formalism, which we work out for dihedral groups. For $8N = 2^n$, the logical gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface-codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.

Title: Error mitigation for logical circuits using decoder confidence
Authors: Maria Dincă, Tim Chan, Simon C. Benjamin
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance under phenomenological noise to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire logical circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code under circuit-level noise, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to billions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use the DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood estimation. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.

Title: Molecular Quantum Computations on a Protein
Authors: Akhil Shajan, Danil Kaliakin, Fangchun Liang, Thaddeus Pellegrini, Hakan Doga, Subhamoy Bhowmik, Susanta Das, Antonio Mezzacapo, Mario Motta, Kenneth M. Merz Jr
Abstract: This work presents the implementation of a fragment-based, quantum-centric supercomputing workflow for computing molecular electronic structure using quantum hardware. The workflow is applied to predict the relative energies of two conformers of the 300-atom Trp-cage miniprotein. The methodology employs wave function-based embedding (EWF) as the underlying fragmentation framework, in which all atoms in the system are explicitly included in the CI treatment. CI calculations for individual fragments are performed using either sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) for challenging fragments or full configuration interaction (FCI) for trivial fragments. To assess the accuracy of SQD for fragment CI calculations, EWF-(FCI,SQD) results are compared against EWF-MP2 and EWF-CCSD benchmarks. Overall, the results demonstrate that large-scale electronic configuration interaction (CI) simulations of protein systems containing hundreds or even thousands of atoms can be realized through the combined use of quantum and classical computing resources.

Title: Continuum Limits of Lazy Open Quantum Walks
Authors: Lara Janiurek, Viv Kendon
Abstract: We derive the continuous spacetime limit of the one dimensional lazy discrete time quantum walk, obtaining explicit macroscopic evolution equations for a three state model in the presence of decoherence. While continuum limits of two state quantum walks are well established, an explicit continuous spacetime formulation for the lazy three state walk, particularly including noise, has not previously been constructed. Using an SU(3) representation of a Grover type coin together with a Lindblad formulation of decoherence acting either on the coin or the spatial subspace, we systematically expand the discrete dynamics in both space and time to obtain continuum master equations governing the coarse grained evolution. The resulting generators yield a genuine partial differential equation description of the walk, going beyond purely probabilistic or spectral correspondences. We show that the unitary limit is governed by a Dirac-type SU(3) Hamiltonian describing ballistic advection of left and right moving modes coupled by local symmetric mixing, with the rest state acting as an additional internal degree of freedom. Coin dephasing selectively damps internal coherences while preserving coherent spatial transport, whereas spatial dephasing suppresses long range spatial interference and rapidly drives the dynamics toward classical behaviour. This continuum framework clarifies how internal symmetry, rest state coupling, and distinct decoherence channels shape large scale transport in lazy open quantum walks, and provides a foundation for future extensions toward multichannel quantum transport models and quantum-inspired algorithms.

Title: Squeezed states for Frenkel-like two-fermion composite bosons
Authors: Francisco Figueiredo, Itzhak Roditi
Abstract: We investigate squeezed states of composite bosons (cobosons) formed by pairs of spin-$1/2$ fermions, with emphasis on Frenkel-like cobosons. While squeezing for standard bosonic modes is well established, its extension to cobosons requires accounting for Pauli blocking and the resulting non-canonical commutation algebra. Building on earlier constructions of coboson coherent states, we define squeezed cobosons as eigenstates of a Bogoliubov transformed coboson operator and derive explicit expressions for the associated quadrature variances. We show that the underlying fermionic structure leads to state-dependent modifications of the Heisenberg--Robertson uncertainty bound, which may fall below the canonical bosonic limit without implying any violation of uncertainty principles. Numerical results based on finite-dimensional matrix representations illustrate how these effects constrain the attainable squeezing. Our framework is relevant to composite boson systems such as tightly bound electron-hole pairs and provides a physically transparent setting to probe compositeness through observable quadrature fluctuations.

Title: Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication
Authors: Simon J. K. Lang, Ignaz Eisele, Alwin Maiwald, Emir Music, Luis Schwarzenbach, Carla Morán-Guizán, Johannes Weber, Daniela Zahn, Thomas Mayer, Rui N. Pereira, Christoph Kutter
Abstract: Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.

Title: MultiQ: Multi-Programming Neutral Atom Quantum Architectures
Authors: Francisco Romão, Daniel Vonk, Emmanuil Giortamis, Dennis Sprokholt, Pramod Bhatotia
Abstract: Neutral atom Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are emerging as a popular quantum computing technology due to their large qubit counts and flexible connectivity. However, performance challenges arise as large circuits experience significant fidelity drops, while small circuits underutilize hardware and face initialization latency issues. To tackle these problems, we propose $\textit{multi-programming on neutral atom QPUs}$, allowing the co-execution of multiple circuits by logically partitioning the qubit array. This approach increases resource utilization and mitigates initialization latency while maintaining result fidelity. Currently, state-of-the-art compilers for neutral atom architectures do not support multi-programming. To fill this gap, we introduce MultiQ, the first system designed for this purpose. MultiQ addresses three main challenges: (i) it compiles circuits into a $\textit{virtual zone layout}$ to optimize spatio-temporal hardware utilization; (ii) it parallelizes the execution of co-located circuits, allowing single hardware instructions to operate on different circuits; and (iii) it includes an algorithm to verify the functional independence of the bundled circuits. MultiQ functions as a cross-layer system comprising a compiler, controller, and checker. Our compiler generates \emph{virtual zone layouts} to enhance performance, while the controller efficiently maps these layouts onto the hardware and resolves any conflicts. The checker ensures the correct bundling of circuits. Experimental results show a throughput increase from 3.8$\times$ to 12.3$\times$ when multi-programming 4 to 14 circuits, with fidelity largely maintained, ranging from a 1.3% improvement for four circuits to only a 3.5% loss for fourteen circuits. Overall, MultiQ facilitates concurrent execution of multiple quantum circuits, boosting throughput and hardware utilization.

Title: Exponential Analysis for Entanglement Distillation
Authors: Zhiwen Lin, Ke Li, Kun Fang
Abstract: Historically, the focus in entanglement distillation has predominantly been on the distillable entanglement, and the framework assumes complete knowledge of the initial state. In this paper, we study the reliability function of entanglement distillation, which specifies the optimal exponent of the decay of the distillation error when the distillation rate is below the distillable entanglement. Furthermore, to capture greater operational significance, we extend the framework from the standard setting of known states to a black-box setting, where distillation is performed from a set of possible states. We establish an exact finite blocklength result connecting to composite correlated hypothesis testing without any redundant correction terms. Based on this, the reliability function of entanglement distillation is characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence. In the special case of a pure initial state, our result reduces to the error exponent for entanglement concentration derived by Hayashi et al. in 2003. Given full prior knowledge of the state, we construct a concrete optimal distillation protocol. Additionally, we analyze the strong converse exponent of entanglement distillation. While all the above results assume the free operations to be non-entangling, we also investigate other free operation classes, including PPT-preserving, dually non-entangling, and dually PPT-preserving operations.

Title: The power-spectrum tensor in steady-state systems and its role in quantum friction
Authors: F. Intravaia, K. Busch
Abstract: We derive and classify properties of the power-spectrum tensor for systems in general steady-states, including stationary states not necessarily corresponding to equilibrium configurations. We establish a rigorous connection between the power-spectrum tensor and other quantities that characterize these systems, providing a systematic comparison with their equilibrium counterparts. As a physical application, we investigate the problem of quantum friction, describing the contactless quantum-electrodynamic drag acting on a particle moving in close proximity to material bodies at zero temperature. Specifically, we demonstrate how including additional information about the system's physical properties facilitates the derivation of more precise constraints on the power spectrum and its functional dependencies.

Title: Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space
Authors: Shashank Pathrudkar, Stephanie Taylor, Abhishek Keripale, Abhijeet Sadashiv Gangan, Ponkrshnan Thiagarajan, Shivang Agarwal, Jaime Marian, Susanta Ghosh, Amartya S. Banerjee
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.

Title: A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography
Authors: Taishi Kawamoto
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.

Title: Universality, Robustness, and Limits of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Gabriel Almeida, Pedro Ribeiro, Masudul Haque, Lucas Sá
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) underpins much of our modern understanding of the thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of the Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the validity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of several physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we consider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one postselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps. The average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and we show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other hand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces to a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.

Title: Floquet operator dynamics and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle
Authors: Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Aditi Mitra
Abstract: Operator spreading under stroboscopic time evolution due to a unitary is studied. An operator Krylov space is constructed and related to orthogonal polynomials on a unit circle (OPUC), as well as to the Krylov space of the edge operator of the Floquet transverse field Ising model with inhomogeneous couplings (ITFIM). The Verblunsky coefficients in the OPUC representation are related to the Krylov angles parameterizing the ITFIM. The relations between the OPUC and spectral functions are summarized and several applications are presented. These include derivation of analytic expressions for the OPUC for persistent $m$-periodic dynamics, and the numerical construction of the OPUC for autocorrelations of the homogeneous Floquet-Ising model as well as the $Z_3$ clock model. The numerically obtained Krylov angles of the $Z_3$ clock model with long-lived period tripled autocorrelations show a spatial periodicity of six, and this observation is used to develop an analytically solvable model for the ITFIM that mimics this behavior.

Title: pyRMG: A Framework for High-Throughput, Large-Cell DFT Calculations on Supercomputers
Authors: R. J. Morelock, S. Bagchi, E. L. Briggs, W. Lu, J. Bernholc, P. Ganesh
Abstract: Exascale computing delivers the raw power to simulate ever larger and more chemically realistic systems, but realizing this potential requires codes that can efficiently use thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) density functional theory (DFT) code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). However, the limited workflow infrastructure for RMG has thus far constrained its adoption to a small user community. In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE computational materials science Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which offers chemical insights into this system and shows that RMG-based workflows can converge with limited user intervention.

Title: Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder
Authors: Kadir Çeven, Lukas Peinemann, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.

Title: Time Evolution of Multi-Party Entanglement Signals
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Hanzhi Jiang, Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We study the real-time dynamics of multi-party entanglement signals in chaotic quantum many-body systems including but not necessarily restricted to holographic conformal field theories. We find that scrambling dynamics generates multiparty entanglement with rich structure including: (a) qualitatively different dynamical behaviours for different signals, likely reflecting different dynamics for different kinds of entanglement patterns, (b) discontinuities indicating dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement structure, (c) transient and non-monotonic multiparty entanglement, and (d) periods during which the extensive entanglement of some regions is entirely multipartite. Our main technical tool is the membrane theory of entanglement dynamics.

Title: Topological BF Theory construction of twisted dihedral quantum double phases from spontaneous symmetry breaking
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Gao, Chunxiao Liu, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further suggests a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.

Title: Quantum, Diplomacy, and Geopolitics
Authors: Axel Ferrazzini
Abstract: Quantum technologies, spanning communication, sensing, computing, and cryptography, are rapidly emerging as critical paths of geopolitical competition and strategic defence innovation. Unlike traditional technological advances, quantum introduces novel capabilities that fundamentally disrupt established norms of security, intelligence, and diplomatic engagement. This strategic analysis explores the evolving quantum landscape through the dual lenses of diplomacy and geopolitics, with specific implications for defence leaders, policymakers, and industry stakeholders. The benefits and challenges of quantum technologies are examined from a diplomatic and geopolitical perspective to help leaders make informed strategic decisions. Leading powers now recognise quantum as a domain where technological leadership directly translates to geopolitical influence, compelling an intense race for dominance alongside new forms of multilateral diplomacy aimed at managing both risks and opportunities. Quantum technologies do not all have the same operational maturity, but technological progress is accelerating. Post-quantum cryptography demands immediate action, every encrypted communication created today may be harvested and decrypted within the decade by adversaries equipped with quantum capabilities.
