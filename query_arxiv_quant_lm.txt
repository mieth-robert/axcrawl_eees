Title: Genetically Engineered Quantum Circuits for Financial Market Indicators
Authors: Floyd M. Creevey, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg
Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense potential for transforming financial analysis and decision-making. Realising this potential necessitates the efficient encoding and processing of financial data on quantum computers. In this study, we propose using the GASP (Genetic Algorithm for State Preparation) framework to optimise the encoding of stock price data into quantum states and show it can enhance both the fidelity and efficiency of the encoding process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by encoding stock price data onto both a simulated and real quantum computer to calculate the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) entropy. Our results show improvements in fidelity and the potential for more precise financial analysis. This research provides insights into the applicability of GASP for the efficient encoding of real-world data, specifically stock price data, which is crucial for quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era quantum computers.

Title: Quantum-Assisted Graph Domination Games
Authors: C. Weeks, P. Strange, P. Drmota, J. Quintanilla
Abstract: We study quantum advantage in the 1-step graph domination game on cycle graphs numerically, analytically and through the use of Noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) processors. We find explicit strategies that realise the recently found upper bounds for small graphs and generalise them to larger cycles. We demonstrate that NISQ computers realise the predicted quantum advantages with high accuracy.

Title: Engineering multi-mode bosonic squeezed states using Monte-Carlo optimization
Authors: Jieqiu Shao, Diego A. R. Dalvit, Lukasz Cincio, Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana
Abstract: Bosonic systems, such as photons and ultracold atoms, have played a central role in demonstrating quantum-enhanced sensing. Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved. Our results indicate that the HL can be approached in quantum gravimetry using realistic experimental parameters for systems with $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $N\gg L$.

Title: Mixed state tomography reduces to pure state tomography
Authors: Angelos Pelecanos, Jack Spilecki, Ewin Tang, John Wright
Abstract: A longstanding belief in quantum tomography is that estimating a mixed state is far harder than estimating a pure state. This is borne out in the mathematics, where mixed state algorithms have always required more sophisticated techniques to design and analyze than pure state algorithms. We present a new approach to tomography demonstrating that, contrary to this belief, state-of-the-art mixed state tomography follows easily and naturally from pure state algorithms. We analyze the following strategy: given $n$ copies of an unknown state $\rho$, convert them into copies of a purification $|\rho\rangle$; run a pure state tomography algorithm to produce an estimate of $|\rho\rangle$; and output the resulting estimate of $\rho$. The purification subroutine was recently discovered via the "acorn trick" of Tang, Wright, and Zhandry. With this strategy, we obtain the first tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal in all parameters. For a rank-$r$ $d$-dimensional state, it uses $n = O((rd + \log(1/\delta))/\varepsilon)$ samples to output an estimate which is $\varepsilon$-close in fidelity with probability at least $1-\delta$. This algorithm also uses poly$(n)$ gates, making it the first gate-efficient tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal even in terms of the dimension $d$ alone. Moreover, with this method we recover essentially all results on mixed state tomography, including its applications to tomography with limited entanglement, classical shadows, and quantum metrology. Our proofs are simple, closing the gap in conceptual difficulty between mixed and pure tomography. Our results also clarify the role of entangled measurement in mixed state tomography: the only step of the algorithm which requires entanglement across copies is the purification step, suggesting that, for tomography, the reason entanglement is useful is for consistent purification.

Title: Nonclassicality of a Macroscopic Qubit-Ensemble via Parity Measurement Induced Disturbance
Authors: Lorenzo Braccini, Debarshi Das, Ben Zindorf, Stephen D. Hogan, John J. L. Morton, Sougato Bose
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to test the nonclassicality of a macroscopic ensemble of qubits, through the violation of the classical notion of macrorealism (MR) via the fundamental measurement-induced disturbance of quantum systems. An electromagnetic resonator is used to probe the parity of the qubit-ensemble. The action of sequential measurements allows the nonclassicality of whole ensemble to manifest itself, in the ideal case, irrespective of its size. This enables to probe the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics as the qubit-ensemble is, effectively, a single large spin of many $\hbar$ units. Even as $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ in comparison to the total angular momentum of the ensemble, a constant amount of violation of MR is found in the noiseless case. However, environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity of qubit-electromagnetic field couplings precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition. This implies that Bohr's correspondence principle is not fundamental, but a consequence of practical limitations. We outline an implementation with a variety of qubits (superconducting qubits, spins in semiconductors, and Rydberg atoms) coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator, and - via the corresponding noise analysis - find that violation of MR is detectable up to $100$ qubits via current technology.

Title: How "Quantum" is your Quantum Computer? Macrorealism-based Benchmarking via Mid-Circuit Parity Measurements
Authors: Ben Zindorf, Lorenzo Braccini, Debarshi Das, Sougato Bose
Abstract: To perform meaningful computations, Quantum Computers (QCs) must scale to macroscopic levels - i.e., to a large number of qubits - an objective pursued by most quantum companies. How to efficiently test their quantumness at these scales? We show that the violation of Macrorealism (MR), being the fact that classical systems possess definite properties that can be measured without disturbances, provide a fruitful avenue to this aim. The No Disturbance Condition (NDC) - the equality used here to test MR - can be violated by two consecutive parity measurements on $N$ qubits and found to be independent of $N$ under ideal conditions. However, realistic noisy QCs show a quantum-to-classical transition as $N$ increases, giving a foundationally-motivated scalable benchmarking metric. Two methods are formulated to implement this metric: one that involves a mid-circuit measurement, probing the irreversible collapse of the wavefunction, in contrast to the reversible entanglement generated in the other. Both methods are designed to be clumsiness-loophole free: the unwanted classical disturbances are negligible within statistical error. Violation of MR is detected on a IBM QC up to $N = 38$ qubits, increasing $N$ by one order of magnitude over best known results of MR. Two QCs are benchmarked using the proposed NDC metric, showing a three-fold improvement in their quantumness from one generation to the next.

Title: Cyclone: Designing Efficient and Highly Parallel QCCD Architectural Codesigns for Fault Tolerant Quantum Memory
Authors: Sahil Khan, Abhinav Anand, Kenneth R. Brown, Jonathan M. Baker
Abstract: Modular trapped-ion quantum computing hardware, known as QCCDs require shuttling operations in order to maintain effective all-to-all connectivity. Each module or trap can perform only one operation at a time, resulting in low intra-trap parallelism, but there is no restriction on operations happening on independent traps, enabling high inter-trap parallelism. Unlike their superconducting counterparts, the design space for QCCDs is relatively flexible and can be explored beyond current grid designs. In particular, current grid-based architectures significantly limit the performance of many promising, high-rate codes such as HGP codes and BB codes, suffering from numerous trap to trap ``roadblocks", forcing serialization and destroying the inherent parallelism of these codes.. Many of these codes are highly parallelizable, meaning that with appropriate hardware layouts and matching software schedules, execution latency can be reduced. Faster execution, in turn, reduces error accumulation from decoherence and heating, ultimately improving code performance when mapped to realistic hardware. To address this, we propose Cyclone, a circular software-hardware codesign that departs from traditional 2D grids in favor of a flexible ring topology, where ancilla qubits move in lockstep. Cyclone eliminates roadblocks, bounds total movement, and enables high levels of parallelism, resulting in up to ~4$\times$ speedup in execution times. With HGP codes, Cyclone achieves up to a 2$\times$ order of magnitude improvement in logical error rate, and with BB codes, this improvement reaches up to a 3$\times$ in order of this http URL, Cyclone reduces the number of required traps and ancilla qubits by $2\times$.The overall spacetime improvement over a standard grid is up to $\sim 20 \times$, demonstrating Cyclone as a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional 2D QCCD architectures.

Title: k-Uniform complete hypergraph states stabilizers in terms of local operators
Authors: Gabriel M. Arantes, Vinícius Salem, Danilo Cius, Bárbara Amaral
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method to express the stabilizer of a k-uniform complete hypergraph state as a linear combination of local operators. Quantum hypergraph states generalize graph states and exhibit properties that are not shared by their graph counterparts, most notably, their stabilizers are intrinsically nonlocal, as hyperedges can involve arbitrary subsets of vertices. Our formulation provides an explicit description of the stabilizers for k-uniform complete hypergraphs and may offer new insights for exploring these states within the stabilizer formalism. In particular, this approach could facilitate the construction of new Bell inequalities or find applications in quantum error correction.

Title: Reversing Quantum Noise: Quantum Reverse Diffusion for Pauli Channels
Authors: Einar Gabbassov
Abstract: The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are quantum reverse diffusion stochastic differential equations, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate reverse diffusion dynamics for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. Our results bridge the gap between highly nonlinear classical reverse diffusion, prominent in generative modelling, and linear quantum mechanics. Consequently, this establishes a theoretical framework for diffusion-driven quantum gates, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.

Title: Generation of spin-squeezed states using dipole-coupled spins
Authors: Yifan Song, Nabiha Hasan, Susumu Takahashi
Abstract: Spins in solids and molecules are promising for applications of quantum sensing technology. The sensitivity of the quantum sensing depends on how precisely spin observables can be determined in the measurement, and is intrinsically limited by the uncertainties of the observables. The use of a spin-squeezed state in a quantum sensor can reduce the uncertainty below the standard quantum limit when combined with an appropriate measurement procedure. Here, we discuss the simulation study of the generation of a squeezed state in an interacting spin system. We show that a spin system coupled by the magnetic dipole interaction can create a squeezed state. Model systems to realize the spin squeezing experimentally are also discussed. In addition, we find that a squeezed state is a type of entangled state. The present work paves the way to realize a squeezed state using a spin system to build a quantum sensor network with improved sensitivity, and to use it for the detection of quantum entanglement.

Title: A Graph-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Measurement Incompatibility
Authors: Daniel McNulty
Abstract: Measurement incompatibility--the impossibility of jointly measuring certain quantum observables--is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing. We develop a graph-theoretic framework for quantifying this resource for large families of binary measurements, including Pauli observables on multi-qubit systems and $k$-body Majorana observables on $n$-mode fermionic systems. To each set of observables we associate an anti-commutativity graph, whose vertices represent observables and whose edges indicate pairs that anti-commute. In this representation, the incompatibility robustness--the minimal amount of classical noise required to render the set jointly measurable--becomes a graph invariant. We derive general bounds on this invariant in terms of the Lovász number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number, and show that the Lovász number yields the correct asymptotic scaling for $k$-body Majorana observables. For line graphs $L(G)$, which naturally arise in the characterisation of exactly solvable spin models, we obtain spectral bounds on the robustness expressed through the energy and skew-energy of the underlying graph $G$. These bounds become tight for highly symmetric graphs, leading to closed formulas for several graph families. Finally, we identify structural conditions under which the robustness is determined by a simple function of the graph's maximum degree and the number of vertices and edges, and show that such extremal cases occur only when combinatorial structures such as Hadamard, conference or weighing matrices exist.

Title: High-Fidelity Raman Spin-Dependent Kicks in the Presence of Micromotion
Authors: Haonan Liu, Varun D. Vaidya, Monica Gutierrez Galan, Alexander K. Ratcliffe, Amrit Poudel, C. Ricardo Viteri
Abstract: We propose high-fidelity single-qubit spin-dependent kicks (SDKs) for trapped ions using nanosecond Raman pulses via amplitude modulation of a continuous-wave laser with a tunable beat frequency. We develop a general method for maintaining SDK performance in the presence of micromotion by identifying optimal choices of the RF phase and frequency that suppress unwanted backward kicks. The proposed scheme enables SDK infidelities as low as $10^{-9}$ in the absence of micromotion, and below $10^{-5}$ with micromotion. This study lays the foundation for the realization of sub-trap-period and high-fidelity two-qubit gates based on SDKs.

Title: A Primer on Quantum Machine Learning
Authors: Su Yeon Chang, M. Cerezo
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a computational paradigm that seeks to apply quantum-mechanical resources to solve learning problems. As such, the goal of this framework is to leverage quantum processors to tackle optimization, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and generative modeling-among other tasks-more efficiently than classical models. Here we offer a high level overview of QML, focusing on settings where the quantum device is the primary learning or data generating unit. We outline the field's tensions between practicality and guarantees, access models and speedups, and classical baselines and claimed quantum advantages-flagging where evidence is strong, where it is conditional or still lacking, and where open questions remain. By shedding light on these nuances and debates, we aim to provide a friendly map of the QML landscape so that the reader can judge when-and under what assumptions-quantum approaches may offer real benefits.

Title: Universal work statistics in quenched gapless quantum systems
Authors: Donny Dwiputra, Mir Faizal, Francesco Marino, Freddy P. Zen
Abstract: We study the universality of work statistics performed during a quench in gapless quantum systems. We show that the cumulants of work scale separately in the fast and slow quench regimes, following a power law analogous to the universal scaling in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for topological defect formation in phase transition. As an example, we analyze the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quenched Heisenberg XXZ chain at its critical gapless state using the bosonization picture, resulting in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The analytical scaling is in agreement with the exact numerical calculation for the fast and slow quench regimes. In finite systems, the characteristic function display an oscillatory pattern which disappears in the thermodynamic limit. This study is particularly useful for understanding the thermodynamics of adiabatic quantum computation.

Title: Molecular resonance identification in complex absorbing potentials via integrated quantum computing and high-throughput computing
Authors: Jingcheng Dai, Atharva Vidwans, Eric H. Wan, Alexander X. Miller, Micheline B. Soley
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum algorithms have reached a state where we can consider how to capitalize on quantum and classical computational resources to accelerate molecular resonance state identification. Here we identify molecular resonances with a method that combines quantum computing with classical high-throughput computing (HTC). This algorithm, which we term qDRIVE (the quantum deflation resonance identification variational eigensolver) exploits the complex absorbing potential formalism to distill the problem of molecular resonance identification into a network of hybrid quantum-classical variational quantum eigensolver tasks, and harnesses HTC resources to execute these interconnected but independent tasks both asynchronously and in parallel, a strategy that minimizes wall time to completion. We show qDRIVE successfully identifies resonance energies and wavefunctions in simulated quantum processors with current and planned specifications, which bodes well for qDRIVE's ultimate application in disciplines ranging from photocatalysis to quantum control and places a spotlight on the potential offered by integrated heterogenous quantum computing/HTC approaches in computational chemistry.

Title: Explicit construction of low-overhead gadgets for gates on quantum LDPC codes
Authors: Paul Webster, Samuel C. Smith, Lawrence Z. Cohen
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum computing, provided the methods for performing logical operations do not require substantial space and time resources. A popular method for performing logical operations is by measuring logical Pauli operators. We present a simple, explicit construction for fixed gadgets that can measure arbitrary logical Pauli operators on QLDPC codes when dynamically connected to the code block. We apply this construction to a family of generalised bicycle codes with distances relevant to utility-scale quantum computation ($10\leq d \leq 24$) and show that it reduces the space overhead by at least an order of magnitude compared to corresponding surface code architectures, without increasing the time overhead.

Title: Nonadaptive One-Way to Hiding Implies Adaptive Quantum Reprogramming
Authors: Joseph Jaeger
Abstract: An important proof technique in the random oracle model involves reprogramming it on hard to predict inputs and arguing that an attacker cannot detect that this occurred. In the quantum setting, a particularly challenging version of this considers adaptive reprogramming wherein the points to be reprogrammed (or the output values they should be programmed to) are dependent on choices made by the adversary. Some quantum frameworks for analyzing adaptive reprogramming were given by Unruh (CRYPTO 2014, EUROCRYPT 2015), Grilo-Hövelmanns-Hülsing-Majenz (ASIACRYPT 2021), and Pan-Zeng (PKC 2024). We show, counterintuitively, that these adaptive results follow from the \emph{nonadaptive} one-way to hiding theorem of Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh (CRYPTO 2019). These implications contradict beliefs (whether stated explicitly or implicitly) that some properties of the adaptive frameworks cannot be provided by the Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh result.

Title: TRAM: A Transverse Relaxation Time-Aware Qubit Mapping Algorithm for NISQ Devices
Authors: Yifei Huang, Pascal Jahan Elahi, Kan He, Jinchuan Hou, Shusen Liu
Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices impose dual challenges on quantum circuit execution: limited qubit connectivity requires extensive SWAP-gate routing, while time-dependent decoherence progressively degrades quantum information. Existing qubit mapping algorithms optimize for hardware topology and static calibration metrics but systematically neglect transverse relaxation dynamics (T2), creating a fundamental gap between compiler decisions and evolving noise characteristics. We present TRAM (Transverse Relaxation Time-Aware Qubit Mapping), a coherence-guided compilation framework that elevates decoherence mitigation to a primary optimization objective. TRAM integrates calibration-informed community detection to construct noise-resilient qubit partitions, generates time-weighted initial mappings that anticipate coherence decay, and dynamically schedules SWAP operations to minimize cumulative error accumulation. Evaluated on Qiskit-based simulators with realistic noise models, TRAM outperforms SABRE by 3.59% in fidelity, reduces gate count by 11.49%, and shortens circuit depth by 12.28%, establishing coherence-aware optimization as essential for practical quantum compilation in the NISQ era.

Title: Channel-selective frequency up-conversion for frequency-multiplexed quantum network
Authors: Shoichi Murakami, Shunsuke Hiraoka, Toshiki Kobayashi, Takashi Yamamoto, Rikizo Ikuta
Abstract: We demonstrate channel-selective frequency up-conversion from telecom wavelengths around 1540 nm for optical fiber communication to visible wavelengths around 780 nm, based on second-order optical nonlinearity in a cavity of the converted modes. In our experiment, we selectively convert a light from any frequency mode within frequency-multiplexed telecom signals to a desired output mode, determined by the cavity resonances. Based on the experimental results of the frequency up-conversion, we derive the signal-to-noise ratio of the process at the single-photon level, and discuss its applicability to channel-selective quantum frequency conversion (CS-QFC) in the context of frequency-multiplexed quantum networks. Finally, we describe specific use cases of the CS-QFC, which show its utility as a reconfigurable switching element in frequency-multiplexed networks, particularly for selectively performing Bell-state measurements between two photons originating from different frequencies.

Title: Approximation rates of quantum neural networks for periodic functions via Jackson's inequality
Authors: Ariel Neufeld, Philipp Schmocker, Viet Khoa Tran
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.

Title: Mixed-State Berry Curvature in quantum multiparameter estimations
Authors: Xiaoguang Wang, Xiao-Ming Lu, Yunbo Zhang, Libin Fu, Shu Chen
Abstract: For pure states, the quantum Berry curvature was well studied. However, the quantum curvature for mixed states has received less attention. From the concept of symmetric logarithmic derivative, we introduce a mixed-state quantum curvature and find that it plays a key role in the field of multi-parameter precision estimations. Through spectral decomposition, we derive the mixed-state Berry curvature for both the full-rank and non-full-rank density matrices. As an example, we obtain the exact expression of the Berry curvature for an arbitrary qubit state.

Title: Heralded quantum non-Gaussian states in pulsed levitating optomechanics
Authors: F. Bemani, A. A. Rakhubovsky, R. Filip
Abstract: Optomechanics with levitated nanoparticles is a promising way to combine very different types of quantum non-Gaussian aspects induced by continuous dynamics in a nonlinear or time-varying potential with the ones coming from discrete quantum elements in dynamics or measurement. First, it is necessary to prepare quantum non-Gaussian states using both methods. The nonlinear and time-varying potentials have been widely analyzed for this purpose. However, feasible preparation of provably quantum non-Gaussian states in a single mechanical mode using discrete photon detection has not been proposed yet for optical levitation. We explore pulsed optomechanical interactions combined with non-linear photon detection techniques to approach mechanical Fock states and confirm their quantum non-Gaussianity. We also predict the conditions under which the optomechanical interaction can induce multiple-phonon addition processes, which are relevant for $n$-phonon quantum non-Gaussianity. The practical applicability of quantum non-Gaussian states for sensing phase-randomized displacements is shown. Besides such applications, generating quantum non-Gaussian states of levitated nanoparticles can help to study fundamental questions of quantum thermodynamics, and macroscopic quantum effects.

Title: QASER: Breaking the Depth vs. Accuracy Trade-Off for Quantum Architecture Search
Authors: Ioana Moflic, Alexandru Paler, Akash Kundu
Abstract: Quantum computing faces a key challenge: balancing the need for low circuit depth (crucial for fault tolerance) with the high accuracy required for complex computations like quantum chemistry and error correction, which typically require deeper circuits. We overcome this trade-off by introducing a novel reinforcement learning approach featuring engineered reward functions, called \textbf{QASER}, that take into account seemingly contradictory optimization goals. This reward enables the compilation of circuits with lower depth and higher accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Benchmarks on quantum chemistry state preparation circuits demonstrate stable compilations. We achieve up to 50\% improved accuracy, while reducing 2-qubit gate counts and depths by 20\%. This advancement enables more efficient and reliable quantum compilation.

Title: Universal features of non-analytical energy storage in quantum critical quantum batteries
Authors: Riccardo Grazi, Dario Ferraro, Niccolò Traverso Ziani
Abstract: Quantum batteries are quantum mechanical systems able to store and release energy in a controlled fashion. Among them, a special role is played by quantum structures defined as networks of two-level systems. In this context, it has recently been shown that the energy stored in free fermion quantum batteries is sensitive to the quantum phase diagram of the battery itself. This sensitivity is relevant for stabilizing the stored energy and designing optimal charging protocols. In this article, we explore universal charging behaviors of free fermion quantum batteries across quantum phase transitions. We first analyze a Dirac cone-like model to extract general features. Then, we verify our findings by means of two relevant lattice models, namely the Ising chain in a transverse field and the Haldane model.

Title: Symmetry-Controlled Ultrastrong Phonon-Photon Coupling in a Terahertz Cavity
Authors: Dasom Kim, Maxime Dherbécourt, Sae R. Endo, Geon Lee, Ayush Agrawal, Sunghwan Kim, Wen-Hua Wu, Aditya D. Mohite, Minah Seo, David Hagenmüller, Junichiro Kono
Abstract: Optical cavities provide a powerful means to engineer light-matter hybrid states by coupling confined electromagnetic fields with matter excitations. Achieving in situ control of the coupling strength is essential for investigating how such hybridization evolves with the coupling strength. In this work, we use a symmetry-changing structural phase transition in lead halide perovskites to reversibly tune the phonon-photon coupling strength, leveraging the fact that their phonon frequencies and oscillator strengths are dictated by lattice symmetry. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of MAPbI3 embedded in nanoslot cavities reveals three polariton branches above the critical temperature Tc = 162.5 K, and the emergence of an additional branch below Tc, activated by a new phonon mode in the low-temperature phase. The full dispersion is accurately reproduced using a multimode Hopfield model, confirming that all normalized coupling strengths remain in the ultrastrong coupling regime. These results demonstrate symmetry-controlled tuning of ultrastrong coupling via phonon engineering in optical cavities.

Title: Medusa: Detecting and Removing Failures for Scalable Quantum Computing
Authors: Karoliina Oksanen, Quan Hoang, Alexandru Paler
Abstract: Quantum circuits will experience failures that lead to computational errors. We introduce Medusa, an automated compilation method for lowering a circuit's failure rate. Medusa uses flags to predict the absence of high-weight errors. Our method can numerically upper bound the failure rate of a circuit in the presence of flags, and fine tune the fault-tolerance of the flags in order to reach this bound. We assume the flags can have an increased fault-tolerance as a result of applying surface QECs to the gates interacting with them. We use circuit level depolarizing noise to evaluate the effectiveness of these flags in revealing the absence of the high-weight stabilizers. Medusa reduces the cost of quantum-error-correction (QEC) because the underlying circuit has a lower failure rate. We benchmark our approach using structured quantum circuits representative of ripple-carry adders. In particular, our flag scheme demonstrates that for adder-like circuits, the failure rate of large-scale implementations can be lowered to fit the failure rates of smaller-scale circuits. We show numerically that a slight improvement in the local fault-tolerance of the flag-qubits can lead to a reduction in the overall failure rate of the entire quantum circuit.

Title: Emulation Capacity between Idempotent Channels
Authors: Idris Delsol, Omar Fawzi, Li Gao, Mizanur Rahaman
Abstract: We study the optimal rates of emulation (also called interconversion) between quantum channels. When the source and the target channels are idempotent, we give a single-letter expression for the zero-error emulation capacity in terms of structural properties of the range of the two channels. This expression shows that channel emulation is not reversible for general idempotent channels. Furthermore, we establish a strong converse rate that matches with the zero-error emulation capacity when the source or the target channel is either an identity or a completely dephasing channel.

Title: ATLAS: Efficient Atom Rearrangement for Defect-Free Neutral-Atom Quantum Arrays Under Transport Loss
Authors: Otto Savola, Alexandru Paler
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum computers encode qubits in individually trapped atoms arranged in optical lattices. Achieving defect-free atom configurations is essential for high-fidelity quantum gates and scalable error correction, yet stochastic loading and atom loss during rearrangement hinder reliable large-scale assembly. This work presents ATLAS, an open-source atom transport algorithm that efficiently converts a randomly loaded $W \times W$ lattice into a defect-free $L \times L$ subarray while accounting for realistic physical constraints, including finite acceleration, transfer time, and per-move loss probability. In the planning phase, optimal batches of parallel moves are computed on a lossless virtual array; during execution, these moves are replayed under probabilistic atom loss to maximize the expected number of retained atoms. Monte Carlo simulations across lattice sizes $W=10$--$100$, loading probabilities $p_{\mathrm{occ}}=0.5$--$0.9$, and loss rates $p_{\mathrm{loss}}=0$--$0.05$ demonstrate fill rates above $99\%$ within six iterations and over $90\%$ atom retention at low loss. The algorithm achieves sublinear move scaling ($\propto M^{0.55}$) and linear growth of required initial size with target dimension, outperforming prior methods in robustness and scalability -- offering a practical path toward larger neutral-atom quantum arrays.

Title: On-chip Time-bin to Path Qubit Encoding Converter via Thin Film Lithium Niobate Photonics Chip
Authors: Xiaosong Ren, Zhanping Jin, Xiaotong Zou, Xiaole Zhang, Xue Feng, Fang Liu, Kaiyu Cui, Yidong Huang, Wei Zhang
Abstract: The development of quantum internet demands on-chip quantum processor nodes and interconnection between the nodes. Path-encoded photonic qubits are suitable for on-chip quantum information processors, while time-bin encoded ones are good at long-distance communication. It is necessary to develop an on-chip converter between the two encodings to satisfy the needs of the quantum internet. In this work, a quantum photonic circuit is proposed to convert time-bin-encoded photonic qubits to path-encoded ones via a thin-film lithium niobate high-speed optical switch and low-loss matched optical delay lines. The performance of the encoding converter is demonstrated by the experiment of time-bin to path encoding conversion on the fabricated sample chip. The converted path qubits have an average fidelity higher than 97%. The potential of the encoding converter on applications in quantum networks is demonstrated by the experiments of entanglement distribution and quantum key distribution. The results show that the on-chip encoding converter can serve as a foundational component in the future quantum internet, bridging the gap between quantum information transmission and on-chip processing based on photons.

Title: Tripartite Entanglement Generation in Atom-Coupled Dual Microresonators System
Authors: Abhishek Mandal, Joy Ghosh, Maruthi Manoj Brundavanam, Shailendra K Varshney
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence and control of genuine tripartite entanglement in a hybrid cavity quantum electrodynamics architecture consisting of two linearly coupled single mode resonators, one of which interacts coherently with a two level atom. An analytical framework is developed in a weak driving regime, where the system dynamically supports a delocalized hybrid excitation shared by the two photonic modes and the atomic degree of freedom. Tripartite concurrence fill has been used to characterize and identify parameter regimes of maximal multipartite quantum correlation that can be generated in this model. Additionally, we demonstrate how dissipative rates and detuning asymmetries govern the conversion of bipartite entanglement into a genuinely tripartite state, establishing a controllable transition from localized Jaynes Cummings correlations to delocalized photonic atomic entanglement networks. These findings outline a clear route to engineering steady state multipartite quantum resources in coupled cavity QED platforms, with direct relevance to quantum networking, distributed quantum information processing, and photonic state routing in scalable quantum architectures.

Title: Identifying the $3$-qubit $W$ state with quantum uncertainty relation
Authors: Zhi-Jie Liu, Hao-Nan Qiang, Jie Zhou, Mi Xie, Jing-Ling Chen
Abstract: The $W$ state, a canonical representative of multipartite quantum entanglement, plays a crucial role in quantum information science due to its robust entanglement properties. Quantum uncertainty relations, on the other hand, are a fundamental cornerstone of quantum mechanics. This paper introduces a novel approach to Identifying tripartite $W$ states by leveraging tripartite quantum uncertainty relations. By employing a specific set of non-commuting observables, we formulate an uncertainty-based criterion for identifying $W$ states and rigorously demonstrate its generality in distinguishing them from other tripartite entangled states, such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. Our approach bypasses the need for complete quantum state tomography, as it requires only the verification of a set of uncertainty inequalities for efficient $W$-state identification. This work provides a new theoretical tool for identifying multipartite entangled states and underscores the significant role of quantum uncertainty relations in entanglement characterization.

Title: Optimizing Quantum Key Distribution Network Performance using Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Akshit Pramod Anchan, Ameiy Acharya, Leki Chom Thungon
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.

Title: Local fermion density in inhomogeneous free-fermion chains: a discrete WKB approach
Authors: Martín Zapata, Federico Finkel, Artemio González-López
Abstract: We introduce a novel analytical approach for studying free-fermion (XX) chains with smoothly varying, site-dependent hoppings and magnetic fields. Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields. This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles. Our findings are thus the first step towards an analytical treatment of entanglement in free-fermion chains beyond the reach of conventional field-theoretic techniques.

Title: Quantum speed limit for observables from quantum asymmetry
Authors: Agung Budiyono, Michael Moody, Hadyan L. Prihadi, Rafika Rahmawati, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: Quantum asymmetry and coherence are genuinely quantum resources that are essential to realize quantum advantage in information technologies. However, all quantum processes are fundamentally constrained by quantum speed limits, which raises the question on the corresponding bounds on the rate of consumption of asymmetry and coherence. In the present work, we derive a formulation of the quantum speed limit for observables in terms of the trace-norm asymmetry of the time-dependent quantum state relative to the observable. This version of the quantum speed limit can be shown to be directly relevant in weak measurements and quantum metrology. It can be further related to quantum coherence relative to the observable, and we obtain a complementary relation for the speed of three mutually unbiased observables for a single qubit. As an application, we derive a notion of a quantum thermodynamic speed limit.

Title: Analytical Fock Representation of Two-Mode Squeezing for Quantum Interference
Authors: Xuemei Gu, Carlos Ruiz-Gonzalez, Mario Krenn
Abstract: Two-mode squeezing is central to entangled-photon generation and nonlinear interferometry, yet standard perturbative low-gain and Gaussian treatments obscure how photon-number amplitudes interfere, especially in multi-crystal geometries and at high gain. Here, we derive the exact analytic action of the two-mode squeezing operator on arbitrary Fock states to analyze nonlinear interferometers directly in the number basis at arbitrary squeezing strength. Within this framework, we find new physical interpretations of previously known quantum interference effects, and theoretically discover a new and unusual multi-photon interference effect in an experimental four-crystal geometry that could readily be observed in laboratories. Our work provides a compact analytic toolkit and concrete design rules for engineering multi-photon interference, with applications in quantum sensing, precision metrology, and advanced quantum state generation.

Authors: Konrad Anand, Zongchen Chen, Mary Cryan, Graham Freifeld, Leslie Ann Goldberg, Heng Guo, Xinyuan Zhang
Abstract: We show that a distribution related to Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) on graphs can be sampled classically in polynomial time. Graphical applications of GBS typically sample from this distribution, and thus quantum algorithms do not provide exponential speedup for these applications. We also show that another distribution related to Boson sampling can be sampled classically in polynomial time.

Title: Reinforcement learning of quantum circuit architectures for molecular potential energy curves
Authors: Maureen Krumtünger, Alissa Wilms, Paul K. Faehrmann, Jens Eisert, Jakob Kottmann, Paolo Andrea Erdman, Sumeet Khatri
Abstract: Quantum chemistry and optimization are two of the most prominent applications of quantum computers. Variational quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving problems in these domains. However, the design of the quantum circuit ansatz remains a challenge. Of particular interest is developing a method to generate circuits for any given instance of a problem, not merely a circuit tailored to a specific instance of the problem. To this end, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learning a problem-dependent quantum circuit mapping, which outputs a circuit for the ground state of a Hamiltonian from a given family of parameterized Hamiltonians. For quantum chemistry, our RL framework takes as input a molecule and a discrete set of bond distances, and it outputs a bond-distance-dependent quantum circuit for arbitrary bond distances along the potential energy curve. The inherently non-greedy approach of our RL method contrasts with existing greedy approaches to adaptive, problem-tailored circuit constructions. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the four-qubit and six-qubit lithium hydride molecules, as well as an eight-qubit H$_4$ chain. Our learned circuits are interpretable in a physically meaningful manner, thus paving the way for applying RL to the development of novel quantum circuits for the ground states of large-scale molecular systems.

Title: OpenQudit: Extensible and Accelerated Numerical Quantum Compilation via a JIT-Compiled DSL
Authors: Ed Younis
Abstract: High-performance numerical quantum compilers rely on classical optimization, but are limited by slow numerical evaluations and a design that makes extending them with new instructions a difficult, error-prone task for domain experts. This paper introduces OpenQudit, a compilation framework that solves these problems by allowing users to define quantum operations symbolically in the Qudit Gate Language (QGL), a mathematically natural DSL. OpenQudit's ahead-of-time compiler uses a tensor network representation and an e-graph-based pass for symbolic simplification before a runtime tensor network virtual machine (TNVM) JIT-compiles the expressions into high-performance native code. The evaluation shows that this symbolic approach is highly effective, accelerating the core instantiation task by up to $\mathtt{\sim}20\times$ on common quantum circuit synthesis problems compared to state-of-the-art tools.

Title: Lindbladian approach for many-qubit thermal machines: enhancing the performance with geometric heat pumping by entanglement
Authors: Gerónimo J. Caselli, Luis O. Manuel, Liliana Arrachea
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of slowly driven quantum thermal machines based on interacting qubits within the framework of the Lindblad master equation. By implementing a systematic expansion in the driving rate, we derive explicit expressions for the rate of work of the driving forces, the heat currents exchanged with the reservoirs, and the entropy production up to second order, ensuring full thermodynamic consistency in the linear-response regime. The formalism naturally separates geometric and dissipative contributions, identified by a Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space, respectively. Analytical results show that the geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \ln 2$ for $N_q$ non-interacting qubits, in direct analogy with the Landauer limit for entropy change. This bound can be surpassed when qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings to the baths are introduced. Numerical results for the interacting two-qubit system reveal a non-trivial role of the interaction between qubits and the coupling between the qubits and the baths in the behavior of the dissipated power. The approach provides a general platform for studying dissipation, pumping, and performance optimization in driven quantum devices operating as heat engines.

Title: Variational Quantum Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Ivana Nikoloska, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication functionalities within a common system is one of the main innovation drivers for next-generation networks. In this paper, we introduce a quantum integrated sensing and communication (QISAC) protocol that leverages entanglement in quantum carriers of information to enable both superdense coding and quantum sensing. The proposed approach adaptively optimizes encoding and quantum measurement via variational circuit learning, while employing classical machine learning-based decoders and estimators to process the measurement outcomes. Numerical results for qudit systems demonstrate that the proposed QISAC protocol can achieve a flexible trade-off between classical communication rate and accuracy of parameter estimation.

Title: Correction of chain losses in trapped ion quantum computers
Authors: Nolan J. Coble, Min Ye, Nicolas Delfosse
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers and to a lesser extent trapped ions may suffer from atom loss. In this work, we investigate the impact of atom loss in long chains of trapped ions. Even though this is a relatively rare event, ion loss in long chains must be addressed because it destabilizes the entire chain resulting in the loss of all the qubits of the chain. We propose a solution to the chain loss problem based on (1) a quantum error correction code distributed over multiple long chains, (2) beacon qubits within each long chain to detect the loss of a chain, and (3) a decoder adapted to correct a combination of circuit faults and erasures after beacon qubits convert chain losses into erasures. We verify the chain loss correction capability of our scheme through circuit level simulations with a distributed $[[72,12,6]]$ BB code with beacon qubits.

Title: Measurement incompatibility in Bayesian multiparameter quantum estimation
Authors: Francesco Albarelli, Dominic Branford, Jesús Rubio
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and pedagogical formulation of Bayesian multiparameter quantum estimation, providing explicit conditions for achieving minimum quadratic losses. Within this framework, we analyse the role of measurement incompatibility and establish its quantitative effect on attainable precision. We achieve this by deriving upper bounds based on the pretty good measurement -- a notion originally developed for hypothesis testing -- combined with the evaluation of the Nagaoka-Hayashi lower bound. In general, we prove that, as in the many-copy regime of local estimation theory, incompatibility can at most double the minimum loss relative to the idealised scenario in which individually optimal measurements are assumed jointly implementable. This result implies that, in many practical situations, the latter may provide a sufficient and computationally efficient benchmark without solving the full optimisation problem. Our results, which we illustrate through a range of applications, including discrete quantum phase imaging, phase and dephasing estimation, and qubit sensing, provide analytical and numerical tools for assessing ultimate precision limits and the role of measurement incompatibility in Bayesian multiparameter quantum metrology. We also provide an open-source package that implements all bounds discussed here, enabling practical evaluation and comparison across quantum metrological models.

Title: Comparison of Mathematical Models for Subscription Services Using Optimization Problems and Quantum Information Theory -Feasibility of Implementing Optimization Problem Algorithms on Quantum Computers-
Authors: Misao Fukuda
Abstract: The purpose of this research is to explore whether it is possible to construct a design theory for subscription services for intangible goods from a time discounting perspective, based on quantum information theory, which is the foundational theory for quantum computers and similar technologies. To this end, we propose a mathematical model of subscription services using optimization problems based on optimal growth theory from standard economics, and with reference to microeconomics, we define utility as a value function of customer satisfaction derived from quantum mutual information, an entropy measure in quantum information theory, by considering time discounting. We propose the quantification of customer satisfaction and the formulation of consumer surplus. In the mathematical model of subscription services, the existence of a minimum value in the time-discounted customer satisfaction value function under budget constraints, and the realization of a mathematical expression for consumer surplus, could be explained by the laws of behavioral economics. This yielded new insights into the design of individually customized customer experiences, enhanced the feasibility of constructing economic models based on quantum information theory and the mathematical design of customer experiences, raised the possibility that mathematical models using quantum information theory can achieve greater economic welfare than standard economics, and increased the feasibility of implementing optimization problem algorithms on quantum computers.

Title: Parity anomalies in 2+1-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm type configurations
Authors: Harun Basmaci, Hasan Ozgur Cildiroglu
Abstract: We demonstrate that Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions, coupled to Abelian gauge fields in multiply-connected regions, exhibit a parity anomaly that directly manifests as Aharonov-Bohm (AB) type topological phases. Using the Fujikawa method, we show that this anomaly reproduces both the AB phase and the spin-dependent Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. We explicitly calculate the induced topological currents, establishing that their characteristic divergence-free form provides a direct signature of this parity-anomalous topological phase.

Title: Automorphism in Gauge Theories: Higher Symmetries and Transversal Non-Clifford Logical Gates
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi
Abstract: Gauge theories are important descriptions for many physical phenomena and systems in quantum computation. Automorphism of gauge group naturally gives global symmetries of gauge theories. In this work we study such symmetries in gauge theories induced by automorphisms of the gauge group, when the gauge theories have nontrivial topological actions in different spacetime dimensions. We discover the automorphism symmetry can be extended, become a higher group symmetry, and/or become a non-invertible symmetry. We illustrate the discussion with various models in field theory and on the lattice. In particular, we use automorphism symmetry to construct new transversal non-Clifford logical gates in topological quantum codes. In particular, we show that 2+1d $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford stabilizer models can implement non-Clifford transversal logical gate in the 4th level $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford hierarchy for $N\geq 3$, extending the generalized Bravyi-König bound proposed in the companion paper [arXiv:2511.02900] for qubits.

Title: Explicit Connections Between Krylov and Nielsen Complexity
Authors: Ben Craps, Gabriele Pascuzzi, Juan F. Pedraza, Le-Chen Qu, Shan-Ming Ruan
Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between Krylov and Nielsen complexity by choosing the Krylov basis to be part of the elementary gate set of Nielsen geometry and selecting a Nielsen complexity metric compatible with the Krylov metric. Up to normalization, the Krylov complexity of a Hermitian operator then equals the length squared of a straight-line trajectory on the manifold of unitaries that connects the identity operator with a precursor operator. The corresponding length provides an upper bound on Nielsen complexity that saturates whenever the straight line is a minimal geodesic. While for general systems we can only establish saturation in the limit of small precursors, we provide evidence that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model there is a precise correspondence between Krylov complexity and (the square of) Nielsen complexity for a finite range of precursors.

Title: Floquet Bosonic Kitaev Chain
Authors: Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: We propose a class of periodically driven (Hermitian) modified bosonic Kitaev chains that effectively hosts rich nonHermitian Floquet topological phenomena. Two particular models are investigated in details as case studies. The first of these represents a minimal topologically nontrivial model in which nonHermitian skin effect, topological zero modes, and topological $\pi$ modes coexist. The other displays a more sophisticated model that supports multiple topological zero modes and topological $\pi$ modes in a tunable manner. By subjecting both models to perturbations such as a finite onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder, these features exhibit distinct responses. In particular, while generally all topological edge modes are robust against such perturbations, the nonHermitian skin effect is easily suppressed and revived by, respectively, the onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder in the first model, but it could be insensitive to both perturbations in the second model. Our studies thus demonstrate the prospect of a periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chain as a starting point in exploring various nonHermitian Floquet topological phases through the lens of a Hermitian system.

Title: Relativistic Covariance and Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics: Tomonaga-Schwinger Analysis
Authors: Stephen D.H. Hsu
Abstract: We use the Tomonaga-Schwinger (TS) formulation of quantum field theory to determine when state-dependent additions to the local Hamiltonian density (i.e., modifications to linear Schrodinger evolution) violate relativistic covariance. We derive new operator integrability conditions required for foliation independence, including the Frechet derivative terms that arise from state-dependence. Nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics affect operator relations at spacelike separation, leading to violation of the integrability conditions.

Title: A low-energy effective Hamiltonian for Landau quasiparticles
Authors: Pierre-Louis Taillat, Hadrien Kurkjian
Abstract: We introduce a new renormalisation scheme to construct the Landau quasiparticles of Fermi fluids. The scheme relies on an energy cutoff $\Lambda$ which removes the quasi-resonant couplings, enabling the dressing of the particles into quasiparticles via a unitary transformation. The dynamics of the quasiparticles is then restricted to low-energy transitions and is fully determined by an effective Hamiltonian which unifies the Landau interaction function $f$ and the collision amplitude in a single amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ regularized by $\Lambda$. Our effective theory captures all the low-energy physics of Fermi fluids that support Landau quasiparticles, from the equation of state to the transport properties, both in the normal and in the superfluid phase. We apply it to an atomic Fermi gas with contact interaction to compute the speed of zero sound in function of the scattering length $a$. We also recover the Gork'ov-Melik Barkhudarov correction to the superfluid gap and critical temperature as a direct consequence of the dressing of particles into Landau quasiparticles.

Title: Finite-Dimensional ZX-Calculus for Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: Ben Priestley
Abstract: Loop quantum gravity (LQG) attempts to unify general relativity with quantum physics to offer a complete description of the universe by quantising spacetime geometry, but the numerical calculations we encounter are extraordinarily difficult. Progress has been made in the covariant formulation of LQG, but the tools do not carry over to the canonical formulation. These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand. Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114). Specifically, we derive the mixed-dimensional ZX-diagrams representing the generating objects of spin networks and the rules for the Penrose Spin Calculus (arXiv:2511.06012), and use these to present the ZX-form and correctness of "loop removal". We also derive the forms for several fundamental LQG objects in the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus for the first time. This gives us a high-level, intuitive graphical language that retains a flexibility to handle changing graph structures, and thus we argue positions the PSC as the new definitive language for canonical LQG. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility for a matrix-like normal form for spin networks deriving from a novel perspective of the PSC in terms of W-nodes.

Title: Quantum Reorientational Excitations in the Raman Spectrum of Hydrogen
Authors: Philip Dalladay-Simpson, Eric Edmund, Huixin Hu, Mario Santoro, Federico Aiace Gorelli
Abstract: Low-frequency Raman peaks, below 250 cm-1, are observed in hydrogen between 2-174 GPa and 13-300 K. The origin of these features is attributed to reorientational transitions (DeltaJ = 0; Q0-branch), which shift from the Rayleigh line as anisotropic intermolecular interactions lift the mJ degeneracy. This family of excitations closely follows the behavior of the S0-branches, sharing their dependence on pressure, temperature, and ortho-H2 concentration. Above 65 K, spectra corrected by the Bose-Einstein population factor reveal a broad continuum arising from populated higher J-states and increased ortho-para disorder. Upon entering phase III, where molecular rotation is inhibited, this continuum is quenched, giving way to well-established optical phonons. Below 25 K, equilibrated samples demonstrate a fine structure from isolated and pair excitations from impurity ortho-H2 molecules in a parahydrogen lattice, the latter a sensitive probe to anisotropic intermolecular interactions relevant to the quantum modeling of solid H2.

Title: On the resolution of categorical symmetries in (Non-) Unitary Rational CFTs
Authors: Arpan Bhattacharyya, Saptaswa Ghosh, Sounak Pal, Jagannath Santara
Abstract: We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by the SymTFT construction of arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.

Title: Exceptional-Point-Induced Sensitivity-Robustness Phase Transition in Quantum Interference
Authors: Xing Lin, Shuang Zhang
Abstract: Quantum interference underpins many quantum information protocols but is typically studied in lossless Hermitian systems. Here, we reveal an exceptional point induced phase transition in two photon Hong Ou Mandel interference within a lossy coupled waveguide system. In the PT symmetric phase. interference is ultrasensitive to coupling strength, yielding sharp bunching antibunching switches. In the PT broken phase. it becomes robust oscillation free and propagation independent with coincidence probability stably tunable via coupling. These regimes enable enhanced quantum sensing and reliable two photon control for robust quantum information processing.

Title: Distinguishing thermal versus quantum annealing using probability-flux signatures across interaction networks
Authors: Yoshiaki Horiike, Yuki Kawaguchi
Abstract: Simulated annealing provides a heuristic solution to combinatorial optimization problems. The cost function of a problem is mapped to the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which may correspond to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it difficult to design problem instances that fairly compare the two methods. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing.

Title: From percolation transition to Anderson localization in one-dimensional speckle potentials
Authors: Margaux Vrech, Jan Major, Dominique Delande, Marcel Filoche, Nicolas Cherroret
Abstract: Classical particles in random potentials typically experience a percolation phase transition, being trapped in clusters of mean size $\chi$ that diverges algebraically at a percolation threshold. In contrast, quantum transport in random potentials is controlled by the Anderson localization length, which shows no distinct feature at this classical critical point. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the semi-classical crossover between these two regimes by studying particle propagation in a one-dimensional, red speckle potential, which hosts a percolation transition at its upper bound. As the system deviates from the classical limit, we find that the algebraic divergence of $\chi$ continuously connects to a smooth yet non-analytic increase of the localization length. We characterize this behavior both numerically and theoretically using a semi-classical approach. In this crossover regime, the correlated and non-Gaussian nature of the speckle potential becomes essential, causing the standard DMPK description for uncorrelated disorder to break down. Instead, we predict the emergence of a bimodal transmission distribution, a behavior normally absent in one dimension, which we capture within our semi-classical analysis. Deep in the quantum regime, the DMPK framework is recovered and the universal features of Anderson localization reappear.

Title: Adiabatic charge transport through non-Bloch bands
Authors: Dharana Joshi, Tanay Nag
Abstract: We explore the non-reciprocal intracell hopping mediated non-Hermitian topological phases of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model hosting second-nearest-neighbour hopping. We microscopically analyze the phase boundaries using the non-Bloch momentum while the off-critical (critical) phases are directly associated with the gapped (gapless) nature of the non-Bloch bands that we derive from the characteristic equation using the gauge freedom. The non-Bloch momentum accurately reflects the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC) explaining the winding number profile under open boundary conditions. We examine the adiabatic dynamics to promote the concept of adiabatic charge transport in a non-Hermitian scenario justifying the BBC in spatio-temporal Bott index and non-Bloch Chern number. Once the non-Bloch bands experience no (a) gap-closing during the evolution of time, quantized flow of is preserved (broken). Our study systematically unifies the concept of non-Bloch bands for both static and driven situations.

Title: Comment on: "Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions"
Authors: J. Sirker
Abstract: In Ref. Ansari et al., dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) -- non-analyticities in the Loschmidt return rate at critical times -- are investigated in the presence of noise for a two-band model. The authors report that DQPTs persist even after averaging over the noise and they use their results to derive dynamical phase diagrams. In this comment we rigorously prove that in any two-dimensional Hilbert space the Loschmidt echo of two density matrices can only become zero if and only if both density matrices are pure. As a consequence, the existence of DQPTs in the considered scenario is strictly ruled out for non-zero noise because the considered averaging leads to a mixed state. We also investigate alternative natural ways to average over noise realizations and show that in all of them DQPTs are smoothed out.

Title: Non-Abelian operator size distribution in charge-conserving many-body systems
Authors: Mina Tarakemeh, Shenglong Xu
Abstract: We show that operator dynamics in U(1) symmetric systems are constrained by two independent conserved charges and construct a non-Abelian operator size basis that respects both, enabling a symmetry-resolved characterization of operator growth. The non-Abelian operator size depends on the operator's nonlocal structure and is organized by an SU(2) algebra. Operators associated with large total angular momentum are relatively simple, while those with small angular momentum are more complex. Operator growth is thus characterized by a reduction in angular momentum and can be probed using out-of-time-ordered correlators. Using the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we derive an exact classical master equation that governs the size distribution, the distribution of an operator expanded in this basis, for arbitrary system sizes. The resulting dynamics reveal that the size distribution follows a chi-squared form, with the two conserved charges jointly determining the overall time scale and the shape of the distribution. In particular, single-particle operators retain a divergent peak at large angular momentum throughout the time evolution.

Title: Performance Analysis of Satellite-Based QKD Protocols Using the Circular Beam Model
Authors: Muskan, Ramniwas Meena, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: Satellite-based free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a practical framework for achieving secure global communication beyond the limitations of optical fibers. In this work, the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and secure key rate of four representative protocols-BB84, B92, BBM92, and E91 are investigated over low earth orbit (LEO) links in both uplink and downlink configurations. A circular beam transmittance model is employed, incorporating the effects of diffraction, pointing errors, atmospheric turbulence, and background photons. The protocols are examined under day and night-time operating conditions, and their dependence on the zenith angle is analyzed. The findings show that downlink links generally exhibit lower QBER and higher secure key rates than uplinks, and among prepare-and-measure schemes, BB84 consistently outperforms B92, while in entanglement-based approaches, BBM92 achieves higher key rates than E91.

Title: Dynamics of "Classical" Bosons, Fermions, and beyond
Authors: Varsha Subramanyan, T.H. Hansson, Smitha Vishveshwara
Abstract: We study the classical mechanics and dynamics of particles that retains some memory of quantum statistics. Our work builds on earlier work on the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of such particles. Starting from the effective classical manifold associated with two-particle bosonic and fermionic coherent states, we show how their exchange statistics is reflected in the symplectic form of the manifold. We demonstrate the classical analogues of exclusion or bunching behavior expected in such states by studying their trajectories in various quadratic potentials. Our examples are two-particle coherent states in one dimension and two-particle vortex motion in the lowest Landau level. We finally compare and contrast our results with previous simulations of the full quantum system, and with existing results on the geometric interpretations of quantum mechanics.

Title: A graph-based approach to entanglement entropy of quantum error correcting codes
Authors: Wuxu Zhao, Menglong Fang, Daiqin Su
Abstract: We develop a graph-based method to study the entanglement entropy of Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum codes. This method offers a straightforward interpretation for the entanglement entropy of quantum error correcting codes through graph-theoretical concepts, shedding light on the origins of both the local and long-range entanglement. Furthermore, it inspires an efficient computational scheme for evaluating the entanglement entropy. We illustrate the method by calculating the von Neumann entropy of subsystems in toric codes and two types of quantum low-density-parity check codes, and by comparing the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy with respect to the subsystem size. Our method provides a new perspective for understanding the entanglement structure in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Digit quantum simulation of a fermion field in an expanding universe
Authors: Jia-Qi Gong, Ji-Chong Yang
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a rapidly evolving tool with great potential for research at the frontiers of physics, and is particularly suited to be used in computationally intensive lattice simulations, such as problems with non-equilibrium. In this work, a basic scenario, namely free fermions in an expanding universe, is considered and quantum simulations are used to perform the evolution and study the phenomena involved. Using digital quantum simulations with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter expansion, the evolutions of fermion number density, correlation functions, polarization, and chiral condensation are analyzed. A spread out phenomenon can be observed in the simulation, which is a consequence of momentum redshift. This work also demonstrates the simplicity and convenience of using quantum simulations when studying time-evolution problems.

Title: System versus charger in performance optimization of quantum batteries
Authors: Rohit Kumar Shukla, Rajiv Kumar, Ujjwal Sen, Sunil K. Mishra
Abstract: Quantum batteries have emerged as promising devices that work within the quantum regime and provide energy storage and power delivery. In this work, we explore the interplay between the battery and charger Hamiltonians, focusing on controlling and minimizing the batterys intrinsic influence during the charging process. To this end, we introduce a tunable parameter that allows partial suppression of the batterys contribution, enabling a systematic study of its role in energy transfer. We examine several charging configurations: a non-interacting qubit battery driven by an interacting many-body charger, an interacting qubit battery energized by a non-interacting charger, and setups in which both the battery and the charger are interacting qubit chains. In all cases, the inclusion of a controllable counteraction, or anti-effect of the battery Hamiltonian, allows us to modulate the batterys internal dynamics during charging. Our results demonstrate a significant enhancement in both stored energy and charging power when the batterys influence is suppressed, emphasizing the critical role of the charger in optimizing performance. Notably, we find that incorporating the batterys countereffect consistently improves storage characteristics across all configurations, suggesting a novel avenue for designing highly efficient quantum batteries.

Title: Compactifying linear optical unitaries using multiport beamsplitters
Authors: P. A. Ameen Yasir, Peter van Loock
Abstract: We show that any $N$-dimensional unitary matrix can be realized using a finite sequence of concatenated identical fixed multiport beamsplitters (MBSs) and phase shifters (PSs). Our construction is based on a Lie group theorem applied to existing decompositions. Using the Bell-Walmsley-Clements framework, we prove that any $N$-dimensional unitary requires $N+2$ phase masks, $N-1$ fixed MBSs, and $N-1$ BSs. Our scheme requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ fixed, identical components (MBSs and BSs) compared to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ fixed BSs required by conventional schemes (e.g., Clements), all while keeping the same number of PSs. Experimentally, these MBS can be realized as a monolithic element via femtosecond laser writing, offering superior performance through reduced insertion losses. As an application, we present a reconfigurable linear optical circuit that implements a three-dimensional unitary emerging in the unambiguous discrimination of two nonorthogonal qubit states.

Title: Metainformation in Quantum Guessing Games
Authors: Teiko Heinosaari, Hanwool Lee
Abstract: Quantum guessing games offer a structured approach to analyzing quantum information processing, where information is encoded in quantum states and extracted through measurement. An additional aspect of this framework is the influence of partial knowledge about the input on the optimal measurement strategies. This kind of side information can significantly influence the guessing strategy and earlier work has shown that the timing of such side information, whether revealed before or after the measurement, can affect the success probabilities. In this work, we go beyond this established distinction by introducing the concept of metainformation. Metainformation is information about information, and in our context it is knowledge that additional side information of certain type will become later available, even if it is not yet provided. We show that this seemingly subtle difference between having no expectation of further information versus knowing it will arrive can have operational consequences for the guessing task. Our results demonstrate that metainformation can, in certain scenarios, enhance the achievable success probability up to the point that post-measurement side information becomes as useful as prior-measurement side information, while in others it offers no benefit. By formally distinguishing metainformation from actual side information, we uncover a finer structure in the interplay between timing, information, and strategy, offering new insights into the capabilities of quantum systems in information processing tasks.

Title: Classical-quantum systems breaking conservation laws
Authors: Masahiro Hotta, Sebastian Murk, Daniel R. Terno
Abstract: Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system violates angular momentum conservation despite rotational symmetry of the underlying equations of motion. This provides an explicit example of a fully closed, rotationally invariant classical-quantum system with completely positive dynamics that violates a conservation law.

Title: SYK model based $β$ regime dependent two-qubit dynamical wormhole-inspired teleportation protocol simulation
Authors: Sudhanva Joshi, Sunil Kumar Mishra
Abstract: We implement the Wormhole-Inspired Teleportation Protocol (WITP) in a pair of coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models prepared in a thermofield-double state, forming a quantum analog of a traversable wormhole. By varying parameters (temperature, coupling strength, insertion site, and traversal time), we compare the teleportation fidelity against an analogous protocol using a transverse-field Ising model. We find that the chaotic SYK system consistently yields higher teleportation fidelity than the TFIM model, reflecting the SYK Hamiltonian's pronounced many-body chaos. These enhanced fidelities arise from the SYK's effectively random-matrix dynamics, which improve coherent information transfer through the wormhole channel. Unlike prior single-qubit benchmarks based on basis state inputs, the present work defines and evaluates a genuinely quantum-state fidelity for a maximally entangled two-qubit Bell input, using a Pauli-stabilizer formalism that captures entanglement-phase coherence. Our central result is achieved by teleporting a maximally entangled two-qubit Bell state through the wormhole. We introduce a Pauli-stabilizer fidelity measure for the two-qubit message and demonstrate that the Bell-state protocol produces a substantial fidelity boost compared to single-qubit teleportation. Furthermore, we examine the time-resolved fidelity for both single-qubit and two-qubit messages, revealing distinct fluctuation patterns that deepen the understanding of dynamical many-body teleportation processes. Finally, we present an argument that our Bell-state WITP simulations provide a concrete numerical testbed for aspects of the ER=EPR conjecture, by mapping entanglement structure and thermal/coupling dependence to traversability diagnostics in an emergent wormhole geometry.

Title: The Quantum Formalism Revisited
Authors: Hajo Leschke
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle confined to a straight line, I compile, initially in a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics and contrast them with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, resulting from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. The latter was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.

Title: Isoprobability Models of Qubit Dynamics: Demonstration via Time-Dependent Phase Control on IBM Quantum
Authors: Ivo S. Mihov, Nikolay V. Vitanov
Abstract: Efficient quantum control is a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum technologies, from computation to sensing and communications. Several approaches in quantum control, e.g. optimal control and inverse engineering, use pulse amplitude and frequency shaping as control tools. Often, these approaches prescribe pulse shapes which are difficult or impossible to implement. To this end, we develop the concept of isoprobability classes of models of qubit dynamics, in which various pairs of time-dependent pulse amplitude and frequency generate the same transition probability profile (albeit different temporal evolutions toward this probability). In this manner, we introduce an additional degree of freedom, and hence flexibility in qubit control. Selection of hardware-aware temporal pulse shapes has the potential to decrease gate duration, overcome platform constraints and increase robustness to noise. We demonstrate this approach with two classes of isoprobability models, which derive from the established Landau-Majorana-Stückelberg-Zener (LMSZ) and Allen-Eberly-Hioe (AEH) classes. We experimentally validate the isoprobability equivalence on an IBM Quantum processor, quantifying agreement with numerical simulations via the mean squared error (MSE). Instead of frequency (i.e. detuning) shaping, which is difficult to implement on this platform, we exploit the time-dependent phase of the driving field to induce an effective detuning. Indeed, the temporal derivative of the phase function emulates a variable detuning, thereby avoiding the need for direct detuning control. The experimental validation of the isoprobability concept with the time-dependent phase control underscores the potential of this robust and accessible method for high-fidelity quantum operations, bringing us one step closer to scalable quantum control in various quantum applications.

Title: Time Entangled Quantum Blockchain with Phase Encoding for Classical Data
Authors: Ruwanga Konara, Kasun De Zoysa, Anuradha Mahasinghe, Asanka Sayakkara, Nalin Ranasinghe
Abstract: With rapid advancements in quantum computing, it is widely believed that there will be quantum hardware capable of compromising classical cryptography and hence, the internet and the current information security infrastructure in the coming decade. This is mainly due to the operational realizations of quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, to which the current classical encryption protocols are vulnerable. Blockchains, i.e., blockchain data structures and their data, rely heavily on classical cryptography. One approach to secure blockchain is to attempt to achieve information theoretical security by defining blockchain on quantum technologies. There have been two conceptualizations of blockchains on quantum registers: the time-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph blockchain. On our part, an attempt is made to conceptualize a new quantum blockchain combining features of both these schemes to achieve the absolute security of the time-temporal GHZ blockchain and the scalability and efficiency of the quantum hypergraph blockchain in the proposed quantum blockchain protocol.

Title: Learning to Restore Heisenberg Limit in Noisy Quantum Sensing via Quantum Digital Twin
Authors: Hang Xu, Tailong Xiao, Jingzheng Huang, Jianping Fan, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: Quantum sensors leverage nonclassical resources to achieve sensing precision at the Heisenberg limit, surpassing the standard quantum limit attainable through classical strategies. However, a critical issue is that the environmental noise induces rapid decoherence, fundamentally limiting the realizability of the Heisenberg limit. In this Letter, we propose a quantum digital twin protocol to overcome this issue. The protocol first establishes observable-constrained state reconstruction to infer random errors in the decoherence process, and then utilizes reinforcement learning to derive adaptive compensatory control strategies. Demonstrated across discrete, continuous variable and multi-qubit circuit systems, our approach bypasses quantum state tomography's exponential overhead and discovers optimal control schemes to restore the Heisenberg limit. Unlike quantum error correction or mitigation schemes requiring precise noise characterization and ancillary qubits, our autonomous protocol achieves noise-resilient sensing through environment-adaptive control sequencing. This work establishes quantum digital twin as a generic methodology for quantum control, proposing a noise-immune paradigm for next-generation quantum sensors compatible with NISQ-era experimental constraints.

Title: Revisiting the Jaynes-Cummings model with time-dependent coupling
Authors: Thiago T. Tsutsui, Danilo Cius, Antonio Vidiella-Barranco, Antonio S. M. de Castro, Fabiano M. Andrade
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model stands as a fully quantized, fundamental framework for exploring light-matter interactions, a timely reflection on a century of quantum theory. The time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (TDJC) model introduces temporal variations in certain parameters, which often require numerical methods. However, under the resonance condition, exact solutions can be obtained, offering insight into a variety of physical scenarios. In this work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.

Title: Open system dynamics in local Lindbladians with chaotic spectra
Authors: Sanket Chirame, Fiona J. Burnell
Abstract: We investigate the physical consequences of having a spectrum that satisfies random matrix theory (RMT) for generic Lindbladians, and compare its implications for spatially local and completely random Lindblad dynamics in one spatial dimension. We find that Lindbladians whose spectrum is described by RMT exhibit quasi-universal early-time dynamics for quantities non-linear in the density matrix, in the sense that for generic, highly entangled initial states, the early time evolution is independent of the choice of initial state. We numerically investigate how locality generically imposes constraints on the size-dependence of Lindblad eigenoperators. This size dependence implies that linear observables, such as expectation values of local operators, are highly sensitive to eigenmodes outside the bulk of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit, and plays a central role in limiting operator growth in the presence of dissipation. We find that when single-site dissipation dominates, an operator's decoherence scales approximately linearly with its Pauli weight, even in the presence of 2-site jump operators. When two-site only dissipation dominates, however, this generic trend in operator size can be violated for numerically accessible system sizes, leading to long-lived high Pauli-weight operators.

Title: Achieving Utility-Scale Applications through Full Stack Co-Design of Fault Tolerant Quantum Computers
Authors: Katerina Gratsea, Matthew Otten
Abstract: Quantum computing promises revolutionary advances in modeling materials and molecules. However, the up-to-date runtime estimates for utility-scale applications on certain quantum hardware systems are in the order of years rendering quantum computations impractical. Our work incorporates state-of-the-art innovations in all key aspects of the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) stack to show how quantum computers could realistically and practically tackle CO$_2$ utilization for green energy production. We bring down the quantum computation runtime from 22 years to just 1 day, achieving a significant 7.9e03 reduction from previous state-of-the-art work. This reduction renders the quantum computation feasible, challenges state-of-the-art classical methods and results to a predicted run-time quantum advantage. We provide a rigorous analysis of how different innovations across the stack combine to provide such reductions. Our work provides strong evidence that all layers of FTQC are crucial in the quest for quantum advantage. Our analysis can be applied to related problems on FTQC and for any type of quantum architecture. Our methodology connects quantum algorithms to applications of positive real-world impact and leads to compelling evidence of achievable quantum advantage.

Title: Sample-Based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization for the Schwinger Model on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Quantum Processors
Authors: Emil Otis Rosanowski, Jurek Eisinger, Lena Funcke, Ulrich Poschinger, Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler
Abstract: We apply the recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method to lattice gauge theories, using the Schwinger model with a $\theta$-term as a benchmark. SKQD approximates the ground state of a Hamiltonian, employing a hybrid quantum-classical approach: (i) constructing a Krylov space from bitstrings sampled from time-evolved quantum states, and (ii) classically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian within this subspace. We study the dependence of the ground-state energy and particle number on the value of the $\theta$-term, accurately capturing the model's phase structure. The algorithm is implemented on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating consistent performance across platforms. We show that SKQD substantially reduces the effective Hilbert space, and although the Krylov space dimension still scales exponentially, the slower growth underscores its promise for simulating lattice gauge theories in larger volumes.

Title: Charge-state stability of single NV centers in HPHT-type IIa diamond
Authors: Darya Meniailava, Michael Petrov, Josef Soucek, Milos Nesladek
Abstract: This is a preliminary version. Improvements and additional analysis will be included in a revised manuscript. We investigate the charge-state stability of individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in weakly doped HPHT IIa diamond containing sub-ppm concentrations of boron and nitrogen. Using Ti/Al coplanar electrodes on an oxygen-terminated surface, we study how applied electric fields and optical excitation jointly govern NV charge conversion. By combining voltage-dependent photoluminescence, real-time charge-state monitoring, laser-power saturation with spectral decomposition, and time-resolved measurements, we reveal that electric fields several micrometers from the contacts significantly increase the NV- population and enhance spin readout. At low excitation powers, the NV- population evolves on minute timescales following compressed-exponential kinetics, consistent with slow space-charge rearrangement in ultra-insulating diamond. Under pulsed excitation, we observe hundreds-of-nanoseconds NV-/NV0 conversion driven by hole capture, which is strongly suppressed by applied bias. Our results demonstrate that residual boron acceptors play a key role in determining charge-state stability and show how electrical bias can reliably stabilize NV- in weakly doped bulk diamond.

Title: Generation of 10-dB squeezed light from a broadband waveguide optical parametric amplifier with improved phase locking method
Authors: Kazuki Hirota, Takahiro Kashiwazaki, Gyeongmin Ha, Taichi Yamashima, Pawaphat Jaturaphagorn, Takumi Suzuki, Kazuma Takahashi, Akito Kawasaki, Asuka Inoue, Warit Asavanant, Mamoru Endo, Takeshi Umeki, Akira Furusawa
Abstract: We report generation of 10.1\pm0.2-dB squeezed light from a broadband periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Based on our previous report where a similar PPLN waveguide shows 8.3-dB squeezing [T. Kashiwazaki et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 122, 234003 (2023)], we reduce phase fluctuations and overall optical losses in the measurement system. In particular, we introduce a novel phase detection technique that does not require tapping a part of the squeezed light to get a phase locking signal. We use a phase-detection OPA seeded by a tapped probe and pump light before a squeezer OPA. This configuration breaks the conventional trade-off between generating a phase-locking signal with high-signal-to-noise ratio and suppressing degradation of squeezing level caused by optical tapping. With all these improvements, the phase fluctuation angle is reduced from 14 mrad to 9 mrad, and the total optical loss from 12\% to 8\%. Achieving more than 10 dB of squeezing by the broadband waveguide OPA is a significant step towards realization of fault-tolerant ultra-fast universal optical quantum computation.

Title: Minimal ring extensions of the integers exhibiting Kochen-Specker contextuality
Authors: Ida Cortez, Camilo Morales, Manuel Reyes
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the algebraic study of contextuality in quantum theory. As an algebraic analogue of Kochen and Specker's no-hidden-variables result, we investigate rational subrings over which the partial ring of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices ($d \geq 3$) admits no morphism to a commutative ring, which we view as an "algebraic hidden state." For $d = 3$, the minimal such ring is shown to be $\mathbb{Z}[1/6]$, while for $d \geq 6$ the minimal subring is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself. The proofs rely on the construction of new sets of integer vectors in dimensions 3 and 6 that have no Kochen-Specker coloring.

Title: Dimensional Crossover in a Quantum Gas of Light
Authors: Kirankumar Karkihalli Umesh, Julian Schulz, Julian Schmitt, Martin Weitz, Georg von Freymann, Frank Vewinger
Abstract: The dimensionality of a system profoundly influences its physical behaviour, leading to the emergence of different states of matter in many-body quantum systems. In lower dimensions, fluctuations increase and lead to the suppression of long-range order. For example, in bosonic gases, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in one dimension requires stronger confinement than in two dimensions. We experimentally study the properties of a harmonically trapped photon gas undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation along the dimensional crossover from one to two dimensions. The photons are trapped in a dye microcavity where polymer nanostructures provide the trapping potential for the photon gas. By varying the aspect ratio of the harmonic trap, we tune from an isotropic two-dimensional confinement to an anisotropic, highly elongated one-dimensional trapping potential. Along this transition we determine the caloric properties of the photon gas and find a softening of the second-order Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition observed in two dimensions to a crossover behaviour in one dimension.

Title: Numerically efficient unitary evolution for Hamiltonians beyond nearest-neighbors
Authors: Alberto Giuseppe Catalano
Abstract: Matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are fundamental tools in the study of quantum many-body systems, particularly in the context of tensor network methods such as Time-Evolving Block Decimation (TEBD). However, constructing compact MPO representations for Hamiltonians with interactions beyond nearest-neighbors, such as those arising in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems or in systems with ring geometry, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the direct construction of compact MPOs tailored specifically for the exponential of spin Hamiltonians. This approach allows for a more efficient time evolution, using TEBD, of spin systems with interactions beyond nearest-neighbors, such as long-range spin-chains, periodic systems and more complex cluster model, with interactions involving more than two spins.

Title: Property-guided Inverse Design of Metal-Organic Frameworks Using Quantum Natural Language Processing
Authors: Shinyoung Kang, Jihan Kim
Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of using quantum natural language processing (QNLP) to inverse design metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with targeted properties. Specifically, by analyzing 450 hypothetical MOF structures consisting of 3 topologies, 10 metal nodes and 15 organic ligands, we categorize these structures into four distinct classes for pore volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant values. We then compare various QNLP models (i.e. the bag-of-words, DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical), and sequence-based models) to identify the most effective approach to process the MOF dataset. Using a classical simulator provided by the IBM Qiskit, the bag-of-words model is identified to be the optimum model, achieving validation accuracies of 88.6% and 78.0% for binary classification tasks on pore volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Further, we developed multi-class classification models tailored to the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits, with average test accuracies of 92% and 80% across different classes for pore volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant datasets. Finally, the performance of generating MOF with target properties showed accuracies of 93.5% for pore volume and 87% for $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Although our investigation covers only a fraction of the vast MOF search space, it marks a promising first step towards using quantum computing for materials design, offering a new perspective through which to explore the complex landscape of MOFs.

Title: Quantum Supercritical Crossover with Dynamical Singularity
Authors: Junsen Wang, Enze Lv, Xinyang Li, Yuliang Jin, Wei Li
Abstract: Bounded by crossover lines exhibiting universal scaling, the supercritical regime above the critical endpoint is characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercritical crossover to the quantum critical endpoint (QCEP), by studying the prototypical mixed-field quantum Ising and Potts models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities, near the QCEP. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is found, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is the so-called gap exponent of the QCEP. Moreover, we demonstrate that the QSC crossover line acts as a boundary for the emergence of dynamical singularities in quench dynamics. This singularity manifests as a distinctive cusp with a critical exponent of 1/2, signaling a new dynamical universality class. We also propose utilizing Rydberg atom arrays as an experimental platform to observe these QSC crossovers and dynamical singularities. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the role of QCEP and associated supercritical crossovers in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

Title: Long-Time Behavior of Typical Pure States from Thermal Equilibrium Ensembles
Authors: Cornelia Vogel
Abstract: We consider an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi_t$ evolving unitarily in a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and take for granted that different macro states $\nu$ correspond to mutually orthogonal subspaces $\mathcal{H}_\nu\subset\mathcal{H}$. Let $P_\nu$ be the projection to $\mathcal{H}_\nu$. It was recently shown that for all Hamiltonians with no highly degenerate eigenvalues and gaps most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}_\mu$ are such that for most $t\geq 0$, $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to a $t$- and $\psi_0$-independent value $M_{\mu\nu}$ provided that $M_{\mu\nu}$ is not too small. Here, ``most'' refers to the uniform distribution on the sphere $\mathbb{S}(\mathcal{H}_\mu)$. In the present work, we generalize this result from the uniform distribution, corresponding to the micro-canonical ensemble, to the much more general class of Gaussian adjusted projected (GAP) measures. For any density matrix $\rho$ on $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathrm{GAP}(\rho)$ is the most spread out distribution on $\mathbb{S}(\mathcal{H})$ with density matrix $\rho$. We show that also for $\mathrm{GAP}(\rho)$-most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$ for most $t\geq 0$, $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to a fixed value $M_{\rho P_\nu}$ (which must not be too small). Moreover, we prove a generalization for certain operators $B$ instead of $P_\nu$ and for finite times. Since certain GAP measures are quantum analogs of the (grand-)canonical ensemble, our result expresses a version of equivalence of ensembles.

Title: Anatomy of information scrambling and decoherence in the integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
Authors: Antonio M. García-García, Chang Liu, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot, Jie-ping Zheng
Abstract: The growth of information scrambling, captured by out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), is a central indicator of the nature of many-body quantum dynamics. Here, we compute analytically the complete time dependence of the OTOC for an integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ Majoranas with random two-body interactions of infinite range, coupled to a Markovian bath at finite temperature. In the limit of no coupling to the bath, the time evolution of scrambling experiences different stages. For $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$, after an initial polynomial growth, the OTOC approaches saturation in a power-law fashion with oscillations superimposed. At $t \sim \sqrt{N}$, the OTOC reverses trend and starts to decrease linearly in time. The reason for this linear decrease is that, despite being a subleading $1/N$ effect, the OTOC in this region is governed by the spectral form factor of the antisymmetric couplings of the SYK model. The linear decrease stops at $t \sim 2N$, the Heisenberg time, where saturation occurs. The effect of the environment is an overall exponential decay of the OTOC for times longer than the inverse of the coupling strength to the bath. The oscillations at $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$ indicate lack of thermalization -- a desired feature for a better performance of quantum information devices.

Title: Probing Sub-eV Dark Photon, Scalar and Axion-like Particle Dark Matters with Transmon Qubits
Authors: Wei Chao, Yu Gao, Ming-jie Jin, Xiao-sheng Liu, Xi-lei Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate constraints of the transmon qubit, an improved version of the charge qubit, on bosonic light dark matters. Phonon excitations induced by the scattering or absorption of dark matter on a superconductor may destroy the Cooper pair, leading to the production of quasiparticles made by the electron. By measuring the production rate of the quasiparticle density, one may read out the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter, assuming that these quasiparticles are solely induced by dark matter interactions. For the first time, we show constraints on the parameter space of the dark photon, light scalar dark matter, and axion-like particles from the measurement of quasiparticles in transmon qubit experiments. This study offers insights for the development of quantum qubit experiments aimed at the direct detection of dark matter in underground laboratories.

Title: On the Potential of Microtubules for Scalable Quantum Computation
Authors: Nick E. Mavromatos, Andreas Mershin, Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We examine the quantum coherence properties of tubulin heterodimers arranged into the protofilaments of cytoskeletal microtubules. In the physical model proposed by the authors, the microtubule interiors are treated as high-Q quantum electrodynamics (QED) cavities that can support decoherence-resistant entangled states under physiological conditions, with decoherence times of the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ sec. We identify strong electric dipole interactions between tubulin dimers and ordered water dipole quanta within the microtuble interior as the mechanism responsible for the extended coherence times. Classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\sigma$-models describing solitonic excitations are reinterpreted as emergent quantum-coherent-or possibly pointer-states, arising from incomplete collapse of dipole-aligned quantum states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer along microtubule filaments. We discuss logic-gate-like behavior facilitated by microtubule-associated proteins, and outline how such structures may enable scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage realized as a quDit encoded in the tubulin dipole state. We further describe a process akin to decision making that emerges following an external stimulus, whereby optimal, energy-loss-free signal and information transport pathways are selected across the microtubular network. Finally, we propose experimental approaches-including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes-to validate the use of biomatter as a substrate for scalable quantum computation.

Title: Experiment to test one of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics
Authors: Michel Gondran (AFBL), Alexandre Gondran (ENAC)
Abstract: For nearly 100 years, the incompleteness of quantum formalism and the probabilistic nature of measurement have been the subject of ongoing debate, with no interpretation achieving unanimous agreement. In double-slit interference experiments, standard quantum theory does not take particle size into account, which is not the case in de Broglie's double-solution theory. We use the large size of Rydberg atoms to propose an experiment to test the incompleteness of the standard quantum formalism. We present a variation on the double-slit experiment performed with Rydberg sodium atoms, in which a grating of very narrow slits is added between the two slits. Rydberg atoms are too big and cannot pass through the slits of the grating. We show with numerical simulations that the transmission densities in the standard interpretation and in the double-solution interpretation give very different results (a dark band appears in the center of the pattern). Experimental implementation now seems possible and would be a crucial test between these two interpretations.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 5.7%, achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.

Title: Overlapped-repetition Shor codes achieving fourfold asymptotic rate
Authors: En-Jui Chang
Abstract: Introducing controlled overlap among a few repetition blocks yields a fourfold asymptotic rate improvement while preserving an average stabilizer weight of \(4\). Substituting the overlapped outer layer with an LDPC code further produces a family of constructions with asymptotic rate \(2/d\). We also describe a constant-excitation variant that suppresses collective coherent errors without additional overhead, as well as a bosonic generalization that extends the framework to oscillator encodings. The resulting family achieves a code rate intermediate between that of the rotated surface code (average stabilizer weight \(4\)) and the BB code (average stabilizer weight \(6\)), while remaining free of the performance degradation typical of iterative decoders.

Title: Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions
Authors: Yucheng Wang
Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.
