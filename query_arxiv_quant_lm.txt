Title: Critically slow Hilbert-space ergodicity in quantum morphic drives
Authors: Saúl Pilatowsky-Cameo, Soonwon Choi, Wen Wei Ho
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle is foundational for statistical analyses of complex dynamics. This principle has been challenged by the findings of a previous work [Phys. Rev. X 7, 031034 (2017)], where it was argued that a quantum system driven in time by a certain aperiodic sequence without any explicit symmetries, dubbed the Thue-Morse drive, gives rise to emergent nonergodic steady states which are underpinned by effective conserved quantities. Here, we resolve this apparent tension. We rigorously prove that the Thue-Morse drive achieves a very strong notion of quantum ergodicity in the long-time limit: the time evolution of any initial state uniformly visits every corner of its Hilbert space. On the other hand, we find the dynamics also approximates a Floquet drive for arbitrarily long albeit finite periods of time with no characteristic timescale, resulting in a scale-free ergodic dynamics we call critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity (CS-CHSE). Furthermore, numerical studies reveal that CS-CHSE is not specific to the Thue-Morse drive and is in fact exhibited by many other aperiodic drives derived from morphic sequences, i.e., words derived from repeatedly applying substitution rules on basic characters. Our work presents a new class of dynamics in time-dependent quantum systems where full ergodicity is eventually attained, but only after astronomically long times.

Title: Computing Quantum Resources using Tensor Cross Interpolation
Authors: Sven Benjamin Kožić, Gianpaolo Torre
Abstract: Quantum information quantifiers are indispensable tools for analyzing strongly correlated systems. Consequently, developing efficient and robust numerical methods for their computation is crucial. We propose a general procedure based on the family of Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) algorithms to address this challenge in a fully general framework, independent of the system or the quantifier under consideration. To substantiate our approach, we compute the non-stabilizerness Rényi entropy (SRE) and Relative Entropy of Coherence (REC) considering the 1D and 2D ferromagnetic Ising models with minimal modifications to the numerical procedure. This method not only demonstrates its versatility, but also provides a generic framework for exploring other quantum information quantifiers in complex systems.

Title: Joint Cutting for Hybrid Schrödinger-Feynman Simulation of Quantum Circuits
Authors: Laura S. Herzog, Lukas Burgholzer, Christian Ufrecht, Daniel D. Scherer, Robert Wille
Abstract: Despite the continuous advancements in size and robustness of real quantum devices, reliable large-scale quantum computers are not yet available. Hence, classical simulation of quantum algorithms remains crucial for testing new methods and estimating quantum advantage. Pushing classical simulation methods to their limit is essential, particularly due to their inherent exponential complexity. Besides the established Schrödinger-style full statevector simulation, so-called Hybrid Schrödinger-Feynman (HSF) approaches have shown promise to make simulations more efficient. HSF simulation employs the idea of "cutting" the circuit into smaller parts, reducing their execution times. This, however, comes at the cost of an exponential overhead in the number of cuts. Inspired by the domain of Quantum Circuit Cutting, we propose an HSF simulation method based on the idea of "joint cutting" to significantly reduce the aforementioned overhead. This means that, prior to the cutting procedure, gates are collected into "blocks" and all gates in a block are jointly cut instead of individually. We investigate how the proposed refinement can help decrease simulation times and highlight the remaining challenges. Experimental evaluations show that "joint cutting" can outperform the standard HSF simulation by up to a factor $\approx 4000\times$ and the Schrödinger-style simulation by a factor $\approx 200\times$ for suitable instances. The implementation is available at this https URL.

Title: Vibrational parametric arrays with trapped ions: non-Hermitian topological phases and quantum sensing
Authors: Miguel Clavero-Rubio, Tomas Ramos, Diego Porras
Abstract: We consider a linear array of trapped ions subjected to local parametric modulation of the trapping potential and continuous laser cooling. In our model, the phase of the parametric modulation varies linearly along the array, breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing non-trivial topological effects. The linear response to an external force is investigated with the Green's function formalism. We predict the appearance of topological amplification regimes in which the trapped ion array behaves as a directional amplifier of vibrational excitations. The emergence of topological phases is determined by a winding number related to non-Hermitian point-gap topology. Beyond its fundamental interests as a topological driven-dissipative system, our setup can be used for quantum sensing of ultra-weak forces and electric fields. We consider a scheme in which a trapped ion at one edge of the array acts as a sensor of an ultra-weak force, and the vibrational signal gets amplified towards the last trapped ion, which acts as a detector. We consider arrays of 2-30 $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ions, assuming that the detector ion's displacement is measured via fluorescence with a spatial resolution of 200-500 nm, and predict sensitivities as small as 1 yN $\cdot$ Hz$^{-1/2}$. Our system has the advantage that the detected force frequency can be tuned by adjusting the frequency of the periodic drive.

Title: Fully optimised variational simulation of a dynamical quantum phase transition on a trapped-ion quantum computer
Authors: Lesley Gover, Vinul Wimalaweera, Fariha Azad, Matthew DeCross, Michael Foss-Feig, Andrew G. Green
Abstract: We time-evolve a translationally invariant quantum state on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum processor, studying the dynamical quantum phase transition of the transverse field Ising model. This physics requires a delicate cancellation of phases in the many-body wavefunction and presents a tough challenge for current quantum devices. We follow the dynamics using a quantum circuit matrix product state ansatz, optimised for the time-evolution using a fidelity cost function. Sampling costs are mitigated by using the measured values of this circuit as stochastic corrections to a simple classical extrapolation of the ansatz parameters. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of variational quantum time-evolution and reveal a hitherto hidden simplicity of the evolution of the transverse-field Ising model through the dynamical quantum phase transition.

Title: Detecting entanglement in any measurement using quantum networks
Authors: Shubhayan Sarkar
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource to demonstrate quantum advantage over classical strategies. Entanglement in quantum states is one of the most well-explored areas in quantum physics. However, a rigorous approach to understanding and detecting entanglement in composite quantum measurements is lacking. In this work, we focus on composite quantum measurements and classify them into two classes: entangled and separable measurements. As done for quantum states, we define analogously a notion of witness that can be used to detect entanglement in composite quantum measurements. Here, one does not need to trust the measurement to witness its entanglement but must trust the quantum states. We then further extend this approach to show that any entangled measurement provides an advantage in network quantum steering without inputs, also known as swap steering. Consequently, this provides a way to witness entanglement in any quantum measurement in a one-sided device-independent way. Finally, we consider the star network scenario and show that any rank-one projective entangled quantum measurement gives a quantum advantage. Thus, one can detect the entanglement in any rank-one projective measurement in a device-independent way.

Title: What Kind of Relationality does Quantum Mechanics Exhibit?
Authors: Emily Adlam
Abstract: In this article I elaborate on the approach to relational quantum mechanics suggested by Adlam and Rovelli (2023). I suggest that this approach fills an important gap in the spectrum of relational approaches, because it posits that the relational aspects of quantum mechanics are both inherent and dynamical. I compare this approach to Orthodox RQM, arguing that it has a number of advantages, and I show how some possible objections can be resolved.

Title: Quantum codes do not fix isotropic errors
Authors: Jesús García López de Lacalle, Luis Miguel Pozo Coronado, André L. Fonseca de Oliveira
Abstract: In this work we prove that quantum error correcting codes do not fix isotropic errors, even assuming that their correction circuits do not introduce new errors. We say that a quantum code does not fix a quantum computing error if its application does not reduce the variance of the error. We also prove for isotropic errors that, if the correction circuit of a quantum code detects an error, the corrected logical $m-$qubit has uniform distribution and as a result, it already loses all the computing information.

Title: Does Entanglement Correlation in Ground State Guarantee Quantum Energy Teleportation?
Authors: Taisanul Haque
Abstract: Although extraction of energy from the ground state is forbidden, one can utilize Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) protocol for energy extraction -- a two-step protocol involving quantum measurements followed by LOCC. This is an unique method to ``extract energy from ground states'' of quantum systems. QET requires some correlation in the ground state, and entanglement correlation plays a crucial roles as a resource. The general belief is that if the ground state is quantum-correlated via entanglement for two different sites in a quantum system, and if we perform measurements on one of the sites, we can find an LOCC for the other site to successfully accomplish QET. In this paper, we show that this belief may not be true in the case of the Toric Code. We demonstrate this by performing a PVM measurements on spins in the Toric Code. Based on the measurement outcomes, we found that there is no LOCC for successful QET.

Title: Computing Efficiently in QLDPC Codes
Authors: Alexander J. Malcolm, Andrew N. Glaudell, Patricio Fuentes, Daryus Chandra, Alexis Schotte, Colby DeLisle, Rafael Haenel, Amir Ebrahimi, Joschka Roffe, Armanda O. Quintavalle, Stefanie J. Beale, Nicholas R. Lee-Hone, Stephanie Simmons
Abstract: It is the prevailing belief that quantum error correcting techniques will be required to build a utility-scale quantum computer able to perform computations that are out of reach of classical computers. The QECCs that have been most extensively studied and therefore highly optimized, surface codes, are extremely resource intensive in terms of the number of physical qubits needed. A promising alternative, QLDPC codes, has been proposed more recently. These codes are much less resource intensive, requiring up to 10x fewer physical qubits per logical qubit than practical surface code implementations. A successful application of QLDPC codes would therefore drastically reduce the timeline to reaching quantum computers that can run algorithms with proven exponential speedups like Shor's algorithm and QPE. However to date QLDPC codes have been predominantly studied in the context of quantum memories; there has been no known method for implementing arbitrary logical Clifford operators in a QLDPC code proven efficient in terms of circuit depth. In combination with known methods for implementing T gates, an efficient implementation of the Clifford group unlocks resource-efficient universal quantum computation. In this paper, we introduce a new family of QLDPC codes that enable efficient compilation of the full Clifford group via transversal operations. Our construction executes any m-qubit Clifford operation in at most O(m) syndrome extraction rounds, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art lattice surgery methods. We run circuit-level simulations of depth-126 logical circuits to show that logical operations in our QLDPC codes attains near-memory performance. These results demonstrate that QLDPC codes are a viable means to reduce, by up to 10x, the resources required to implement all logical quantum algorithms, thereby unlocking a much reduced timeline to commercially valuable quantum computing.

Title: Effcient classical error correction for parity encoded spin systems
Authors: Yoshihiro Nambu
Abstract: Fast solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) have attracted engineering interest in various industrial and social applications. Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate and significant efforts have been dedicated to its development. Since COP is encoded in the Ising interaction between logical spins, its realization requires a spin system with all-to-all connectivity, which poses technical difficulties in the physical implementation of large-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed parity-encoding (PE) architecture, consisting of a larger system of physical spins with only local connectivities between them, to avoid this diffculty in the near future QA device development. They suggested that this architecture not only reduces implementation diffculties and improves scalability, but also has intrinsic fault tolerance because logical spins are redundantly and nonlocally encoded into the physical spins. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how these advantageous features can be exploited. This paper addresses how to correct errors in a spin readout of PE architecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture and classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We have shown that independent and identically distributed errors in a spin readout can be corrected by a very simple decoding algorithm that can be regarded as a bit flipping (BF) algorithm for the LDPC codes. The BF algorithm was shown to have comparable performance to the belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Furthermore, it is suggested that the introduction of post-readout BF decoding reduces the total computational cost and improves the performance of the global optimal solution search using the PE architecture. We believe that our results indicate that the PE architecture is a promising platform for near-term QA devices.

Title: Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states
Authors: Xin Wang, Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. While each phase follows its parallel-transport condition, we also consider the non-adiabatic IGP for arbitrary unitary evolution beyond parallel transport. For the $j=3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase shows temperature-induced topological phase transitions with jumps. The IGP and non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=3/2$ CSS also exhibits temperature-induced jumps. In contrast, the Uhlmann phase of the $j=1$ SSS exhibits smooth behavior without any temperature-induced transition. Interestingly, the parallel-transport condition of the IGP of the $j=1$ SSS in general does not allow a solution at finite temperature. Instead, the non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=1$ SSS has a solution showing smooth behavior as the squeezing parameter and temperature change. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications and simulations.

Title: Hybrid classical-quantum communication networks
Authors: Joseph M. Lukens, Nicholas A. Peters, Bing Qi
Abstract: Over the past several decades, the proliferation of global classical communication networks has transformed various facets of human society. Concurrently, quantum networking has emerged as a dynamic field of research, driven by its potential applications in distributed quantum computing, quantum sensor networks, and secure communications. This prompts a fundamental question: rather than constructing quantum networks from scratch, can we harness the widely available classical fiber-optic infrastructure to establish hybrid quantum-classical networks? This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of ongoing research endeavors aimed at integrating quantum communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution, into existing lightwave networks. This approach offers the substantial advantage of reducing implementation costs by allowing classical and quantum communication protocols to share optical fibers, communication hardware, and other network control resources, arguably the most pragmatic solution in the near term. In the long run, classical communication will also reap the rewards of innovative quantum communication technologies, such as quantum memories and repeaters. Accordingly, our vision for the future of the Internet is that of heterogeneous communication networks thoughtfully designed for the seamless support of both classical and quantum communications.

Title: Scrambling Enabled Entropy Accumulation in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Yuke Zhang, Zeyu Liu, Shuo Zhang, Langxuan Chen, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: In closed quantum many-body systems, initially localized information spreads throughout the system and becomes highly complex. This phenomenon, known as information scrambling, is closely related to entropy growth and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have shown that dissipation in open systems can hinder information scrambling, driving the system into a dissipative phase when the system-bath coupling is strong. However, the signature of this scrambling transition in entropy dynamics remains unexplored. In this work, we unveil a novel phenomenon in open quantum systems, termed entropy accumulation, which occurs exclusively within the scrambling phase. We consider a setup in which a probe is weakly coupled to a system that is already interacting with a bath. We calculate the increase in the second Rényi entropy induced by an external impulse on the system, after tracing out the probe. Despite the system-probe coupling being weak, the entropy continues to increase and eventually saturates at a finite value due to operator growth. In contrast, the entropy increase is limited by the coupling strength in the dissipative phase. The theoretical prediction is derived from both general arguments and an explicit example using generalized Boltzmann equations. Our results offer new insights into the intriguing relationship between entropy dynamics and information scrambling in open quantum systems.

Title: Entanglement and energy transportation in the central-spin quantum battery
Authors: Fan Liu, Hui-Yu Yang, Shuai-Li Wang, Jun-Zhong Wang, Kun Zhang, Xiao-Hui Wang
Abstract: Quantum battery exploits the principle of quantum mechanics to transport and store energy. We study the energy transportation of the central-spin quantum battery, which is composed of $N_b$ spins serving as the battery cells, and surrounded by $N_c$ spins serving as the charger cells. We apply the invariant subspace method to solve the dynamics of the central-spin battery with a large number of spins. We establish a universal inverse relationship between the battery capacity and the battery-charger entanglement, which persists in any size of the battery and charger cells. Moreover, we find that when $N_b=N_c$, the central-spin battery has the optimal energy transportation, corresponding to the minimal battery-charger entanglement. Surprisingly, the central-spin battery has a uniform energy transportation behaviors in certain battery-charger scales. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic relationship between the battery-charger size and the energy transportation efficiency, which may provide more insights on designing other types of quantum batteries.

Title: HAIL: An Efficient Iterative Algorithm for Qubit Mapping via Layer-Weight Assignment and Search Space Reduction
Authors: Kang Xu, Zeyang Li, Xinjian Liu, Dandan Li, Yukun Wang
Abstract: Current quantum devices only support interactions between physical qubits and a limited number of neighboring qubits, preventing quantum circuits from being executed directly on the devices. To execute the circuit, SWAP gates must be inserted to adjust the mapping relationships between qubits, which consequently increases runtime and error rates in quantum circuits. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HAIL, an efficient iterative qubit mapping algorithm to minimize additional SWAP gates. First, a layer-weight assignment method integrated with the subgraph isomorphism algorithm is introduced to establish an initial mapping. Next, we propose a SWAP sequence search combined with the post-processing function to identify the optimal SWAP sequences. Finally, the qubit mapping algorithm is refined through iterative forward and backward traversals to further reduce the number of SWAP gates. Experimental results on the IBM Q20 architecture and various benchmarks demonstrate that HAIL-3 reduces the number of additional gates inserted in the $\mathcal{B}_{23}$ by 20.62% compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, we present a partially extended strategy based on HAIL to reduce the sequence search space, with experiments on the sparsely connected Google Sycamore architecture showing a reduction in both algorithm runtime and additional SWAP gates.

Title: Estimation of Nonlinear Physical Quantities By Measuring Ancillas
Authors: Nhat A. Nghiem, Tzu-Chieh Wei
Abstract: In this article, we present quantum algorithms for estimating von Neumann entropy and Renyi entropy, which are crucial physical and information-theoretical properties of a given quantum state $\rho$. Although there have been existing works that achieved the same goal, some prior developments assume the unitary that prepares the purification to the target state $\rho$. Here, we consider an alternative setting where only copies of $\rho$ are given and construct a quantum algorithm that estimates the desired entropy. Our framework can complete the given task by measuring a small number of ancilla qubits without directly measuring the system, and that it achieves significant improvement over prior relevant developments. For example, for the Renyi entropy of the order of non-integral $\alpha$, our method achieves almost power-of-two improvement in sample complexity with respect to the rank of the given state and almost a power-of-two improvement in error tolerance compared with the work by Wang et al. [Phys. Rev. Applied 19, 044041 (2023)].

Authors: Giulia Salatino, Maximilian Matzler, Annarita Scocco, Procolo Lucignano, Gianluca Passarelli
Abstract: Diabatic quantum annealing aims to mitigate the challenges posed by small energy gaps and decoherence in quantum optimization by exploiting nonadiabatic transitions. In this paper, we compare the performance of two diabatic protocols in a realistic, dissipative setting using the maximum weighted independent set problem as a test case, showing that the potential advantages of diabatic protocols are strongly reduced in the presence of dissipation. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating quantum annealing strategies under practical conditions.

Title: Quantum State Tomography in a Third-Order Integrated Optical Parametric Oscillator
Authors: Roger Alfredo Kögler, Gabriel Couto Rickli, Renato Ribeiro Domeneguetti, Xingchen Ji, Alexander L. Gaeta, Michal Lipson, Marcelo Martinelli, Paulo Nussenzveig
Abstract: We measured the covariance matrix of the fields generated in an integrated third-order optical parametric oscillator operating above threshold. We observed up to $(2.3 \pm 0.3)$ dB of squeezing in amplitude difference, inferred $(4.9 \pm 0.7)$ dB of on-chip squeezing, while an excess of noise for the sum of conjugated quadratures hinders the entanglement. The degradation of amplitude correlations and state purity for the increasing of the pump power is consistent with the observed growth of the phase noise of the fields, showing the necessity of strategies for phase noise control aiming at entanglement generation in these systems.

Title: Kinetic inductance coupling for circuit QED with spins
Authors: S. Günzler, D. Rieger, M. Spiecker, T. Koch, G. A. Timco, R. E. P. Winpenny, I. M. Pop, W. Wernsdorfer
Abstract: In contrast to the commonly used qubit resonator transverse coupling via the $\sigma_{xy}$-degree of freedom, longitudinal coupling through $\sigma_z$ presents a tantalizing alternative: it does not hybridize the modes, eliminating Purcell decay, and it enables quantum-non-demolishing qubit readout independent of the qubit-resonator frequency detuning. Here, we demonstrate longitudinal coupling between a {Cr$_7$Ni} molecular spin qubit ensemble and the kinetic inductance of a granular aluminum superconducting microwave resonator. The inherent frequency-independence of this coupling allows for the utilization of a 7.8 GHz readout resonator to measure the full {Cr$_7$Ni} magnetization curve spanning 0-600 mT, corresponding to a spin frequency range of $f_\text{spin}=$0-15 GHz. For 2 GHz detuning from the readout resonator, we measure a $1/e$ spin relaxation time $\tau=$0.38 s, limited by phonon decay to the substrate. Based on these results, we propose a path towards longitudinal coupling of single spins to a superconducting fluxonium qubit.

Title: Quantum dynamics of a spin model with an extensive degeneracy
Authors: Krishanu Ghosh, Diptiman Sen, K. Sengupta
Abstract: We study the role played by extensive degeneracy in shaping the nature of the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional spin model for both ramp and periodic drive protocols. The model displays an extensive degenerate manifold of states for a specific value of one of the parameters of its Hamiltonian. We study a linear ramp which takes the spin model through this degenerate point and show that it leads to a deviation from the usual Kibble-Zurek behavior. We also study the Stückelberg oscillations in such a model for a ramp which passes twice through the degenerate point. Our study indicates that such oscillations are strongly suppressed leading to a distinct behavior compared to those arising from double passage through a quantum critical point. Finally, we study the periodic dynamics of the model and show, for a large drive amplitude, the existence of special drive frequencies at which the system exhibits an approximate emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. We study the effect of this emergent symmetry on the correlators of the driven system and demonstrate the existence of dynamic symmetry restoration at these frequencies. We study the fate of the emergent symmetry when the drive amplitude is decreased and discuss possible experiments to test our theory.

Title: Optical spin readout of a silicon color center in the telecom L-band
Authors: Shuyu Wen, Gregor Pieplow, Junchun Yang, Kambiz Jamshidi, Manfred Helm, Jun-Wei Luo, Tim Schröder, Shengqiang Zhou, Yonder Berencén
Abstract: Silicon-based quantum technologies have gained increasing attention due to their potential for large-scale photonic integration, long spin coherence times, and compatibility with CMOS fabrication. Efficient spin-photon interfaces are crucial for quantum networks, enabling entanglement distribution and information transfer over long distances. While several optically active quantum emitters in silicon have been investigated, no spin-active defect with optical transitions in the telecom L-band-a key wavelength range for low-loss fiber-based communication-has been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate the optical detection of spin states in the C center, a carbon-oxygen defect in silicon that exhibits a zero-phonon line at 1571 nm. By combining optical excitation with microwave driving, we achieve optically detected magnetic resonance, enabling spin-state readout via telecom-band optical transitions. These findings provide experimental validation of recent theoretical predictions and mark a significant step toward integrating spin-based quantum functionalities into silicon photonic platforms, paving the way for scalable quantum communication and memory applications in the telecom L-band.

Title: Unsupervised Feature Extraction and Reconstruction Using Parameterized Quantum Circuits
Authors: Li-An Lo, Li-Yi Hsu, En-Jui Kuo
Abstract: Autoencoders are fundamental tools in classical computing for unsupervised feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and generative learning. The Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), introduced by Romero J.[2017 Quantum Sci. Technol. 2 045001], extends this concept to quantum systems and has been primarily applied to tasks like anomaly detection. Despite its potential, QAE has not been extensively evaluated in basic classification tasks such as handwritten digit classification, which could provide deeper insights into its capabilities. In this work, we systematically investigate the performance of QAE in unsupervised feature extraction and reconstruction tasks. Using various encoder and decoder architectures, we explore QAE's ability to classify MNIST and analyze its reconstruction effectiveness. Notably, with a QCNN-based encoder, QAE achieves an average accuracy of 97.59% in binary classification of MNIST (0 and 1), demonstrating the feasibility of QAE for such tasks. This result highlights the synergy between QAE and QCNN in achieving optimal feature extraction performance. However, we also identify limitations in QAE's reconstruction capability, underscoring the need for further advancements in encoder and decoder designs. Our findings provide a foundation for future research on leveraging QAE in practical quantum machine learning applications.

Title: Interplay of resources for universal continuous-variable quantum computing
Authors: Varun Upreti, Ulysse Chabaud
Abstract: Quantum resource theories identify the features of quantum computers that provide their computational advantage over classical systems. We investigate the resources driving the complexity of classical simulation in the standard model of continuous-variable quantum computing, and their interplay enabling computational universality. Specifically, we uncover a new property in continuous-variable circuits, analogous to coherence in discrete-variable systems, termed symplectic coherence. Using quadrature propagation across multiple computational paths, we develop an efficient classical simulation algorithm for continuous-variable computations with low symplectic coherence. This establishes symplectic coherence as a necessary resource for universality in continuous-variable quantum computing, alongside non-Gaussianity and entanglement. Via the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill encoding, we show that the interplay of these three continuous-variable quantum resources mirrors the discrete-variable relationship between coherence, magic, and entanglement.

Authors: Eugenio Caruccio, Simone Roncallo, Valeria Cimini, Riccardo Albiero, Ciro Pentangelo, Francesco Ceccarelli, Giacomo Corrielli, Roberto Osellame, Nicolò Spagnolo, Lorenzo Maccone, Chiara Macchiavello, Fabio Sciarrino
Abstract: Traditional quantum metrology assesses precision using the figures of merit of continuous-valued parameter estimation. Recently, quantum digital estimation was introduced: it evaluates the performance information-theoretically by quantifying the number of significant bits of the parameter, redefining key benchmarks like the Heisenberg bound. Here, we report the first experimental realization of a Quantum Analog-to-Digital Converter for quantum metrology, that takes an input continuous parameter and outputs a bit string, using an advanced photonic platform, comprising a fully reconfigurable integrated circuit and a quantum dot source of highly indistinguishable photons. We implement a protocol for digital phase estimation that is capable of surpassing the standard quantum limit, through the simultaneous use of different entangled state resources. We tackle experimental imperfections by employing machine learning techniques for noise deconvolution and estimation process refinement. Our protocol is experimentally benchmarked against classical strategies via the number of recoverable bits of the unknown parameter. Our results open new perspectives for future implementation of quantum digital estimation strategies.

Title: Time-resolved second-order autocorrelation function of parametric downconversion
Authors: D. B. Horoshko, S. Srivastava, F. Sośnicki, M. Mikołajczyk, M. Karpiński, B. Brecht, M. I. Kolobov
Abstract: We study a possibility of measuring the time-resolved second-order autocorrelation function of one of two beams generated in type-II parametric downconversion by means of temporal magnification of this beam, bringing its correlation time from the picosecond to the nanosecond scale, which can be resolved by modern photodetectors. We show that such a measurement enables one to infer directly the degree of global coherence of that beam, which is linked by a simple relation to the number of modes characterizing the entanglement between the two generated beams. We illustrate the proposed method by an example of photon pairs generated in a periodically poled KTP crystal with a symmetric group velocity matching for various durations of the pump pulse, resulting in different numbers of modes. Our theoretical model also shows that the magnified double-heralded autocorrelation function of one beam exhibits a local maximum around zero delay time, corresponding to photon bunching at a short time scale.

Title: Materials and spin characteristics of amino-terminated nanodiamonds embedded with nitrogen-vacancy color centers
Authors: Nikoletta Jegenyes, Vladimir Verkhovlyuk, Szabolcs Czene, Attila Csáki, Olga Krafcsik, Zsolt Czigány, David Beke, Adam Gali
Abstract: Understanding and controlling fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with optically read qubits is a key focus of research, as they show high potential for detecting electric and magnetic fields, temperature, and other physico-chemical quantities at the nanoscale, which are highly sought after in chemistry and biology. Proper functionalization of FNDs is required for their application as probes in chemical and biological processes. However, modifying the surface of FNDs can affect the properties of qubit sensors. In this work, we thoroughly study the fundamental properties of embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers as a function of FND size and surface termination. The FNDs were produced by milling high-pressure, high-temperature diamonds, and NV centers were introduced via electron beam irradiation and annealing. In particular, the initial FNDs, covered with various oxygen groups, were homogenized through a reduction process to predominantly cover them with alcohol ($-$OH) groups as reference FNDs. Additionally, a Hofmann degradation process was applied to terminate FNDs with amine ($-$NH$_2$) groups, enabling direct linkage of proteins and other biomolecules to the FNDs. We monitored the charge state stability upon illumination, the zero-field splitting parameters, and the longitudinal spin-relaxation time of the NV centers in these FNDs. Our findings indicate that charge state stabilization of the NV centers was achieved in both $-$OH- and $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs beyond a certain FND size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs embedding NV centers exhibit a $T_1$ longitudinal relaxation time of approximately 25~$\mu$s, independent of FND size within the studied range of 10~nm to 140~nm. This relaxation time is comparable to that of larger-sized reference FNDs.

Title: Variational expressions and Uhlmann theorem for measured divergences
Authors: Kun Fang, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi
Abstract: We present a variational expression for measured $f$-divergences for convex functions $f$. Under a suitable operator convexity condition, this variational expression leads to a convex optimization problem recovering the known expression in the case of Rényi divergences. As an application, we establish an Uhlmann theorem for a wide class of measured $f$-divergences including measured $\alpha$-Rényi divergences for all $\alpha \geq 0$. The well-known Uhlmann theorem for the fidelity corresponds to the special case $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$.

Title: A proposal for charge basis tomography of superconducting qubits
Authors: Elena Lupo, Daniel Long, Daniel Dahan, Konstantin Yavilberg, Malcolm R. Connolly, Eytan Grosfeld, Eran Ginossar
Abstract: We introduce a general protocol for obtaining the charge basis density matrix of a superconducting quantum circuit. Inspired by cavity state tomography, our protocol combines Josephson-energy pulse sequences and projective charge-basis readout to access the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, a scheme we thus dub charge basis tomography. We simulate the reconstruction of the ground state of a target transmon using the Aharonov-Casher effect in a probe qubit to realise projective readout and show the Hilbert-Schmidt distance can detect deviations from the correct model Hamiltonian. Unlocking this ability to validate models using the ground state sets the stage for using transmons to detect interacting and topological phases, particularly in materials where time-domain and spectroscopic probes can be limited by intrinsic noise.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum technologies have opened new horizons for exploring the physical world in ways once deemed impossible. Central to these breakthroughs is the concept of quantum advantage, where quantum systems outperform their classical counterparts in solving specific tasks. While much attention has been devoted to computational speedups, quantum advantage in learning physical systems remains a largely untapped frontier. Here, we present a photonic implementation of a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning the probability distribution of a multimode bosonic displacement process. By harnessing the unique properties of continuous-variable quantum entanglement, we obtain a massive advantage in sample complexity with respect to conventional methods without entangled resources. With approximately 5 dB of two-mode squeezing -- corresponding to imperfect Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen (EPR) entanglement -- we learn a 100-mode bosonic displacement process using 11.8 orders of magnitude fewer samples than a conventional scheme. Our results demonstrate that even with non-ideal, noisy entanglement, a significant quantum advantage can be realized in continuous-variable quantum systems. This marks an important step towards practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols with implications for quantum metrology, certification, and machine learning.

Title: Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field
Authors: Edward Medina Guerra, Igor Gornyi, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.

Title: Quantum-driven Zero Trust Framework with Dynamic Anomaly Detection in 7G Technology: A Neural Network Approach
Authors: Shakil Ahmed, Ibne Farabi Shihab, Ashfaq Khokhar
Abstract: As cyber threats become more complex, modern networks struggle to balance security, scalability, and computational efficiency. While quantum computing offers a promising solution, adoption is limited by scalability constraints, inefficiencies in data encoding, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Neural Network-Enhanced Zero Trust Framework (QNN-ZTF), integrating Zero Trust Architecture, Intrusion Detection Systems, and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) for enhanced security. Leveraging superposition, entanglement, and variational optimization, QNN-ZTF enables real-time anomaly detection and adaptive policy enforcement. Key contributions include a hybrid quantum-classical architecture for scalability, dynamic anomaly scoring for improved detection accuracy, and quantum micro-segmentation to contain threats and restrict lateral movement. Evaluation results show improved cyber threat mitigation, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in reducing false positives and response times. This research establishes a scalable, adaptive, and quantum-optimized cybersecurity model, advancing quantum-enhanced security for next-generation networks.

Title: QuantumDNA: A Python Package for Analyzing Quantum Charge Dynamics in DNA and Exploring Its Biological Relevance
Authors: Dennis Herb, Marco Trenti, Marilena Mantela, Constantinos Simserides, Joachim Ankerhold, Mirko Rossini
Abstract: The study of DNA charge dynamics is a highly interdisciplinary field that bridges physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine, and plays a critical role in processes such as DNA damage detection, protein-DNA interactions, and DNA-based nanotechnology. However, despite significant advances in each of these areas, knowledge often remains inaccessible to other scientific communities, limiting the broader impact of advances across disciplines. To bridge this gap, we present QuantumDNA, an open-source Python package for simulating DNA charge transfer (CT) and excited states using quantum-physical methods. QuantumDNA combines an efficient Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) approach with tight-binding (TB) models, incorporating open quantum systems techniques to account for environmental effects. This approach allows rapid yet accurate analysis of large DNA ensembles, enabling statistical studies of genetic and epigenetic phenomena. To ensure accessibility, the package features a graphical user interface (GUI), making it suitable for researchers across disciplines.

Title: Piecemeal method revisited
Authors: Yi-Xin Shen, Zhou-Kai Cao, Jian Leng, Xiang-Bin Wang
Abstract: Detecting the angles and orbits of remote targets precisely has been playing crucial roles in astrophysical research. Due to the resolution limitations imposed by the Airy disk in a single telescope, optical interferometric schemes with at least two telescopes have received considerable attention. We have extended the piecemeal method to reduce the required number of baselines for observation. Through the analysis of its performance under practical conditions, we demonstrate that both the original and extended piecemeal methods exhibit strong robustness against errors in baseline lengths and orientations. Under the same practical conditions, our approach achieves higher precision than other existing weak-light interference-based methods.

Title: Hyper Compressed Fine-Tuning of Large Foundation Models with Quantum Inspired Adapters
Authors: Snehal Raj, Brian Coyle
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large foundation models for specific tasks has become increasingly challenging due to the computational and storage demands associated with full parameter updates. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue by updating only a small subset of model parameters using adapter modules. In this work, we propose \emph{Quantum-Inspired Adapters}, a PEFT approach inspired by Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits from quantum machine learning literature. These models can be both expressive and parameter-efficient by operating in a combinatorially large space while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in weight parameters. We test our proposed adapters by adapting large language models and large vision transformers on benchmark datasets. Our method can achieve 99.2\% of the performance of existing fine-tuning methods such LoRA with a 44x parameter compression on language understanding datasets like GLUE and VTAB. Compared to existing orthogonal fine-tuning methods such as OFT or BOFT, we achieve 98\% relative performance with 25x fewer parameters. This demonstrates competitive performance paired with a significant reduction in trainable parameters. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that Quantum-Inspired Adapters offer a promising direction for efficient adaptation of language and vision models in resource-constrained environments.

Title: Acceleration-induced radiation from a qudit particle detector model
Authors: Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura, Yuki Osawa, Yasusada Nambu
Abstract: We nonperturbatively examine the emission rate of acceleration-induced radiation from a uniformly accelerated gapless qudit-type Unruh-DeWitt detector. We find that the emission rate can be written as Larmor's formula multiplied by a factor that depends on the detector's initial state. In particular, certain initial states of integer-spin detectors do not produce radiation. Although the appearance of Larmor's formula may suggest a classical phenomenon, we argue that the resulting radiation is fundamentally distinct from that of structureless classical sources, as it evolves into a multimode coherent state correlated with the detector's internal degree of freedom. Thus, gapless detectors cannot be treated as structureless sources, as previously proposed.

Title: Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits
Authors: Abhikbrata Sarkar, Pratik Chowdhury, Xuedong Hu, Andre Saraiva, A. S. Dzurak, A. R. Hamilton, Rajib Rahman, S. Das Sarma, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.

Title: Spin dependent fluorescence mediated by anti-symmetric exchange in triplet exciton pairs
Authors: Yan Sun, M. Monteverde, V. Derkach, T. Chaneliere, E. Aldridge, J. E. Anthony, A.D. Chepelianskii
Abstract: Singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) are spin-dependent phenomena critical to optoelectronics. The dynamics of spin populations during geminate triplet pair separation are crucial for controlling fission and TTA rates. We show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) induces level crossings between spin manifolds, affecting spin populations and TTA rates in crystalline fission semiconductors. By investigating spin-dependent fluorescence in a triplet exciton pair with the magnetic field aligned along the fine structure tensor, we isolate the effect of DMI, as the triplet wavefunctions remain unaffected by the field. Our results reveal that DMI introduces additional TTA pathways that are forbidden by spin conservation, explaining the observed evolution of optically detected magnetic resonance signals with varying magnetic field. This study highlights the significant impact of DMI on the optical properties of triplet excitons, advancing our understanding of spin dynamics in these systems.

Title: Operation of a high-frequency, phase-slip qubit
Authors: Cheeranjeev Purmessur, Kaicheung Chow, Bernard van Heck, Angela Kou
Abstract: Aluminum-based Josephson junctions are currently the main sources of nonlinearity for control and manipulation of superconducting qubits. A phase-slip junction, the dual of a Josephson junction, provides an alternative source of nonlinearity that promises new types of protected qubits and the possibility of high-temperature and high-frequency operation through the use of superconductors with larger energy gaps. Phase-slip junctions have been challenging, however, to incorporate into superconducting qubits because of difficulty controlling junction parameters. Here we demonstrate the operation of a superconducting qubit based on a phase slip junction made using titanium nitride. We operate the qubit at zero flux where the qubit frequency (~17 GHz) is mainly determined by the inductance of the qubit. We perform readout and coherent control of the superconducting qubit, and measure qubit lifetimes >60 $\mu$s. Finally, we demonstrate operation of the qubit at temperatures exceeding 300 mK. Our results add the phase-slip junction as a tool for superconducting quantum information processing and opens avenues for new classes of superconducting qubits.

Title: Majorana quasiparticles in atomic spin chains on superconductors
Authors: Stephan Rachel, Roland Wiesendanger
Abstract: For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.

Title: Anisotropic resonance energy transfer with strained phosphorene
Authors: J. Oliveira-Cony, C. Farina, P. P. Abrantes, Tarik P. Cysne
Abstract: We analyze the resonance energy transfer (RET) rate between quantum emitters (QEs) near a phosphorene/SiC interface under the effects of uniaxial strain. Using a low-energy tight-binding model, we describe the electronic structure of strained phosphorene in an experimentally feasible situation. Due to the anisotropic electronic structure of phosphorene, we demonstrate that the RET rate drastically depends on the direction in which the QEs are separated relative to the phosphorene lattice. More specifically, we obtain a large variation in the RET rate when the QEs are separated along the zigzag direction, in contrast to a rather small variation when separated along the armchair direction of phosphorene's crystalline structure. Furthermore, our results reveal that the RET rate can be highly modulated by uniaxial strain in phosphorene when considering emitters placed along the zigzag direction. Finally, by means of a simple toy model, we also show that this anisotropy in the RET rate is a general characteristic produced by anisotropic 2D materials.

Title: Quantifying Quantumness in (A)dS spacetimes with Unruh-DeWitt Detector
Authors: Li-Juan Li, Xue-Ke Song, Liu Ye, Dong Wang
Abstract: Probing quantumness in curved spacetime is regarded as one of fundamental and important topics in the framework of relativistic quantum information. In this work, we focus on the theoretical feasibility of probing quantum properties in de Sitter (dS) and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes via detectors. By employing the Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled with a massless scalar field, which is treated as an open system, quantum uncertainty and quantum coherence in both dS and AdS spacetimes are investigated. Our analysis reveals that the acceleration in dS spacetime and the boundary conditions in AdS spacetime significantly impact the detector's evolution in the initial stage. Notably, both of the uncertainty and coherence will oscillate with the initial state being in a superposition state, however the high temperature is able to suppress their oscillation. Interestingly, it is found that the constant values of the final uncertainty and coherence are identical as those in dS and AdS spacetimes, which are determined by the ratio of energy gap to temperature. Hence, the current exploration offers insight into quantumness in dS and AdS spacetimes, and might be helpful to facilitate the curved-spacetime-based quantum information processing.

Title: Efficient First-Principles Framework for Overdamped Phonon Dynamics and Anharmonic Electron-Phonon Coupling in Superionic Materials
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Marios Zacharias, Xiao Zhang, Nick Pant, Jacky Even, Pierre F. P. Poudeu, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.

Title: Auxiliary dynamical mean-field approach for Anderson-Hubbard model with off-diagonal disorder
Authors: Zelei Zhang, Jiawei Yan, Li Huang, Youqi Ke
Abstract: This work reports a theoretical framework that combines the auxiliary coherent potential approximation (ACPA-DMFT) with dynamical mean-field theory to study strongly correlated and disordered electronic systems with both diagonal and off-diagonal disorders. In this method, by introducing an auxiliary coupling space with extended local degree of freedom,the diagonal and off-diagonal disorders are treated in a unified and self-consistent framework of coherent potential approximation, within which the dynamical mean-field theory is naturally combined to handle the strongly correlated Anderson-Hubbard model. By using this approach, we compute matsubara Green's functions for a simple cubic lattice at finite temperatures and derive impurity spectral functions through the maximum entropy method. Our results reveal the critical influence of off-diagonal disorder on Mott-type metal-insulator transitions. Specifically, a reentrant phenomenon is identified, where the system transitions between insulating and metallic states under varying interaction strengths. The ACPA-DMFT method provides an efficient and robust computational method for exploring the intricate interplay of disorder and strong correlations.

Title: Decay Rates of Optical Modes Unveil the Island Structures in Mixed Phase Space
Authors: Chang-Hwan Yi, Barbara Dietz, Jae-Ho Han, Jung-Wan Ryu
Abstract: We explore the decay rates of optical modes in asymmetric microcavities with mixed phase space across a wide range of wavelengths that extend deep into the semiclassical, i.e., short-wavelength limit. Implementing an efficient numerical method, we computed 1000000 eigenmodes and discovered that certain decay rates form sequential separate branches with increasing wavenumber that eventually merge into smooth curves. The analysis of the localization properties and Husimi distributions reveals that each branch corresponds to a periodic orbit in the closed classical system. Our findings show that these decay rates gradually resolve the structure of the islands in mixed phase space as we approach the short-wavelength limit. We present an effective semiclassical model incorporating wavenumber-dependent localization, Fresnel reflection, and the Goos-Haenchen shift and demonstrate that these effects are crucial in accounting for the observed branches of decay rate curves.

Title: Quantum Communication Advantage for Leader Election and Agreement
Authors: Fabien Dufoulon, Frédéric Magniez, Gopal Pandurangan
Abstract: This work focuses on understanding the quantum message complexity of two central problems in distributed computing, namely, leader election and agreement in synchronous message-passing communication networks. We show that quantum communication gives an advantage for both problems by presenting quantum distributed algorithms that significantly outperform their respective classical counterparts under various network topologies. While prior works have studied and analyzed quantum distributed algorithms in the context of (improving) round complexity, a key conceptual contribution of our work is positing a framework to design and analyze the message complexity of quantum distributed algorithms. We present and show how quantum algorithmic techniques such as Grover search, quantum counting, and quantum walks can make distributed algorithms significantly message-efficient. In particular, our leader election protocol for diameter-2 networks uses quantum walks to achieve the improved message complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such application of quantum walks in distributed computing.

Title: Testing spooky action between free-traveling electron-positron pairs
Authors: Leyun Gao, Alim Ruzi, Qite Li, Chen Zhou, Qiang Li
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. While the entanglement of confined electron pairs has been established early on, the entanglement of free-traveling electron pairs, particularly at high energies, remains largely unexplored due to the substantial challenges involved in measuring the spins of free-traveling electrons. In this study, we investigate the entanglement and the Bell inequality violation of free-traveling electron-positron pairs generated in a fixed-target experiment. This experimental setup facilitates the creation of a controllable source of entangled electron-positron pairs, where entangled events are produced in specific phase spaces. Based on this source and the prior knowledge of the entangled state, we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the polarization correlations of the entangled $e^+e^-$ pairs through their individual secondary scatterings off two separate additional targets.

Title: The impact of hole $g$-factor anisotropy on spin-photon entanglement generation with InGaAs quantum dots
Authors: P. R. Ramesh, E. Annoni, N. Margaria, D. A. Fioretto, A. Pishchagin, M. Morassi, A. Lemaître, M. F. Doty, P. Senellart, L. Lanco, N. Belabas, S. C. Wein, O. Krebs
Abstract: Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.

Title: Curved spacetimes from quantum mechanics
Authors: László B. Szabados
Abstract: The ultimate extension of Penrose's Spin Geometry Theorem is given. It is shown how the \emph{local} geometry of any \emph{curved} Lorentzian 4-manifold (with $C^2$ metric) can be derived in the classical limit using only the observables in the algebraic formulation of abstract Poincaré-invariant elementary quantum mechanical systems. In particular, for any point $q$ of the classical spacetime manifold and curvature tensor there, there exists a composite system built from finitely many Poincaré-invariant elementary quantum mechanical systems and a sequence of its states, defining the classical limit, such that, in this limit, the value of the distance observables in these states tends with asymptotically vanishing uncertainty to lengths of spacelike geodesic segments in a convex normal neighbourhood $U$ of $q$ that determine the components of the curvature tensor at $q$. Since the curvature at $q$ determines the metric on $U$ up to third order corrections, the metric structure of curved $C^2$ Lorentzian 4-manifolds is recovered from (or, alternatively, can be \emph{defined} by the observables of) abstract Poincaré-invariant quantum mechanical systems.

Title: Fock state probability changes in open quantum systems
Authors: Clare Burrage, Christian Käding
Abstract: Open quantum systems are powerful effective descriptions of quantum systems interacting with their environments. Studying changes of Fock states probabilities can be intricate in this context since the prevailing description of open quantum dynamics is by master equations of the systems' reduced density matrices, which usually requires finding solutions for a set of complicated coupled differential equations. In this article, we show that such problems can be circumvented by employing a recently developed path integral-based method for directly computing reduced density matrices in scalar quantum field theory. For this purpose, we consider a real scalar field $\phi$ as an open system interacting via a $\lambda \chi^2\phi^2$-term with an environment comprising another real scalar field $\chi$ that has a finite temperature. In particular, we investigate how the probabilities for observing the vacuum or two-particle states change over time if there were initial correlations of these Fock states. Subsequently, we apply our resulting expressions to a neutrino toy model. We show that, within our model, lighter neutrino masses would lead to a stronger distortion of the observable number of particles due to the interaction with the environment after the initial production process.

Title: Tomographic Signatures of Interacting Majorana and Andreev States in Superconductor-Semiconductor Transmon Qubits
Authors: Daniel Dahan, Konstantin Yavilberg, Talya Shnaider, Elena Lupo, Malcolm R. Connolly, Eran Ginossar, Eytan Grosfeld
Abstract: Semiconductor-based Josephson junctions embedded within a Cooper-pair-box can host complex many-body states, such as interacting Andreev states and potentially other quasi-particles of topological origin. Here, we study the insights that could be revealed from a tomographic reconstruction of the Cooper-pair charge distribution of the junction prepared in its ground state. We posit that interacting and topological states can be identified from distinct signatures within the probability distribution of the charge states. Furthermore, the comprehensive dataset provides direct access to information theory metrics elucidating the entanglement between the charge sector of the superconductor and the microscopic degrees of freedom in the junction. We demonstrate how these metrics serve to further classify differences between the types of excitations in the junction.

Title: On the distinction between beables and qualia
Authors: Adam Brownstein
Abstract: The link between the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation and the hard problem of consciousness is investigated. We highlight that beables of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation are not themselves qualia, but are intimately related to qualia. It is then argued that qualia are necessary for the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, and conversely the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation (or similar theories) are necessary for qualia. Therefore, there is a reflexive two-way relationship between the beables of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation and qualia such that they support the existence of each other. By using this reflexive argument, the hard problem of consciousness can be addressed via an indirect route.

Authors: Miqueas Gamero, Agustin Lapi, Blas Irigoyen Gimenez, Fernando Chierchie, Guillermo Fernandez Moroni, Brenda Cervantes-Vergara, Javier Tiffenberg, Juan Estrada, Eduardo Paolini, Gustavo Cancelo
Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of the Skipper-CCD, a sensor with single-electron counting capability, as a promising technology for implementing an electron-pump-based current source. Relying on its single-electron resolution and built-in charge sensing, it allows self-calibration of the charge packets. This article presents an initial discussion of how low ppm and high current realizations can be achieved with this technology. We report experimental results that illustrate the key functionalities in manipulating both small and large electron charge packets, including a comparison of the charge generated, self-measured, and drained by the sensor against measurements from an electrometer. These results were obtained using a standard sensor and readout electronics without specific optimizations for this application. The objective is to explore the potential of Skipper-CCD for realizing an electron-based current source.

Title: Degeneracy-breaking and Long-lived Multimode Microwave Electromechanical Systems Enabled by Cubic Silicon-Carbide Membrane Crystals
Authors: Yulong Liu, Huanying Sun, Qichun Liu, Haihua Wu, Mika A. Sillanpää, Tiefu Li
Abstract: Cubic silicon-carbide crystals (3C-SiC), known for their high thermal conductivity and in-plane stress, hold significant promise for the development of high-quality ($Q$) mechanical oscillators. We reveal degeneracy-breaking phenomena in 3C-phase crystalline silicon-carbide membrane and present high-$Q$ mechanical modes in pairs or clusters. The 3C-SiC material demonstrates excellent microwave compatibility with superconducting circuits. Thus, we can establish a coherent electromechanical interface, enabling precise control over 21 high-$Q$ mechanical modes from a single 3C-SiC square membrane. Benefiting from extremely high mechanical frequency stability, this interface enables tunable light slowing with group delays extending up to an impressive duration of \emph{an hour}. Coherent energy transfer between distinct mechanical modes are also presented. In this work, the studied 3C-SiC membrane crystal with their significant properties of multiple acoustic modes and high-quality factors, provide unique opportunities for the encoding, storage, and transmission of quantum information via bosonic phonon channels.

Title: Non-Markovian Dynamics in Fiber Delay-line Buffers
Authors: Kim Fook Lee, Prem Kumar
Abstract: We study the non-Markovian effect on a two-photon polarization entangled state, in which one photon from the pair is stored in a fiber delay-line buffer. We propose a model of a photonic qubit coupled to fiber birefringence and a fiber reservoir representing the environment. We analytically derive a non-Markovian probability function for the buffered photon and its paired photon. To verify the probability function, we perform full quantum state tomography of the photon pairs. The probability function fits well with the experimental data and physical values. Our results indicate that our quantum system operates slightly above the threshold for a non-Markovian transition. We observe a unique polarization dynamic of the buffered photon. We further exploit measures of quantum mutual information to study the quantumness of the photon pairs. Werner's well-known separability criterion occurs at a buffer time of about 0.9$\,$ms. Our results imply that quantum discord can surpass Werner's criterion, and hence, quantum bi-partite correlation can exist for buffer times greater than 0.9$\,$ms.

Title: Enhanced detection of time-dependent dielectric structure: Rayleigh's limit and quantum vacuum
Authors: Vanik E. Mkrtchian, Hakob S. Avetisyan, Armen E. Allahverdyan
Abstract: Detection of scattered light can determine the susceptibility of dielectrics. Such imaging normally holds Rayleigh's limit: details finer than the wavelength of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field zone. We show that time-modulation of an inhomogeneous dielectric can be used to determine its susceptibility. To this end, we focus on the inverse quantum optics problem for spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose dielectric susceptibility is similar to moving dielectrics. We show that the vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative frequencies even in the far-field zone. Hence, certain dielectric features can be determined without radiating any incident field on the dielectric. When the incident light is scattered (or re-radiated), the determination of dielectric susceptibility is enhanced and overcomes Rayleigh's limit in the far-field zone. We study similar effects for an inhomogeneous dielectric moving with a constant speed, a problem we consider within relativistic optics. Now the vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal reflects dielectric features, can be long-range in space but is not a far-field effect.

Title: Slow Light Augmented Unbalanced Interferometry for Extreme Enhancement in Sensitivity of Measuring Frequency Shift in a Laser
Authors: Ruoxi Zhu, Zifan Zhou, Jinyang Li, Jason Bonacum, David D. Smith, Selim M. Shahriar
Abstract: We demonstrate a slow-light augmented unbalanced Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) which can be used to enhance very significantly the sensitivity of measuring the frequency shift in a laser. The degree of enhancement depends on the group index of the slow-light medium, the degree of imbalance between the physical lengths of the two arms of the MZI, and the spectral width of the laser. For a laser based on a high-finesse cavity, yielding a narrow quantum noise limited spectral width, the group index has to be larger than the finesse in order to achieve enhancement in measurement sensitivity. For the reported results, strong slow-light effect is produced by employing electro-magnetically induced transparency via coherent population trapping in a buffer-gas loaded vapor cell of Rb atoms, with a maximum group index of ~1759. The observed enhancement in sensitivity for a range of group indices agrees well with the theoretical model. The maximum sensitivity enhancement factor realized is ~560; much larger values can be obtained by using cold atoms for producing the slow-light effect. The sensitivity of any sensor that relies on measuring the frequency shift of a laser can be enhanced substantially using this technique. These include, but are not limited to, gyroscopes and accelerometers based on a conventional ring laser or a superluminal ring laser, and detectors for virialized ultra-light field dark matter.

Title: Revealing hidden physical nonclassicality with nonnegative polynomials
Authors: Ties-A. Ohst, Benjamin Yadin, Birte Ostermann, Timo de Wolff, Otfried Gühne, Hai-Chau Nguyen
Abstract: Understanding quantum phenomena which go beyond classical concepts is a focus of modern quantum physics. Here, we show how the theory of nonnegative polynomials emerging around Hilbert's 17th problem, can be used to optimally exploit data capturing the nonclassical nature of light. Specifically, we show that nonnegative polynomials can reveal nonclassicality in data even when it is hidden from standard detection methods up to now. Moreover, the abstract language of nonnegative polynomials also leads to a unified mathematical approach to nonclassicality for light and spin systems, allowing us to map methods for one to the other. Conversely, the physical problems arising also inspire several mathematical insights into characterisation of nonnegative polynomials.

Title: Universal time scalings of sensitivity in Markovian quantum metrology
Authors: Arpan Das, Wojciech Gorecki, Rafal Demkowicz-Dobrzanski
Abstract: Assuming Markovian time evolution of a quantum sensing system, we study the general characterization of the optimal sensitivity scalings with time, under most general quantum control protocols. We allow the estimated parameter to influence both the Hamiltonian as well as the dissipative part of the quantum master equation and focus on the asymptotic-time along with the short-time sensitivity scalings. We find that via simple algebraic conditions (in terms of the Hamiltonian, the jump operators as well as their parameter derivatives), one can characterize the four classes of metrological models that represent: quadratic-linear, quadratic-quadratic, linear-linear and linear-quadratic time scalings. We also investigate the relevant time scales on which the transition between the two regimes appears. Additionally, we provide universal numerical methods to obtain quantitative bounds on sensitivity that are the tightest that exist in the literature. Simplicity and universality of our results make it suitable for diverse applications in quantum metrology.

Title: Hybrid Tree Tensor Networks for quantum simulation
Authors: Julian Schuhmacher, Marco Ballarin, Alberto Baiardi, Giuseppe Magnifico, Francesco Tacchino, Simone Montangero, Ivano Tavernelli
Abstract: Hybrid Tensor Networks (hTN) offer a promising solution for encoding variational quantum states beyond the capabilities of efficient classical methods or noisy quantum computers alone. However, their practical usefulness and many operational aspects of hTN-based algorithms, like the optimization of hTNs, the generalization of standard contraction rules to an hybrid setting, and the design of application-oriented architectures have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm to perform ground state optimizations with hybrid Tree Tensor Networks (hTTNs), discussing its advantages and roadblocks, and identifying a set of promising applications. We benchmark our approach on two paradigmatic models, namely the Ising model at the critical point and the Toric code Hamiltonian. In both cases, we successfully demonstrate that hTTNs can improve upon classical equivalents with equal bond dimension in the classical part.

Title: Simulating electronic structure on bosonic quantum computers
Authors: Rishab Dutta, Nam P. Vu, Chuzhi Xu, Delmar G. A. Cabral, Ningyi Lyu, Alexander V. Soudackov, Xiaohan Dan, Haote Li, Chen Wang, Victor S. Batista
Abstract: Quantum harmonic oscillators, or qumodes, provide a promising and versatile framework for quantum computing. Unlike qubits, which are limited to two discrete levels, qumodes have an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, making them well-suited for a wide range of quantum simulations. In this work, we focus on the molecular electronic structure problem. We propose an approach to map the electronic Hamiltonian into a qumode bosonic problem that can be solved on bosonic quantum devices using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach is demonstrated through the computation of ground potential energy surfaces for benchmark model systems, including H$_2$ and the linear H$_4$ molecule. The preparation of trial qumode states and the computation of expectation values leverage universal ansatzes based on the echoed conditional displacement (ECD), or the selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) operations. These techniques are compatible with circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms, where microwave resonators coupled to superconducting transmon qubits can offer an efficient hardware realization. This work establishes a new pathway for simulating many-fermion systems, highlighting the potential of hybrid qubit-qumode quantum devices in advancing quantum computational chemistry.

Title: Inverse Current in Coupled Transport: A Quantum Thermodynamic Framework for Energy and Spin-polarized Particle Currents
Authors: Shuvadip Ghosh, Nikhil Gupt, Arnab Ghosh
Abstract: The phenomenon of inverse current in coupled transport (ICC), where one induced current flows counter to two parallel thermodynamic forces, represents a strikingly counterintuitive behavior in transport processes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 11607 (2020)]. Through an exactly solvable model of strongly coupled quantum dots, we provide a quantum thermodynamic framework to describe ICC in energy and spin-polarized particle currents, highlighting its potential applications for unconventional and autonomous nanoscale thermoelectric engines and refrigerators. Our analysis establishes a link between the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of the entropy production rate, emphasizing the crucial role of thermodynamic forces and their conjugate fluxes in accurately characterizing genuine ICC. Here, the paradoxical behavior of ICC emerges from the symmetry breaking between particle and energy transitions, identified as the sufficient condition, while the attractive interaction between the coupled quantum dots is determined to be the necessary criterion for the ICC effect.

Title: Information capacity of quantum communication under natural physical assumptions
Authors: Jef Pauwels, Stefano Pironio, Armin Tavakoli
Abstract: The quantum prepare-and-measure scenario has been studied under various physical assumptions on the emitted states. Here, we first discuss how different assumptions are conceptually and formally related. We then identify one that can serve as a relaxation of all others, corresponding to a limitation on the one-shot accessible information of the state ensemble. This motivates us to study the optimal state discrimination probability of a source subject to these various physical assumptions. We derive general and tight bounds for states restricted by their quantum dimension, their vacuum component, an arbitrary uniform overlap, the magnitude of higher-dimensional signals and the experimenter's trust in their device. Our results constitute a first step towards a more unified picture of semi-device-independent quantum information processing.

Title: Memory-corrected quantum repeaters with adaptive syndrome identification
Authors: Alena Romanova, Peter van Loock
Abstract: We address the challenge of incorporating encoded quantum memories into an exact secret key rate analysis for small and intermediate-scale quantum repeaters. To this end, we introduce the check matrix model and quantify the resilience of stabilizer codes of up to eleven qubits against Pauli noise, obtaining analytical expressions for effective logical error probabilities. Generally, we find that the five-qubit and Steane codes either outperform more complex, larger codes in the experimentally relevant parameter regimes or have a lower resource overhead. Subsequently, we apply our results to calculate lower bounds on the asymptotic secret key rate in memory-corrected quantum repeaters when using the five-qubit or Steane codes on the memory qubits. The five-qubit code drastically increases the effective memory coherence time, reducing a phase flip probability of $1\%$ to $0.001\%$ when employing an error syndrome identification adapted to the quantum noise channel. Furthermore, it mitigates the impact of faulty Bell state measurements and imperfect state preparation, lowering the minimally required depolarization parameter for non-zero secret key rates in an eight-segment repeater from $98.4\%$ to $96.4\%$. As a result, the memory-corrected quantum repeater can often generate secret keys in experimental parameter regimes where the unencoded repeater fails to produce a secret key. In an eight-segment repeater, one can even achieve non-vanishing secret key rates up to distances of 2000 km for memory coherence times of $t_c = 10$ s or less using multiplexing. Assuming a zero-distance link-coupling efficiency $p_0 = 0.7$, a depolarization parameter $\mu = 0.99$, $t_c = 10$ s, and an 800 km total repeater length, we obtain a secret key rate of 4.85 Hz, beating both the unencoded repeater that provides 1.25 Hz and ideal twin-field quantum key distribution with 0.71 Hz at GHz clock rates.

Title: Consistency and Causality of Interconnected Nonsignaling Resources
Authors: Peter Bierhorst
Abstract: This paper examines networks of $n$ measuring parties sharing $m$ nonsignaling resources that can be locally wired together: that is, each party follows a scheme to measure the resources in a cascaded fashion with inputs to later resources possibly depending on outputs of earlier-measured ones. A specific framework is provided for studying probability distributions arising in such networks, and this framework is used to directly prove some accepted, but often only implicitly invoked, facts: there is a uniquely determined and well-defined joint probability distribution for the outputs of all resources shared by the parties, and this joint distribution is nonsignaling. It is furthermore shown that is often sufficient to restrict consideration to only extremal nonsignaling resources when considering features and properties of such networks. Finally, the framework illustrates how the physical theory of nonsignaling boxes and local wirings is causal, supporting the applicability of the inflation technique to constrain such models. For an application, we probe the example of (3,2,2) inequalities that witness genuine three-party nonlocality according to the local-operations-shared-randomness definition, and show how all other examples can be derived from that of Mao et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129:150401 (2022)]

Title: Multitype entanglement dynamics induced by exceptional points
Authors: Zigeng Li, Xinyao Huang, Hongyan Zhu, Guofeng Zhang, Fan Wang, Xiaolan Zhong
Abstract: As a most important feature of non-Hermitian systems, exceptional points (EPs) lead to a variety of unconventional phenomena and applications. Here, we study a generic model composed of two coupled non-Hermitian qubits, the EPs can be easily obtained in this system by adjusting the driving amplitude applied to the qubits. The diverse entanglement dynamics on the two sides of the original fourth-order EP (EP4') and second order EP (EP2) can be observed simultaneously in the weak coupling regime. With the increase of the coupling strength, the EP4' is replaced by an additional EP2, leading to the disappearance of the entanglement dynamics changing induced by EP4' in the strong coupling regime. Considering the case of Ising type interaction, we also realize EP-induced entanglement dynamics changing without the driving field. Our study paves the way for the investigation of EP-induced quantum effects and applications of EP-related quantum technologies.

Title: Topological transitions in quantum jump dynamics: Hidden exceptional points
Authors: Andrei I. Pavlov, Yuval Gefen, Alexander Shnirman
Abstract: Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.

Title: Simulating a quasiparticle on a quantum device
Authors: Rimika Jaiswal, Izabella Lovas, Leon Balents
Abstract: We propose a variational approach to explore quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems, motivated by the potential in leveraging near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum devices for quantum state preparation. By exploiting translation invariance and potentially other abelian symmetries of the many-body Hamiltonian, we extend the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach to construct spatially localized quasiparticle states that encode information on the whole excited band, allowing us to achieve quantum parallelism. We benchmark the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations performed on the one-dimension transverse field Ising chain. We show that VQE can capture both the magnon quasiparticles of the paramagnetic phase, and the topologically non-trivial domain wall excitations in the ferromagnetic regime. We show that the localized quasiparticle states constructed with VQE contain accessible information on the full band of quasiparticles, and provide valuable insight into the way interactions renormalize the bare spin flip or domain wall excitations of the simple, trivially solvable limits of the model. These results serve as important theoretical input towards utilizing quantum simulators to directly access the quasiparticles of strongly interacting quantum systems, as well as to gain insight into crucial experimentally measured properties directly determined by the nature of these quasiparticles.

Title: Digital quantum simulation of cosmological particle creation with IBM quantum computers
Authors: Marco Díaz Maceda, Carlos Sabín
Abstract: We use digital quantum computing to simulate the creation of particles in a dynamic spacetime. We consider a system consisting of a minimally coupled massive quantum scalar field in a spacetime undergoing homogeneous and isotropic expansion, transitioning from one stationary state to another through a brief inflationary period. We simulate two vibration modes, positive and negative for a given field momentum, by devising a quantum circuit that implements the time evolution. With this circuit, we study the number of particles created after the universe expands at a given rate, both by simulating the circuit and by actual experimental implementation on IBM quantum computers, consisting of hundreds of quantum gates. We find that state-of-the-art error mitigation techniques are useful to improve the estimation of the number of particles and the fidelity of the state.

Title: Error mitigation and circuit division for early fault-tolerant quantum phase estimation
Authors: Alicja Dutkiewicz, Stefano Polla, Maximilian Scheurer, Christian Gogolin, William J. Huggins, Thomas E. O'Brien
Abstract: As fully fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of solving useful problems remain a distant goal, we anticipate an era of "early fault tolerance" where limited error correction is available. We propose a framework for designing early fault-tolerant algorithms by trading between error correction overhead and residual logical noise, and apply it to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We develop a quantum-Fourier-transform (QFT)-based QPE technique that is robust to global depolarising noise and outperforms the previous state of the art at low and moderate noise rates. We further introduce the Explicitly Unbiased Maximum Likelihood Estimation (EUMLE), a data processing technique that mitigates arbitrary errors in QFT-based QPE schemes. EUMLE provides consistent, asymptotically normal error-mitigated estimates, addressing the open problem of extending error mitigation beyond expectation value estimation. Applying this scheme to the ground state problem of the two-dimensional Hubbard model and various molecular Hamiltonians, we find we can roughly halve the number of physical qubits with a $\sim 10\times$ wall-clock time overhead, but further reduction causes a steep runtime increase. This work provides an end-to-end analysis of early fault-tolerance cost reductions and space-time trade-offs, and identifies which areas can be improved in the future.

Title: Intrinsic mixed state topological order in a stabilizer system under stochastic decoherence: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking from percolation point of view
Authors: Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Discovering quantum orders in mixed many-body systems is an ongoing issue. Very recently, the notion of an intrinsic mixed state topologically-ordered (IMTO) state was proposed. As a concrete example, we observe the emergence of IMTO by studying the toric code system under stochastic maximal decoherence by $ZX$-diagonal type projective measurement without monitoring. We study how the toric code state changes to an IMTO state at the level of the averaged quantum trajectories. This phase transition is understood from the viewpoint of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 1-form weak symmetry, that is, the IMTO is characterized by the symmetry restoration from the SSB, which comes from the proliferation of anyons. To understand the emergent IMTO, order and disorder parameters of 1-form symmetry are numerically studied by stabilizer simulation. The present study clarifies the existence of two distinct microscopic string operators for the fermionic anyons, that leads to distinct fermionic strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and also the obtained critical exponents indicate strong relation between IMTO and percolation.

Title: High-impedance resonators for strong coupling to an electron on helium
Authors: G. Koolstra, E. O. Glen, N. R. Beysengulov, H. Byeon, K. E. Castoria, M. Sammon, B. Dizdar, C. S. Wang, D. I. Schuster, S. A. Lyon, J. Pollanen, D. G. Rees
Abstract: The in-plane motion of an electron on helium can couple to superconducting microwave resonators via electrical dipole coupling, offering a robust and rapid readout scheme. In previous efforts, microwave resonator designs for electrons on helium have lacked the coupling strength to reach the strong coupling regime, where coherent quantum effects outlast both electron and resonator decoherence rates. High-impedance superconducting microwave resonators offer a path to strong coupling, but integrating such resonators with electrons on helium remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a high-impedance resonator design compatible with strong coupling to electrons on helium. We fabricate and measure titanium nitride resonators with median internal quality factors of $3.9\times 10^5$ and average impedance of 2.5 k$\Omega$, promising a seven-fold increase in coupling strength compared with standard 50$\Omega$ resonators. Additionally, we develop a simplified resonator model from the capacitance matrix and sheet inductance that accurately predicts the mode frequencies, significantly simplifying the design process of future resonators for investigating quantum effects with electrons on helium.

Title: Space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems
Authors: François Le Gall, Yupan Liu, Harumichi Nishimura, Qisheng Wang
Abstract: We introduce two models of space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems, ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. The ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ model, a space-bounded variant of quantum interactive proofs (${\sf QIP}$) introduced by Watrous (CC 2003) and Kitaev and Watrous (STOC 2000), restricts verifier actions to unitary circuits. In contrast, ${\sf QIPL}$ allows logarithmically many pinching intermediate measurements per verifier action, making it the weakest model that encompasses the classical model of Condon and Ladner (JCSS 1995). We characterize the computational power of ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. When the message number $m$ is polynomially bounded, ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L} \subsetneq {\sf QIPL}$ unless ${\sf P} = {\sf NP}$: - ${\sf QIPL}$ contains ${\sf NP}$ and is contained in ${\sf SBP}$, which is a subclass of ${\sf AM}$. - ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ is contained in ${\sf P}$ and contains ${\sf SAC}^1 \cup {\sf BQL}$, where ${\sf SAC}^1$ denotes problems solvable by classical logarithmic-depth, semi-unbounded fan-in circuits. However, this distinction vanishes when $m$ is constant. Our results further indicate that (pinching) intermediate measurements uniquely impact space-bounded quantum interactive proofs, unlike in space-bounded quantum computation, where ${\sf BQL}={\sf BQ_{\rm U}L}$. We also introduce space-bounded unitary quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L}$), a specific form of ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ proof systems with statistical zero-knowledge against any verifier. This class is a space-bounded variant of quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK}$) defined by Watrous (SICOMP 2009). We prove that ${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L} = {\sf BQL}$, implying that the statistical zero-knowledge property negates the computational advantage typically gained from the interaction.

Title: Genuine tripartite entanglement in graviton-matter interactions
Authors: Pablo Guillermo Carmona Rufo, Anupam Mazumdar, Carlos Sabín
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in a quantum gravitational system formed by a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a single frequency of a quantized gravitational wave. For this purpose, we introduce a new entanglement witness, well-suited for the graviton-matter interaction Hamiltonian analysed here. We show that the witness is non-zero for the three-mode states generated by the Hamiltonian when the system starts in the ground state, thus proving the generation of genuine multipartite quantum entanglement at the most fundamental level of theoretical graviton-matter interactions.

Title: String Breaking in the Heavy Quark Limit with Scalable Circuits
Authors: Anthony N. Ciavarella
Abstract: Quantum simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories require efficient mappings onto quantum computers and practical state preparation and measurement procedures. A truncation of the Hilbert space of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter in the heavy quark limit is developed. This truncation is applied to $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1D$ to map the theory efficiently onto a quantum computer. Scalable variational circuits are found to prepare the vacuum and single meson states. It is also shown how these state preparation circuits can be used to perform measurements of the number of mesons produced during the system's time evolution. A state with a single $q\overline{q}$ pair is prepared on quantum hardware and the inelastic production of $q\overline{q}$ pairs is observed using $104$ qubits on IBM's Heron quantum computer ibm_torino.

Title: On some states minimizing uncertainty relations: A new look at these relations
Authors: Krzysztof Urbanowski
Abstract: Analyzing Heisenberg--Robertson (HR) and Schrödinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist a large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non--commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. The correlation function for these observables in such states is equal to zero. We have also shown that the so--called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states. We additionally show that the uncertainty principle in its most general form has two faces: one is that it is a lower bound on the product of standard deviations, and the other is that the product of standard deviations is an upper bound on the modulus of the correlation function of a pair of the non--commuting observables in the state under consideration.

Title: Simulating Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics on NISQ Computers Using the Hierarchical Equations of Motion
Authors: Xiaohan Dan, Eitan Geva, Victor S. Batista
Abstract: Quantum computing offers promising new avenues for tackling the long-standing challenge of simulating the quantum dynamics of complex chemical systems, particularly open quantum systems coupled to external baths. However, simulating such non-unitary dynamics on quantum computers is challenging since quantum circuits are specifically designed to carry out unitary transformations. Furthermore, chemical systems are often strongly coupled to the surrounding environment, rendering the dynamics non-Markovian and beyond the scope of Markovian quantum master equations like Lindblad or Redfield. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm designed to simulate non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. Our approach enables the implementation of arbitrary quantum master equations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We illustrate the method as applied in conjunction with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method. The effectiveness of the resulting quantum HEOM algorithm is demonstrated as applied to simulations of the non-Lindbladian electronic energy and charge transfer dynamics in models of the carotenoid-porphyrin-\ce{C60} molecular triad dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.

Title: Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits
Authors: Chaohui Fan, Xiangjian Qian, Hua-Chen Zhang, Rui-Zhen Huang, Mingpu Qin, Tao Xiang
Abstract: Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum states with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, the Clifford circuits augmented matrix product states (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of the CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the optimized disentanglers correspond to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For the critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, i.e., the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of the XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of the framework as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.

Title: Coherent deflection of atomic samples and positional mesoscopic superpositions
Authors: L. F. Alves da Silva, L. M. R. Rocha, M. H. Y. Moussa
Abstract: We present a protocol based on the interplay between superradiance and superabsorption to achieve the coherent deflection of an atomic sample due to the momentum transfer from the atoms to a cavity field. The coherent character of this momentum transfer, causing the atomic sample to deflect as a whole, follows from the collective nature of the atomic superradiant pulse and its superabsorption by the cavity field. The protocol is then used for the construction of positional mesoscopic atomic superpositions.

Title: Learning Equivariant Maps with Variational Quantum Circuits
Authors: Zachary P. Bradshaw, Ethan N. Evans, Matthew Cook, Margarite L. LaBorde
Abstract: Geometric quantum machine learning uses the symmetries inherent in data to design tailored machine learning tasks with reduced search space dimension. The field has been well-studied recently in an effort to avoid barren plateau issues while improving the accuracy of quantum machine learning models. This work explores the related problem of learning an equivariant map given two unitary representations of a finite group, which in turn allows the symmetric embedding of the data to be learned rather than simply required. Moreover, this procedure allows the learning of covariant quantum channels, which are an essential tool in quantum information theory. We demonstrate the feasibility of this task and give examples to illustrate the procedure.

Title: GroverGPT: A Large Language Model with 8 Billion Parameters for Quantum Searching
Authors: Haoran Wang, Pingzhi Li, Min Chen, Jinglei Cheng, Junyu Liu, Tianlong Chen
Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting non-Von Neumann paradigm, offering provable speedups over classical computing for specific problems. However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability. This work suggests task-specific LLMs can surpass general-purpose models like GPT-4o in quantum algorithm learning and serve as powerful tools for advancing quantum research.

Title: On Measures in Ion Trap Quantum Information
Authors: Reza Pirmoradian, M Reza Tanhayi
Abstract: In this study, we investigate quantum information measures in ion traps by utilizing the harmonic oscillator model to characterize trapped potentials and ion dynamics. Our findings confirm that, in the steady-state case, mutual information and synchronization measures exhibit similar behaviors. Additionally, we explore how these measures change in the quench model and how they are influenced by coupling and external noise, such as an external magnetic field. Moreover, for a proposed target ground state, we determine the circuit depth and analyze the effects of the external magnetic field and coupling constant, highlighting their dynamic evolution over time. We also discuss the coherent state of a single ion in a trap, noting an inverse relationship between complexity and fidelity-where increased fidelity corresponds to decreased system complexity, indicating a more ordered state with improved control and optimization. However, at higher system frequencies, complexity increases due to intricate interactions and rapid state changes, necessitating advanced control mechanisms.

Title: Exact Floquet solutions in a Parity-Time-Symmetric Rabi Model
Authors: M. Baradaran, D. Braak, L.M. Nieto, S. Zarrinkamar
Abstract: It is shown that a semiclassical Rabi model with parity-time (PT) symmetry has a hidden $sl(2)$ symmetry and hence possesses quasi-exact solutions. These are located precisely at the exceptional points of the spectrum, the boundaries of the PT-symmetric phase. The corresponding constraints on the model parameters can be interpreted as a resonance relationship between the constant and periodic driving terms.

Title: On Exact Space-Depth Trade-Offs in Multi-Controlled Toffoli Decomposition
Authors: Suman Dutta, Siyi Wang, Anubhab Baksi, Anupam Chattopadhyay, Subhamoy Maitra
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the optimized implementation of Multi Controlled Toffoli (MCT) using the Clifford $+$ T gate sets. While there are several recent works in this direction, here we explicitly quantify the trade-off (with concrete formulae) between the Toffoli depth (this means the depth using the classical 2-controlled Toffoli) of the $n$-controlled Toffoli (hereform we will tell $n$-MCT) and the number of clean ancilla qubits. Additionally, we achieve a reduced Toffoli depth (and consequently, T-depth), which is an extension of the technique introduced by Khattar et al. (2024). In terms of a negative result, we first show that using such conditionally clean ancilla techniques, Toffoli depth can never achieve exactly $\ceil{\log_2 n}$, though it remains of the same order. This highlights the limitation of the techniques exploiting conditionally clean ancilla [Nie et al., 2024, Khattar et al., 2024]. Then we prove that, in a more general setup, the T-Depth in the Clifford + T decomposition, via Toffoli gates, is lower bounded by $\ceil{\log_2 n}$, and this bound is achieved following the complete binary tree structure. Since the ($2$-controlled) Toffoli gate can further be decomposed using Clifford $+$ T, various methodologies are explored too in this regard for trade-off related implications.

Title: Directly imaging spin polarons in a kinetically frustrated Hubbard system
Authors: Max L. Prichard, Benjamin M. Spar, Ivan Morera, Eugene Demler, Zoe Z. Yan, Waseem S. Bakr
Abstract: The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular lattice moiré materials.

Title: Complete Upper Bound Hierarchies for Spectral Minimum in Noncommutative Polynomial Optimization
Authors: Igor Klep, Victor Magron, Jurij Volčič
Abstract: This work focuses on finding the spectral minimum (ground state energy) of a noncommutative polynomial subject to a finite number of noncommutative polynomial constraints. Based on the Helton-McCullough Positivstellensatz, the Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy is the noncommutative analog of Lasserre's moment-sum of squares hierarchy and provides a sequence of lower bounds converging to the spectral minimum, under mild assumptions on the constraint set. Each lower bound can be obtained by solving a semidefinite program. This paper derives complementary complete hierarchies of upper bounds for the spectral minimum. They are noncommutative analogues of the upper bound hierarchies due to Lasserre for minimizing commutative polynomials over compact sets. Each upper bound is obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. The derived hierarchies apply to optimization problems in bounded and unbounded operator algebras, as demonstrated on a variety of examples.

Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a unital completely positive (UCP) map on the space of operators on some Hilbert space. We assume that $\Phi$ is $\eta$-idempotent, namely, $\|\Phi^2-\Phi\|_{\mathrm{cb}} \le\eta$, and construct an associated $\varepsilon$-$C^*$ algebra (of almost-invariant observables) for $\varepsilon=O(\eta)$. This type of structure has the axioms of a unital $C^*$ algebra but the associativity and other axioms involving the multiplication and the unit hold up to $\varepsilon$. We prove that any finite-dimensional $\varepsilon$-$C^*$ algebra $A$ is $O(\varepsilon)$-isomorphic to some genuine $C^*$ algebra $B$. These bounds are universal, i.e. do not depend on the dimensionality or other parameters. When $A$ comes from a finite-dimensional $\eta$-idempotent UCP map $\Phi$, the $O(\eta)$-isomorphism and its inverse can be realized by UCP maps. This gives an approximate factorization of the quantum channel $\Phi^*$ into a decoding channel, producing a state on $B$, and an encoding channel.

Title: Phenomenology of many-body localization in bond-disordered spin chains
Authors: Adith Sai Aramthottil, Piotr Sierant, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) hinders the thermalization of quantum many-body systems in the presence of strong disorder. In this work, we study the MBL regime in bond-disordered spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain, finding the multimodal distribution of entanglement entropy in eigenstates, sub-Poissonian level statistics, and revealing a relation between operators and initial states required for examining the breakdown of thermalization in the time evolution of the system. We employ a real space renormalization group scheme to identify these phenomenological features of the MBL regime that extend beyond the standard picture of local integrals of motion relevant for systems with disorder coupled to on-site operators. Our results pave the way for experimental probing of MBL in bond-disordered spin chains.

Title: Majorana qubit readout by a point-contact detector under finite bias voltages
Authors: Huizi Xie, Sirui Yu, Hong Mao, Jinshuang Jin
Abstract: In this work we revisit the problem of a Majorana box qubit (MBQ) readout by a point-contact (PC) detector. The logic states of the MBQ are associated with the combined fermion parities of the MBQ and its tunnel-coupled quantum dot, which is measured by a PC detector. Beyond the existing studies on limiting bias voltage regimes, we analyze the steady-state current and the current power spectrum across all bias voltages. Our results indicate that the MBQ readout via the parity-dependent detector current is effective only at low bias voltage regime and requires the dot energy level to be off-resonance with the Majorana qubit. In contrast, the current power spectrum allows MBQ readout through the parity-dependent Rabi oscillation peak signals for arbitrary bias voltages, without restrictions on the dot energy level. Particularly, with focus on the MBQ measurement visibility, we analyze the peak-to-pedestal ratio for each characteristic peak (associated with each logic state of the qubit) and the signal-to-noise ratio of the two peaks. By examining these two metrics, we identify the optimal bias voltage window for the PC detector at low temperature limit.

Title: Broadband light extraction from near-surface NV centers using crystalline-silicon antennas

Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~17 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~9 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.

Authors: Tian Chen, Weixuan Zhang, Deyuan Zou, Yifan Sun, Xiangdong Zhang
Abstract: Based on the correspondence between circuit Laplacian and Schrodinger equation, recent investigations have shown that classical electric circuits can be used to simulate various topological physics and the Schrodinger's equation. Furthermore, a series of quantum-inspired information processing have been implemented by using classical electric circuit networks. In this review, we begin by analyzing the similarity between circuit Laplacian and lattice Hamiltonian, introducing topological physics based on classical circuits. Subsequently, we provide reviews of the research progress in quantum-inspired information processing based on the electric circuit, including discussions of topological quantum computing with classical circuits, quantum walk based on classical circuits, quantum combinational logics based on classical circuits, electric-circuit realization of fast quantum search, implementing unitary transforms and so on.

Title: Deep in the Knotted Black Hole
Authors: Massimiliano Spadafora, Manar Naeem, María R. Preciado-Rivas, Robert B. Mann, Jorma Louko
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector, coupled linearly to a massless scalar quantum field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, as a probe of the interior of a black hole. Specifically, we consider the transition rate of a detector in the spinless Bañados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole as it freely falls toward and across the horizon and compare it to the corresponding situation for an $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon. Both the BTZ black hole and its geon counterpart are quotients of $\text{AdS}_3$ spacetime that are identical exterior to the horizon but have different interior topologies. We find outside the horizon that the rates are qualitatively similar, but with the amplitude in the geon spacetime larger than in the BTZ case. Once the detector crosses the horizon, there are notable distinctions characterized by different discontinuities in the temporal derivative of the response rate. These discontinuities can appear outside the horizon if the detector is switched on at a sufficiently early time, within the past white hole horizon. In general, the detector can act as an `early warning system' that both spots the black hole horizon and discerns its interior topology.

Title: SFFT-Based Homogenization: Using Tensor Trains to Enhance FFT-Based Homogenization
Authors: Sascha H. Hauck, Matthias Kabel, Mazen Ali, Nicolas R. Gauger
Abstract: Homogenization is a fundamental technique for estimating the macroscopic properties of materials with microscale heterogeneity. Among Homogenization methods, the FFT-based Homogenization algorithm has become widely used due to its computational efficiency and ability to handle complex microstructures. Nevertheless, even with GPU acceleration, FFT-based Homogenization for industrial applications remains excessively time-consuming, particularly when generating elastic training data for AI models. This is due to the curse of dimensionality, which arises from the algorithms reliance on the Fast Fourier Transform, creating a fundamental bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired SFFT-based Homogenization algorithm that leverages the improved time complexity of a Tensor Train variant of the Quantum Fourier Transform. By additionally exploiting structural properties of the underlying microstructure, our method achieves exponential improvements in time complexity and memory efficiency compared to the traditional FFT-based technique - all while remaining executable on classical hardware. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm across increasingly complex microstructures, demonstrating its potential advantages and limitations.

Title: Open transmission channels in multimode fiber cavities with random mode mixing
Authors: Guy Pelc, Shay Guterman, Rodrigo Gutiérrez-Cuevas, Arthur Goetschy, Sébastien M. Popoff, Yaron Bromberg
Abstract: The transport of light in disordered media is governed by open transmission channels, which enable nearly complete transmission of the incident power, despite low average transmission. Extensively studied in diffusive media and chaotic cavities, open channels exhibit unique properties such as universal spatial structure and extended dwell times. However, their experimental study is challenging due to the large number of modes required for control and measurement. We propose a multimode fiber cavity (MMFC) as a platform to explore open channels. Leveraging mode confinement and finite angular spread, MMFCs enable a full control over all channels. This allowed us to achieve an 18-fold power enhancement by selectively exciting an open channel with a transmission rate of $0.90 \pm 0.04$. By analyzing 100 transmission matrices of MMFC realizations, we observed a bimodal transmission eigenvalue distribution, indicating high channel control and low losses. The scalability of MMFCs, combined with long dwell times and potential for nonlinear phenomena, offers new opportunities for studying complex wave transport.
