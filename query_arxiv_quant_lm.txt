Title: Simple Quantum Algorithm for Approximate $k$-Mismatch Problem
Authors: Ruhan Habib
Abstract: In the $k$-mismatch problem, given a pattern and a text of length $n$ and $m$ respectively, we have to find if the text has a sub-string with a Hamming distance of at most $k$ from the pattern. This has been studied in the classical setting since 1982 and recently in the quantum computational setting by Jin and Nogler and Kociumaka, Nogler, and Wellnitz. We provide a simple quantum algorithm that solves the problem in an approximate manner, given a parameter $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$. It returns an occurrence as a match only if it is a $\left(1+\epsilon\right)k$-mismatch. If it does not return any occurrence, then there is no $k$-mismatch. This algorithm has a time (size) complexity of $\tilde{O}\left( \epsilon^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{mn}{k}} \right)$.

Title: Probability distributions over CSS codes: two-universality, QKD hashing, collision bounds, security
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We characterize novel probability distributions for CSS codes. Such classes of error correcting codes, originally introduced by Calderbank, Shor, and Steane, are of great significance in advancing the fidelity of Quantum computation, with implications for future near term applications. Within the context of Quantum key distribution, such codes, as examined by Ostrev in arXiv: 2109.06709 along with two-universal hashing protocols, have greatly simplified Quantum phases of computation for unconditional security. To further examine novel applications of two-universal hashing protocols, particularly through the structure of parity check matrices, we demonstrate how being able to efficiently compute functions of the parity check matrices relates to marginals of a suitably defined probability measure supported over random matrices. The security of the two-universal QKD hashing protocol will be shown to depend upon the computation of purified states of random matrices, which relates to probabilistic collision bounds between two hashing functions. Central to our approach are the introduction of novel real, simulator, and ideal, isometries, hence allowing for efficient computations of functions of the two parity check matrices. As a result of being able to perform such computations involving parity check matrices, the security of the two-universal hashing protocol is a factor of $2^{ \frac{5}{2} ( 5 - \frac{3}{2} ) + \mathrm{log}_2 \sqrt{C}}$ less secure, for some strictly positive constant $C$.

Title: Comment on Marek Czachor article entitled "On Relativity of Quantumness as Implied by Relativity of Arithmetic and Probability"
Authors: Krzysztof Sienicki, Mikołaj Sienicki
Abstract: Czachor's model of hierarchical arithmetics begins with a valid formal premise but fixes the key probability mapping g by importing the Born rule and Fubini-Study metric from standard quantum mechanics, where Born probabilities are Kolmogorov within a fixed measurement context. This g is then applied in a non-Newtonian hidden-variable setting, producing a hybrid framework whose agreement with quantum correlations is built in by design, not derived from new physics, and thus does not constitute a genuine counterexample to Bell's theorem

Title: Utility-Scale Quantum State Preparation: Classical Training using Pauli Path Simulation
Authors: Cheng-Ju Lin, Hrant Gharibyan, Vincent P. Su
Abstract: We use Pauli Path simulation to variationally obtain parametrized circuits for preparing ground states of various quantum many-body Hamiltonians. These include the quantum Ising model in one dimension, in two dimensions on square and heavy-hex lattices, and the Kitaev honeycomb model, all at system sizes of one hundred qubits or more, beyond the reach of exact state-vector simulation, thereby reaching utility scale. We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation. We achieve a relative energy error of approximately $5\%$ without error mitigation and demonstrate the braiding of Abelian anyons on the quantum device beyond fixed-point models.

Title: Mitigating the barren plateau problem in linear optics
Authors: Matthew D. Horner
Abstract: We demonstrate a significant speedup of variational quantum algorithms that use discrete variable boson sampling when the parametrised phase shifters are constrained to have two distinct eigenvalues. This results in a cost landscape with less local minima and barren plateaus regardless of the problem, ansatz or circuit layout. This works without reliance on any classical pre-processing and allows for the fast gradient-free Rotosolve algorithm to be used. We propose three ways to achieve this by using either non-linear optics, measurement-induced non-linearities, or entangled resource states simulating fermionic statistics. The latter two require linear optics only, allowing for implementation with widely-available technology today. We show this outperforms the best-known boson sampling variational algorithm for all tests we conducted.

Title: Characterizing Superconducting Qubits using Averaged Circuit Eigenvalue Sampling
Authors: Tauno Palomaki, Shu Xin Wu, Noah Huffman, Samuel D. Park, James Shackford, Ben DalFavero, Leigh Norris, Ryan Sitler, Paraj Titum, Kevin Schultz
Abstract: Efficient characterization of noise during quantum gate operations is an essential step to building and scaling up a quantum computer. One such protocol is averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES) which efficiently characterizes a noisy gate set by reconstructing a Pauli noise model for a each gate. Here we utilize the ACES protocol to characterize two coupled superconducting qubits. For accurate reconstruction, we tailor the noise via Pauli twirling and account for measurement errors. We verify the accuracy of the protocol by comparing the predicted gate fidelities to that extracted from conventional benchmarking approaches, such as interleaved randomized benchmarking. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of ACES in accurately identifying specific noise sources by reconstructing injected phase errors in the two-qubit gates.

Title: Computational access to lattice and long-wavelength physics in quantum mutual information
Authors: Patrick M. Lenggenhager, M. Michael Denner, Doruk Efe Gökmen, Maciej Koch-Janusz, Titus Neupert, Mark H. Fischer
Abstract: Quantum mutual information is an important tool for characterizing correlations in quantum many-body systems, but its numerical evaluation is often prohibitively expensive. While some variants of Rényi Mutual Information (RMI) are computationally more tractable, it is not clear whether they correctly capture the long-wavelength physics or are dominated by UV effects, which is of key importance in lattice simulations. We analyze the relevance of lattice effects on the family of $\alpha$-$z$ Rényi mutual informations for ground states of models with conformal field theory descriptions. On the example of massless free fermions we identify distinct regions in the $\alpha$-$z$ plane, where RMI corrections due to the lattice are relevant or irrelevant. We further support these findings with MPS calculations on the transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Our results, accompanied by the open-source Julia package this http URL, provide guidance to using RMI in quantum-many body physics numerical computations.

Title: On a Class of Time-Dependent Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
Authors: F. Kecita, B. Khantoul, A. Bounames
Abstract: We study a class of time-dependent (TD) non-Hermitian Hamiltonians $H(t)$ that can be transformed into a time-independent pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{0}^{PH}$ using a suitable TD unitary transformation $F(t)$. The latter can in turn be related to a Hermitian Hamiltonian $h$ by a similarity transformation, $h=\rho \mathcal{H}_{0}^{PH} \rho^{-1}$ where $\rho$ is the Dyson map. Accordingly, once the Schrödinger equation for the Hermitian Hamiltonian $h$ is solved, the general solution of the initial system can be deduced. This allows to define the appropriate $\tilde{\eta}(t)$-inner product for the Hilbert space associated with $H(t)$, where $\tilde{\eta}(t)=F^{\dagger}(t)\eta F(t)$ and $\eta=\rho^{\dagger}\rho$ is the metric operator. This greatly simplifies the computation of the relevant uncertainty relations for these systems. As an example, we consider a model of a particle with a TD mass subjected to a specific TD complex linear potential. We thus obtain two Hermitian Hamiltonians, namely that of the standard harmonic oscillator and that of the inverted oscillator. For both cases, the auxiliary equation admits a solution, and the exact analytical solutions are squeezed states given in terms of the Hermite polynomials with complex coefficients. Moreover, when the Hermitian Hamiltonian is that of the harmonic oscillator, the position-momentum uncertainty relation is real and greater than or equal to $\hbar/2$, thereby confirming its consistency.

Title: Amplitude-based Input Attribution in Quantum Learning via Integrated Gradients
Authors: Nicholas S. DiBrita, Jason Han, Younghyun Cho, Hengrui Luo, Tirthak Patel
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms have demonstrated early promise across hardware platforms, but remain difficult to interpret due to the inherent opacity of quantum state evolution. Widely used classical interpretability methods, such as integrated gradients and surrogate-based sensitivity analysis, are not directly compatible with quantum circuits due to measurement collapse and the exponential complexity of simulating state evolution. In this work, we introduce HATTRIQ, a general-purpose framework to compute amplitude-based input attribution scores in circuit-based QML models. HATTRIQ supports the widely-used input amplitude embedding feature encoding scheme and uses a Hadamard test-based construction to compute input gradients directly on quantum hardware to generate provably faithful attributions. We validate HATTRIQ on classification tasks across several datasets (Bars and Stripes, MNIST, and FashionMNIST).

Title: Many Retrocausal Worlds: A Foundation for Quantum Probability
Authors: Michael Ridley
Abstract: Recent accounts of probability in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics are vulnerable due to their dependence on probability theory per se. For this reason, the many worlds interpretation continues to suffer from the incoherence and quantitative problems. After discussing various theories of probability, I discuss the incoherence problem and argue that self-locating probabilities centered in time-extended worlds can solve it. I then discuss and refute various solutions to the quantitative problem. I argue that the only tenable way to ground these self-locating probabilities is to identify the mathematical form of the Born rule as a generic pattern in a time-extended wavefunction, and to distribute degrees of belief over the region of wavefunction occupied by this pattern. I then outline a time-symmetric version of quantum mechanics - the Fixed Point Formulation - which, interpreted within a time-symmetric Everettian framework, can provide the foundation for a theory of quantum probability.

Title: Emulation of Coherent Absorption of Quantum Light in a Programmable Linear Photonic Circuit
Authors: Govind Krishna, Jun Gao, Sam O Brien, Rohan Yadgirkar, Venkatesh Deenadayalan, Stefan Preble, Val Zwiller, Ali W. Elshaari
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, governed by nonunitary evolution, offer powerful tools for manipulating quantum states through engineered loss. A prime example is coherent absorption, where quantum states undergo phase-dependent partial or complete absorption in a lossy medium. Here, we demonstrate a fully programmable implementation of nonunitary transformations that emulate coherent absorption of quantum light using a programmable integrated linear photonic circuit, with loss introduced via coupling to an ancilla mode [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021017; 2018]. Probing the circuit with a single-photon dual-rail state reveals phase-controlled coherent tunability between perfect transmission and perfect absorption. A two-photon NOON state input, by contrast, exhibits switching between deterministic single-photon and probabilistic two-photon absorption. Across a range of input phases and circuit configurations, we observe nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, along with continuous and coherent tuning of output Fock state probability amplitudes. Classical Fisher information analysis reveals phase sensitivity peaks of 0.79 for single-photon states and 3.7 for NOON states, exceeding the shot-noise limit of 2 and approaching the Heisenberg limit of 4. The experiment integrates quantum state generation, programmable photonic circuitry, and photon-number-resolving detection, establishing ancilla-assisted circuits as powerful tools for programmable quantum state engineering, filtering, multiplexed sensing, and nonunitary quantum simulation.

Title: Quantum simulation of carbon capture in periodic metal-organic frameworks
Authors: Dario Rocca, Jerome F. Gonthier, Joshua Levin, Tobias Schafer, Andreas Gruneis, Byeol Kang, Hong Woo Lee
Abstract: Carbon capture is vital for decarbonizing heavy industries such as steel and chemicals. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high surface area and structural tunability, are promising materials for CO2 capture. This study focuses on Fe-MOF-74, a magnetic Mott insulator with exposed metal sites that enhance CO2 adsorption. Its strongly correlated electronic structure challenges standard DFT methods, which often yield inconsistent predictions. We initially benchmark adsorption energies using various DFT functionals, revealing substantial variability and underscoring the need for more accurate approaches, such as those provided by quantum computing. However, practical quantum algorithms are far less established for simulations of periodic materials, particularly when the plane-wave basis set, often comprising tens of thousands of basis vectors, is used. To address this, we employ an active space reduction strategy based on Wannier functions and natural orbital selection. Localized orbitals around the adsorption site are identified, and MP2 natural orbitals are used to improve convergence of correlation energies. Adsorption energies are then computed using a quantum number-preserving ansatz within the variational quantum eigensolver framework. In addition to classical simulations, we conduct quantum experiments using the sample-based quantum diagonalization method. Although current hardware limits the size of feasible simulations, our approach offers a more efficient and scalable path forward. These results advance the applicability of quantum algorithms to realistic models of carbon capture and periodic materials more broadly.

Title: Construction of the Complete Set of Maximally Entangled Basis Vectors for N-Qubit Systems
Authors: Chi-Chuan Hwang
Abstract: In this study, we first use a three-qubit system as an example to demonstrate the construction of quantum circuits for the eight maximally entangled basis vectors, subsequently extending the approach to N-qubit systems. We employ a random-number approach to generate maximally entangled basis vectors and their corresponding circuits, while also detailing the required number of single-qubit and CNOT gates. This approach not only provides a solid theoretical foundation but also establishes a practical technique for technological applications, bypassing the difficulty of storing large-scale encoding data.

Title: Complementarity Reveals Entanglement Sharing in Sequential Quantum Measurements
Authors: Zinuo Cai, Changliang Ren
Abstract: We investigate entanglement sharing in a two-qubit sequential measurement scenario using three complementary classical correlation metrics: mutual information (I), sum of conditional probabilities (S), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (C). By investigating both weak measurement and probabilistic projective measurement (PPM) strategies in unilateral and bilateral scenarios, the phenomenon of entanglement sharing is conclusively certified when multiple pairs of classical correlation metrics simultaneously exceed their thresholds. Our investigation reveals that weak measurement strategies are more favorable than PPM for exhibiting entanglement sharing, regardless of the scenario. Furthermore, the mutual information criterion fails to characterize entanglement sharing in the bilateral scenario. While, the Pearson correlation criterion (C) is proven to be the most robust across all strategies and scenarios. These findings unveil a critical trade-off between measurement disturbance and complementary correlation recovery, which is essential for quantum resource reuse problems.

Title: Dynamics of Quantum Entanglement Between Photon and Phonon Modes in a Coulomb-coupled Optomechanical Cavity Magnonic Systems
Authors: Muhib Ullah, Muhammad Idrees, Said Mikki
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum information science and a crucial resource for quantum technologies such as precision sensing, secure communication, and computation. In hybrid cavity magno-optomechanical systems, entanglement among cavity photons, magnons, and phonons enables manipulation of quantum states across different modes via radiation pressure-based light-matter interaction. We propose a hybrid optomechanical cavity-magnonic setup with Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere allowing magnons to couple with photons via magnetic-dipole interaction. The system also uses optomechanical and electrostatic interactions to entangle cavity photons and mechanical resonators. We focus on how the magnon nonlinear Kerr effect and varying coupling strengths influence entanglement dynamics. By analysing nonlinear effects alongside other coupling parameters, we identify optimal conditions for initiating and sustaining robust entanglement between the motional modes (phonons) of two Coulomb-coupled mechanical resonators. Our model predicts that adding Coulomb interaction and magnon coupling enhances the degree and tunability of entanglement, making it more resilient to thermal baths at 3 K. This study addresses how to optimize and sustain phonon-phonon entanglement in complex hybrid quantum systems. These findings offer insights relevant to developing quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and other quantum technologies.

Title: Any type of spectroscopy can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer
Authors: Liam P. Flew, Ivan Kassal
Abstract: Spectroscopy is the most important method for probing the structure of molecules. However, predicting molecular spectra on classical computers is computationally expensive, with the most accurate methods having a cost that grows exponentially with molecule size. Quantum computers have been shown to simulate simple types of optical spectroscopy efficiently -- with a cost polynomial in molecule size -- using methods such as time-dependent simulations of photoinduced wavepackets. Here, we show that any type of spectroscopy can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer using a time-domain approach, including spectroscopies of any order, any frequency range, and involving both electric and magnetic transitions. Our method works by computing any spectroscopic correlation function based on the corresponding double-sided Feynman diagram, the canonical description of spectroscopic interactions. The approach can be used to simulate spectroscopy of both closed and open molecular systems using both digital and analog quantum computers.

Title: Accurate and Effective Model for Coexistence of Classical and Quantum Signals In Optical Fibers
Authors: Lucas Alves Zischler, Çağla Özkan, Tristan Vosshenrich, Qi Wu, Giammarco Di Sciullo, Divya A. Shaji, Chiara Lasagni, Paolo Serena, Alberto Bononi, Amirhossein Ghazisaeidi, Chigo Okonkwo, Antonio Mecozzi, Cristian Antonelli
Abstract: The rising interest in quantum-level communication has resulted in proposals for coexistence schemes with classical signals within the same fiber optic channel, where the most recent proposals leverage novel fibers designed for space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission. In all cases the large power difference between classical and quantum channels presents challenges for such schemes, as the classical signals generate interfering noise that corrupts the quantum signal. In this work, we discuss the main interference mechanisms in coexistence scenarios and provide a model to quantify their impact on the quantum signal quality. Analytical approximations in the model allow accurate and fast numerical solutions in the millisecond time-scale. The model accounts for out-of-band non-linear interference effects, namely spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) and four-wave-mixing (FWM) in both cases of single-mode and SDM fibers with weakly-coupled degenerate mode groups. Rayleigh and SpRS backscattering are considered in counter-propagating scenarios. Since broadband classical transmission is targeted, the model also accounts for the effect of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)-induced power tilt. Use of the model in sample scenarios indicates that the interference noise power is minimized at the high end of the transmission band in both cases were the quantum is co- and counter-propagating with respect to the classical signals, with a preference of one or the other scheme depending on the link length and quantum signal center frequency. Our model reveals that FWM has negligible impact in counter-propagating schemes, but can be relevant in co-propagating schemes under certain scenarios. Nevertheless, the FWM interference can be mitigated by deallocating the classical signals adjacent to the quantum channel.

Title: Quantum sensing with discrete time crystals in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model
Authors: Rahul Ghosh, Bandita Das, Victor Mukherjee
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions have been shown to be highly beneficial for quantum sensing, owing to diverging quantum Fisher information close to criticality. In this work we consider a periodically modulated Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model to show that discrete time crystal (DTC) phase transition in this setup can enable us to achieve quantum-enhanced high-precision sensing of field strength. We employ a detailed finite-size scaling analysis and a time-averaged Inverse Participation Ratio analysis to determine the critical properties of this second-order phase transition. Our studies provide a comprehensive understanding of how quantum criticality in DTCs involving long-range interactions can be harnessed for advanced quantum sensing applications.

Title: Testing Quantum Mechanics with Quantum Computers: Qubit Information Capacity
Authors: Tim Palmer
Abstract: Motivated by John Wheeler's assertion that the continuum nature of Hilbert Space conceals the information-theoretic nature of the quantum wavefunction, a specific discretisation of complex Hilbert Space is proposed, leading to the notion of qubit information capacity $N_{\mathrm{max}}$: for any $N \ge N_{\mathrm{max}}$-qubit state, there is insufficient information in the $N$ qubits to allocate even one bit to each of the $2^{N+1}-2$ degrees of freedom demanded by complex Hilbert Space and hence unitary quantum mechanics. Using gravitised quantum mechanics, it is estimated that, for typical qubits in a quantum computer, $N_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 500-1,000$. By contrast, $N_{\mathrm{max}}=\infty$ in quantum mechanics. On this basis, it is predicted that the exponential speed up of algorithms such as Shor's will have saturated in quantum computers which use more than about 1,000 logical qubits. This predicted breakdown of quantum mechanics should be testable within the coming decade. If verified, factoring 2048-RSA integers using quantum computers will for all practical purposes be impossible. The existence of a finite qubit information capacity has profound implications for reimagining the foundations of quantum physics (including the measurement problem, complementarity and nonlocality) and for developing novel theories which synthesise quantum and gravitational physics.

Title: Universal classical-quantum channel resolvability and private channel coding
Authors: Takaya Matsuura, Masahito Hayashi, Min-Hsiu Hsieh
Abstract: We address the problem of constructing fully universal private channel coding protocols for classical-quantum (c-q) channels. Previous work constructed universal decoding strategies, but the encoder relied on random coding, which prevents fully universal code construction. In this work, we resolve this gap by identifying an explicit structural property of codebooks -- namely, the spectral expansion of an associated Schreier graph -- that guarantees universal channel resolvability. Our analysis reveals how this property can be related to channel resolvability through the theory of induced representation. Our main technical result shows that when the transition matrix of a graph associated with a codebook has a large spectral gap, the channel output induced by uniformly sampled codewords is asymptotically indistinguishable from the target output distribution, independently of the channel. This establishes the first deterministic, channel-independent construction of resolvability codebooks. Building on this, we construct a fully universal private channel coding protocol by combining it with universal c-q channel coding based on the Schur-Weyl duality. With appropriate modifications to the requirements on codebooks of universal c-q channel coding, we show that our fully universal private channel coding achieves the known optimal rate. This work thus sheds new light on the expander property of a graph in the context of secure communication.

Title: Scalable Quantum Optimisation using HADOF: Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework
Authors: Namasi G Sankar, Georgios Miliotis, Simon Caton
Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) and QAOA are promising quantum optimisation algorithms used for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial problems on near-term NISQ systems. Many NP-hard problems can be reformulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO), which maps naturally onto quantum Hamiltonians. However, the limited qubit counts of current NISQ devices restrict practical deployment of such algorithms. In this study, we present the Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework (HADOF), which leverages an iterative strategy to automatically divide the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) Hamiltonian into sub-Hamiltonians which can be optimised separately using Hamiltonian based optimisers such as QAOA, QA or Simulated Annealing (SA) and aggregated into a global solution. We compare HADOF with Simulated Annealing (SA) and the CPLEX exact solver, showing scalability to problem sizes far exceeding available qubits while maintaining competitive accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we realise HADOF for a toy problem on an IBM quantum computer, showing promise for practical applications of quantum optimisation.

Title: MAQCY: Modular Atom-Array Quantum Computing with Space-Time Hybrid Multiplexing
Authors: Andrew Byun, Chanseul Lee, Eunsik Yoon, Minhyuk KimMinhyuk Kim, Tai Hyun Yoon
Abstract: We present a modular atom-array quantum computing architecture with space-time hybrid multiplexing (MAQCY), a dynamic optical tweezer-based protocol for fully connected and scalable universal quantum computation. By extending the concept of globally controlled static dual-species Rydberg atom wires [1], we develop an entirely new approach using Q-Pairs, which consist of globally controlled and temporally multiplexed dual-species Rydberg blockaded atom and superatom pairs. Space-time hybrid multiplexing of Q-Pairs achieves O(N) linear scaling in the number of required physical qubits, while preserving coherence and mitigating circuit-depth limitations through in-situ atom replacement. To demonstrate MAQCY's versatility, we implement a three-qubit quantum Fourier transform using only global operations and atom transport. We also propose a concrete implementation using ytterbium isotopes, paving the way toward large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: Non-reciprocal Synchronization in Thermal Rydberg Ensembles
Authors: Yunlong Xue, Zhengyang Bai
Abstract: Optical non-reciprocity is a fundamental phenomenon in photonics. It is crucial for developing devices that rely on directional signal control, such as optical isolators and circulators. However, most research in this field has focused on systems in equilibrium or steady states. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature Rydberg atomic platform where the unidirectional propagation of light acts as a switch to mediate time-crystalline-like collective oscillations through atomic synchronization. We find that thermal-motion-induced coupling asymmetry, enabled by counterpropagating probe and control fields, generates persistent oscillations; conversely, co-propagation quenches this effect. We identify, through both numerical and analytical approaches, the criteria for realizing optical non-reciprocity within a synchronization regime. These results provide key insights for chiral quantum optics and promote the on-chip integration of non-reciprocal devices in nonequilibrium many-body systems.

Title: Boundary Time Crystals: Beyond Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Zeping Liu, Yaotian Li, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang
Abstract: Boundary time crystals are a class of exotic dissipative quantum phases that spontaneously break continuous time-translation symmetry in the thermodynamic limit of open quantum systems. In finite-size systems, the long-time evolution of boundary time crystals exhibits decaying oscillations that cannot be captured by widely used mean-field theory. To address this issue, we develop an effective approach called the stroboscopic rotating wave approximation, which provides a well approximate state for the long-time evolution of boundary time crystals under strong driving. In this approach, the order parameter exhibits both a long-time decaying envelope governed by an effective Lindblad superoperator and short-time oscillations dominated by a reduced quantum dynamical semigroup. Our results reveal that the competition among dephasing processes along three distinct directions induces persistent oscillations, marking the emergence of the boundary time crystal phase. We obtain the analytical expressions for the steady-state density operator, the oscillation period, and the decay rate of the order parameter in the regime where the coherent energy splitting exceeds the dissipation rate. Our work provides a beyond-mean-field theoretical tool for studying the dynamics of periodically driven open quantum systems and understanding the formation of time crystals.

Title: Probability distribution reconstruction using circuit cutting applied to a variational classifier
Authors: Niels M. P. Neumann, Carlos M. R. Rocha, Jasper Verbree, Marc van Vliet
Abstract: Significant efforts are being spent on building a quantum computer. At the same time, developments in quantum software are rapidly progressing. Insufficient quantum resources often are the problem when running quantum algorithms. New techniques can aid in using smaller quantum computers to run larger quantum algorithms. One of these techniques is circuit cutting. With this method, a circuit is broken into multiple pieces, each of which is run on quantum hardware independently and then recombined to obtain the overall answer. These circuit cutting techniques require additional circuit evaluations, which can form a bottleneck for algorithms requiring many interactions. This work explores the potential of circuit cutting techniques precisely in this regime of many interactions. We consider two different models, a standard method based on expectation values, and a novel method based on probability distribution reconstruction. Next, we compare two different training methods we call train-then-cut and cut-then-train and show that in practice, cut-then-train still produces good results. This observation brings closer the practical applicability of circuit cutting techniques, as a train-then-cut strategy is often infeasible. We conclude by implementing a cut and uncut circuit and find that circuit cutting helps achieve higher fidelity results.

Title: To break, or not to break: Symmetries in adaptive quantum simulations, a case study on the Schwinger model
Authors: Karunya Shailesh Shirali, Kyle Sherbert, Yanzhu Chen, Adrien Florio, Andreas Weichselbaum, Robert D. Pisarski, Sophia E. Economou
Abstract: We investigate the role of symmetries in constructing resource-efficient operator pools for adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers. In particular, we focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a discretized model of $1+1$ dimensional electrodynamics, which we use as a proxy for spin chains with a continuum limit. We present an extensive set of simulations comprising a total of $11$ different operator pools, which all systematically and independently break or preserve a combination of discrete translations, the conservation of charge (magnetization) and the fermionic locality of the excitations. Circuit depths are the primary bottleneck in current quantum hardware, and we find that the most efficient ansätze in the near-term are obtained by pools that $\textit{break}$ translation invariance, conserve charge, and lead to shallow circuits. On the other hand, we anticipate the shot counts to be the limiting factor in future, error-corrected quantum devices; our findings suggest that pools $\textit{preserving}$ translation invariance could be preferable for such platforms.

Title: Modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for CSS codes
Authors: Sebastian Stengele, Ángela Capel, Li Gao, Angelo Lucia, David Pérez-García, Antonio Pérez-Hernández, Cambyse Rouzé, Simone Warzel
Abstract: We consider the class of Davies quantum semigroups modelling thermalization for translation-invariant Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes in D dimensions. We prove that conditions of Dobrushin-Shlosman-type on the quantum Gibbs state imply a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with a constant that is uniform in the system's size. This is accomplished by generalizing parts of the classical results on thermalization by Stroock, Zegarlinski, Martinelli, and Olivieri to the CSS quantum setting. The results in particular imply the rapid thermalization at any positive temperature of the toric code in 2D and the star part of the toric code in 3D, implying a rapid loss of stored quantum information for these models.

Title: Bounds on Atomistic Disorder for Scalable Electron Shuttling
Authors: Raphaël J. Prentki, Pericles Philippopoulos, Mohammad Reza Mostaan, Félix Beaudoin
Abstract: Electron shuttling is emerging as a key enabler of scalable silicon spin-qubit quantum computing, but fidelities are limited by atomistic disorder. We introduce a multiscale simulation framework combining time-dependent finite-element electrostatics and atomistic tight-binding to capture the impact of random alloying and interface roughness on the valley splitting and phase of shuttled electrons. We find that shuttling fidelities are strongly suppressed by interface roughness, with a sharp anomaly near the atomic-layer scale, setting quantitative guidelines to realize scalable shuttling.

Title: Cheat-Penalised Quantum Weak Coin-Flipping
Authors: Atul Singh Arora, Carl A. Miller, Mauro E.S. Morales, Jamie Sikora
Abstract: Coin-flipping is a fundamental task in two-party cryptography where two remote mistrustful parties wish to generate a shared uniformly random bit. While quantum protocols promising near-perfect security exist for weak coin-flipping -- when the parties want opposing outcomes -- it has been shown that they must be inefficient in terms of their round complexity, and it is an open question of how space efficient they can be. In this work, we consider a variant called cheat-penalised weak coin-flipping in which if a party gets caught cheating, they lose $\Lambda$ points (compared to $0$ in the standard definition). We find that already for a small cheating penalty, the landscape of coin-flipping changes dramatically. For example, with $\Lambda=0.01$, we exhibit a protocol where neither Alice nor Bob can bias the result in their favour beyond $1/2 + 10^{-8}$, which uses $24$ qubits and $10^{16}$ rounds of communication (provably $10^{7}$ times better than any weak coin-flipping protocol with matching security). For the same space requirements, we demonstrate how one can choose between lowering how much a malicious party can bias the result (down to $1/2 + 10^{-10}$) and reducing the rounds of communication (down to $25,180$), depending on what is preferred. To find these protocols, we make two technical contributions. First, we extend the point game-protocol correspondence introduced by Kitaev and Mochon, to incorporate: (i) approximate point games, (ii) the cheat-penalised setting, and (iii) round and space complexity. Second, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge) numerical algorithm for constructing (approximate) point games that correspond to high security and low complexity. Our results open up the possibility of having secure and practical quantum protocols for multiparty computation.

Title: Absence of quantum Darwinism as a resource in secure quantum communication and computation
Authors: Bishal Kumar Das, Sourav Manna, Vaibhav Madhok
Abstract: The emergence of classical world from underlying quantum mechanics is characterized by not only vanishing quantum correlations but also an unfolding of objectivity also known as quantum Darwinism. We show that the absence of this objectivity has a quantum advantage in cryptography and also provides the crucial missing link in efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits with zero discord. For this purpose, we consider a model of mixed state quantum computation where one is promised concordant states at all stages of the quantum circuit. A concordant quantum state has zero discord with respect to any part and there exists a basis made up of a tensor product of orthonormal local subsystem basis in which the density matrix is diagonal. Efficient classical simulation of concordant computation has surprisingly been an outstanding question in quantum information theory. We argue that a key ingredient of an efficient classical simulation algorithm, a knowledge of the local basis in which the multi-party state is diagonal, is made available by quantum Darwinism. Concordant states in the absence of quantum Darwinism cannot be efficiently simulated by existing methods and give a cryptographic advantage in communication. We show this by giving a protocol for secure quantum communication that exploits this insight. Our work also has implications for the quantum-classical border and we discuss how objectivity emerging out of Darwinism demarcates this border in three ways - empirical based on our observations and experience of objectivity, information theoretic due to the absence of any quantum correlations and lastly computational in the sense discussed above. Lastly, we show that the quantum-classical boundary as drawn by quantum Darwinism as well by what can be simulated efficiently in a mixed state quantum computation aligns with the boundary given by Hardy

Title: Plugging Leaks in Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation and Verification
Authors: Theodoros Kapourniotis, Dominik Leichtle, Luka Music, Harold Ollivier
Abstract: With the advent of quantum cloud computing, the security of delegated quantum computation has become of utmost importance. While multiple statistically secure blind verification schemes in the prepare-and-send model have been proposed, none of them achieves full quantum fault-tolerance, a prerequisite for useful verification on scalable quantum computers. In this paper, we present the first fault-tolerant blind verification scheme for universal quantum computations able to handle secret-dependent noise on the verifier's quantum device. Composable security of the proposed protocol is proven in the Abstract Cryptography framework. Our main tools are two novel distillation protocols that turn secret-dependent noise into secret-independent noise. The first one is run by the verifier and acts on its noisy gates, while the second and more complex one is run entirely on the prover's device and acts on states provided by the verifier. Both are required to overcome the leakage induced by secret-dependent noise. We use these protocols to prepare states in the X-Y-plane whose noise is overwhelmingly secret-independent, which then allows us to verify with exponential confidence arbitrary fault-tolerant BQP computations.

Title: String commitment from unstructured noise
Authors: Jiawei Wu, Masahito Hayashi, Marco Tomamichel
Abstract: Noisy channels are a foundational resource for constructing cryptographic primitives such as string commitment and oblivious transfer. The noisy channel model has been extended to unfair noisy channels, where adversaries can influence the parameters of a memoryless channel. In this work, we introduce the unstructured noisy channel model as a generalization of the unfair noisy channel model to allow the adversary to manipulate the channel arbitrarily subject to certain entropic constraints. We present a string commitment protocol with established security and derive its achievable commitment rate, demonstrating the feasibility of commitment against this stronger class of adversaries. Furthermore, we show that the entropic constraints in the unstructured noisy channel model can be derived from physical assumptions such as noisy quantum storage. Our work thus connects two distinct approaches to commitment, i.e., the noisy channel and physical limitations.

Title: Hybrid Schemes of NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standard Algorithms and Quantum Key Distribution for Key Exchange and Digital Signature
Authors: Abel C. H. Chen
Abstract: Since the security of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms is based on the hardness of mathematical problems, while the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on the fundamental principles of quantum physics, each approach possesses distinct advantages and limitations that can complement one another. Consequently, recent studies have proposed hybrid schemes that combine QKD and PQC to establish a dual-layered security model. In response to this trend, this study proposes hybrid schemes that integrate QKD with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized PQC algorithms. These hybrid schemes include two core components: a hybrid QKD-PQC key exchange protocol and a hybrid QKD-PQC digital signature scheme. For the hybrid key exchange protocol, this study combines Module-Lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (ML-KEM) with QKD protocols, specifically BB84 and E91, to construct a secure key exchange protocol. In the design of the hybrid digital signature scheme, this study utilizes Module-Lattice-based Digital Signature Algorithms (ML-DSA) and Stateless Hash-based Digital Signature Algorithms (SLH-DSA) to generate signature reconstruction values. These values are verified using confirmation codes transmitted via the BB84 and E91 protocols. The proposed hybrid key exchange protocol is evaluated by examining the shared secret key it produces, particularly with respect to entropy and whether the output is independent and identically distributed (IID). Furthermore, the computation time and message lengths of the proposed hybrid schemes are evaluated.

Title: Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors
Authors: Srinivas V. Mandyam, Esther Wang, Zhipan Wang, Bijuan Chen, Nishan C. Jayarama, Anmay Gupta, Eric A. Riesel, Valery I. Levitas, Christopher R. Laumann, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.

Title: Statistical Signatures of Integrable and Non-Integrable Quantum Hamiltonians
Authors: Feng He, Arthur Hutsalyuk, Giuseppe Mussardo, Andrea Stampiggi
Abstract: Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality.

Title: Basis-independent coherence and its distribution in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Samira Elghaayda, Atta ur Rahman, Mostafa Mansour
Abstract: Quantum coherence in curved spacetime offers a fresh window into the interplay between gravity, thermality, and quantum resources. While previous work has shown that Markovian evolution can generate entanglement and other nonclassical correlations in de Sitter backgrounds, the basis-dependent nature of coherence has so far limited its unambiguous interpretation. Here, we introduce a basis-independent framework to quantify not only the total coherence of two comoving detectors, but also its collective and localized contributions, and we trace how each of these decomposed measures varies with the inverse of Gibbons-Hawking temperature. By treating the detectors as open quantum systems interacting with a massless scalar field in the Bunch-Davies and squeezed alpha-vacua, we find that non-thermal squeezing substantially enhances extractable coherence, even under strong thermal effects. Our results demonstrate how basis-independent coherence in de Sitter spacetime can serve as a robust resource for relativistic quantum information protocols.

Title: Fast surrogate modelling of EIT in atomic quantum systems using LSTM neural networks
Authors: Isabel S. Burdon Hita, Óscar Iglesias-González, Gabriel M. Carral, Miguel Ferreira-Cao
Abstract: Simulations of optical quantum systems are essential for the development of quantum technologies. However, these simulations are often computationally intensive, especially when repeated evaluations are required for data fitting, parameter estimation, or real-time feedback. To address this challenge, we develop a Long Short-Term Memory neural network capable of replicating the output of these simulations with high accuracy and significantly reduced computational cost. Once trained, the surrogate model produces spectra in milliseconds, providing a speed-up of 5000x relative to traditional numerical solvers. We focus on applying this technique to Doppler-broadened Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in a ladder-type scheme for Rydberg-based sensing, achieving near-unity agreement with the physics solver for resonant and off-resonant regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the LSTM model on this representative optical quantum system, establishing it as a surrogate tool capable of supporting real-time signal processing and feedback-based optimisation.

Title: Congestion bounds via Laplacian eigenvalues and their application to tensor networks with arbitrary geometry
Authors: Sayan Mukherjee, Shinichiro Akiyama
Abstract: Embedding the vertices of arbitrary graphs into trees while minimizing some measure of overlap is an important problem with applications in computer science and physics. In this work, we consider the problem of bijectively embedding the vertices of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ into the leaves of an $n$-leaf rooted binary tree $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion of such an embedding is given by the largest size of the cut induced by the two components obtained by deleting any vertex of $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion $\mathrm{cng}(G)$ is defined as the minimum congestion obtained by any embedding. We show that $\lambda_2(G)\cdot 2n/9\le \mathrm{cng} (G)\le \lambda_n(G)\cdot 2n/9$, where $0=\lambda_1(G)\le \cdots \le \lambda_n(G)$ are the Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$. We also provide a contraction heuristic given by hierarchically spectral clustering the original graph, which we numerically find to be effective in finding low congestion embeddings for sparse graphs. We numerically compare our congestion bounds on different families of graphs with regular structure (hypercubes and lattices), random graphs, and tensor network representations of quantum circuits. Our results imply lower and upper bounds on the memory complexity of tensor network contraction in terms of the underlying graph.

Title: A Hardware Accelerator for the Goemans-Williamson Algorithm
Authors: D. A. Herrera-Martí, E. Guthmuller, J. Fereyre
Abstract: The combinatorial problem Max-Cut has become a benchmark in the evaluation of local search heuristics for both quantum and classical optimisers. In contrast to local search, which only provides average-case performance guarantees, the convex semidefinite relaxation of Max-Cut by Goemans and Williamson, provides worst-case guarantees and is therefore suited to both the construction of benchmarks and in applications to performance-critic scenarios. We show how extended floating point precision can be incorporated in algebraic subroutines in convex optimisation, namely in indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which are used in Interior Point Methods in the case of very large problem sizes. Also, an estimate is provided of the expected acceleration of the time to solution for a hardware architecture that runs natively on extended precision. Specifically, when using indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which have lower complexity than direct methods and are therefore used in very large problems, we see that increasing the internal working precision reduces the time to solution by a factor that increases with the system size.

Title: Fermionic optimal transport
Authors: Rocco Duvenhage, Dylan van Zyl, Paola Zurlo
Abstract: Quadratic Wasserstein distances are obtained between dynamical systems (with states as special case), on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded von Neumann algebras. This is achieved through a systematic translation from non-graded to $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded transport plans, on usual and fermionic (or $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded) tensor products respectively. The metric properties of these fermionic Wasserstein distances are shown, and their symmetries relevant to deviation of a system from quantum detailed balance are investigated. The latter is done in conjunction with the development of a complete mathematical framework for detailed balance in systems involving indistinguishable fermions.

Title: Tradeoffs on the volume of fault-tolerant circuits
Authors: Anirudh Krishna, Gilles Zémor
Abstract: Dating back to the seminal work of von Neumann [von Neumann, Automata Studies, 1956], it is known that error correcting codes can overcome faulty circuit components to enable robust computation. Choosing an appropriate code is non-trivial as it must balance several requirements. Increasing the rate of the code reduces the relative number of redundant bits used in the fault-tolerant circuit, while increasing the distance of the code ensures robustness against faults. If the rate and distance were the only concerns, we could use asymptotically optimal codes as is done in communication settings. However, choosing a code for computation is challenging due to an additional requirement: The code needs to facilitate accessibility of encoded information to enable computation on encoded data. This seems to conflict with having large rate and distance. We prove that this is indeed the case, namely that a code family cannot simultaneously have constant rate, growing distance and short-depth gadgets to perform encoded CNOT gates. As a consequence, achieving good rate and distance may necessarily entail accepting very deep circuits, an undesirable trade-off in certain architectures and applications.

Title: New Junction Condition and Casimir effect for Network CFT
Authors: Sinan Pang, Ling Li, Tian-Ming Zhao, Rong-Xin Miao
Abstract: Recently, BCFT and ICFT have been generalized to the CFT on networks (NCFT). A key aspect of NCFT is how we connect the CFTs in different edges at the nodes of the network. For a free scalar field, one naturally requires that the scalar fields are continuous at the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new junction condition that instead requires the normal derivative of the scalar field to be continuous at the node. We demonstrate that this new junction condition is consistent with the variational principle and energy conservation. Furthermore, we provide an exact realization of it in a real physical system. As an application, we analyze the Casimir effect using both the traditional and the new junction conditions in networks formed by regular polyhedra. Our results indicate that the new junction condition generally results in a smaller Casimir effect.

Title: Polarization dependence of spin-electric transitions in molecular exchange qubits
Authors: Filippo Troiani, Athanassios K. Boudalis
Abstract: Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in molecular spin triangles.

Title: Analytical solution of a free-fermion chain with time-dependent ramps
Authors: Viktor Eisler, Riccarda Bonsignori, Stefano Scopa
Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution of the single-particle Schrödinger equation for a chain of non-interacting fermions subject to a time-dependent linear potential, with its slope varied as an arbitrary function of time. The resulting dynamics exhibit self-similar behavior, with a structure reminiscent of the domain wall melting problem, albeit characterized by a nontrivial time-dependent length scale and phase. Building on this solution, we derive hydrodynamic predictions for the evolution of particle density, current, and entanglement entropy along the chain. In the special case of a sudden quench, the system develops a breathing interface region, which may be interpreted as a realization of Wannier-Stark localization, as previously suggested on the basis of hydrodynamic arguments.

Title: Slow dynamics from a nested hierarchy of frozen states
Authors: Vanja Marić, Luka Paljk, Lenart Zadnik
Abstract: We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions.

We discuss how the remarkable progress in top-quark physics has opened the possibility of using the top quark as a tool to test quantum mechanics at the energy frontier. After reviewing the motivations for exploring beyond quantum mechanics, we present an example: probing post-quantum correlations at the energy frontier with boosted top quarks.

Title: Exponential quantum advantages for practical non-Hermitian eigenproblems
Authors: Xiao-Ming Zhang, Yukun Zhang, Wenhao He, Xiao Yuan
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a rich field of study, with applications ranging from $PT$-symmetry breaking and skin effects to non-Hermitian topological phase transitions. Yet most studies remain restricted to small-scale or classically tractable systems. While quantum computing has shown strong performance in Hermitian eigenproblems, its extension to the non-Hermitian regime remains largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm to address general non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems, specifically targeting eigenvalues near a given line in the complex plane -- thereby generalizing previous results on ground state energy and spectral gap estimation for Hermitian matrices. Our method combines a fuzzy quantum eigenvalue detector with a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently isolate relevant eigenvalues. This yields a provable exponential quantum speedup for non-Hermitian eigenproblems. Furthermore, we discuss the broad applications in detecting spontaneous $PT$-symmetry breaking, estimating Liouvillian gaps, and analyzing classical Markov processes. These results highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in tackling challenging problems across quantum physics and beyond.

Title: Conditional Independence of 1D Gibbs States with Applications to Efficient Learning
Authors: Álvaro M. Alhambra, Ángela Capel, Paul Gondolf, Alberto Ruiz-de-Alarcón, Samuel O. Scalet
Abstract: We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a correlation structure in which individual regions are strongly correlated at most with their near vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of the conditional mutual information, defined through the so-called Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. We prove that these measures decay superexponentially at every positive temperature, under the assumption that the spin chain Hamiltonian is translation-invariant. Using a recovery map associated with these measures, we sequentially construct tensor network approximations in terms of marginals of small (sublogarithmic) size. As a main application, we show that classical representations of the states can be learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample complexity. We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity of the entire Gibbs state, which implies that it can be efficiently estimated to a small multiplicative error from a small number of local measurements. The results extend from strictly local to exponentially-decaying interactions above a threshold temperature, albeit only with exponential decay rates. As a technical step of independent interest, we show an upper bound to the decay of the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional expectation.

Title: Can we accurately read or write quantum data?
Authors: Ovidiu Cristinel Stoica
Abstract: Applications of quantum mechanics rely on the accuracy of reading and writing data. This requires accurate measurements and preparations of the quantum states. I show that accurate measurements and preparations are impossible if the total Hamiltonian is bounded from below (as thought to be in our universe). This result invites a reevaluation of the limitations of quantum control, quantum computing, and other quantum technologies dependent on the accuracy of quantum preparations and measurements, and maybe of the assumption that the Hamiltonian is bounded from below.

Title: Entanglement entropy scaling laws from fluctuations of non-conserved quantities
Authors: Szczepan Głodzik, Kim Pöyhönen, Ali G. Moghaddam, Teemu Ojanen
Abstract: Entanglement patterns reveal essential information on many-body states and provide a way to classify quantum phases of matter. However, experimental studies of many-body entanglement remain scarce due to their unscalable nature. The present work aims to mitigate this theoretical and experimental divide by introducing reduced fluctuations of observables, consisting of a sum of on-site operators, as a scalable experimental probe of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, we illustrate by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations in spin chains that the reduced fluctuations exhibit the same size scaling properties as the entanglement entropy. Generalizing previous observations restricted to special systems with conserved quantities, our work introduces experimentally feasible protocol to extract entanglement scaling laws.

Title: Sudden Decoherence by Resonant Particle Excitation for Testing Gravity-Induced Entanglement
Authors: Youka Kaku, Akira Matsumura, Tomohiro Fujita
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe gravity-induced entanglement. We consider the gravitational interaction between a particle trapped in a shallow potential and a harmonic oscillator. The harmonic oscillator is in a quantum superposition of two frequencies and only one of these states can excite the trapped particle via resonance. Once the excited particle is detected, the quantum state of the oscillator is collapsed, which can be observed as the sudden disappearance of the superposition of oscillator frequencies. Thus, the sudden decoherence, which is only triggered by particle detection, can be a smoking gun evidence of gravity-induced entanglement. Since the probability of particle excitation increases linearly with time, the total probability is multiplied by repeating experiments. We will also discuss experimental implementations using optomechanics.

Title: Demonstration of Fourier-domain Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography for a fast tomographic quantum imaging
Authors: Sylwia M. Kolenderska, Crislane Vieira de Brito, Piotr Kolenderski
Abstract: Using spectrally correlated photon pairs instead of classical laser light and coincidence detection instead of light intensity detection, Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography (Q-OCT) outperforms classical OCT in several experimental terms. It provides twice better axial resolution with the same spectral bandwidth and it is immune to even-order chromatic dispersion, including Group Velocity Dispersion responsible for the bulk of axial resolution degradation in the OCT images. Q-OCT has been performed in the time domain configuration, where one line of the two-dimensional image is acquired by axially translating the mirror in the interferometer's reference arm and measuring the coincidence rate of photons arriving at two single-photon-sensitive detectors. Although successful at producing resolution-doubled and dispersion-cancelled images, it is still relatively slow and cannot compete with its classical counterpart. Here, we experimentally demonstrate Q-OCT in a much faster Fourier-domain configuration, theoretically proposed in 2020, where the reference mirror is fixed and the joint spectrum is acquired by inserting long fibre spools in front of the detectors. We propose two joint spectrum pre-processing algorithms, aimed at compensating resolution-degrading effects within the setup. While the first one targets fibre spool dispersion, an effect specific to this configuration, the other one removes the effects leading to the weakening of even-order dispersion cancellation, the latter impossible to be mitigated in the time-domain alternative. Being additionally contrasted with both the time-domain approach and the conventional OCT in terms of axial resolution, imaging range and multilayer-object imaging, Fourier-domain Q-OCT is shown to be a significant step forward towards a practical and competitive solution in the OCT arena.

Title: Invariance under quantum permutations rules out parastatistics
Authors: Manuel Mekonnen, Thomas D. Galley, Markus P. Mueller
Abstract: Quantum systems invariant under particle exchange are either Bosons or Fermions, even though quantum theory in principle admits more general behavior under permutations. But why do we not observe such "paraparticles" in nature? The analysis of this question was previously limited primarily to specific quantum field theory models. Here we give two independent arguments that rule out parastatistics universally, originating in quantum information theory and recent research on internal quantum reference frames. First, we introduce a notion of complete invariance: quantum systems should not only preserve their local state under permutations, but also the quantum information they carry about other systems, in analogy to the notion of complete positivity in quantum information theory. Second, we demand that quantum systems are invariant under quantum permutations, i.e. permutations conditioned on values of permutation-invariant observables. For both, we show that the respective principle is fulfilled if and only if the particle is a Boson or Fermion. Our results show how quantum reference frames can shed light on a longstanding problem of quantum physics, they underline the crucial role played by the compositional structure of quantum information, and demonstrate the explanatory power but also subtle limitations of recently proposed quantum covariance principles.

Title: Two-Photon Resonance Fluorescence in a Three-Level Ladder-Type Atom
Authors: Jacob Ngaha, Scott Parkins, Howard J. Carmichael
Abstract: In this work, we consider a three-level ladder-type atom driven by a coherent field, inspired by the experimental work of Gasparinetti et al. [Phys. Rev. A 100, 033802 (2019)]. When driven on two-photon resonance, the atom is excited into its highest energy state $| f \rangle$ by absorbing two photons simultaneously. The atom then de-excites via a cascaded decay $| f \rangle \rightarrow | e \rangle \rightarrow | g \rangle$. Here we present a theoretical study of the atomic fluorescence spectrum where, upon strong coherent driving, the spectrum exhibits seven distinct frequencies corresponding to transitions amongst the atomic dressed states. We characterize the quantum statistics of the emitted photons by investigating the second-order correlation functions of the emitted field. We do so by considering the total field emitted by the atom and focusing on each of the dressed-state components, taking in particular a secular-approximation and deriving straightforward, transparent analytic expressions for the second-order auto- and cross-correlations.

Title: Space-time tradeoff in networked virtual distillation
Authors: Tenzan Araki, Joseph F. Goodwin, Bálint Koczor
Abstract: In contrast to monolithic devices, modular, networked quantum architectures are based on interconnecting smaller quantum hardware nodes using quantum communication links, and offer a promising approach to scalability. Virtual distillation (VD) is a technique that can, under ideal conditions, suppress errors exponentially as the number of quantum state copies increases. However, additional gate operations required for VD introduce further errors, which may limit its practical effectiveness. In this work, we analyse three practical implementations of VD that correspond to edge cases that maximise space-time tradeoffs. Specifically, we consider an implementation that minimises the number of qubits but introduces significantly deeper quantum circuits, and contrast it with implementations that parallelise the preparation of copies using additional qubits, including a constant-depth implementation. We rigorously characterise their circuit depth and gate count requirements, and develop explicit architectures for implementing them in networked quantum systems -- while also detailing implementations in early fault-tolerant quantum architectures. We numerically compare the performance of the three implementations under realistic noise characteristics of networked ion trap systems and conclude the following. Firstly, VD effectively suppresses errors even for very noisy states. Secondly, the constant-depth implementation consistently outperforms the implementation that minimises the number of qubits. Finally, the approach is highly robust to errors in remote entangling operations, with noise in local gates being the main limiting factor to its performance.

Title: Predicting Dynamics from Flows of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis
Authors: Dominik Hahn, David M. Long, Marin Bukov, Anushya Chandran
Abstract: Analytical treatments of far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics are few, even in well-thermalizing systems. The celebrated eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a post hoc ansatz for the matrix elements of observables in the eigenbasis of a thermalizing Hamiltonian, given various response functions of those observables as input. However, the ETH cannot predict these response functions. We introduce a procedure, dubbed the statistical Jacobi approximation (SJA), to update the ETH ansatz after a perturbation to the Hamiltonian and predict perturbed response functions. The Jacobi algorithm diagonalizes the perturbation through a sequence of two-level rotations. The SJA implements these rotations statistically assuming the ETH throughout the diagonalization procedure, and generates integrodifferential flow equations for various form factors in the ETH ansatz. We approximately solve these flow equations, and predict both quench dynamics and autocorrelators in the thermal state of the perturbed Hamiltonian. The predicted dynamics compare well to exact numerics in both random matrix models and one-dimensional spin chains.

Title: Information storage and transmission under Markovian noise
Authors: Satvik Singh, Nilanjana Datta
Abstract: We study the information transmission capacities of quantum Markov semigroups $(\Psi^t)_{t\in \mathbb{N}}$ acting on $d-$dimensional quantum systems. We show that, in the limit of $t\to \infty$, the capacities can be efficiently computed in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of $\Psi$, are strongly additive, and satisfy the strong converse property. We also establish convergence bounds to show that the infinite-time capacities are reached after time $t\gtrsim d^2\ln (d)$. From a data storage perspective, our analysis provides tight bounds on the number of bits or qubits that can be reliably stored for long times in a quantum memory device that is experiencing Markovian noise. From a practical standpoint, we show that typically, an $n-$qubit quantum memory, with Markovian noise acting independently and identically on all qubits and a fixed time-independent global error correction mechanism, becomes useless for storage after time $t\gtrsim n2^{2n}$. In contrast, if the error correction is local, we prove that the memory becomes useless much more quickly, i.e., after time $t\gtrsim \ln(n)$. In the setting of point-to-point communication between two spatially separated parties, our analysis provides efficiently computable bounds on the optimal rate at which bits or qubits can be reliably transmitted via long Markovian communication channels $(\Psi^l)_{l\in \mathbb{N}}$ of length $l\gtrsim d^2 \ln(d)$, both in the finite block-length and asymptotic regimes.

Title: Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models
Authors: Gopal Chandra Santra, Alex Windey, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Andrea Legramandi, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer Rényi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer Rényi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.

Authors: Zhao Zhang, Olai B. Mykland
Abstract: While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their 2D counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least 4 neighboring degrees of freedom. Here, we show that similar 2D entanglement properties can be realized by twisting a single 1D chain embedded on a 2D lattice. The interaction to generate such 2D entanglement is much simpler than the previous 2D construction by coupling orthogonal arrays of 1D highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous bona fide 2D models, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. The tensor network representation of the new ground state is composed of tensors with lower rank, showing a similar global geometry as those of the old ones.

Title: A purely Quantum Generative Modeling through Unitary Scrambling and Collapse
Authors: Yihua Li, Jiayi Chen, Tamanna S. Kumavat, Kyriakos Flouris
Abstract: Quantum computing offers fundamentally more expressive mechanisms for generative modeling, yet current approaches remain constrained by classical neural components that bottleneck quantum capability and hardware efficiency. We propose the Quantum Scrambling and Collapse Generative Model (QGen), a purely quantum paradigm that eliminates classical dependencies. QGen implements two coherent processes: scrambling, which interleaves Gaussian diffusion channels with unitary delocalization to disperse information globally while avoiding collapse into uninformative states; and collapse, where parameterized quantum circuits refocus scrambled distributions into structured outputs, achieving distributional reconstruction under coherent evolution. To enable scalability, we introduce a measurement-based training principle that decomposes learning into tractable subproblems, mitigating barren plateaus. Empirically, QGen outperforms classical and hybrid baselines under matched parameter budget, while maintaining robustness under finite-shot sampling, demonstrating strong feasibility for near-term hardware.

Title: Casimir Effect for Quantum Field theory in Networks
Authors: Tian-Ming Zhao, Rong-Xin Miao
Abstract: This paper studies quantum field theories defined in networks, which are the multi-branch generalizations of interface conformal field theory (ICFT). We propose a novel junction condition on the node and show that it is consistent with energy conservation in the sense that the total energy flow into the node is zero. As an application, we explore the Casimir effect on networks. Remarkably, the Casimir force on one edge can be changed from attractive to repulsive by adjusting the lengths of the other edges, providing a straightforward way to control the Casimir effect. We begin by discussing the Casimir effect for $(1+1)$-dimensional free massless scalars on a simple network. We then extend this discussion to various types of networks and higher dimensions. Finally, we offer brief comments on some open questions.

Title: Minimum-Weight Parity Factor Decoder for Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Yue Wu, Binghong Li, Kathleen Chang, Shruti Puri, Lin Zhong
Abstract: Fast and accurate quantum error correction (QEC) decoding is crucial for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoding, while being near-optimal, is intractable on general quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes and typically relies on approximation and heuristics. We propose HyperBlossom, a unified framework that formulates MLE decoding as a Minimum-Weight Parity Factor (MWPF) problem and generalizes the blossom algorithm to hypergraphs via a similar primal-dual linear programming model with certifiable proximity bounds. HyperBlossom unifies all the existing graph-based decoders like (Hypergraph) Union-Find decoders and Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder, thus bridging the gap between heuristic and certifying decoders. We implement HyperBlossom in software, namely Hyperion. Hyperion achieves a 4.8x lower logical error rate compared to the MWPM decoder on the distance-11 surface code and 1.6x lower logical error rate compared to a fine-tuned BPOSD decoder on the $[[90, 8, 10]]$ bivariate bicycle code under code-capacity noise. It also achieves an almost-linear average runtime scaling on both the surface code and the color code, with numerical results up to sufficiently large code distances of 99 and 31 for code-capacity noise and circuit-level noise, respectively.

Title: Symmetry enforces entanglement at high temperatures
Authors: Amir-Reza Negari, Leonardo A. Lessa, Subhayan Sahu
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems with local interactions undergo ``sudden death of entanglement" at high temperatures, whereby thermal states become classical mixtures of product states. We investigate whether symmetry constraints can prevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states (canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries remain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high temperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge sector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs states evade sudden death of entanglement and have persistent fermionic negativity at high temperatures, proving along the way some existing conjectures about fermionic entanglement. These findings demonstrate that global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and quantum information in thermal equilibrium.

Title: Explicit Quantum Circuits for Simulating Linear Differential Equations via Dilation
Authors: Seonggeun Park
Abstract: Quantum simulation has primarily focused on unitary dynamics, while many physical and engineering systems can be modeled by linear ordinary differential equations whose generators include non-Hermitian terms. Recent studies have shown that such equations, which give rise to nonunitary dynamics, can be embedded into a larger unitary framework via dilation techniques. However, their concrete realization on quantum circuits remains underexplored. In this paper we present a concrete pipeline that connects the dilation formalism with explicit quantum circuit constructions. On the analytical side, building on the recent dilation framework, we introduce a discretization of the continuous dilation operator that is tailored for quantum implementation. This construction ensures an exactly skew-Hermitian ancillary generator, which allows the moment conditions to be satisfied without imposing artificial constraints. We prove that the resulting scheme achieves a global error bound of order $O(M^{-3/2})$, up to exponentially small boundary effects. This error can be suppressed by refining the discretization, where $M$ denotes the discretization parameter. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that the dilation triple $(F_h, |r_h\rangle, \langle l_h|)$ can be efficiently implemented on quantum circuits. Using linear combinations of unitaries, QFT-adder operators, and quantum singular value transformation, the framework requires resources ranging from $O(\log M)$ to $O((\log M)^2)$, depending on the stage of the pipeline.

Title: A Quantum Computer Based on Donor-Cluster Arrays in Silicon
Authors: Shihang Zhang, Chunhui Zhang, Guanyong Wang, Tao Xin, Guangchong Hu, Yu He, Peihao Huang
Abstract: Significant advances in silicon spin qubits highlight the potential of silicon quantum dots for scalable quantum computing, given their compatibility with industrial fabrication and long coherence times. In particular, phosphorus (P)-doped spin qubits possess excellent coherence and have demonstrated high-fidelity two-qubit gates exceeding 99.9%. However, scaling P-donor systems is challenging due to crosstalk caused by the uniformity of individual P donors and the low tolerance for imprecise atomic placement. Stochastic placement can lead to multiple donors located within a small region (diameter <3 nm), forming a so-called donor cluster. Notably, in cluster-based systems, high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum gates and all-to-all connectivity have recently been demonstrated experimentally on nuclear spin qubits. In this work, we propose a scalable cluster-array architecture for nuclear spin qubits and a corresponding control protocol. We analyze crosstalk-induced errors, a major error source, during primitive operations under various parameters, showing that they can be suppressed through device design and control optimization. We evaluate the fidelities of intra- and inter-cluster multi-qubit gates between nuclear spins, confirming the feasibility of our architecture and establishing design requirements and parameter targets. The local all-to-all connectivity within clusters provides unique flexibility for quantum error correction. Our scalable scheme provides a path toward large-scale spin-based quantum processors.

Title: Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors
Authors: Bence Dárdai, Gábor Vattay
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.

Title: Three-Dimensional Niobium Coaxial Cavity with $\sim0.1\,$second Lifetime
Authors: Takaaki Takenaka, Takayuki Kubo, Imran Mahboob, Kosuke Mizuno, Hitoshi Inoue, Takayuki Saeki, Shiro Saito
Abstract: We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm int} \gtrsim 3\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm int}\sim90\,\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.

Title: Understanding Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution and its Variational form
Authors: Andreu Anglés-Castillo, Luca Ion, Tanmoy Pandit, Rafael Gomez-Lurbe, Rodrigo Martínez, Miguel Angel Garcia-March
Abstract: Many computationally hard problems can be encoded in quantum Hamiltonians. The solution to these problems is given by the ground states of these Hamiltonians. A state-of-the-art algorithm for finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian is the so-called Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) which approximates imaginary time evolution by a unitary evolution that can be implemented in quantum hardware. In this paper, we review the original algorithm together with a comprehensive computer program, as well as, the variational version of it.

Title: Resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability with partial information
Authors: Siqi Yao, Kun Fang
Abstract: Recent studies have introduced the worst-case quantum divergence as a key measure in quantum information. Here we show that such divergences can be understood from the perspective of the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability, which utilizes the asymmetric distinguishability between a pair of quantum states as resource. In our work, we extend this framework to settings with partial information, where the goal is to distinguish between sets of quantum states rather than individual states. Within this setting, we characterize optimal rates for resource distillation and dilution using (smoothed) one-shot divergences and regularized divergences. Our framework further exhibits a reversibility property: resource interconversions can be achieved without loss at rates determined entirely by regularized divergences. These results offer a broad operational interpretation of divergences between state sets and generalize existing resource theories to encompass incomplete information scenarios.

Title: Dynamical and invariance algebras of the $d$-dimensional Dunkl-Coulomb problem
Authors: Christiane Quesne
Abstract: It is shown that the rich algebraic structure of the standard $d$-dimensional Coulomb problem can be extended to its Dunkl counterpart. Replacing standard derivatives by Dunkl ones in the so($d+1$,2) dynamical algebra generators of the former gives rise to a deformed algebra with similar commutation relations, except that the metric tensor becomes dependent on the reflection operators and that there are some additional commutation or anticommutation relations involving the latter. It is then shown that from some of the dynamical algebra generators it is straightforward to derive the integrals of motion of the Dunkl-Coulomb problem in Sturm representation. Finally, from the latter, the components of a deformed Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector are built. Together with the Dunkl angular momentum components, such operators insure the superintegrability of the Dunkl-Coulomb problem in Schrödinger representation.

Title: Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography
Authors: Rong-Xin Miao
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography imposes a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for three-dimensional conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound on the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, the Ising model, and $O(N)$ models with $N=2,3$ at critical points and prove it for the two-dimensional case. Remarkably, a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries also obeys the holographic bound.

Title: A New Proof of the QNEC
Authors: Stefan Hollands, Roberto Longo
Abstract: We give a simplified proof of the quantum null energy condition (QNEC). Our proof is based on an explicit formula for the shape derivative of the relative entropy, with respect to an entangling cut. It allows bypassing the analytic continuation arguments of a previous proof by Ceyhan and Faulkner and can be used e.g., for defining entropy current fluctuations.

Title: Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method
Authors: Xiao Liang
Abstract: We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$, next-nearest-neighbor hopping strengths $t'$ and boundary conditions. Instead of considering backflow terms from all sites, competitive results are achieved by considering nearest-neighbor or next-nearest-neighbor backflow terms. Meanwhile the variational wave-function is not enforced on geometric symmetries. When $t'$=0, by considering nearest-neighbor backflow terms, linear stripe order is sucessfully obtained for the case of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under periodoc boundary condition. For a similar case under open boundary condition, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. Comparing to state-of-the-art neural network results, energies are competitive and relative errors are below $5\times 10^{-3}$. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations. When $t'$=-0.2, by considering next-nearest-neighbor backflow terms, obtained energies are competitive or even lower than state-of-the-art neural network results. For example, obtained energy for $n$=0.875, $U$=8 on the $12\times 12$ lattice under PBC is $8.1\times 10^{-4}$ lower comparing to that from the neural network state. Therefore, the Tensor-Backflow method has strong representation abilities for the Fermi-Hubbard model.

Title: Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.

Title: Symmetry and Topology of Successive Quantum Feedback Control
Authors: Junxuan Wen, Zongping Gong, Takahiro Sagawa
Abstract: We establish a symmetry classification for a general class of quantum feedback control. For successive feedback control with a non-adaptive sequence of bare measurements (i.e., with positive Kraus operators), we prove that the symmetry classification collapses to the ten-fold AZ$^\dagger$ classes, specifying the allowed topology of CPTP maps associated with feedback control. We demonstrate that a chiral Maxwell's demon with Gaussian measurement errors exhibits quantized winding numbers. Moreover, for general (non-bare) measurements, we explicitly construct a protocol that falls outside the ten-fold classification. These results broaden and clarify the principles in engineering topological aspects of quantum control robust against disorder and imperfections.
