Title: Enhancing Gradient Variance and Differential Privacy in Quantum Federated Learning
Authors: Duc-Thien Phan, Minh-Duong Nguyen, Quoc-Viet Pham, Huilong Pi
Abstract: Upon integrating Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as the local model, Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) has recently confronted notable challenges. Firstly, exploration is hindered over sharp minima, decreasing learning performance. Secondly, the steady gradient descent results in more stable and predictable model transmissions over wireless channels, making the model more susceptible to attacks from adversarial entities. Additionally, the local QFL model is vulnerable to noise produced by the quantum device's intermediate noise states, since it requires the use of quantum gates and circuits for training. This local noise becomes intertwined with learning parameters during training, impairing model precision and convergence rate. To address these issues, we propose a new QFL technique that incorporates differential privacy and introduces a dedicated noise estimation strategy to quantify and mitigate the impact of intermediate quantum noise. Furthermore, we design an adaptive noise generation scheme to alleviate privacy threats associated with the vanishing gradient variance phenomenon of QNN and enhance robustness against device noise. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively balances convergence, reduces communication costs, and mitigates the adverse effects of intermediate quantum noise while maintaining strong privacy protection. Using real-world datasets, we achieved test accuracy of up to 98.47\% for the MNIST dataset and 83.85\% for the CIFAR-10 dataset while maintaining fast execution times.

Title: Practical Fidelity Limits of Toffoli Gates in Superconducting Quantum Processors
Authors: M. AbuGhanem
Abstract: High-fidelity multi-qubit gates are a critical resource for near-term quantum computing, as they underpin the execution of both quantum algorithms and fault-tolerant protocols. The Toffoli gate (CCNOT), in particular, plays a central role in quantum error correction and quantum arithmetic, yet its efficient implementation on current quantum hardware remains limited by noise and connectivity constraints. In this work, we present a hardware-aware characterization of the Toffoli gate using optimized, connectivity-compliant decompositions executed on IBM's 127-qubit superconducting quantum processors. Our study integrates state preparation, gate synthesis, and quantum state/process tomography (QST/QPT) to evaluate fidelity across three distinct classes of input states: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), W, and the uniform superposition of all three-qubit computational basis states -- under noise-free simulation, noise-aware emulation, and real hardware execution. For GHZ states, we report state fidelities of 98.442% (noise-free simulation), 81.470% (noise-aware quantum emulation), and 56.368% (real quantum hardware). For W states, state fidelities are 98.739%, 79.900%, and 63.689%, respectively, and for the uniform superposition state, we observe state fidelities of 99.490%, 85.469%, and 61.161%. Comparative QPT experiments yield process fidelities of 98.976% (noise-free) and 80.160% (noise-aware emulation). Our results empirically characterize state-dependent error patterns in multi-qubit circuits and quantify trade-offs between gate decomposition strategies and native hardware performance, offering practical insights for scalable, hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.

Title: Efficient Preparation of Resource States for Hamiltonian Simulation and Universal Quantum Computation
Authors: Thierry N. Kaldenbach, Isaac D. Smith, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Matthias Heller, Hans J. Briegel
Abstract: The direct compilation of algorithm-specific graph states in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) can lead to resource reductions in terms of circuit depth, entangling gates, and even the number of physical qubits. In this work, we extend previous studies on algorithm-tailored graph states to periodic sequences of generalized Pauli rotations, which commonly appear in, e.g., Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation. We first implement an enhanced simulated-annealing-based algorithm to find optimal periodic graph states within local-Clifford (LC-)MBQC. In addition, we derive a novel scheme for the preparation of resource states based on a graph state and a ladder of CNOT gates, which we term anticommutation-based (AC-)MBQC, since it uncovers a direct relationship between the graph state and the anticommutation matrix for the set of Hamilonians generating the computation. We also deploy our two approaches to derive universal resource states from minimal universal sets of generating Hamiltonians, thus providing a straightforward algorithm for finding the former. Finally, we demonstrate and compare both of our methods based on various examples from condensed matter physics and universal quantum computation.

Title: Mitigating Measurement Crosstalk via Pulse Shaping
Authors: Yang Gao, Feiyu Li, Yang Liu, Zhen Yang, Jiayu Ding, Wuerkaixi Nuerbolati, Ruixia Wang, Tang Su, Yanjun Ma, Yirong Jin, Haifeng Yu, He Wang, Fei Yan
Abstract: Quantum error correction protocols require rapid and repeated qubit measurements. While multiplexed readout in superconducting quantum systems improves efficiency, fast probe pulses introduce spectral broadening, leading to signal leakage into neighboring readout resonators. This crosstalk results in qubit dephasing and degraded readout fidelity. Here, we introduce a pulse shaping technique inspired by the derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) protocol to suppress measurement crosstalk during fast readout. By engineering a spectral notch at neighboring resonator frequencies, the method effectively mitigates spurious signal interference. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing readout architectures, enabling fast, low-crosstalk multiplexed measurements without additional hardware overhead -- a critical advancement for scalable quantum computing.

Title: Continuous-Time Quantum State Transfer with a Generalized Laplacian
Authors: Yujia Shi
Abstract: Quantum walks generated by the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian are known to exhibit low transfer fidelity on general graphs. In this paper, we study continuous-time quantum walks governed by the generalized Laplacian operator L_k = A+kD, where A is the adjacency matrix, D is the degree matrix, and k is a real-valued parameter. Recent work of Duda, McLaughlin, and Wong showed that in the single-excitation Heisenberg (XYZ) spin model, one can realize walks generated by this family of operators on signed weighted graphs. Motivated by earlier studies on vertex-weighted graphs, we demonstrate that for certain graphs, tuning the parameter k can significantly enhance the fidelity of state transfer between endpoints.

Title: Room Temperature Single Photon Detection at 1550 nm using van der Waals Heterojunction
Authors: Nithin Abraham, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kausik Majumdar
Abstract: Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing. The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by coupling a low bandgap ($\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\%$ (estimated as $42.8\%$ for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of $\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature.

Title: Cartan-Khaneja-Glaser decomposition of $\SU(2^n)$ via involutive automorphisms
Authors: John A. Mora Rodríguez, Arthur C. R. Dutra, Henrique N. Sá Earp, Marcelo Terra Cunha
Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for performing the Cartan-Khaneja-Glaser decomposition of unitary matrices in $\SU(2^n)$, a critical task for efficient quantum circuit design. Building upon the approach introduced by Sá Earp and Pachos (2005), we overcome key limitations of their method, such as reliance on ill-defined matrix logarithms and the convergence issues of truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff(BCH) series. Our reformulation leverages the algebraic structure of involutive automorphisms and symmetric Lie algebra decompositions to yield a stable and recursive factorization process. We provide a full Python implementation of the algorithm, available in an open-source repository, and validate its performance on matrices in $\SU(8)$ and $\SU(16)$ using random unitary benchmarks. The algorithm produces decompositions that are directly suited to practical quantum hardware, with factors that can be implemented near-optimally using standard gate sets.

Title: Bayesian Greedy Receiver for Pulse Position Modulation without an Error Floor under Thermal Noise
Authors: Leo Bia, Christos N. Gagatsos, Saikat Guha
Abstract: We investigate quantum receiver architectures for demodulation $M$-ary Pulse Position Modulation under thermal noise and photon-starved conditions. Building on the greed receiver framework, we analyze it using jointly optimized displacement-squeezing and the Dolinar receiver. We further introduce a novel slicing Bayesian greedy receiver, which partitions each PPM time slot into multiple optical slices and update the full posterior distribution over codeword hypothesis at each slice using Bayes' rule. Under the presence of noise, our slicing greedy receiver outperforms the standard greedy receiver and appears to avoid a noise floor given sufficient slicing resolution.

Title: The complementarity relations in a multi-path interferometer with quantum memory
Authors: Yue Sun, Ming-Jing Zhao, Peng-Tong Li
Abstract: The complementarity relations impose the constraints on different aspects of quantum states. We study the complementarity relation within a multi-path interferometer that includes detectors and quantum memory. Here we consider the mixed states as the input states. We establish a duality relation between the visibility and the path distinguishability. Based on this duality, two triality relations, one is related with visibility, path distinguishability, and mixedness, the other is related with visibility, path distinguishability, and entanglement, were derived respectively. Therefore, the role of entanglement in multi-path interferometer is characterized quantitatively. These complementarity relations are all complete for the two-path interferometer.

Title: Generation of Correlated Quantum Random Number Sequences with Bright Twin Beams
Authors: Anirudh Shekar, Chirang R. Patel, Jerin A. Thachil, Ashok Kumar
Abstract: Quantum random number generators play a vital role in securing communication and encryption. In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using four-wave mixing in a double-{\Lambda} configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and generated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.

Title: Stability of Adiabatic States in a Dissipative Three-Level System
Authors: Emil A. Gazazyan, Gayane G. Grigoryan, Vanush Paturyan
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of adiabatic states in three-level quantum systems are investigated analytically and numerically. Various possible configurations of three-level systems under exact two-photon resonance are considered. It is shown that in all these schemes, the lifetime of the studied states is determined by the dephasing time between levels that are not connected by a dipole transition. An efficient population transfer through the b-state at room temperature is demonstrated despite relatively long relaxation times. It is also demonstrated that, in case of large one-photon detuning, the so-called b-state has the same lifetime as that of the dark state. The evolution of adiabatic states for arbitrary values of single-photon detunings has been studied numerically.

Title: Enhanced magnetic field sensitivity of shallow NV$^-$ ensembles via high-temperature implantation
Authors: Joa Al Yahya, Anatole Bach, Jayash Panigrahi, Pauline Perrin, Ionut Balasa, Diana Serrano, Alexey Tiranov, Jocelyn Achard, Alexandre Tallaire, Philippe Goldner
Abstract: Dense and shallow ensembles of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV$^-$) with good optical and spin properties play a key role in the performance enhancement of diamond-based quantum sensors. Ion implantation enables precise control of NV$^-$ depth and density. However, at high ion fluence, this method is limited by low NV$^-$ creation yields and sample amorphization. Additionally, shallow NV$^-$ spin properties deteriorate due to surface proximity. In this paper, we study N$_2^+$ ion implantation at energies between 10 and 15 keV with fluences as high as 1e15 ions/cm2 at temperatures of 20, 400 and 800°C to investigate the influence of implantation temperature on lattice damage, NV$^-$ creation yield and NV$^-$ spin properties. Our results show that diamond maintains structural integrity at 800°C with fluences up to 1e15 ions/cm2 without amorphization. Furthermore, high-temperature implantation improves NV$^-$ creation yields up to five times without compromising T2$^*$, T2 and T1, making it a promising approach to enhance the magnetic field sensitivity of NV$^-$ ensembles.

Title: Hanbury Brown-Twiss interference with massively parallel spectral multiplexing for broadband light

Abstract: Two-photon interference in the spectral domain is a powerful resource for quantum technologies, enabling both precision measurements and scalable entanglement distribution. Here, we report the first demonstration of massively parallel, wavelength-resolved photon bunching, revealing Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations across 100 independent spectral channels. These observations are enabled by a fast, data-driven single-photon spectrometer that achieves 40 pm spectral and 40 ps temporal resolution over a 10 nm bandwidth, allowing simultaneous access to spectro-temporal photon correlations without the need for narrowband filtering. This approach preserves photon flux while enabling high-dimensional quantum interference measurements across a broad spectrum. Our results establish frequency-multiplexed two-photon interference as a scalable and throughput-efficient platform for quantum-enhanced photonic technologies, with applications ranging from stellar intensity interferometry to broadband entanglement swapping in quantum networks.

Title: Tunneling of bosonic qubits under local dephasing through microscopic Lindblad approach
Authors: Alberto Ferrara, Farzam Nosrati, Andrea Smirne, Jyrki Piilo, Rosario Lo Franco
Abstract: We consider a system composed of two distinct spatial regions, populated by two-component bosons coupled through a tunneling process. Local dephasing noise acts independently on each region, enabling competition between coherent dynamics and decoherence. We present an analytic microscopical derivation of the corresponding Lindblad master equation, taking into account the full system-environment evolution and verify its validity against the numerical solution of the full system, computed through the pseudo-mode method. We demonstrate how the commonly-used phenomenological master equation emerges as a short-time limit of the full one. We finally explore how dephasing affects known two-particle indistinguishability-based scenarios, namely Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and entanglement generation. In particular, we show that simultaneous deformation and dephasing can produce rich, nontrivial dynamics, including persistent quantum correlations in long-time steady states.

Title: Quantum Purification for Amplitude Damping Noise
Authors: Kai Wang, Zhen-Yang Peng
Abstract: Noise poses a fundamental challenge to quantum information processing, with amplitude-damping (AD) noise being particularly detrimental. Preserving high-fidelity quantum systems therefore relies critically on effective error correction and purification methods. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for mitigating AD noise that can be applied to both state and channel purification. Our method achieves a substantial enhancement in the fidelity of affected states or channels while maintaining a low resource overhead, requiring only one or two ancilla qubits in combination with two Clifford gates, and exhibits a relatively high success probability. This approach provides a practical and scalable framework for addressing AD noise in realistic quantum systems.

Title: Another generalization of Hadamard test: Optimal sample complexities for learning functions on the unitary group
Authors: Daiki Suruga
Abstract: Estimating properties of unknown unitary operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. While full unitary tomography requires a number of samples to the unknown unitary scaling linearly with the dimension (implying exponentially with the number of qubits), estimating specific functions of a unitary can be significantly more efficient. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the sample-efficient estimation of arbitrary square integrable functions $f: \mathbf{U}(d) \to \mathbb{C}$, using only access to the controlled-unitary operation. We first provide a tight characterization of the optimal sample complexity when the accuracy is measured by the averaged bias over the unitary $\mathbf{U}(d)$. We then construct a sample-efficient estimation algorithm that becomes optimal under the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning criterion for various classes of functions. Applications include optimal estimation of matrix elements of irreducible representations, the trace, determinant, and general polynomial functions on $\mathbf{U}(d)$. Our technique generalize the Hadamard test and leverage tools from representation theory, yielding both lower and upper bound on sample complexity.

Title: Deterministic nuclear spin squeezing and squeezing by continuous measurement using vector and tensor light shifts
Authors: Ali Moshiri, Alice Sinatra
Abstract: We study the joint effects of vector and tensor light shifts in a set of large spin atoms, prepared in a polarized state and interacting with light. Depending on the ratio $\epsilon$ between tensor and vector coupling and a measurement rate $\Gamma$, we identify a regime of quantum non-demolition measurement squeezing for times shorter than $(\sqrt{\epsilon}\Gamma)^{-1}$, and a deterministic squeezing regime for times longer than $(\epsilon \Gamma)^{-1}$. We apply our results to fermionic isotopes of strontium, ytterbium, and helium, which are atoms with purely nuclear spin in their ground state, benefiting from very low decoherence. For ytterbium 173, with a cavity such as that of \cite{Thompson2021}, it would be possible to achieve an atomic spin variance reduction of $0.03$ in $\simeq 50 \rm ms$.

Title: Improving the runtime of quantum phase estimation for chemistry through basis set optimization
Authors: Pauline J. Ollitrault, Jerome F. Gonthier, Dario Rocca, Gian-Luca Anselmetti, Matthias Degroote, Nikolaj Moll, Raffaele Santagati, Michael Streif
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a promising quantum algorithm for obtaining molecular ground-state energies with chemical accuracy. However, its computational cost, dominated by the Hamiltonian 1-norm $\lambda$ and the cost of the block encoding, scales at least quadratically with the number of molecular orbitals, making it challenging to incorporate dynamic correlation by enlarging the active space. In this work, we investigate two strategies to mitigate this cost through the optimization of the basis set. First, we investigate whether adjusting the coefficients of Gaussian basis functions can minimize the 1-norm while preserving the accuracy of the ground state energy. Although this method leads to a reduction in the 1-norm up to 10%, this reduction is system-dependent and diminishes with increasing molecular size. Second, we demonstrate that employing a large-basis-set frozen natural orbital (FNO) strategy results in a substantial reduction in QPE resources without compromising accuracy. We study a dataset of 58 small organic molecules and the dissociation curve of N2, and demonstrate that an active space constructed from orbitals derived from larger basis sets captures correlation effects more effectively. This approach yields up to an 80% reduction in the 1-norm $\lambda$ and also leads to a 55% reduction in the number of orbitals. Our results highlight that improving the quality, not just the size, of the orbital basis is a viable strategy for extending QPE to include dynamical correlation, making progress toward scalable and chemically accurate quantum simulations with tractable resource requirements.

Title: Non-linear cooling and control of a mechanical quantum harmonic oscillator
Authors: Matteo Simoni, Ivan Rojkov, Matteo Mazzanti, Wojciech Adamczyk, Alexander Ferk, Pavel Hrmo, Shreyans Jain, Tobias Sägesser, Daniel Kienzler, Jonathan Home
Abstract: Non-linearities are a key feature allowing non-classical control of quantum harmonic oscillators. However, when non-linearities are strong, designing protocols for control is often difficult, placing a barrier to exploiting these properties fully. Here, using a single trapped-ion oscillator operated in the strongly non-linear regime of the atom-light interaction, we show how to generate localized multi (2, 3, 4, and 5)-component Schrödinger's cat manifolds using a novel form of non-linear reservoir engineering. We then specifically select Hamiltonians which allow us to perform measurements on these state manifolds. To our knowledge, our work is the first experimental use of such high order non-linear processes for control of non-classical states of a quantum harmonic oscillator, opening up a new toolbox which can be applied to bosonic quantum error correction, computation, and sensing.

Title: Cavity-Mediated Coupling between Local and Nonlocal Modes in Landau Polaritons
Authors: Sae R. Endo, Dasom Kim, Shuang Liang, Geon Lee, Sunghwan Kim, Alan Covarrubias-Morales, Minah Seo, Michael J. Manfra, Dukhyung Lee, Motoaki Bamba, Junichiro Kono
Abstract: The multimode ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime has emerged as a novel platform for accessing previously inaccessible phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Of particular interest are cavity-mediated correlations between local and nonlocal excitations, or equivalently, between modes at zero and finite in-plane momentum modes, which offer new opportunities for controlling light--matter interactions across space. However, direct experimental evidence of such interactions has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal multimode coupling in a Landau polariton system, where cavity photons simultaneously interact with the zero-momentum cyclotron resonance and finite-momentum magnetoplasmons of a two-dimensional electron gas in a GaAs quantum well. Our slot cavities, with their subwavelength mode volumes, supply in-plane momentum components that enable the excitation of finite-momentum matter modes. Terahertz time-domain magnetospectroscopy measurements reveal a clear splitting of the upper-polariton branch, arising from hybridization between magnetoplasmon modes and the cavity--cyclotron-resonance hybrids. Extracted coupling strengths confirm USC of the cyclotron resonance and strong coupling of the magnetoplasmon modes to the cavity field, respectively. The experimental results are well captured by the multimode Hopfield model and finite-element simulations. These findings establish a pathway for engineering multimode light--matter interactions involving zero- and finite-momentum matter modes in the USC regime.

Title: Quantum Theory of Distributed-Feedback Parametric Amplifiers and Oscillators
Authors: Alex O.C. Davis, Alex I. Flint
Abstract: Optical parametric amplifiers and oscillators are among the best-developed quantum light sources, having already been adopted in precision measurement and underpinning various quantum computing and communication paradigms. Meanwhile, progress in photonic structures such as Bragg gratings has enabled distributed feedback oscillators to become widely established as classical laser sources with desirable properties. Recent work in fabricating and processing photonic structures in nonlinear media opens the path to combining these two programs to realize distributed feedback parametric oscillators. Such devices have great potential as sources of quantum light, especially for squeezed vacuum, a crucial resource state in emerging quantum technologies. In this study, an analytic and fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics of such devices is presented. This approach gives explicit results for the key properties of these sources, including the parametric oscillation pump threshold, intracavity mode, tunability, and quantum statistics of the output modes. These results underpin future work on a versatile class of next-generation quantum light source.

Title: Discrete-Time Quantum Random Walk for Epidemiological Modeling
Authors: Sayan Manna, Nikhil Kowshik, Sudebkumar Prasant Pal
Abstract: We introduce a discrete-time quantum random walk (QRW) framework for spatial epidemic modelling on a two-dimensional square lattice and compare its dynamics to classical random-walk SIR models. In our model, each infected site spawns a quantum walker whose coherent evolution (controlled by an amplitude-splitting coin and conditional shifts) can infect visited susceptible sites with probability $p$ and persists for a lifetime of $\tau$ steps. We perform extensive numerical simulations on finite lattices, measure cluster observables (single-run cluster size $M$ and its ensemble average $\langle M\rangle$), and compute the basic reproduction number $R_0$ across a broad grid of $(p,\tau)$ values. Results show that QRW dynamics interpolate between diffusive and super-diffusive regimes: at low $p$ the QRW reproduces classical-like $R_0$ and cluster statistics, while at higher $p$ and $\tau$ ballistic propagation and interference produce markedly larger $R_0$ and non-Gaussian spatial profiles. We compare the QRW $R_0$ range to empirical estimates from historical outbreaks and discuss parameter regimes where QRW offers a closer qualitative match than classical diffusion. We conclude that QRWs provide a flexible, conceptually novel toy model for exploring rapid or heavy-tailed epidemic spread, while emphasizing the need for caution when mapping quantum-coherent mechanisms to biological transmission.

Title: Genetic optimization of ansatz expressibility for enhanced variational quantum algorithm performance
Authors: Manish Mallapur, Ronit Raj, Ankur Raina
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a leading paradigm that extracts practical computation from near-term intermediate-scale quantum devices, enabling advances in quantum chemistry simulations, combinatorial optimization, and quantum machine learning. However, the performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms is highly sensitive to the design of the ansatze. To be effective, ansatze must be expressive enough to capture target states but shallow enough to be trainable. We propose a genetic algorithm-inspired framework for designing ansatze that achieve high expressibility while maintaining shallow depth and low parameter count. Our approach evolves ansatze through mutation and selection based on an expressibility metric. The circuit generated by our framework consistently demonstrates high expressibility at any target depth and performs comparably to traditional ansatz design approaches while showing minimal to no signs of barren plateau issues. This work presents a general, scalable solution for ansatz design, producing expressive, low-depth circuits that need to be designed only once and can serve a wide range of applications.

Title: Emergence of Unruh prethermalization for uniformly accelerating many-atom system
Authors: Saptarshi Saha, Chiranjeeb Singha, Pragna Das, Arpan Chatterjee
Abstract: A uniformly accelerated atom in an inertial vacuum generally thermalizes and reaches a Gibbs state. This phenomenon is commonly known as the Unruh effect. Here, we show that the situation is entirely different for the many-atoms problem. In the case of non-interacting accelerating atoms, we show that a regime exists where the entire system reaches a prethermal generalized Gibbs state before it thermalizes. The prethermal state is protected by emergent conserved quantities; hence, the system behaves like a nearly-integrable one, which shows a sharp distinction from the Unruh effect. We coin the term ``Unruh prethermalization" to characterize this phenomenon. The measure of entanglement is a good estimation of the lifetime of the prethermal state and is consistent with previous studies. Finally, we show that in such a regime, the dynamics show a Dicke superradiance-type radiation burst before reaching the prethermal state. In contrast, only a mono-exponential decay is observed for Unruh thermalization. In addition, to highlight the significance of our results, we compare them with existing experimental observations.

Title: Quantum spatial best-arm identification via quantum walks
Authors: Tomoki Yamagami, Etsuo Segawa, Takatomo Mihana, André Röhm, Atsushi Uchida, Ryoichi Horisaki
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithm for best-arm identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification (QSBAI). The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural restrictions. We analyze complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum algorithms for decision-making.

Title: A brain-inspired paradigm for scalable quantum vision
Authors: Chenghua Duan, Xiuxing Li, Wending Zhao, Lin Yao, Qing Li, Ziyu Li, Fukang Li, Junhao Ma, Xia Wu
Abstract: One of the fundamental tasks in machine learning is image classification, which serves as a key benchmark for validating algorithm performance and practical potential. However, effectively processing high-dimensional, detail-rich images, a capability that is inherent in biological vision, remains a persistent challenge. Inspired by the human brain's efficient ``Forest Before Trees'' cognition, we propose a novel Guiding Paradigm for image recognition, leveraging classical neural networks to analyze global low-frequency information and guide targeted quantum circuit towards critical high-frequency image regions. We present the Brain-Inspired Quantum Classifier (BIQC), implementing this paradigm via a complementarity architecture where a quantum pathway analyzes the localized intricate details identified by the classical pathway. Numerical simulations on diverse datasets, including high-resolution images, show the BIQC's superior accuracy and scalability compared to existing methods. This highlights the promise of brain-inspired, hybrid quantum-classical approach for developing next-generation visual systems.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Learning of Nonlinear Entanglement Witnesses via Continuous-Variable Quantum Neural Networks
Authors: Mohammad Rezaei Shokou, Hossein Davoodi Yeganeh
Abstract: A major challenge in quantum information is characterizing entanglement, for which entanglement witnesses offer effective means of detecting quantum correlations. We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework that learns a nonlinear entanglement witness directly from quantum data using continuous-variable quantum neural networks (CV-QNNs). Our architecture combines variational interferometers, squeezers and non-Gaussian Kerr gates with a small classical neural head to output a scalar witness value. Numerical simulations were conducted on two- and three-mode families, including Gaussian and non-Gaussian states in both pure and mixed forms. We observed over 99% classification accuracy and a robust performance gap compared to strong classical baselines, especially when scaling from two to three modes. Robustness to photon loss is further quantified under a finite number of measurement shots. On the theory side, we show that when the quantum measurement stage is informationally complete, the hybrid model can approximate any continuous witness-like functional on compact sets of this http URL findings highlight CV-QNNs as a promising framework for data-driven quantum state characterization and propose specific benchmarks where near-term photonic platforms offer tangible advantages.

Title: Symmetric and asymmetric tripartite states under the lens of entanglement splitting and topological linking
Authors: Sougata Bhattacharyya, Sovik Roy
Abstract: This work establishes a direct operational connection between the entanglement structures of specific three-qubit states (i.e. multipartite entanglement) and their corresponding topological links. We investigate the symmetric $\wwbar$ state and the asymmetric $\starstate$ state through local projective measurements on individual qubits. The post measurement states are analyzed via their Schmidt rank to characterize residual bipartite entanglement. For the symmetric $\wwbar$ state, measurement of any qubit consistently results in a non-maximally entangled post-measurement state (Schmidt rank 2), analogous to the behavior of a \textit{3-Hopf link} structure, where cutting any ring leaves the remaining two nontrivially linked. On the other hand, the $\starstate$ state exhibits a context-dependent fragility. Its behavior predominantly mirrors that of a \textit{3-link chain}, where severing the central qubit decouples the system, while cutting an outer qubit often preserves a residual link. Crucially, for specific measurement outcomes, the $\starstate$ state also exhibits the defining property of the \textit{Borromean rings}, where the loss of one qubit completely disentangles the remaining two. This analysis provides a concrete interpretation of topological linking structures as a resource for characterizing distributed entanglement and its resilience under local measurement operations, revealing that a single quantum state can contextually embody multiple distinct topological analogues.

Title: Unified formalism and adaptive algorithms for optimal quantum state, detector and process tomography
Authors: Shuixin Xiao, Xiangyu Wang, Yuanlong Wang, Zhibo Hou, Jun Zhang, Ian R. Petersen, Wen-Zhe Yan, Hidehiro Yonezawa, Franco Nori, Guo-Yong Xiang, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: Quantum tomography is a standard technique for characterizing, benchmarking and verifying quantum systems/devices and plays a vital role in advancing quantum technology and understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics. Achieving the highest possible tomography accuracy remains a central challenge. Here we unify the infidelity metrics for quantum state, detector and process tomography in a single index $1-F(\hat S,S)$, where $S$ represents the true density matrix, POVM element, or process matrix, and $\hat S$ is its estimator. We establish a sufficient and necessary condition for any tomography protocol to attain the optimal scaling $1-F= O(1/N) $ where $N$ is the number of state copies consumed, in contrast to the $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ worst-case scaling of static methods. Guided by this result, we propose adaptive algorithms with provably optimal infidelity scalings for state, detector, and process tomography. Numerical simulations and quantum optical experiments validate the proposed methods, with our experiments reaching, for the first time, the optimal infidelity scaling in ancilla-assisted process tomography.

Title: Quantum optics in the turbulent atmosphere: Fundamental issues and applications
Authors: A. A. Semenov, M. Klen, I. Pechonkin
Abstract: Quantum light propagation through turbulent atmosphere has become a subject of intensive research, spanning both theoretical and experimental studies. This interest is driven by its important applications in free-space quantum communication, remote quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring. At the same time, this phenomenon itself poses an intriguing fundamental problem. A consistent theoretical description typically makes explicit assumptions about the measurement scheme at the receiver station and/or the method of quantum-information encoding. A common and straightforward approach encodes the information in quantum states of a quasi-monochromatic mode, representing a pulsed Gaussian beam. Atmospheric turbulence induces random distortions of the pulse shape and, consequently, random fluctuations of the transmittance through the receiver aperture. These fluctuations, characterized by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT), directly affect the quantum state of the received light. In this paper we examine various analytical models of the PDT, validate them through numerical simulations, and assess their range of applicability. Furthermore, we extend the analysis beyond the standard ensemble-averaging approach, recognizing that realistic experiments typically involve time averaging. This requires a detailed examination of the underlying random process, including the study of temporal correlations and their impact on nonclassical properties of electromagnetic radiation.

Title: High-order Magnus Expansion for Hamiltonian Simulation
Authors: Di Fang, Diyi Liu, Shuchen Zhu
Abstract: Efficient simulation of quantum dynamics with time-dependent Hamiltonians is important not only for time-varying systems but also for time-independent Hamiltonians in the interaction picture. Such simulations are more challenging than their time-independent counterparts due to the complexity introduced by time ordering. Existing algorithms that aim to capture commutator-based scaling either exhibit polynomial cost dependence on the Hamiltonian's time derivatives or are limited to low-order accuracy. In this work, we establish the general commutator-scaling error bounds for the truncated Magnus expansion at arbitrary order, where only Hamiltonian terms appear in the nested commutators, with no time derivatives involved. Building on this analysis, we design a high-order quantum algorithm with explicit circuit constructions. The algorithm achieves cost scaling with the commutator structure in the high-precision regime and depends only logarithmically on the Hamiltonian's time variation, making it efficient for general time-dependent settings, including the interaction picture.

Title: Quantum machine unlearning
Authors: Junjian Su, Runze He, Guanghui Li, Sujuan Qin, Zhimin He, Haozhen Situ, Fei Gao
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computation with classical Machine Learning (ML) and holds the potential to achieve the quantum advantage for specific tasks. In classical ML, Machine Unlearning (MU) is a crucial strategy for removing the influence of specified training data from a model, to meet regulatory requirements and mitigate privacy risks. However, both the risk of training-data membership leakage remains underexplored in QML. This motivates us to propose Quantum Machine Unlearning (QMU) to explore two core questions: do QML models require MU due to training-data membership leakage, and can MU mechanisms be efficiently implemented in the QML? To answer the two questions, we conducted experiments on the MNIST classification task, utilizing a class-wise unlearning paradigm in both noiseless simulations and quantum hardware. First, we quantify training-data privacy leakage using a Membership Inference Attack (MIA), observing average success rates of 90.2\% in noiseless simulations and 75.3\% on quantum hardware. These results indicate that QML models present training-data membership leakage with very high probability under adversarial access, motivating the need for MU. Second, we implement MU algorithms on the QML model, which reduces the average MIA success rate to 0\% in simulations and 3.7\% on quantum hardware while preserving accuracy on retained data. We conclude that implementing MU mechanisms in QML models renders them resistant to MIA. Overall, this paper reveals significant privacy vulnerabilities in QML models and provides effective corresponding defense strategies, providing a potential path toward privacy-preserving QML systems.

Title: Simultaneous generation and transfer of mechanical noise squeezing
Authors: Mungyeong Jeong, Hyojun Seok, Young-Sik Ra, Junho Suh
Abstract: Optomechanical interactions between mechanical oscillators and an electromagnetic field induce controllable modifications in mechanical fluctuation. When multiple mechanical oscillators are coupled to a single electromagnetic mode, these interactions can be extended to utilize the electromagnetic mode as a mediator for distributing noise squeezing among different mechanical oscillators. We investigate the transfer of mechanical noise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave cavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing in one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of its resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously, optomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical modes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode (target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical modes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from the squeezing in the control mode. Remarkably, the observed squeezing transfer manifests noise characteristics of both single-mode and two-mode squeezing. This unique feature suggests that the squeezing transfer holds significant potential for enhancing precision measurements.

Title: The Efficiency Frontier: Classical Shadows versus Quantum Footage
Authors: Shuowei Ma, Junyu Liu
Abstract: Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states, enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares classical shadows with ``quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight $w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.

Title: Beyond Stellar Rank: Control Parameters for Scalable Optical Non-Gaussian State Generation
Authors: Fumiya Hanamura, Kan Takase, Hironari Nagayoshi, Ryuhoh Ide, Warit Asavanant, Kosuke Fukui, Petr Marek, Radim Filip, Akira Furusawa
Abstract: Advanced quantum technologies rely on non-Gaussian states of light, essential for universal quantum computation, fault-tolerant error correction, and quantum sensing. Their practical realization, however, faces hurdles: simulating large multi-mode generators is computationally demanding, and benchmarks such as the \emph{stellar rank} do not capture how effectively photon detections yield useful non-Gaussianity. We address these challenges by introducing the \emph{non-Gaussian control parameters} $(s_0,\delta_0)$, a continuous and operational measure that goes beyond stellar rank. Leveraging these parameters, we develop a universal optimization method that reduces photon-number requirements and greatly enhances success probabilities while preserving state quality. Applied to the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) state generation, for example, our method cuts the required photon detections by a factor of three and raises the preparation probability by nearly $10^8$. Demonstrations across cat states, cubic phase states, GKP states, and even random states confirm broad gains in experimental feasibility. Our results provide a unifying principle for resource-efficient non-Gaussian state generation, charting a practical route toward scalable optical quantum technologies and fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Ramsey Interferometry with Qudits
Authors: Branislav Ilikj, Nikolay V. Vitanov
Abstract: Ramsey interferometry, a cornerstone technique in quantum spectroscopy, traditionally operates with qubits for high precision measurements. In this work we build on Ramsey interferometry, extending it to qudits in Wigner-Majorana (WM) systems where the internal degrees of freedom are used to achieve enhanced resolution. We also show that replacing the two $\pi/2$ pulses of standard Ramsey interferometry with the quantum Fourier transform provides no increase in resolution. Theoretical analysis further reveals that quantum systems with the WM symmetry are particularly well-suited for this objective, achieving substantial resolution improvements for a given interrogation time. Simulations and analytical solutions validate these predictions, confirming the feasibility and advantages of qudits in Ramsey interferometry. We quantify these advantages using a resolution--contrast index that enables direct comparison between different qudit dimensions. In particular, three state systems (qutrits) achieve a twofold resolution increase compared to qubits without contrast degradation, emerging as optimal for the qudit approach. Higher dimensional qudits achieve superior resolution enhancement at the cost of contrast degradation. These significant resolution gains establish qudits as attractive candidates for high-precision quantum metrology and sensing technologies.

Title: Efficient Convex Optimization for Bosonic State Tomography
Authors: Shengyong Li, Yanjin Yue, Ying Hu, Rui-Yang Gong, Qianchuan Zhao, Zhihui Peng, Pengtao Song, Zeliang Xiang, Jing Zhang
Abstract: Quantum states encoded in electromagnetic fields, also known as bosonic states, have been widely applied in quantum sensing, quantum communication, and quantum error correction. Accurate characterization is therefore essential yet difficult when states cannot be reconstructed with sparse Pauli measurements. Tomography must work with dense measurement bases, high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and often sample-based data. However, existing convex optimization-based techniques are not efficient enough and scale poorly when extended to large and multi-mode systems. In this work, we explore convex optimization as an effective framework to address problems in bosonic state tomography, introducing three techniques to enhance efficiency and scalability: efficient displacement operator computation, Hilbert space truncation, and stochastic convex optimization, which mitigate common limitations of existing approaches. Then we propose a sample-based, convex maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) method specifically designed for flying mode tomography. Numerical simulations of flying four-mode and nine-mode problems demonstrate the accuracy and practicality of our methods. This method provides practical tools for reliable bosonic mode quantum state reconstruction in high-dimensional and multi-mode systems.

Title: Single-Shot Decoding of Biased-Tailored Quantum LDPC Codes
Authors: Devon Campbell
Abstract: Quantum processors are often affected by biased noise and noisy readout, which reduce reliability and reproducibility. This work combines two complementary strategies to address these challenges. The first is bias tailoring, which aligns stabilizers with the dominant error type. The second is single-shot (SS) decoding, which uses metachecks to identify measurement faults from just one noisy round. We implement these ideas in a four-dimensional lifted hypergraph product (4D-LHP) code constructed from quasi-cyclic protograph seeds. Simulation results show that bias tailoring lowers the word-error rate (WER) by 20-60 percent across realistic Z:X bias ratios (from 1:1 up to 1000:1), with the largest improvements at moderate bias. When measurement noise is present, a single SS round recovers more than one third of the performance lost to readout errors. Moreover, metachecks identify over 99.8 percent of faulty syndromes, providing near-complete fault visibility even with limited correction power. Together, these findings demonstrate that 4D-LHP codes maintain strong resilience under realistic noise, making them promising candidates for integration into orchestrated QPU-CPU workflows.

Title: Schrodinger's Toolbox: Exploring the Quantum Rowhammer Attack
Authors: Devon Campbell
Abstract: Residual cross-talk in superconducting qubit devices creates a security vulnerability for emerging quantum cloud services. We demonstrate a Clifford-only Quantum Rowhammer attack-using just X and CNOT gates-that injects faults on IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processors without requiring pulse-level access. Experiments show that targeted hammering induces localized errors confined to the attack cycle and primarily manifests as phase noise, as confirmed by near 50% flip rates under Hadamard-basis probing. A full lattice sweep maps QR's spatial and temporal behavior, revealing reproducible corruption limited to qubits within two coupling hops and rapid recovery in subsequent benign cycles. Finally, we leverage these properties to outline a prime-and-probe covert channel, demonstrating that the clear separability between hammered and benign rounds enables highly reliable signaling without error correction. These findings underscore the need for hardware-level isolation and scheduler-aware defenses as multi-tenant quantum computing becomes standard.

Title: Monotones from multi-invariants: a classification
Authors: Abhijit Gadde, Shraiyance Jain
Abstract: In this paper we study local unitary invariants of a multi-partite quantum state that are monotonic, on average, under local operations and classical communication (locc). In particular we focus on local unitary invariants that are constructed out of polynomials in the state and its conjugate - called multi-invariants. Multi-invariants are labeled by certain types of graphs. Recently, in \cite{Gadde:2024jfi}, the authors related the condition of monotonicity under locc to a graph theoretic condition on the multi-invariant called edge-convexity. In this paper, we conjecture a complete classification of edge-convex multi-invariants. The conjecture states that the edge-convex multi-invariants are labeled by finite Coxeter groups. We prove this conjecture for all but six cases.

Title: Subspace Variational Quantum Simulation: Fidelity Lower Bounds as Measures of Training Success
Authors: Seung Park, Dongkeun Lee, Jeongho Bang, Hoon Ryu, Kyunghyun Baek
Abstract: We propose an iterative variational quantum algorithm to simulate the time evolution of arbitrary initial states within a given subspace. The algorithm compresses the Trotter circuit into a shorter-depth parameterized circuit, which is optimized simultaneously over multiple initial states in a single training process using fidelity-based cost functions. After the whole training procedure, we provide an efficiently computable lower bound on the fidelities for arbitrary states within the subspace, which guarantees the performance of the algorithm in the worst-case training scenario. We also show our cost function exhibits a barren-plateau-free region near the initial parameters at each iteration in the training landscape. The experimental demonstration of the algorithm is presented through the simulation of a 2-qubit Ising model on an IBMQ processor. As a demonstration for a larger system, a simulation of a 10-qubit Ising model is also provided.

Title: Collective dissipation engineering of interacting Rydberg atoms
Authors: Tao Chen, Chenxi Huang, Jacob P. Covey, Bryce Gadway
Abstract: Engineered dissipation is emerging as an alternative tool for quantum state control, enabling high-fidelity preparation, transfer and stabilization, and access to novel phase transitions. We realize a tunable, state-resolved laser-induced loss channel for individual Rydberg atoms, in both non-interacting and strongly correlated settings. This capability allows us to reveal interaction-driven shifts of the exceptional point separating quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes, and to demonstrate interaction-enhanced decay. By exploiting interaction-dependent energy level shifts, we observe a configuration-selective two-body Zeno effect that freezes target spin states. We theoretically show that when this mechanism is extended to many-body chains it allows for the dissipative distillation of unwanted spin configurations. These experimental studies establish a versatile approach for exploring strongly interacting, open quantum spin systems, and opens possible new routines for dissipative preparation of correlated quantum states in Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Non-Exponential Decay in Finite Photonic Waveguide Arrays
Authors: Florian H. Huber, Benedikt Braumandl, Johannes Knörzer, Jonas Himmel, Carlotta Versmold, Robert H. Jonsson, Alexander Szameit, Jasmin Meinecke
Abstract: Open quantum-system dynamics can follow exponential decay, non-exponential relaxation, or oscillatory dynamics, depending on the system-environment coupling. We study a lattice with a boundary defect that transitions between these regimes, controlled by a single parameter. Extending the exact solution to the oscillatory case, we establish a unified theory confirmed by experiments in integrated waveguide arrays. We characterize finite-size effects by comparing analytics, numerics, and data. This provides a benchmark for emulating infinite systems and studying open systems in photonic lattices.

Title: Improving Entanglement Resilience in Quantum Memories with Error-Detection-Based Distillation
Authors: Huidan Zheng, Gunsik Min, Ilkwon Sohn, Jun Heo
Abstract: The degradation of entanglement in quantum memories due to decoherence is a critical challenge for scalable quantum networks. We present an entanglement distillation protocol based on the [[4,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code, deriving analytical expressions for its output fidelity and yield, and benchmarking it against the BBPSSW protocol. In addition to initial distillation, we investigate a re-distillation strategy in which stored logical entangled states are refreshed using only local operations and classical communication, avoiding the need to regenerate and redistribute entanglement from scratch. Our analysis shows that this method can extend the effective storage lifetime beyond BBPSSW,with its performance advantage primarily determined by classical communication delay. We derive upper bounds on classical communication latency required for the approach to maintain superiority. This work introduces a framework for treating quantum memories as reusable resources and links distillation strategy to practical implementation constraints, offering quantitative guidance for designing resilient quantum networks.

Title: Theoretical and experimental analysis of adaptive quantum computers
Authors: Niels M. P. Neumann
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computations require alternating quantum and classical computations, where the classical computations prove vital in detecting and correcting errors in the quantum computation. Recently, interest in using these classical computations has been growing again, not to correct errors, but to perform computations. Various works have looked into these so-called adaptive quantum algorithms. Few works however have looked in the advantages of adaptive quantum algorithms in realistic scenarios. This work provides the first step in this direction. We introduce a worst-case noise model and use it to derive success probabilities for preparing a GHZ state and preparing a $W$-state using either an adaptive quantum algorithm, or using a standard non-adaptive quantum algorithm. Next, we implemented these protocols on quantum hardware and we compare the outcomes to our derived theoretical results. We find that despite their potential, adaptive quantum algorithms currently do not outperform full quantum algorithms.

Title: Time-frequency Entangled Photon Mediated CCZ Gate
Authors: Chenhui Wang, Weilong Wang, Yangyang Fei, Zhiqiang Fan, Hanshi Zhao, Yuyan Mage, Zheng Shan
Abstract: High-fidelity native multi-qubit operations are crucial to efficient quantum circuit compilation due to their ability of shortening circuit depth and enhence the performance. However, the design and implementation of these gates remain a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a hardware-efficient scalable scheme for direct CCZ gate implementation based on two-photon absorption phenomenon, which is applicable to current superconducting quantumcomputing platforms. By carefully optimizing the parameters of qubits and couplers, we achieve a simulated fidelity over 99% within 194ns, surpassing the decomposed methods with single-qubit and two-qubit gates in both latency and overall fidelity. Crucially, the scheme is robust against parameter drifts and can be extended to CCPhase({\theta}) gates with arbitrary angles and multi-qubit operations. All these results highlight the advantages of our scheme which paves the way for substantial depth compression of complex quantum circuits for practical application in transformative quantum algorithms and simulations.

Title: Tuning of SiV quantum emission in nitrogen-doped nanodiamonds by dual-color excitation

Abstract: The charge dynamics of silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers have been investigated for the first time in high-pressure high-temperature nanodiamonds (NDs) with varying concentrations of substitutional nitrogen (Ns). We demonstrate a controlled sixfold enhancement of SiV- photoluminescence (PL) under dual-color excitation, consisting of strong red (~660 nm) illumination combined with weak green (~530 nm) excitation. The measured dependencies of SiV- PL lifetime and intensity on excitation wavelength, together with the enhancement dependence on Ns concentration in the studied nanodiamonds, provide unambiguous evidence of the involvement of donor nitrogen in SiV-emission dynamics. Saturation curves and second-order PL intensity correlation measurements further indicate suppression of the population of the optically inactive SiV2- state upon the addition of green excitation. These results unlock a practical pathway toward engineering optically-controlled and scalable quantum emitters based on SiV-luminescent diamond nanoparticles.

Title: Universal quantum control over bosonic network
Authors: Zhu-yao Jin, Jun Jing
Abstract: Perfect transfer of unknown states across distinct nodes is fundamental in the construction of bosonic quantum networks. We here develop a general theory to control an $N$-node bosonic network governed by the time-dependent Hamiltonian, as the universal quantum control theory for continuous-variable systems. In particular, we can activate nonadiabatic passages superposed of initial and target modes by the commutation condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the representation of time-independent ancillary modes, which serves as the necessary and sufficient condition to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the entire network. To exemplify the versatility of our theory on the Heisenberg-picture passages, we perform arbitrary state exchange between two nodes, chiral NOON-state transfer among three bosonic nodes, and chiral Fock-state transfer among three of four bosonic nodes. Our work provides a promising avenue toward universal control of any pair of nodes or modes in bosonic networks as well as the whole network.

Title: Construction of PPT entangled state and its detection by using second-order moment of the partial transposition
Authors: Rohit Kumar, Satyabrata Adhikari
Abstract: In this work, we adopt a formalism by which we construct a new family of positive partial transpose (PPT) states, which includes separable and PPT entangled states (PPTES) in a $d_{1}\otimes d_{2}$ dimensional system and then derive a condition that can distinguish between them. The PPT condition is expressed in terms of the inequality between the second-order moment of the system's partial transposition $(p_2)$ and the reciprocal of the product of $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$. The second order moment $(p_{2})$ plays a vital role in detecting the PPT states as it is very easy to calculate and may be a realizable quantity in an experiment. Once we know that the given state is a PPT state, we will use a suitable witness operator to detect whether the given PPT state is a PPTES. Further, we have established a relation between the second and third order moments of partial transposition of a PPT state and have shown that the violation of the inequality implies that the detected state is a negative partial transpose (NPT) entangled state. We will then construct a quantum state by considering the mixture of a separable and an entangled state and obtain a condition on the mixing parameter for which the mixture represents a PPT entangled state. We observe that the resulting PPT entangled state may also be detected by the same witness operator $W$, which had detected the entangled state present in the mixture. Finally, applying our results, we have shown that the distillable key rate of the private state, prepared through our prescription, is positive. It suggests that our result also has potential applications in quantum cryptography.

Title: Reaffirming a Challenge to Bohmian Mechanics
Authors: Jan Klaers, Violetta Sharoglazova, Marius Puplauskis
Abstract: In our recent work (Sharoglazova et al., Nature 643, 67 (2025)), we reported the first measurement of the speed of tunnelling particles using a coupled waveguide system. The measured speed was found to be in disagreement with the standard guiding equation of Bohmian mechanics, which we regard as a challenge to that framework. In the present article, we provide a more detailed account of this issue. In particular, we argue that reformulating the Bohmian guiding equation so as to extend our results on the particle speed to the trajectory level yields a convergence between the predictions of Bohmian mechanics and standard quantum mechanics for tunnelling and related phenomena. Our findings therefore challenge Bohmian mechanics to justify or revise its reliance on the standard guiding equation-an issue that has so far not been addressed.

Title: Dissipation-Enhanced Localization in a Disorder-Free $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge System
Authors: Xuanpu Yang, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan
Abstract: The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model, as the simplest realization of a lattice gauge theory, exhibits rich and unconventional physics. One of its most remarkable features is disorder-free localization, where localization emerges not from explicit quenched disorder but from static background $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges, leading to persistent memory of the initial state. In this work, we investigate the dissipative dynamics of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model by coupling it to a Markovian environment. We find that quantum dissipation can enhance localization: memory of the initial state is retained more robustly under dissipative evolution than under unitary dynamics. This dissipation-induced enhancement of localization persists across a variety of initial states, indicating that the effect is not limited to fine-tuned configurations. Our results demonstrate that dissipation, often associated with decoherence and thermalization, can in fact serve as a powerful tool for stabilizing non-ergodic behavior in gauge-constrained quantum systems.

Title: Classical Neural Networks on Quantum Devices via Tensor Network Disentanglers: A Case Study in Image Classification
Authors: Borja Aizpurua, Sukhbinder Singh, Román Orús
Abstract: We address the problem of implementing bottleneck layers from classical pre-trained neural networks on a quantum computer, with the goal of achieving quantum advantage on near-term devices. Our approach begins with a compression step in which the target linear layer is represented as an effective matrix product operator (MPO) without degrading model performance. The MPO is then further disentangled into a more compact form. This enables a hybrid classical-quantum execution scheme, where the disentangling circuits are deployed on a quantum computer while the remainder of the network -- including the disentangled MPO -- runs on classical hardware. We introduce two complementary algorithms for MPO disentangling: (i) an explicitly disentangling variational method leveraging standard tensor-network optimization techniques, and (ii) an implicitly disentangling gradient-descent-based approach. We validate these methods through a proof-of-concept translation of simple classical neural networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification into a hybrid classical-quantum form.

Title: Robust and cost-effective quantum network using Kramers-Kronig receiver
Authors: Xu Liu, Tao Wang, Junpeng Zhang, Yankai Xu, Yuehan Xu, Lang Li, Peng Huang, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: The quantum internet holds the potential to facilitate applications that are fundamentally inaccessible to the classical internet. Among its most prominent applications is quantum key distribution (QKD) networks, which connect two distant nodes to establish a secure key based on the principles of quantum mechanics. However, the subsequent extensive reliance on interferences in existing QKD protocols leads to the weak robustness of the system and the corresponding network. In this work, we propose a robust and cost-effective quantum network using the Kramers-Kronig receiver. We first propose a continuous-variable QKD protocol based on direct detection without interference, which achieves the recovery of quadrature components through the Kramers-Kronig relation. Subsequently, we have extended this protocol to continuous-variable quantum access networks, further highlighting the robustness and cost advantages of interference-free detection. The experimental results show that each user can achieve a secret key rate at 55 kbit/s within the access network range by using only one photodetector without interference structures. This scheme opens up new possibilities in establishing a robust and cost-effective quantum network, serving as a foundational element in the progress toward establishing a large-scale quantum internet.

Title: Certification of energy-restricted entanglement depth with simple measurements
Authors: Carles Roch I Carceller
Abstract: The ability to certify entanglement in multipartite scenarios is crucial for the development of quantum technologies, specially for the realization of large-scale networks. Here, we introduce a method to certify entanglement from sources with limited energy based on a state discrimination game played by multiple distant uncharacerized parties. Our approach is capable of detecting entanglement across all possible bipartitions employing a single, simple and separable measurement setting for all parties, thereby providing a robust and scalable tool for certifying the depth of multipartite entanglement. We also show that the performance and noise robustness of our method improves in the multipartite regime, growing exponentially with the number of parties.

Title: Enhancing Fault-Tolerant Surface Code Decoding with Iterative Lattice Reweighting
Authors: Yi Tian, Yi-Cong Zheng, Xiaoting Wang, Ching-Yi Lai
Abstract: Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical post-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum noise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce the Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder, which systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error correction. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting: correlated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional probabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative procedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a hardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in finite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results under circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\geq 17$ and physical error rates $\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates by over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold from 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding. Extrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$, IRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a major reduction in qubit overhead.

Title: Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry
Authors: Xingze Qiu
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the asymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the near-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful toolkit for its application.

Title: Multimode Photon-Photon Coupling
Authors: Shourya Viren, Rakesh Kumar Nayak, Biswanath Bhoi, Rajeev Singh
Abstract: This study investigates a planar hybrid system consisting of three complementary splitring resonators (CSRRs), designed to examine interactions among multiple photon modes at room temperature. The system was modeled and simulated using the full-wave electromagnetic solver CST Microwave Studio. Analysis of the transmission spectra (|S21|) as a function of frequency for different CSRR dimensions revealed distinct anti-crossing behavior, indicative of strong photon-photon coupling (PPC). To explain this phenomenon, we present theoretical framework that quantitatively captures the observed mode hybridization and provides estimates of the coupling strength, which are further validated experimentally. This work not only elucidates the fundamental dynamics of PPC in planar systems but also offers practical guidance for designing hybrid platforms with tunable photon interactions, paving the way for future advancements in planar magnonic and hybrid photonic technologies.

Authors: Xiangjun Tan, Zhanning Wang
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.

Title: A Class of Cyclic Quantum Codes
Authors: Matthew B. Hastings
Abstract: We introduce a class of cyclic quantum codes, basing the construction not on the simplicity of the stabilizers, but rather on the simplicity of preparation of a code state (at least in the absence of noise). We show how certain known codes, such as a certain family of rotated two-dimensional toric codes, fall into this class, and we also give certain other examples at small sizes found by computer search. We finally discuss fault tolerant preparation of these codes.

Title: Learning spatially structured open quantum dynamics with regional-attention transformers
Authors: Dounan Du, Eden Figueroa
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and external control is an important challenge in quantum information science. Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design, real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across diverse light-matter platforms.

Title: Behind the scenes of the Quantum Extreme Learning Machines
Authors: A. De Lorenzis, M. P. Casado, N. Lo Gullo, T. Lux, F. Plastina, A. Riera
Abstract: In recent years, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has grown rapidly, emerging as a promising approach to make quantum computing implementation competitive. In this work, we investigate Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELM), a quantum variant of Extreme Learning Machines where training is restricted to the output layer. The proposed architecture combines dimensionality reduction (via PCA or Autoencoders), quantum state encoding, evolution under an XX Hamiltonian, and measurement, providing features for a single-layer classifier. By analyzing the performance of QELMs as a function of the evolution time, we identify a relatively sharp transition from a low-accuracy to a high-accuracy regime, after which the accuracy saturates. Remarkably, the saturation value matches that achieved with random unitaries, which induce maximally complex dynamics and optimally scramble information across the system. Across all cases studied, the critical transition time is sufficient for information to reach nearest neighbors, enabling feature extraction for learning, and is independent of the system size (i.e., the number of qubits). This independence implies that QELMs can be efficiently simulated classically for a broad class of tasks.

Title: Intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases
Authors: Ken Shiozaki
Abstract: We study the interplay of non-Hermitian topological phases under point- and line-gap conditions. Using natural homomorphisms from line-gap to point-gap phases, we distinguish extrinsic phases, reducible to Hermitian or anti-Hermitian line-gapped phases, from intrinsic phases, which are genuinely non-Hermitian without Hermitian counterparts. Although classification tables for all symmetry classes were already presented in earlier work, the present paper develops a unified formulation and provides explicit computations for all internal symmetries.

Title: Benchmarking Single-Qubit Gates on a Neutral Atom Quantum Processor
Authors: Artem Rozanov, Boris Bantysh, Ivan Bobrov, Gleb Struchalin, Stanislav Straupe
Abstract: We present benchmarking results for single-qubit gates implemented on a neutral atom quantum processor using Direct Randomized Benchmarking (DRB) and Gate Set Tomography (GST). The DRB protocol involves preparing stabilizer states, applying $m$ layers of native single-qubit gates, and measuring in the computational basis, providing an efficient error characterization under a stochastic Pauli noise model. GST enables the full, self-consistent reconstruction of quantum processes, including gates, input states, and measurements. Both protocols provide robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors estimations of gate performance, offering complementary perspectives on quantum gate fidelity. For single-qubit gates, DRB yields an average fidelity of $99.963 \pm 0.016\%$. The protocol was further applied to a 25-qubit array under global single-qubit control. GST results are consistent with those obtained via DRB. We also introduce a gauge optimization procedure for GST that brings the reconstructed gates, input states, and measurements into a canonical frame, enabling meaningful fidelity comparisons while preserving physical constraints. These constraints of the operators -- such as complete positivity and trace preservation -- are enforced by performing the optimization over the Stiefel manifold. The combined analysis supports the use of complementary benchmarking techniques for characterizing scalable quantum architectures.

Title: Characterization of low-nitrogen quantum diamond for pulsed magnetometry applications
Authors: Jiashen Tang, Connor A. Roncaioli, Andrew M. Edmonds, Atli Davidsson, Connor A. Hart, Matthew L. Markham, Ronald L. Walsworth
Abstract: Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are versatile quantum sensors with broad applications in the physical and life sciences. The concentration of neutral substitutional nitrogen ([N$_\text{s}^0$]) strongly influences coherence times, sensitivity, and optimal sensing strategies. Diamonds with [N$_\text{s}^0$] $\sim\,1-10\,\text{ppm}$ are a focus of recent material engineering efforts, with higher concentrations being favorable for continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) and lower concentrations expected to benefit pulsed magnetometry techniques through extended NV electronic spin coherence times and improved sensing duty cycles. In this work, we synthesize and characterize low-[N$_\text{s}^0$] ($\sim\,0.8\,\text{ppm}$), NV-enriched diamond material, engineered through low-strain chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth on high-quality substrates, $^{12}$C isotopic purification, and controlled electron irradiation and annealing. Our results demonstrate good strain homogeneity in diamonds grown on CVD substrates and spin-bath-limited NV dephasing times. By measuring NV spin and charge properties across a wide range of optical NV excitation intensity, we provide direct comparisons of photon-shot-noise-limited magnetic sensitivity between the current low-[$\text{N}_\text{s}^0$] and previously studied higher-[$\text{N}_\text{s}^0$] ($\sim\,14\,\text{ppm}$) NV-diamond sensors. We show that low-[N$_\text{s}^0$] diamond can outperform higher-[N$_\text{s}^0$] diamond at moderate and low optical NV excitation intensity. Our results provide practical benchmarks and guidance for selecting NV-diamond sensors tailored to specific experimental constraints and sensing requirements.

Title: Interacting many-body non-Hermitian systems as Markov chains
Authors: Zichang Hao, Wei Jie Chan, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Rich phenomenology emerges at the intersection of non-Hermiticity and many-body dynamics, yet physically realizable implementations remain challenging. In this work, we propose a general formalism that maps non-Hermitian many-body Hamiltonians to the Laplacians of Markov chains, such that wavefunction amplitudes are re-interpreted as stochastic many-body configuration probabilities. Despite explicitly preserving all state transition processes and inheriting analogous non-Hermitian localization and state-space fragmentation, our Markov chain processes exhibit distinct steady-state behavior independently of energetic considerations that govern quantum evolution. We demonstrate our framework with two contrasting representative scenarios, one involving asymmetric (biased) propagation with exclusion interactions, and the other involving flipping pairs of adjacent spins (agents). These results reveal robust and distinctive signatures of non-Hermitian phenomena in classical stochastic settings such as ecological and social networks, and provide a versatile framework for studying non-reciprocal many-body dynamics across and beyond physics.

Title: Emergent Inductance from Chiral Orbital Currents in a Bulk Ferrimagnet
Authors: Gang Cao, Hengdi Zhao, Yu Zhang, Alex Fix, Tristan R. Cao, Dhruva Ananth, Yifei Ni, Gabriel Schebel, Rahul Nandkishore, Itamar Kimchi, Hua Chen, Feng Ye, Lance E. DeLong
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new form of inductance in the bulk ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6, which features strong spin-orbit coupling, large magnetic anisotropy, and pronounced magnetoelastic interactions. Below its Curie temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1]. By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.

Title: Ionization potential and electron affinity of superheavy element 119: relativistic high-order coupled cluster study with QED corrections
Authors: A. R. Saetgaraev, L. V. Skripnikov, I. I. Tupitsyn, D. P. Usov, A. V. Oleynichenko, I. M. Savelyev, N. K. Dulaev, V. M. Shabaev
Abstract: We report a highly accurate \textit{ab initio} study of the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) of element 119. Electronic correlation are treated within the relativistic coupled cluster theory including excitations up to quadruples. The Gaunt electron--electron interaction and quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections are taken into account. The role of high-order correlation effects is analyzed in detail. Our recommended values for the IP and EA are 4.7839(56) eV and 0.6750(71) eV, respectively. These results tighten previous estimates and provide a reference point for future experiments probing periodic-law trends beyond oganesson.

Title: Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry
Authors: Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the Rényi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.

Title: Topological robustness of classical and quantum optical skyrmions in atmospheric turbulence
Authors: Zhenyu Guo, Cade Peters, Nilo Mata-Cervera, Anton Vetlugin, Ruixiang Guo, Pei Zhang, Andrew Forbes, Yijie Shen
Abstract: The degradation of classical and quantum structured light induced by complex media constitutes a critical barrier to its practical implementation in a range of applications, from communication and energy transport to imaging and sensing. Atmospheric turbulence is an exemplary case due to its complex phase structure and dynamic variations, driving the need to find invariances in light. Here we construct classical and quantum optical skyrmions and pass them through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence, revealing the embedded topological resilience of their structure. In the quantum realm, we show that while skyrmions undergo diminished entanglement, their topological characteristics maintain stable. This is paralleled classically, where the vectorial structure is scrambled by the medium yet the skyrmion remains stable by virtue of its intrinsic topological protection mechanism. Our experimental results are supported by rigorous analytical and numerical modelling, validating that the quantum-classical equivalence of the topological behaviour is due to the non-separability of the states and one-sided nature of the channel. Our work blurs the classical-quantum divide in the context of topology and opens a new path to information resilience in noisy channels, such as terrestrial and satellite-to-ground communication networks.

Title: Quantum Mpemba-like effect in Unruh thermalization
Authors: Zihao Wang, Wenjing Chen, Si-Wei Han, Xiaoshan Feng, Linmu Qiao, Zhichun Ouyang, Jun Feng
Abstract: We revisit the thermal nature of the Unruh effect within a quantum thermodynamic framework. For a Unruh-deWitt (UDW) detector in $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that its irreversible thermalization to a Gibbs equilibrium state follows distinct trajectories on the Bloch sphere, which depend on the types of fields the detector interacts with, as well as the spacetime dimensionality. Using thermodynamic process functions, particularly quantum coherence and heat that form the quantum First Law, we characterize the Unruh thermalization through a complementary time evolution between the trajectory-dependent rates of process functions. Grounded in information geometry, we further explore the kinematics of the detector state as it "flows" along the trajectory. In particular, we propose two heating/cooling protocols for the UDW detector undergoing Unruh thermalization. We observe a quantum Mpemba-like effect, characterized by faster heating than cooling in terms of Uhlmann fidelity "distance" change. Most significantly, we establish the maximum fidelity difference as a novel diagnostic that essentially distinguishes between Unruh thermalization and its classical counterpart, i.e., classical thermal bath-driven thermalization of an inertial UDW detector. This compelling criterion may serve as a hallmark of the quantum origin of the Unruh effect in future experimental detection and quantum simulation. Finally, we conclude with a general analysis of Unruh thermalization, starting from equal-fidelity non-thermal states, and demonstrate that the detectors' fidelity and "speed" of quantum evolution still exhibit a Mpemba-like behavior.

Title: Theoretical Proposal of a Digital Closed-Loop Thermal Atomic-Beam Interferometer for High-Bandwidth, Wide-Dynamic-Range, and Simultaneous Absolute Acceleration-Rotation Sensing
Authors: Tomoya Sato, Toshiyuki Hosoya, Martin Miranda, Hiroki Matsui, Yuki Miyazawa, Mikio Kozuma
Abstract: We present a theoretical proposal and simulation study of a digital closed-loop thermal atomic-beam interferometer offering high bandwidth, wide dynamic range, and simultaneous absolute acceleration and rotation sensing, suitable for inertial navigation applications. The scheme synchronizes phase biasing with momentum-kick reversal through the atomic transit time of the interferometer, extracting four interferometric phases to suppress Raman beam path-length errors, while two-photon detuning feedback maintains a pseudo-inertial frame and eliminates cross-coupling. In simulations with a $170^{\circ} {\rm C}$ $^{85}$Rb beam and an interferometer arm length of 100~mm, the approach achieves sensitivities of $3{\rm \mu m / s^2 / \sqrt{Hz}}$ (velocity random walk) and $15{\rm \mu deg / \sqrt{h}}$ (angular random walk), surpassing state-of-the-art inertial sensors.

Title: Path integral approach to quantum thermalization
Authors: Alexander Altland, Kun Woo Kim, Tobias Micklitz
Abstract: We introduce a quasiclassical Green function approach describing the unitary yet irreversible dynamics of quantum systems effectively acting as their own environment. Combining a variety of concepts of quantum many-body theory, notably the nonlinear $\sigma$-model of disordered systems, the $G \Sigma$-formalism for strong correlations, and real time path integration, the theory is capable of describing a wide range of system classes and disorder models. It extends previous work beyond perturbation theory (in inverse Hilbert space dimensions), enabling a description of thermalization dynamics from short scattering times, through the onset of ergodicity at an effective `Thouless time', up to the many-body Heisenberg time. We illustrate the approach with two case studies, (i) a brickwork model of unitarily coupled quantum circuits with and without conserved symmetries, and (ii) an array of capacitively coupled quantum dots. Using the spectral form factor as a test observable, we find good agreement with numerical simulations. We present our formalism in a self-contained and pedagogical manner, aiming to provide a transferable toolbox for the first-principles description of many-body chaotic quantum systems in regimes of strong entanglement.

Title: Topological energy pumping in a quasi-periodically driven four-level system
Authors: Vansh Kaushik, Sayan Choudhury, Tanay Nag
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-periodically driven four-level system that serves as a temporal analog of topological phenomena found in four-band models with intertwined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Under a two-tone drive in the strong-driving regime, the system realizes a two-dimensional synthetic Floquet lattice, thus facilitating the realization of topological energy pumping. For a temporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and absorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a given band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands are added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange is a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model, which we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number. Interestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the drives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the presence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the perfect (imperfect) nature of the fidelity during the time-evolution of the system serves as a characteristic signature of a topological (trivial) phase.

Title: Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring
Authors: Sourav Karmakar, Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Site Basis Excitation Ansatz for Matrix Product States
Authors: Steven R. White
Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient variation of the tangent-space excitation ansatz used to compute elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS). A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta.

Title: Observation of the influence of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations using a cloud-accessible experiment platform of Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Daichi Kagamihara, Hironori Kazuta, Yewei Wu, Noah Fitch, Ippei Danshita
Abstract: Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has allowed physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented convenience. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. Anomalous tunneling, which means low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential, has been theoretically predicted as a characteristic phenomenon of BECs. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy region and experimentally measure their frequencies, finding that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs and stimulate further development and use of cloud-based experiments in this field.

Title: 200 keV energy electron irradiation of single crystal diamond: Quantification of vacancy and nitrogen-vacancy production
Authors: Chloe C Newsom, Lillian B Hughes, Ben L Green, Ania C Bleszynski Jayich, Mark E Newton
Abstract: Electron irradiation and annealing treatments are a method of colour centre/defect creation in diamond. The depth profile of defects created by low energy 200 keV electrons in single crystal high purity (type II) electronic grade diamond grown via chemical vapour deposition has been investigated. The depth profile of monovacancies created was found, using photoluminescence (PL), to decay exponentially, with decay length $12\pm1$ $\mu$m and production rate of $(1.1\pm0.2)\times 10 ^{-1}$ V/e$^{-}$/cm at the surface. The depth distribution of the neutral and negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^{0/-}$) centre, and the 733 nm zero phonon line defect formed during an isochronal annealing study have also been investigated by PL. The observed NV profiles, which do not match the vacancy profiles, can be qualitatively explained in terms of a simple model that includes the formation of vacancy clusters and the nitrogen-divacancy (NV$_{2}$) defect. The production of (NV$^{0/-}$) has been assumed to be nitrogen limited, but this paper has shown that this is not the case, with NVs lost to the production of NV$_{2}$ when the concentration of vacancies greatly exceeds that of substitutional nitrogen.

Title: Super-Quadratic Quantum Speed-ups and Guessing Many Likely Keys
Authors: Timo Glaser, Alexander May, Julian Nowakowski
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of guessing cryptographic keys, drawn from some non-uniform probability distribution $D$, as e.g. in LPN, LWE or for passwords. The optimal classical algorithm enumerates keys in decreasing order of likelihood. The optimal quantum algorithm, due to Montanaro (2011), is a sophisticated Grover search. We give the first tight analysis for Montanaro's algorithm, showing that its runtime is $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$, where $H_{\alpha}(\cdot)$ denotes Renyi entropy with parameter $\alpha$. Interestingly, this is a direct consequence of an information theoretic result called Arikan's Inequality (1996) -- which has so far been missed in the cryptographic community -- that tightly bounds the runtime of classical key guessing by $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$. Since $H_{2/3}(D) < H_{1/2}(D)$ for every non-uniform distribution $D$, we thus obtain a super-quadratic quantum speed-up $s>2$ over classical key guessing. As another main result, we provide the first thorough analysis of guessing in a multi-key setting. Specifically, we consider the task of attacking many keys sampled independently from some distribution $D$, and aim to guess a fraction of them. For product distributions $D = \chi^n$, we show that any constant fraction of keys can be guessed within $2^{H(D)}$ classically and $2 ^{H(D)/2}$ quantumly per key, where $H(\chi)$ denotes Shannon entropy. In contrast, Arikan's Inequality implies that guessing a single key costs $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$ classically and $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$ quantumly. Since $H(D) < H_{2/3}(D) < H_{1/2}(D)$, this shows that in a multi-key setting the guessing cost per key is substantially smaller than in a single-key setting, both classically and quantumly.

Title: Positivity bounds from thermal field theory entropy
Authors: Xin-Yi Liu, Yongjun Xu
Abstract: We present a novel approach to deriving positivity bounds on effective field theories by analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of thermal quantum field systems. Focusing on scalar theories with higher-dimensional operators, we compute the finite-temperature entropy using thermal field theory techniques. We argue that consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles-specifically, the expectation that entropy increases with the introduction of new degrees of freedom-imposes nontrivial constraints on Wilson coefficients. In particular, we show that the coefficient of the leading dimension-8 operator must be strictly positive. This thermodynamic perspective offers an alternative to traditional S-matrix-based derivations of positivity bounds and provides fresh insight into the interplay between entropy, unitarity, and causality in quantum field theory.

Title: Impact of space-time curvature coupling on the vacuum energy induced by a magnetic topological defect in flat space-time of arbitrary dimension
Authors: V.M. Gorkavenko, O.V. Barabash, I.V. Ivanchenko, P.O. Nakaznyi, M.S. Tsarenkova, N.S. Yakovenko, A.O. Zaporozhchenko
Abstract: We have investigated vacuum polarization of a quantized charged massive scalar field in the presence of a magnetic topological defect, modeled as an impenetrable tube of finite thickness carrying magnetic flux. At the tube's surface, we imposed a generalized Robin boundary condition. Our analysis demonstrates that, in flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy is independent of the coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For general Robin boundary conditions, however, the total induced vacuum energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in a flat space-time and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the parameter of the Robin boundary condition. We investigated the dependence of this effect not only on Robin's boundary condition parameter, but also on the tube thickness and the space-time dimensionality. We conclude that careful measurements of vacuum polarization effects in flat space-time may, in principle, provide an independent way to probe the $\xi$ coupling.

Title: Tensor Network based Gene Regulatory Network Inference for Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data
Authors: Olatz Sanz Larrarte, Borja Aizpurua, Reza Dastbasteh, Ruben M. Otxoa, Josu Etxezarreta Martinez
Abstract: Deciphering complex gene-gene interactions remains challenging in transcriptomics as traditional methods often miss higher-order and nonlinear dependencies. This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework leveraging tensor networks (TNs) to optimally map expression data into a lower dimensional representation preserving biological locality. Using Quantum Mutual Information (QMI), a nonparametric measure natural for tensor networks, we quantify gene dependencies and establish statistical significance via permutation testing. This constructs robust interaction networks where the edges reflect biologically meaningful relationships that are resilient to random chance. The approach effectively distinguishes true regulatory patterns from experimental noise and biological stochasticity. To test the proposed method, we recover a gene regulatory network consisted of six pathway genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data comprising over $28.000$ lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, we unveil several triadic regulatory mechanisms. By merging quantum physics inspired techniques with computational biology, our method provides novel insights into gene regulation, with applications in disease mechanisms and precision medicine.

Title: Flux Switching Floquet Engineering
Authors: Ian Powell, Louis Buchalter
Abstract: We present an analysis of a square-lattice Harper-Hofstadter model with a periodically varying magnetic flux with time. By switching the dimensionless flux per plaquette between a set of values $\{p_j/q_j\}$ the Floquet quasienergy spectrum is folded into Q = lcm$\{q_j\}$ bands. We determine closed form analytical solutions for the quasienergy spectrum and Chern numbers for the -1/2 $\to$ 1/2 flux switching case, as well as the Rudner-Lindner-Berg-Levin (RLBL) winding invariants W numerically, and construct the corresponding topological phase diagram for arbitrary driving period. We find that generic flux-switching drives feature interlaced Hofstadter butterfly quasienergy spectra, and the gaps in the spectrum may be labeled according to a Diophantine equation which relates the quasienergy gap index to the fluxes attained in the drive and their associated per-step windings.

Title: Quantum Mpemba effect in a four-site Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Asad Ali, M.I. Hussain, Hamid Arian Zad, H. Kuniyil, M. T. Rahim, Saif Al-Kuwari, Saeed Haddadi
Abstract: We investigated the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model across clean and disordered regimes using exact numerical technique of a four-site lattice under Lindblad dynamics with local dephasing noise. By systematically varying hopping strength, onsite interactions, Stark potentials, and random disorder, we probe relaxation dynamics toward a common steady state using trace distance, relative entropy, entanglement asymmetry, and $\ell_1$-norm of coherence metrics. Our results reveal that QME emerges prominently in the clean-interacting regime, where many-body correlations drive nonlinear relaxation pathways, enabling initially distant states to overtake closer ones. In contrast, non-interacting systems exhibit conventional thermalization, whereas Stark potentials and random disorder suppress QME by inducing localization barriers, with disorder causing milder delays compared to the pronounced effects of Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry proves to be particularly sensitive to the symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME. These findings elucidate the critical role of interactions in anomalous relaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in experimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems.

Title: Quantum State Smoothing for Linear Gaussian Systems
Authors: Kiarn T. Laverick, Areeya Chantasri, Howard M. Wiseman
Abstract: Quantum state smoothing is a technique for assigning a valid quantum state to a partially observed dynamical system, using measurement records both prior and posterior to an estimation time. We show that the technique is greatly simplified for Linear Gaussian quantum systems, which have wide physical applicability. We derive a closed-form solution for the quantum smoothed state, which is more pure than the standard filtered state, whilst still being described by a physical quantum state, unlike other proposed quantum smoothing techniques. We apply the theory to an on-threshold optical parametric oscillator, exploring optimal conditions for purity recovery by smoothing. The role of quantum efficiency is elucidated, in both low and high efficiency limits.

Title: Gaussian decomposition of magic states for matchgate computations
Authors: Joshua Cudby, Sergii Strelchuk
Abstract: Magic states, pivotal for universal quantum computation via classically simulable Clifford gates, often undergo decomposition into resourceless stabilizer states, facilitating simulation through classical means. This approach yields three operationally significant metrics: stabilizer rank, fidelity, and extent. We extend these simulation methods to encompass matchgate circuits (MGCs), and define equivalent metrics for this setting. We begin with an investigation into the algebraic constraints defining Gaussian states, marking the first explicit characterisation of these states. The explicit description of Gaussian states is pivotal to our methods for tackling all the simulation tasks. Central to our inquiry is the concept of Gaussian rank -- a pivotal metric defining the minimum terms required for decomposing a quantum state into Gaussian constituents. This metric holds paramount significance in determining the runtime of rank-based simulations for MGCs featuring magic state inputs. The absence of low-rank decompositions presents a computational hurdle, thereby prompting a deeper examination of fermionic magic states. We find that the Gaussian rank of 2 instances of our canonical magic state is 4 under symmetry-restricted decompositions. Additionally, our numerical analysis suggests the absence of low-rank decompositions for 2 or 3 copies of this magic state. Further, we explore the Gaussian extent, a convex metric offering an upper bound on the rank. We prove the Gaussian extent's multiplicative behaviour on 4-qubit systems, along with initial strides towards proving its sub-multiplicative nature in general settings. One important result in that direction we present is an upper bound on the Gaussian fidelity of generic states.

Title: One Gate Scheme to Rule Them All: Introducing a Complex Yet Reduced Instruction Set for Quantum Computing

Abstract: The design and architecture of a quantum instruction set are paramount to the performance of a quantum computer. This work introduces a gate scheme for qubits with $XX+YY$ coupling that directly and efficiently realizes any two-qubit gate up to single-qubit gates. First, this scheme enables high-fidelity execution of quantum operations and achieves minimum possible gate times. Second, since the scheme spans the entire $\textbf{SU}(4)$ group of two-qubit gates, we can use it to attain the optimal two-qubit gate count for algorithm implementation. These two advantages in synergy give rise to a quantum Complex yet Reduced Instruction Set Computer (CRISC). Though the gate scheme is compact, it supports a comprehensive array of quantum operations. This may seem paradoxical but is realizable due to the fundamental differences between quantum and classical computer architectures. Using our gate scheme, we observe marked improvements across various applications, including generic $n$-qubit gate synthesis, quantum volume, and qubit routing. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also realizes a gate locally equivalent to the commonly used CNOT gate with a gate time of $\frac{\pi}{2g}$, where $g$ is the two-qubit coupling. The AshN scheme is also completely impervious to $ZZ$ error, the main coherent error in transversely coupled systems, as the control parameters implementing the gates can be easily adjusted to take the $ZZ$ term into account.

Title: Efficient entanglement-assisted discrimination of a class of many-copy indistinguishable sets
Authors: Abhay Srivastav, Saronath Halder
Abstract: We explore entanglement as a resource to distinguish locally indistinguishable orthogonal quantum states. Specifically, we consider sets which contain states from an unextendible product basis along with a pure entangled state. We establish a connection between the aforesaid problem and the entanglement-assisted discrimination of a certain class of many-copy indistinguishable sets. The entanglement-assisted protocols that we construct here are quite efficient, as they render the teleportation-based protocols sub-optimal. In fact, a central aspect of our study is to explore the role of Schmidt rank as a resource to distinguish the states of locally indistinguishable sets. Interestingly, we identify an instance where a set of locally indistinguishable orthogonal states remains locally indistinguishable even with access to any finite number of copies, yet becomes perfectly distinguishable using entangled resources of relatively low cost. This fact makes it possible to compare the degrees of local indistinguishability associated with several locally indistinguishable sets within the same Hilbert space. Consequently, we report a hierarchy of local indistinguishability among the many-copy indistinguishable sets. Thereafter, based on our analysis, we present a theoretical proposal for an information processing protocol exhibiting secure locking of information and its resource-efficient extraction. Furthermore, we also find that the hierarchical difference in local indistinguishability can increase with increasing dimension of the Hilbert space.

Title: Covering a Graph with Minimal Local Sets
Authors: Nathan Claudet, Simon Perdrix
Abstract: Local sets, a graph structure invariant under local complementation, have been originally introduced in the context of quantum computing for the study of quantum entanglement within the so-called graph state formalism. A local set in a graph is made of a non-empty set of vertices together with its odd neighborhood. We show that any graph can be covered by minimal local sets, i.e. that every vertex is contained in at least one local set that is minimal by inclusion. More precisely, we introduce an algorithm for finding a minimal local set cover in polynomial time. This result is proved by exploring the link between local sets and cut-rank. We prove some additional results on minimal local sets: we give tight bounds on their size, and we show that there can be exponentially many of them in a graph. Finally, we provide an extension of our definitions and our main result to $q$-multigraphs, the graphical counterpart of quantum qudit graph states.

Title: Nuclear spin relaxation in solid state defect quantum bits via electron-phonon coupling in their optical excited state
Authors: Gergő Thiering, Adam Gali
Abstract: Optically accessible solid state defect spins serve as a primary platform for quantum information processing, where precise control of the electron spin and ancillary nuclear spins is essential for operation. Using the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond as an example, we employ a combined group theory and density functional theory study to demonstrate that spin-lattice relaxation of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin is significantly enhanced due to strong entanglement with orbital degrees of freedom in the $|^3E\rangle$ optical excited state of the defect. This mechanism is common to other solid-state defect nuclear spins with similar optical excited states. Additionally, we propose a straightforward and versatile \textit{ab initio} scheme for predicting orbital-dependent spin Hamiltonians for trigonal defects exhibiting orbital degeneracy.

Title: A Randomized Method for Simulating Lindblad Equations and Thermal State Preparation
Authors: Hongrui Chen, Bowen Li, Jianfeng Lu, Lexing Ying
Abstract: We study a qDRIFT-type randomized method to simulate Lindblad dynamics by decomposing its generator into an ensemble of Lindbladians, $L = \sum_{a \in A} L_a$, where each $L_a$ comprises a simple Hamiltonian and a single jump operator. Assuming an efficient quantum simulation is available for the Lindblad evolution $e^{t L_a}$, we implement $e^{t L_a}$ for a randomly sampled $L_a$ at each time step according to a probability distribution $\mu$ over the ensemble $\{L_a\}_{a \in A}$. This randomized strategy reduces the quantum cost of simulating Lindblad dynamics, particularly in quantum many-body systems with a large or even infinite number of jump operators. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the proposed randomized method, covering both average and typical algorithmic realizations. This analysis extends the known results for the random product formula from closed systems to open systems, ensuring rigorous performance guarantees. Second, based on the random product approximation, we derive a new quantum Gibbs sampler algorithm that utilizes jump operators sampled from a Clifford-random circuit. This generator (i) can be efficiently implemented using our randomized algorithm, and (ii) exhibits a spectral gap lower bound that depends on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Our results present a new instance of a class of Hamiltonians for which the thermal states can be efficiently prepared using a quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm.

Title: Quantum convolutional neural networks for jet images classification
Authors: Hala Elhag, Tobias Hartung, Karl Jansen, Lento Nagano, Giorgio Menicagli Pirina, Alice Di Tucci
Abstract: Recently, interest in quantum computing has significantly increased, driven by its potential advantages over classical techniques. Quantum machine learning (QML) exemplifies one of the important quantum computing applications that are expected to surpass classical machine learning in a wide range of instances. This paper addresses the performance of QML in the context of high-energy physics (HEP). As an example, we focus on the top-quark tagging, for which classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been effective but fall short in accuracy when dealing with highly energetic jet images. In this paper, we use a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for this task and compare its performance with CNN using a classical noiseless simulator. We compare various setups for the QCNN, varying the convolutional circuit, type of encoding, loss function, and batch sizes. For every quantum setup, we design a similar setup to the corresponding classical model for a fair comparison. Our results indicate that QCNN with proper setups tend to perform better than their CNN counterparts, particularly when the convolution block has a lower number of parameters. For the higher parameter regime, the QCNN circuit was adjusted according to the dimensional expressivity analysis (DEA) to lower the parameter count while preserving its optimal structure. The DEA circuit demonstrated improved results over the comparable classical CNN model.

Title: The Gravito-Phononic Effect: A Quantum Signature of Linearised Gravity
Authors: Germain Tobar, Oscar Berg
Abstract: The photo-electric effect was a historic milestone in the development of quantum theory, revealing the first evidence of discrete energy of the electromagnetic field through hallmark signatures such as the threshold frequency, intensity-independent energy transfer, and the near instantaneous ejection of photo-electrons. Here, we discuss the photo-electric effect through the lens of semi-classical, quantum, and neo-classical models. We provide a pedagogical outline for how two coupled harmonic oscillators, under a beam-splitter interaction, can exhibit hallmark signatures analogous to the photo-electric effect, including resonance conditions and quantised energy absorption. We discuss the implications of this model for recently proposed graviton detection protocols. This further clarifies that a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect, modelled as discrete energy transfer between harmonic oscillators can provide the first evidence of the graviton.

Title: Bayesian Quantum Amplitude Estimation
Authors: Alexandra Ramôa, Luis Paulo Santos
Abstract: We present BAE, a problem-tailored and noise-aware Bayesian algorithm for quantum amplitude estimation. In a fault tolerant scenario, BAE is capable of saturating the Heisenberg limit; if device noise is present, BAE can dynamically characterize it and self-adapt. We further propose aBAE, an annealed variant of BAE drawing on methods from statistical inference, to enhance robustness. Our proposals are parallelizable in both quantum and classical components, offer tools for fast noise model assessment, and can leverage preexisting information. Additionally, they accommodate experimental limitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We propose a robust benchmark for amplitude estimation algorithms and use it to test BAE against other approaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios. In both cases, it achieves lower error than any other algorithm as a function of the cost. In the presence of decoherence, it is capable of learning when other algorithms fail.

Title: Quantum Error Correction near the Coding Theoretical Bound
Authors: Daiki Komoto, Kenta Kasai
Abstract: Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.

Title: Learning agent-based approach to the characterization of open quantum systems
Authors: Lorenzo Fioroni, Ivan Rojkov, Florentin Reiter
Abstract: Characterizing quantum processes is crucial for the execution of quantum algorithms on available quantum devices. A powerful framework for this purpose is the Quantum Model Learning Agent (QMLA) which characterizes a given system by learning its Hamiltonian via adaptive generations of informative experiments and their validation against simulated models. Identifying the incoherent noise of a quantum device in addition to its coherent interactions is, however, as essential. Precise knowledge of such imperfections of a quantum device allows to devise strategies to mitigate detrimental effects, for example via quantum error correction. We introduce the open Quantum Model Learning Agent (oQMLA) framework to account for Markovian noise through the Liouvillian formalism. By simultaneously learning the Hamiltonian and jump operators, oQMLA independently captures both the coherent and incoherent dynamics of a system. The added complexity of open systems necessitates advanced algorithmic strategies. Among these, we implement regularization to steer the algorithm towards plausible models and an unbiased metric to evaluate the quality of the results. We validate our implementation in simulated scenarios of increasing complexity, demonstrating its robustness to hardware-induced measurement errors and its ability to characterize systems using only local operations. Additionally, we develop a scheme to interface oQMLA with a publicly available superconducting quantum computer, showcasing its practical utility. These advancements represent a significant step toward improving the performance of quantum hardware and contribute to the broader goal of advancing quantum technologies and their applications.

Title: Impossibility of Quantum Private Queries
Authors: Esther Hänggi, Severin Winkler
Abstract: Symmetric private information retrieval is a cryptographic task allowing a user to query a database and obtain exactly one entry without revealing to the owner of the database which element was accessed. The task is a variant of general two-party protocols called one-sided secure function evaluation and is closely related to oblivious transfer. Under the name quantum private queries, quantum protocols have been proposed to solve this problem in a cheat-sensitive way: In such protocols, it is not impossible for dishonest participants to cheat, but they risk detection [V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, and L. Maccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 230502 (2008)]. We give an explicit attack against any cheat-sensitive symmetric private information retrieval protocol, showing that any protocol that is secure for the user cannot have non-trivial security guarantees for the owner of the database.

Title: Incoherent behavior of partially distinguishable photons
Authors: Emilio Annoni, Stephen C. Wein
Abstract: Photon distinguishability is a key factor limiting quantum interference in photonic devices, directly impacting the performance of protocols such as Boson Sampling and photonic quantum computing. We present a basis-independent framework for analyzing multi-photon interference, identifying a necessary and sufficient condition under which distinguishability behaves as a stochastic error process. This condition enables any multi-photon state to be uniquely expressed as a classical mixture of partition states -- discrete configurations representing different patterns of photon distinguishability. We introduce an experimentally implementable operation, analogous to Pauli twirling, that enforces this condition without compromising computational hardness. The resulting probability distribution over partition states defines the system's incoherent distinguishability spectrum, which we show can be fully characterized through a specific set of experiments. Building on this structure, we also demonstrate the existence of an error mitigation strategy. This framework clarifies key challenges in defining genuine multi-photon indistinguishability, links previous perspectives on partial distinguishability, and provides a rigorous foundation for robust photonic protocols.

Title: Interferometric detection of continuous-variable entanglement using two states
Authors: Elena Callus, Martin Gärttner, Tobias Haas
Abstract: The efficient witnessing and certification of entanglement is necessitated by its ubiquitous use in various aspects of quantum technologies. In the case of continuous-variable bipartite systems, the Shchukin--Vogel hierarchy gives necessary conditions for separability in terms of moments of the mode operators. In this work, we derive mode-operator-based witnesses for continuous-variable bipartite entanglement relying on the interference of two states. Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states. We also take into account experimental noise, including photon loss and detection inefficiency, as well as finite measurement statistics.

Title: Coexistence of continuous-variable quantum key distribution and classical data over 120-km fiber
Authors: Adnan A.E. Hajomer, Ivan Derkach, Vladyslav C. Usenko, Ulrik L. Andersen, Tobias Gehring
Abstract: Integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) with classical data transmission over the same fiber is crucial for scalable quantum-secured communication. However, noise from classical channels limits QKD distance. We demonstrate the longest-distance continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) over 120 km (20 dB loss) in the asymptotic regime, and over 100 km (17 dB loss) in the finite-size regime, both coexisting with a fully populated coarse wavelength division multiplexing system. Natural mode filtering of the local oscillator and phase noise mitigation enabled this without additional filtering or wavelength reallocation. Benchmarking against a commercial discrete-variable QKD system and considering finite-size effects confirms the feasibility of CV-QKD as a plug-and-play solution for typical 80-100 km long-haul optical networks. Our results set a record fiber distance for CV-QKD, showing its potential for cost-effective, large-scale deployment in existing network infrastructure.

Title: On Sufficient and Necessary Criteria of Multipartite Quantum Entanglement
Authors: Zhi-Bo Chen, Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: Based on the generalized Bloch representation, we study the separability and entanglement of arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum states. Some sufficient and some necessary criteria are presented. For certain states, these criteria together are both sufficient and necessary. Detailed examples show that our criteria are better than some existing ones in identifying separability. Based on these criteria, the largest separable ball around the maximally mixed state for arbitrary multi-qubit systems is found, and it is proved that its radius defined via the $l_1$-norm of the Bloch vector is the constant 1. Furthermore, the criteria in this paper can be implemented experimentally.

Title: Degree of simplicity of Floquet states of a periodically driven Bose-Hubbard dimer
Authors: Steffen Seligmann, Martin Holthaus
Abstract: We investigate numerically computed Floquet states of a Bose-Hubbard dimer which is subjected to strong, time-periodic forcing with respect to their coherence, invoking a measure for their degree of simplicity previously suggested by Leggett. This serves to ascertain the validity of the mean-field approximation under conditions such that the time-dependent nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation has chaotic solutions. It is shown that for sufficiently large particle numbers the exact N-particle Floquet state semiclassically associated with the innermost quantized invariant tube surrounding a stable periodic mean-field orbit represents a macroscopically occupied single-particle state, i.e., a Floquet condensate.

Title: Dissipative qutrit-mediated stable charging
Authors: Chen-yi Zhang, Jun Jing
Abstract: In this work, we propose a stable charging scheme mediated by a three-level system (qutrit), which renders a unidirectional energy flow from an external power source to an $(N+1)$-dimensional quantum battery. By virtue of the qutrit dissipation, the battery avoids the spontaneous discharging induced by the time-reversal symmetry of any unitary-charging scheme. Irrespective of the initial state, the battery can be eventually stabilized at the maximal-ergotropy state as long as the charger-battery interaction is present. We use a Dyson series of Lindbladian superoperator to obtain an effective master equation for the battery, which is found to be equivalent to the high-order Fermi's golden rule adapted to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and spontaneous decay. We extract the optimization condition for charging efficiency and justify it in the finite-size battery with uniform energy splitting, the large spin battery, and the truncated harmonic-oscillator battery.

Title: Physical origins and limitations of canonical quantum measurement behavior
Authors: Jonathan F. Schonfeld
Abstract: I review and augment my work of the last few years on the physical origins and limitations of canonical quantum measurement behavior. Central to this work is a detailed analysis of the microstructure of real measurement devices. Particular attention is paid to the Mott problem, which addresses a simpler version of canonical quantum measurement behavior: It asks why an alpha particle emitted in a nuclear decay produces one and only one track in a cloud chamber. My analysis - entirely consistent with unitarity - leads to an emergent, approximate Born rule supported by experiment, with possible breakdown at very small probability density. I argue that a similar picture applies to other measurement scenarios, including Geiger counters, the Stern-Gerlach experiment and superconducting qubits.

Title: Hadamard Random Forest: Reconstructing real-valued quantum states with exponential reduction in measurement settings
Authors: Zhixin Song, Hang Ren, Melody Lee, Bryan Gard, Nicolas Renaud, Spencer H. Bryngelson
Abstract: Quantum tomography is a crucial tool for characterizing quantum states and devices and estimating nonlinear properties of the systems. Performing full quantum state tomography on an $N_\mathrm{q}$ qubit system requires an exponentially increasing overhead with $O(3^{N_\mathrm{q}})$ distinct Pauli measurement settings to resolve all complex phases and reconstruct the density matrix. However, many potential quantum computing applications, such as linear system solves, require only real-valued amplitudes. We introduce a readout method for real-valued quantum states that reduces measurement settings required for state vector reconstruction to $O(N_\mathrm{q})$; the post-processing cost remains exponential $\Omega(2^{N_\mathrm{q}})$. This approach offers a substantial speedup over conventional tomography. We experimentally validate our method up to 10 qubits on the latest available IBM quantum processor and demonstrate that it accurately extracts key properties such as entanglement and magic. Our method also outperforms the standard SWAP test for state overlap estimation. This calculation resembles a numerical integration in certain cases and can be applied to extract nonlinear properties, which are important in application fields. We further implement the method to readout the solution from a quantum linear solver.

Title: Waveguides in a quantum perspective
Authors: Eddy Collin, Alexandre Delattre
Abstract: Solid state quantum devices, operated at dilution cryostat temperatures, are relying on microwave signals to both drive and read-out their quantum states. These signals are transmitted into the cryogenic environment, out of it towards detection devices, or even between quantum systems by well-designed waveguides, almost lossless when made of superconducting materials. Here we report on the quantum theory that describes the simplest Cartesian-type geometries: parallel plates, and rectangular tubes. The aim of the article is twofold: first on a technical and pragmatic level, we provide a full and compact quantum description of the different traveling wave families supported by these guides. Second, on an ontological level, we interpret the results and discuss the nature of the light fields corresponding to each mode family. The concept of potential difference is extended from transverse electric-magnetic (TEM) waves to all configurations, by means of a specific gauge fixing. The generalized flux $\phi$ introduced in the context of quantum electronics becomes here essential: it is the scalar field, conjugate of a charge $Q$, that confines light within the electrodes, let them be real or virtual. The gap in the dispersion relations of non-TEM waves turns out to be linked either to a potential energy necessary for the photon confinement, or to a kinetic energy arising from a photon mass. We finally compute the field zero-point fluctuations in every configuration. The theory is predictive: the lowest transverse magnetic (TM) modes should have smaller quantum noise than the higher ones, which at large wavevectors recover a conventional value similar to TEM and transverse electric (TE) ones. Such low-noise modes might be particularly useful for the routing of quantum information.

Title: Bloch oscillation with a diatomic tight-binding model on quantum computers
Authors: Peng Guo, Jaime Park, Frank X. Lee
Abstract: We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.

Title: Realistic quantum network simulation for experimental BBM92 key distribution
Authors: Michelle Chalupnik, Brian Doolittle, Suparna Seshadri, Eric G. Brown, Keith Kenemer, Daniel Winton, Daniel Sanchez-Rosales, Matthew Skrzypczyk, Cara Alexander, Eric Ostby, Michael Cubeddu
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide secure key material between two parties without relying on assumptions about the computational power of an eavesdropper. QKD is performed over quantum links and quantum networks, systems which are resource-intensive to deploy and maintain. To evaluate and optimize performance prior to, during, and after deployment, realistic simulations with attention to physical realism are necessary. Quantum network simulators can simulate a variety of quantum and classical protocols and can assist in quantum network design and optimization by offering realism and flexibility beyond mathematical models which rely on simplifying assumptions and can be intractable to solve as network complexity increases. We use a versatile discrete event quantum network simulator to simulate the entanglement-based QKD protocol BBM92 and compare it to our experimental implementation and to existing theory. Furthermore, we simulate secure key rates in a repeater key distribution scenario for which no experimental implementations exist.

Title: Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.

Title: Stability of thermal equilibrium in long-range quantum systems
Authors: Tim Möbus, Jorge Sánchez-Segovia, Álvaro M. Alhambra, Ángela Capel
Abstract: Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound, and hence that stability always holds at high temperature. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analogue simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.

Title: State updates and useful qubits in relativistic quantum information
Authors: José Polo-Gómez, T. Rick Perche, Eduardo Martín-Martínez
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge of consistently updating quantum states after selective measurements in a relativistic spacetime. Standard updates along the future lightcones preserve causality but break correlations between causally disconnected parties, whereas updates along the past lightcone either imply retrocausality or do not respect the causal propagation of information. We introduce a minimal extension of multipartite states to encode subsystem-specific contextual information. This "polyperspective" formalism ensures causally consistent covariant state updates, preserves multipartite correlations, and respects conservation laws.

Title: Multimode feedback cooling of the collective modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Ryan J. Thomas, Jordan A. McMahon, Zain Mehdi, Stuart S. Szigeti, Simon A. Haine, Samuel Legge, John D. Close, Joseph J. Hope
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate cavity-free feedback cooling of the three lowest-lying collective modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a prolate harmonic trap. Using shadowgraph imaging as an in situ probe of the atomic density, we measure the time-dependent centers of mass and widths of the condensate in two dimensions and use these measurements to damp oscillations in the two visible dipole modes and the low-frequency quadrupole mode. By inducing oscillations in the condensate, we show that we can efficiently damp the dipole modes to a final mean phonon occupancy per atom of $<1$.

Title: Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity
Authors: Amit Vikram
Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling dynamics such as in random unitary circuits. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.

Title: Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness Beacon
Authors: Ignatius William Primaatmaja, Hong Jie Ng, Koon Tong Goh
Abstract: Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) is the gold standard for generating truly random numbers, as it can produce certifiably random numbers from untrusted devices. However, the stringent device requirements of traditional DIQRNG protocols have limited their practical applications. Here, we introduce Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness Beacon (DIPQRB), a novel approach to generate random numbers from untrusted devices based on routed Bell tests. This method significantly relaxes the device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.

Title: Rise and fall of nonstabilizerness via random measurements
Authors: Annarita Scocco, Wai-Keong Mok, Leandro Aolita, Mario Collura, Tobias Haug
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases, measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time, whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer Rényi Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain quantum computational resources.

Title: On the relation between perspective-neutral, algebraic, and effective quantum reference frames
Authors: Julian De Vuyst, Philipp A. Hoehn, Artur Tsobanjan
Abstract: The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.

Title: Entanglement Certification by Measuring Nonlocality
Authors: Xuan Du Trinh, Zhengyu Wu, Junlin Bai, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Nengkun Yu, Aruna Balasubramanian
Abstract: Reliable verification of entanglement is a central requirement for quantum networks. This paper presents a practical verification approach based on violations of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. We derive tight mathematical bounds that relate the CHSH value to entanglement fidelity and introduce a statistical framework that optimizes resource usage while ensuring reliable certification. Our main contributions are: (i) fidelity bounds derived directly from the CHSH measure, which also enable nonlocality certification at sufficiently high fidelities; (ii) a sample-complexity analysis that quantifies the number of measurements required to achieve desired confidence levels for the CHSH measure and the entanglement fidelity; and (iii) verification protocols, some with rigorous mathematical guarantees and others with numerical evaluation. Using NetSquid, we develop a simulation framework that models diverse network conditions and enables systematic exploration of trade-offs in CHSH-based verification. This framework highlights the interplay between accuracy, efficiency, and operational parameters, providing concrete guidelines for deploying entanglement verification in resource-constrained quantum networks.

Title: Graded Quantum Codes: From Weighted Algebraic Geometry to Homological Chain Complexes
Authors: Tony Shaska
Abstract: We introduce graded quantum codes, unifying two classes of quantum error-correcting codes. The first, quantum weighted algebraic geometry (AG) codes, derives from rational points on hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces over finite fields. This extends classical AG codes by adding weighted degrees and singularities, enabling self-orthogonal codes via the CSS method with improved distances using algebraic structures and invariants like weighted this http URL second class arises from chain complexes of graded vector spaces, generalizing homological quantum codes to include torsion and multiple gradings. This produces low-density parity-check codes with parameters based on homology ranks, including examples from knot invariants and quantum rotors. A shared grading leads to a refined Singleton bound: $d \leq \frac{n - k + 2}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, where $\epsilon > 0$ reflects entropy adjustments from geometric singularities and defects. The bound holds partially for simple orbifolds and is supported by examples over small fields. Applications include post-quantum cryptography, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and optimization via graded neural networks, linking algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and quantum information.

Title: Quantum-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Solutions for Last-Mile On-Demand Delivery
Authors: Farzan Moosavi, Bilal Farooq
Abstract: Quantum computation has demonstrated a promising alternative to solving the NP-hard combinatorial problems. Specifically, when it comes to optimization, classical approaches become intractable to account for large-scale solutions. Specifically, we investigate quantum computing to solve the large-scale Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW). In this regard, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework augmented with a Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is designed to minimize the travel time in a realistic last-mile on-demand delivery. A novel problem-specific encoding quantum circuit with an entangling and variational layer is proposed. Moreover, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) are designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.

Title: Teleportation Fidelity of Binary Tree Quantum Repeater Networks
Authors: Soumit Roy, Md Rahil Miraj, Chittaranjan Hens, Ganesh Mylavarapu, Subrata Ghosh, Indranil Chakrabarty
Abstract: The idea of average of maximum teleportation fidelities was introduced in [1] to measure the capability of the network to act as a resource for distributed teleportation between any pair of nodes. Binary tree network, being a subclass of Cayley tree network, is a significant topological structure used for information transfer in a hierarchical sense. In this article, we consider four types of binary tree repeater networks (directed and undirected, asymmetric and symmetric) and obtain the analytical expressions of the average of the maximum teleportation fidelities for each of these binary tree networks. Our work investigates the role of directionality and symmetry in this measure. Like [1], here also we have used simple Werner state-based models and are able to identify the parameter ranges for which these networks can show quantum advantage. We explore the role of maximally entangled states in the network to enhance the quantum advantage. We explore the large $N$ (nodes) scenario for each of these networks and find out the limiting value of the average of the maximum teleportation fidelity for each of these networks. We also include the scenarios when the Werner state parameters for each link are different and chosen from a uniform distribution. According to our analysis, the directed symmetric binary tree is the most beneficial topology in this context. Our results pave the way to identify the resourceful network in transmitting quantum information.

Title: Simulating Quantum Turbulence with Matrix Product States
Authors: Felipe Gómez-Lozada, Nicolas Perico-García, Nikita Gourianov, Hayder Salman, Juan José Mendoza-Arenas
Abstract: Quantum turbulence spans length scales from the system size $L$ to the healing length $\xi$, making direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation computationally expensive when $L \gg \xi$. We present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale correlations. This approach reduces memory usage by factors ranging from 10x to over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D), capturing key dynamics such as Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited system sizes to uncover novel physics.

Title: Quantum Higher Order Fourier Analysis and the Clifford Hierarchy
Authors: Kaifeng Bu, Weichen Gu, Arthur Jaffe
Abstract: We propose a mathematical framework that we call quantum, higher-order Fourier analysis. This generalizes the classical theory of higher-order Fourier analysis, which led to many advances in number theory and combinatorics. We define a family of quantum measures on a Hilbert space, that reduce in the case of diagonal matrices to the classical uniformity norms. We show that our quantum measures and our related theory of quantum higher-order Fourier analysis characterize the Clifford hierarchy, an important notion of complexity in quantum information. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient analytic condition that a unitary is an element of the k-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.

Title: A Superselection Rule for Quantum Causality
Authors: Issam Ibnouhsein
Abstract: In quantum causality, local laboratories are typically assumed to be operationally independent, each free to choose its own reference frames. We ask whether such independence is compatible with nonclassical correlations, and address this question using the resource-theoretic framework. We formalize local gauge freedom on laboratory connections as a symmetry, and prove that any bipartite process covariant under this symmetry is causally separable. This result holds in arbitrary dimensions and applies both to marginals of multipartite quantum circuits and to general reductions across cuts. Because such covariance enforces a strict superselection rule, it explains why circuit-embeddable dynamics, such as the quantum switch, cannot violate bipartite causal inequalities, even asymptotically. Our analysis thus establishes that generating nonclassical causal correlations requires physical resources that break operational independence.

Title: Cutting stabiliser decompositions of magic state cultivation with ZX-calculus
Authors: Kwok Ho Wan, Zhenghao Zhong
Abstract: We apply the cutting stabiliser decomposition techniques [arXiv:2403.10964] to the quantum states generated from magic state cultivation [arXiv:2409.17595], post-selected upon all $+1$ measured values for simplicity. The resultant states to the $d=3$ and $d=5$ variant magic state cultivation circuits can be expressed as a sum of $4$ and $8$ Clifford ZX-digrams respectively. Modifications to existing ZX-calculus stabiliser decomposition methods may enable better simulation of non-Clifford circuits containing a moderate number of $T$ gates in the context of quantum error correction.

Title: Optimizing digital quantum simulation of open quantum lattice models
Authors: Xie-Hang Yu, Hongchao Li, J. Ignacio Cirac, Rahul Trivedi
Abstract: Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\delta$ in the system-state with $\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ gates, $\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates.

Title: Constructing a Photonic Implementation of Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Alec L. Riso, Karthik Thyagarajan, Connor Whiting, Katherine Jimenez
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) stands as a revolutionary approach to secure communication, using the principles of quantum mechanics to establish unbreakable channels. Unlike traditional cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of mathematical problems, QKD utilizes the inherent properties of quantum states to achieve information-theoretic security. This means that the security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of physics, making it theoretically unbreakable even by an adversary with unlimited computational power. Currently, one of the most viable ways to implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting. This will help demonstrate the protocol's robustness and provide a feasible implementation for educational demonstrations.

Title: Scalable parallel simulation of quantum circuits on CPU and GPU systems
Authors: Guolong Zhong, Yi Fan, Zhenyu Li
Abstract: Quantum computing enables parallelism through superposition and entanglement and offers advantages over classical computing architectures. However, due to the limitations of current quantum hardware in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, classical simulation remains a critical tool for developing quantum algorithms. In this research, we present a comprehensive parallelization solution for the Q$^2$Chemistry software package, delivering significant performance improvements for the full-amplitude simulator on both CPU and GPU platforms. By incorporating batch-buffered overlap processing, dependency-aware gate contraction and staggered multi-gate parallelism, our optimizations significantly enhance the simulation speed compared to unoptimized baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid-level parallelism in HPC systems. Benchmark results show that Q$^2$Chemistry consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art open-source simulators across various circuit types. These benchmarks highlight the capability of Q$^2$Chemistry to effectively handle large-scale quantum simulations with high efficiency and high portability.

Title: Connes spectral distance and nonlocality of generalized noncommutative phase spaces
Authors: Bing-Sheng Lin, Tai-Hua Heng
Abstract: We study the Connes spectral distance of quantum states and analyse the nonlocality of a 4D generalized noncommutative phase space. By virtue of the Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation, we obtain the Dirac operator and construct a spectral triple corresponding to the noncommutative phase space. Based on the ball condition, we obtain some constraint relations about the optimal elements, and then calculate the Connes spectral distance between two Fock states. Due to the noncommutativity, the spectral distances between Fock states in generalized noncommutative phase spaces are shorter than those in normal phase spaces. This shortening of distances implies some type of nonlocality caused by the noncommutativity. These spectral distances in the 4D generalized noncommutative phase space are additive and satisfy the normal Pythagoras theorem. When the noncommutative parameters go to zero, the results return to those in normal quantum phase spaces.

Title: Open boundary conditions of the $D^{(2)}_3$ spin chain and sectors of conformal field theories
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We study open boundary conditions for the $D^{(2)}_3$ spin chain, which shares connections with the six-vertex model, under staggering, and also to the antiferromagnetic Potts model. By formulating a suitable transfer matrix that is related to $K$ matrices and to the Jimbo $R$-matrix, we obtain an analytical expression for the Hamiltonian, as a logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix, under open boundary conditions. Such computations have connections with several objects studied in Integrable Probability, which underlie exactly solvable structures.

Title: Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point
Authors: Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.

Title: Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability for Canonical and non-Canonical Statistics
Authors: Ruo-Xun Zhai, C.P. Sun
Abstract: We extend the Carathéodory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical states from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.

Title: Accurate Unsupervised Photon Counting from Transition Edge Sensor Signals
Authors: Nicolas Dalbec-Constant, Guillaume Thekkadath, Duncan England, Benjamin Sussman, Thomas Gerrits, Nicolás Quesada
Abstract: We compare methods for signal classification applied to voltage traces from transition-edge sensors (TES) which are photon-number resolving detectors fundamental for accessing quantum advantages in information processing, communication and metrology. We quantify the impact of numerical analysis on the distinction of such signals. Furthermore, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to create interpretable and precise photon-number embeddings. We demonstrate that the preservation of local data structures of some nonlinear methods is an accurate way to achieve unsupervised classification of TES traces. We do so by considering a confidence metric that quantifies the overlap of the photon-number clusters inside a latent space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for our dataset previous methods such as the signal's area and principal component analysis can resolve up to 16 photons with confidence above $90\%$ while nonlinear techniques can resolve up to 21 with the same confidence threshold. Also, we showcase implementations of neural networks to leverage information within local structures, aiming to increase confidence in assigning photon numbers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of some nonlinear methods to detect and remove outlier signals.

Title: Observation of quantized vortex in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at Dirac point with emergent spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Yunda Li, Wei Han, Zengming Meng, Wenxin Yang, Cheng Chin, Jing Zhang
Abstract: When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.

Title: Modulating Low-Power Threshold Optical Bistability by Electrically Reconfigurable Free-Electron Kerr Nonlinearity
Authors: Huatian Hu, Gonzalo Álvarez-Pérez, Antonio Valletta, Marialilia Pea, Michele Ortolani, Cristian Ciracì
Abstract: We propose a microscopic mechanism to electrically reconfigure the Kerr nonlinearity by modulating the concentration of free electrons in heavily doped semiconductors under a static bias. Our theory incorporates electrostatic and hydrodynamic frameworks to describe the electronic dynamics, demonstrating electrically tunable linear and nonlinear modulations. The power threshold of achieving optical bistability shows unprecedented tunability over two orders of magnitude, reaching values as low as 10 $\mu$W through surface charge control. These findings offer new insights into understanding and actively controlling Kerr nonlinearities, paving the way for efficient refractive index engineering as well as the development of advanced linear and nonlinear electro-optical modulators.

Title: Ion counting and temperature determination of Coulomb-crystallized laser-cooled ions in traps using convolutional neural networks
Authors: Yanning Yin, Stefan Willitsch
Abstract: Coulomb crystals -- ordered structures of cold ions confined in ion traps -- find applications in a variety of research fields. The number and temperature of the ions forming the Coulomb crystals are two key attributes of interest in many trapped-ion experiments. Here, we present a fast and accurate approach to determining these attributes from fluorescence images of the ions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this approach, we first generate a large number of images of Coulomb crystals with different ion numbers and temperatures using molecular-dynamics simulations and then train CNN models on these images to classify the desired attributes. The classification performance of several common pretrained CNN models was compared in example tasks. We find that for crystals with ion numbers in the range 100--299 and secular temperatures of 5--15 mK, the best-performing model can discern number variations on the level of one ion with an accuracy of 93% and temperature variations by 1 mK with an accuracy of 92%. Since the trained model can be directly integrated into experiments, in-situ determination of these attributes can be realized in a non-invasive fashion, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the analysis and control of trapped ions in real time.

Title: Quantum properties of $H\to VV^*$: precise predictions in the SM and sensitivity to new physics
Authors: Morgan Del Gratta, Federica Fabbri, Priyanka Lamba, Fabio Maltoni, Davide Pagani
Abstract: We study the quantum properties of the Higgs-boson decays into four fermions via two vector bosons $(H\to VV^*\to 4f)$. In particular, we focus on the case of two different-flavour lepton pairs $(H\to ZZ^*\to \mu^+\mu^- e^+ e^-)$. We compute the quantum-information observables for the corresponding two-qutrit system $(ZZ)$ at next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) accuracy in the SM. We find that NLO EW corrections lead to giant (order 1) effects in some specific cases, significantly altering the extraction of observables quantifying the quantum correlations. We identify observables that are robust and can be used to extract reliable information. Finally, we discuss possible new physics (NP) effects, parametrised via an effective-field-theory approach. We show how quantum observables can increase the sensitivity to NP also for the process considered in this study.

Title: Two-media laser threshold magnetometry: A magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold
Authors: Yves Rottstaedt, Lukas Lindner, Florian Schall, Felix A. Hahl, Tingpeng Luo, Florentin Reiter, Takeshi Ohshima, Alexander M. Zaitsev, Roman Bek, Marcel Rattunde, Jan Jeske, Rüdiger Quay
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic-field-dependent contrast and coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at \SI{750}{nm} while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the shot-noise-limited magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 49.07(33) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized NV-diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 ft/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.

Title: Profile control of fibre-based micro-mirrors using adaptive laser shooting with $\textit{in situ}$ imaging
Authors: Shaobo Gao, Vishnu Kavungal, Shuma Oya, Daichi Okuno, Ezra Kassa, William J. Hughes, Peter Horak, Hiroki Takahashi
Abstract: Fibre Fabry-Perot cavities (FFPCs) are used in various studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and quantum technologies due to the cavity's small mode volume and compact integration with optical fibres. We develop a novel $\text{CO}_2$ laser machining method that produces well-controlled surface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibres. Using multiple shots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting algorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting to suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by $\textit{in situ}$ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection and the usage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is a newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls the accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots and as a result determines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We fabricate fibre-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250 $\mu$m to 700 $\mu$m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 $\mu$m in either Gaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our adaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100\% success rate in the production of desired profiles with low ellipticity. After furnishing the laser machined fibre end facets with high reflectivity coating, FFPCs are formed to demonstrate a high finesse up to 150,000 at an optical wavelength of 854 nm.

Title: More on genuine multi-entropy and holography
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka, Simon Lin, Mitsuhiro Nishida
Abstract: By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2502.07995, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo description of correlated electrons in two-dimensional FeSe
Authors: S. Azadi, A. Principi, R. V. Belosludov, T. D. Kühne, M.S. Bahramy
Abstract: An interesting question in physics is how the correlation energy of atoms evolves upon forming a solid. Here, we address this problem for a specific case of double-layer FeSe. We used many-body wavefunction-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to compute the correlation energies of double-layer FeSe with different geometrical configurations and compared them with those of isolated Fe and Se atoms. Variational and diffusion QMC calculations were carried out with Slater Jastrow trial wavefunctions employing two alternative forms for the homogeneous two-body pair correlation term. The ground-state energy was obtained in the thermodynamic limit using two types of trial wave functions of JDFT, in which only the Jastrow factor is optimized while the Slater determinant is derived from the local density approximation, and JSD, where both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized simultaneously. Our results indicate that the correlation energy of double layer FeSe at the thermodynamic limit is mainly determined by the atomic contributions, with the bonding between atoms playing a comparatively minor role in it. After optimizing the interlayer separation of double-layer FeSe under tensile strain, we analyze the correlation energy as a function of strain and separation. We found that with increasing tensile stretch and interlayer spacing, the correlation energy of double-layer FeSe stochastically approaches that of its constituent atomic fragments.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning in Transportation: A Case Study of Pedestrian Stress Modelling
Authors: Bara Rababah, Bilal Farooq
Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

Title: Quantum-inspired probability metrics define a complete, universal space for statistical learning
Authors: Logan S. McCarty
Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural, social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes ($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.

Title: Dirac particles, spin and photons
Authors: Alexander D. Popov
Abstract: We describe relativistic particles with spin as points moving in phase space $X=T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$, where $T^* R^{1,3}=R^{1,3}\times R^{1,3}$ is the space of coordinates and momenta, and $C^2_L$ and $C^2_R$ are the spaces of representation of the Lorentz group of type $(\frac12 , 0)$ and $(0, \frac12)$. Passing from relativistic mechanics with a Lorentz-invariant Hamiltonian function $H$ on the phase space $X$ to quantum mechanics with a Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$, we introduce two complex conjugate line bundles $L_C^+$ and $L_C^-$ over $X$. Quantum particles are introduced as sections $\Psi_+$ of the bundle $L_C^+$ holomorphic along the space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$, and antiparticles are sections $\Psi_-^{}$ of the bundle $L_C^-$ antiholomorphic along the internal spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are characterized by conserved charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ associated with the structure group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ of the bundles $L_C^\pm$. Wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are governed by relativistic analogue of the Schrödinger equation. We show how fields with spin $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon), spin $s=\frac12$ (Dirac) and spin $s=1$ (Proca fields) arise from these equations in the zeroth, first, and second order expansions of the functions $\Psi_\pm^{}$ in the coordinates of the spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations for these fields follow from the Schrödinger equation on the extended phase space $T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$. Using these results, we also introduce equations describing first quantized photons. We show that taking into account the charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ of the fields $\Psi_\pm$ changes the definitions of the inner products and currents, which eliminates negative energies and negative probabilities from relativistic quantum mechanics.

Title: Note on searching for critical lattice models as entropy critical points from strange correlator
Authors: Anran Jin, Ling-Yan Hung
Abstract: An entropy function is proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 251602] as a way to detect criticality even when the system size is small. In this note we apply this strategy in the search for criticality of lattice transfer matrices constructed based on the topological holographic principle. We find that the combination of strategy is indeed a cost-effective and efficient way of identifying critical boundary conditions, estimating central charges and moreover, plotting entire phase diagrams in a multi-dimensional phase space.
