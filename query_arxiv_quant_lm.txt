Title: Machine Learning for Quantum Noise Reduction
Authors: Karan Kendre
Abstract: Quantum noise fundamentally limits the utility of near-term quantum devices, making error mitigation essential for practical quantum computation. While traditional quantum error correction codes require substantial qubit overhead and complex syndrome decoding, we propose a machine learning approach that directly reconstructs clean quantum states from noisy density matrices without additional qubits. We formulate quantum noise reduction as a supervised learning problem using a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder architecture with a novel fidelity-aware composite loss function. Our method is trained and evaluated on a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 10,000 density matrices derived from random 5-qubit quantum circuits, encompassing five noise types (depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping, bit-flip, and mixed noise) across four intensity levels (0.05-0.20). The CNN successfully reconstructs quantum states across all noise conditions, achieving an average fidelity improvement from 0.298 to 0.774 ({\Delta} = 0.476). Notably, the model demonstrates superior performance on complex mixed noise scenarios and higher noise intensities, with mixed noise showing the highest corrected fidelity (0.807) and improvement (0.567). The approach effectively preserves both diagonal elements (populations) and off-diagonal elements (quantum coherences), making it suitable for entanglement-dependent quantum algorithms. While phase damping presents fundamental information-theoretic limitations, our results suggest that CNN-based density matrix reconstruction offers a promising, resource-efficient alternative to traditional quantum error correction for NISQ-era devices. This data-driven approach could enable practical quantum advantage with fewer physical qubits than conventional error correction schemes require.

Title: How Can Quantum Deep Learning Improve Large Language Models?
Authors: Emily Jimin Roh, Hyojun Ahn, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Soohyun Park, Joongheon Kim
Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing, yet the challenge of efficient adaptation remains unresolved. Full fine-tuning achieves strong performance but imposes prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), Prefix tuning, and sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA), address this issue by reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive accuracy. However, these methods often encounter limitations in scalability, stability, and generalization across diverse tasks. Recent advances in quantum deep learning introduce novel opportunities through quantum-inspired encoding and parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). In particular, the quantum-amplitude embedded adaptation (QAA) framework demonstrates expressive model updates with minimal overhead. This paper presents a systematic survey and comparative analysis of conventional PEFT methods and QAA. The analysis demonstrates trade-offs in convergence, efficiency, and representational capacity, while providing insight into the potential of quantum approaches for future LLM adaptation.

Title: Solving Differential Equation with Quantum-Circuit Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Rachana Soni
Abstract: I present a simple hybrid framework that combines physics informed neural networks (PINNs) with features generated from small quantum circuits. As a proof of concept, a first-order equation is solved by feeding quantum measurement probabilities into the neural model. The architecture enforces the initial condition exactly, and training is guided by the ODE residual loss. Numerical results show that the hybrid model reproduces the analytical solution, illustrating the potential of quantum-enhanced PINNs for differential equation solving.

Title: Non-Commutation Chains in Pre- and Post-Selection Paradoxes
Authors: Ouissal Moumou
Abstract: Peculiar measurements can be obtained on systems that undergo both pre- and post-selection. We prove a conjecture from [1] on logical Pre- and Post-Selection (PPS) paradoxes for a restricted case. We prove that all of these paradoxes admit non-commutation chains. We also relate this to the theory of causal balance, recently introduced in [1], and show how the theory blocks such paradoxes.

Title: Beyond Stoquasticity: Structural Steering and Interference in Quantum Optimization
Authors: Vicky Choi
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of the DIC-DAC-DOA algorithm, a non-stoquastic quantum algorithm for solving the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. The algorithm runs in polynomial time and achieves exponential speedup over both transverse-field quantum annealing (TFQA) and classical algorithms on a structured family of NP-hard MIS instances, under assumptions supported by analytical and numerical evidence. The core of this speedup lies in the ability of the evolving ground state to develop both positive and negative amplitudes, enabled by the non-stoquastic XX-driver. This sign structure permits quantum interference that produces negative amplitudes in the computational basis, allowing efficient evolution paths beyond the reach of stoquastic algorithms, whose ground states remain strictly non-negative. In our analysis, the efficiency of the algorithm is measured by the presence or absence of an anti-crossing, rather than by spectral gap estimation as in traditional approaches. The key idea is to infer it from the crossing behavior of bare energy levels of relevant subsystems associated with the degenerate local minima (LM) and the global minimum (GM). The cliques of the critical LM, responsible for the anti-crossing in TFQA, can be efficiently identified to form the XX-driver graph. The resulting speedup can be attributed to two mechanisms: in the first stage, energy-guided localization within the same-sign block steers the ground state smoothly into the GM-supporting region, while in the second stage, the opposite-sign blocks are invoked and sign-generating quantum interference drives the evolution along an opposite-sign path. Finally, we derive scalable reduced models that provide a concrete opportunity for verification of the quantum advantage mechanism on currently available universal quantum computers.

Title: Limitation of Stoquastic Quantum Annealing: A Structural Perspective
Authors: Vicky Choi
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of stoquastic transverse-field quantum annealing (TFQA) on a structured class of Maximum Independent Set (MIS) instances, using the same decomposition framework developed in our companion work on the DIC-DAC-DOA algorithm (Beyond Stoquasticity). For these instances, we provide a structural explanation for the anti-crossing arising from the competition between the energies associated with a set of degenerate local minima (LM) and the global minimum (GM), and analytically derive the associated exponentially small gap. Our analysis proceeds in two steps. First, we reduce the dynamics to an effective two-block Hamiltonian $H_{core}$, constructed from the bare (decoupled) subsystems associated with the LM and GM. This reduction is justified analytically using the structural decomposition. Second, we reformulate the eigenvalue problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem in a non-orthogonal basis constructed from the bare eigenstates of the subsystems. This transformation enables a clean perturbative treatment of the anti-crossing structure, independent of the transverse field, unlike standard perturbation theory approach, which requires treating the transverse field as a small parameter. This paper serves as a supplementary companion to our main work on the DIC-DAC-DOA algorithm, where we demonstrate how appropriately designed non-stoquastic drivers can bypass this tunneling-induced bottleneck.

Title: Qompiler: A Traceable Quantum Circuit Synthesizer for Arbitrary Hamiltonians
Authors: Shoupu Wan
Abstract: We present a quantum compiler framework that bridges the gap between physics modeling and quantum software development. At the core of this framework is a versatile quantum circuit synthesizer capable of decomposing arbitrary Hamiltonians into quantum circuits, represented using a platform-independent B-Tree-based intermediate representation. The B-Tree structure encodes information for gate lineage, enabling detailed tracing information of quantum circuit gates and facilitating circuit verification. The intermediate representation serves as a universal, hardware-agnostic carrier of compiled code, allowing it to be readily rendered on most quantum hardware backends and transpiled into other quantum circuit languages. We demonstrate rendering the intermediate representation into executable quantum circuits in Qiskit and Cirq. We can also transpile the intermediate representation into OpenQASM for broader compatibility.

Title: Classical Feedback in a Quantum Network
Authors: Elina Levi, Uzi Pereg
Abstract: Classical communication over a quantum multiple access channel (MAC) is considered. Since the no-cloning prohibits universal copying of arbitrary quantum states, classical feedback is generated through measurement. An achievable rate region is derived using superposition block Markov coding and a quantum multiparty lemma for the analysis. Our region generalizes both the classical Cover-Leung region and the generalized feedback region. As an example, we show that the quantum binary adder MAC can benefit from feedback.

Title: Unital Kadison-Schwarz Maps
Authors: Hajir Al Zadjali, Farrukh Mukhamedov
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is an important phenomenon in quantum information theory. To detect entanglement theoretically, positive but not completely positive maps are used. The Kadison-Schwarz (KS) inequality interpolates between positivity and complete positivity. KS maps may be key to understanding and detecting entanglement. We provide a description of a subset of KS maps on $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ that are unital. This allows for the classification of a wider class of positive maps than the well known bistochastic maps. We derive the conditions for a unital map to be a KS map, and provide non-trivial examples of such a map.

Title: Multimode Gaussian steady state engineering in optomechanical systems with a squeezed reservoir
Authors: Nahid Yazdi, Stefano Zippilli, David Vitali
Abstract: We investigate a theoretical protocol for the dissipative stabilization of mechanical quantum states in a multimode optomechanical system composed of multiple optical and mechanical modes. The scheme employs a single squeezed reservoir that drives one of the optical modes, while the remaining optical modes mediate an effective phonon-phonon interaction Hamiltonian. The interplay between these coherent interactions and the dissipation provided by the squeezed bath enables the steady-state preparation of targeted quantum states of the mechanical modes. In the absence of significant uncontrolled noise sources, the resulting dynamics closely approximate the model introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 020402 (2021)]. We analyze the performance of this protocol in generating mechanical cluster states defined on rectangular graphs.

Title: Subtleties in the pseudomodes formalism
Authors: Wynter Alford, Laetitia P. Bettmann, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: The pseudomode method for open quantum systems, also known as the mesoscopic leads approach, consists in replacing a structured environment by a set of auxiliary "pseudomodes" subject to local damping that approximate the environment's spectral density. Determining what parameters and geometry to use for the auxiliary modes, however, is non-trivial and involves many subtleties. In this paper we revisit this problem of pseudomode design and investigate some of these subtleties. In particular, we examine the scenario in which pseudomodes couple to each other, resulting in an effective spectral density that is no longer a sum of Lorentzians. We show that non-diagonalizability of the pseudomodes' effective single-particle non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can lead to terms in the effective spectral density which cannot be obtained by diagonalizable non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We also present a method for constructing the pseudomode parameters to exactly match a fit to a spectral density, and in doing so illuminate the enormous freedom in this process. The case of many uncoupled pseudomodes is explored, and we show how, contrary to conventional assumption, the effective spectral density does not necessarily converge in the limit of an infinite number of pseudomodes; we attribute this to the non-completeness of Lorentzians as basis functions. Finally, we discuss how the notion of effective spectral densities can also emerge in the context of scattering theory for non-interacting systems.

Title: Data Complexity: a threshold between Classical and Quantum Machine Learning -- Part I
Authors: Christophe Pere
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) holds promise for accelerating pattern recognition, optimization, and data analysis, but the conditions under which it can truly outperform classical approaches remain unclear. Existing research often emphasizes algorithms and hardware, while the role of data itself in determining quantum advantage has received less attention. We argue that data complexity -- the structural, statistical, algorithmic, and topological richness of datasets -- is central to defining these conditions. Beyond qubit counts or circuit depth, the real bottleneck lies in the cost of embedding, representing, and generalizing from data. In this paper (Part I of a two-part series), we review classical and quantum metrics of data complexity, including entropy, correlations, compressibility, and topological invariants such as persistent homology and topological entanglement entropy. We also examine their implications for trainability, scalability, and error tolerance in QML. Part II will develop a unified framework and provide empirical benchmarks across datasets, linking these complexity measures to practical performance.

Title: Locally Purified Maximally Mixed States At Scale: Entanglement Pruning and Symmetries
Authors: Amit Jamadagni, Eugene Dumitrescu
Abstract: Locally Purified Density Operators (LPDOs) are state-of-the-art tensor network ansatze candidates that efficiently represent mixed quantum states at scale. However, given their non-uniqueness, their representational complexity is generally sub-optimal in practical computations. In this work we perform a comprehensive numerical and analytical analysis and resolve this issue in the experimentally relevant limit where noise depolarizes the density operator into a maximally mixed state. To resolve the sub-optimality issue, we analyze two numerical tools, one analytic method, and detail the relations between them. The numerical tools used are fidelity-preserving truncations and isometric gauge transformations leveraging Riemannian optimizations over entropic objective functions. In addition, by invoking the injectivity and symmetry constraints of the maximally mixed LPDO, we also present analytical closed-form expressions for the disentangler and discuss their relation to numerical optimizers. Our work shows how, by minimizing the resources required to represent key states of practical interest in experiment, the efficiency of tensor network algorithms can be substantially increased. This paves the path for uncovering tensor network's fundamental scalability limits and latent potential in representing the wide locus of mixed quantum states that are accessible on near-term quantum devices.

Title: Geometric Construction of Dynamically Corrected Quantum Gates
Authors: Shingo Kukita, Yasushi Kondo
Abstract: The foundation of quantum technologies lies in the precise control of quantum systems. It is crucial to implement dynamically corrected quantum gates (DCQG), which compensate for individual quantum gate errors to make them more resilient to errors alongside quantum error correction. Off-resonance error (ORE), which originates from fluctuation and mis-calibration of resonance frequencies of qubits, is one of the most critical error types to be compensated. There have been many studies on constructing DCQGs robust against ORE up to its first this http URL construction of second-order robust DCQGs against ORE has been discussed less. Recently, the geometric meaning of the second-order robustness against ORE was uncovered. From this implication, we propose a geometric construction of second-order DCQGs against ORE using a first-order DCQG as a seed.

Authors: Joanna K. Kalaga, Jan Perina Jr
Abstract: The states of a three-mode bosonic system with the restricted Hilbert space are discussed in the context of quantum entanglement and squeezing of quantum fluctuations. The states exhibiting non-zero tripartite entanglement are considered. Mutual relations between the two- and three-mode entanglement quantified by the corresponding negativities and the squeezing described by the corresponding principal squeeze variances are revealed. Entangled three-qubit states exhibiting squeezing are identified.

Title: Quantum Algorithms for Solving Generalized Linear Systems via Momentum Accelerated Gradient and Schrödingerization
Authors: Qitong Hu, Xiaoyang He, Shi Jin, Xiao-Dong Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that combines the momentum accelerated gradient method with Schrödingerization [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett, 133 (2024), 230602][S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603], achieving polynomial speedup over its classical counterpark in solving linear systems. The algorithm achieves a query complexity of the same order as the Schrödingerization based damped dynamical system method, namely, linear dependence on the condition number of the matrix, and can overcome the practical limitations of existing non-Schrödingerization-based quantum linear system algorithms. These limitations stem from their reliance on techniques such as VTAA and RM, which introduce substantial quantum hardware resource overhead. Furthermore, it demonstrates both theoretically and experimentally that the auxiliary variables introduced by our method do not dominate the error reduction at any point, thereby preventing a significant increase in the actual evolution time compared to the theoretical prediction. In contrast, the damped method fails to meet this criterion. This gives new perspectives for quantum algorithms for linear systems, establishing a novel analytical framework for algorithms with broader applicability, faster convergence rates, and superior solution quality.

Title: Solving Linear Systems of Equations with the Quantum HHL Algorithm: A Tutorial on the Physical and Mathematical Foundations for Undergraduate Students
Authors: Lucas Q. Galvão, Anna Beatriz M. de Souza, Alexandre Oliveira S. Santos, André Saimon S. Sousa, Clebson Cruz
Abstract: Quantum computing enables the efficient resolution of complex problems, often outperforming classical methods across various applications. In 2009, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd proposed an algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, demonstrating exponential speedup (under ideal conditions) with a complexity of $poly(\log N)$, in contrast to classical approaches, which in the general case exhibit a complexity of $O(N^3)$, although they can achieve $O(N)$ in specific cases involving sparse matrices. This algorithm holds promise for advancements in machine learning, the solution of differential equations, linear regression, and cryptographic analysis. However, its structure is intricate, and there is a notable lack of detailed instructional materials in the literature. In this context, this paper presents a tutorial addressing the physical and mathematical foundations of the HHL algorithm, aimed at undergraduate students, explaining its theoretical construction and its implementation for solving linear equation systems. After discussing the underlying mathematical and physical concepts, we present numerical examples that illustrate the evolution of the quantum circuit. Finally, the algorithm's complexity, limitations, and future prospects are analyzed. The examples are compared with their classical simulations, allowing for an operational assessment of the algorithm's performance.

Title: Auxiliary-Qubit-Free Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for the Minimum Dominating Set Problem
Authors: Guanghui Li, Xiaohui Ni, Junjian Su, Sujuan Qin, Fenzhuo Guo, Bingjie Xu, Wei Huang, Fei Gao
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum devices. One such problem is the Minimum Dominating Set (MDS), which is NP-hard in graph theory. Existing QAOA studies for the MDS problem typically require a large number of auxiliary qubits, which increases hardware demands and hinders scalability on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this paper, we propose an auxiliary-qubit-free QAOA for the MDS problem. Unlike previous studies that introduce auxiliary variables to convert inequality constraints into equalities, our algorithm utilizes Boolean algebra to perform this transformation, eliminating the need for auxiliary qubits. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable performance to the existing best QAOA for this problem while using fewer qubits. Additionally, an ablation study based on multi-angle QAOA reveals that the solution quality of the algorithm can be further improved by replacing shared circuit parameters with independent ones.

Title: A blueprint for robust, high-temperature quantum entanglement with PT-symmetric molecular optomechanics
Authors: E. Kongkui Berinyuy, C. Tchodimou, P. Djorwé, S. K. Singh, S. G. Nana Engo
Abstract: We introduce and conduct a theoretical analysis of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system, presenting a framework for generating multipartite quantum entanglement that is both robust and highly adjustable. The system leverages a sophisticated synergy of collective molecular enhancement, nonreciprocal directional coupling, and engineered $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dissipation. A central finding is the exceptional thermal resilience of this entanglement, which persists robustly at and well above room temperature, with a practical operational ceiling limited by material stability around \SI{700}{\kelvin}. This remarkable resilience, driven by ultra-high-frequency molecular vibrations and collective $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement, positions our system as a leading candidate for developing robust, high-temperature quantum technologies. Notably, our work directly addresses the performance trade-offs inherent in nonlinear enhancement schemes. By employing a two-collective-mode model to explicitly investigate vibration-vibration correlations, our $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric architecture achieves a balanced and powerful enhancement across all investigated bipartite entanglement channels: inter-cavity ($E_{ac}$), cavity-molecule ($E_{aB_1}$, $E_{cB_2}$), and critically, vibration-vibration ($E_{B_1B_2}$). These findings, rigorously validated within stable operational regimes, establish $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric McOM as a versatile platform for engineering advanced quantum information technologies

Title: On the accuracy of twirled approximations in repeater chains
Authors: Bethany Davies, Guus Avis, Stephanie Wehner
Abstract: In the performance analysis of quantum networks, it is common to approximate bipartite entangled states as either being Bell-diagonal or Werner states. We refer to these as twirled approximations because it is possible to bring any state to such a form with a twirling map. Although twirled approximations can simplify calculations, they can lead to an inaccuracy in performance estimates. The goal of this work is to quantify this inaccuracy. We consider repeater chains where end-to-end entanglement is achieved by performing an entanglement swap at each repeater in the chain. We consider two scenarios: postselected and non-postselected entanglement swapping, where postselection is performed based on the Bell-state measurement outcomes at the repeaters. We show that, for non-postselected swapping, the Bell-diagonal approximation is exact for the computation of the Bell-diagonal elements of the end-to-end state. We also find that the Werner approximation accurately approximates the end-to-end fidelity when the infidelity of each initial state is small with respect to the number of repeaters in the chain. For postselected swapping, we find bounds on the difference in end-to-end fidelity from what is obtained with the twirled approximation, for initial states with a general noisy form. Finally, for the example of performing quantum key distribution over a repeater chain, we demonstrate how our insights can be used to understand how twirled approximations affect the secret-key rate.

Title: Knowledge Distillation for Variational Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks on Heterogeneous Data
Authors: Kai Yu, Binbin Cai, Song Lin
Abstract: Distributed quantum machine learning faces significant challenges due to heterogeneous client data and variations in local model structures, which hinder global model aggregation. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for variational quantum convolutional neural networks on heterogeneous data. The framework features a quantum gate number estimation mechanism based on client data, which guides the construction of resource-adaptive VQCNN circuits. Particle swarm optimization is employed to efficiently generate personalized quantum models tailored to local data characteristics. During aggregation, a knowledge distillation strategy integrating both soft-label and hard-label supervision consolidates knowledge from heterogeneous clients using a public dataset, forming a global model while avoiding parameter exposure and privacy leakage. Theoretical analysis shows that proposed framework benefits from quantum high-dimensional representation, offering advantages over classical approaches, and minimizes communication by exchanging only model indices and test outputs. Extensive simulations on the PennyLane platform validate the effectiveness of the gate number estimation and distillation-based aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that the aggregated global model achieves accuracy close to fully supervised centralized training. These results shown that proposed methods can effectively handle heterogeneity, reduce resource consumption, and maintain performance, highlighting its potential for scalable and privacy-preserving distributed quantum learning.

Title: Driving the Unruh Response
Authors: Kevin Player
Abstract: The Unruh effect, central to quantum field theory in curved spacetime, states that uniformly accelerated observers perceive the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal ensemble of Rindler excitations. Building on this foundation and drawing analogies from squeezing in quantum optics, we investigate how entangled, non-thermal excitations generated by bilocal driving sources contribute to the accelerated response. These paired excitations act as inertial microstates within the thermal Unruh ensemble, suggesting that portions of the effect can be interpreted as source-driven. To capture this, we employ modular automorphisms from algebraic QFT to track localization of modes and observers across nested Rindler wedges. We then construct compact wave-packet approximations using parabolic cylinder functions, providing a smooth interpolation between wedge-supported thermal modes and fully localized non-thermal excitations. This approach situates the Unruh response within a broader framework where standard thermality emerges alongside, and sometimes from, localized source-induced structure.

Title: Navigating entanglement via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange: Snake, bouncing, boundary-residing, pulse, and damping-stabilized time-frozen trajectories
Authors: Son-Hsien Chen, Seng Ghee Tan, Ching-Ray Chang
Abstract: Entanglement dynamics are fundamental to quantum technologies, yet navigating their temporal profiles (trajectories) remains challenging. Here, we propose a scalable solid-state platform based on RKKY exchange, where two spin qubits couple to a central spin qudit that oscillatorily spin-polarizes the surrounding conduction electrons. We introduce the exchange-time integral (ETI), which maps the spatial motion of the qubits to a time-dependent exchange interaction and serves as an effective "trajectory clock" governing the system evolution. We focus specifically on entanglement trajectories initially near the entanglement-unentanglement boundary, with the distance to this boundary quantified by concurrence extended to include negative values. By alternating the sign changes of the exchange, implemented through vibrational motion of qubits, the ETI enables programmable entanglement trajectories. For in-phase and antiphase vibrations, including scenarios with controlled stopping at the RKKY exchange-free nodes, we identify distinctive trajectories: snake (repeatedly crossing the boundary), bouncing (immediately reversing upon reaching the boundary), boundary-residing (remaining at the transition point), and pulse (controllable entanglement intervals). The vibration phase creates asymmetric shifts to the trajectories. The proposed device offers built-in error correction against dephasing by utilizing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. Out-of-phase vibrations drive trajectories away from the boundary, accessing larger entanglement values but with irregular/unsteady final states. To stabilize these trajectories, we introduce a damping mechanism. Our framework offers a systematic method for navigating and engineering entanglement dynamics in quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum computation, cryptography, and metrology.

Title: A Collisional Model Approach to Quantum Phase Sensitivity
Authors: S. Elham Mousavigharalari, Deniz Türkpençe
Abstract: We investigate how relative phase information, encoded by a single qubit $H\,\varphi\,H$ gate sequence, is reflected in the quantum Fisher information (QFI) under noisy dynamics. Within a collision model framework, algorithmically prepared reservoir units imprint a $\varphi$ dependent signature on the steady state of a probe qubit, which permits a closed form evaluation of the QFI. To corroborate this reservoir based prediction, we perform a device level simulation of the same gate sequence using effective two level dynamics with parameters motivated by transmon devices. In this description the noisy gate segment is modeled by a Gaussian modulated drive evolving under open system dynamics. Across both treatments the resulting QFI profile exhibits the same qualitative dependence on the encoded phase, despite the distinct underlying mechanisms. Beyond conceptual agreement, the steady state perspective provides a tomography free metric for phase fragility that can inform biased noise error correction and guide compiler and pulse choices in near term quantum hardware.

Title: Variational processing of multimode squeezed light
Authors: Aviv Karnieli, Paul-Alexis Mor, Charles Roques-Carmes, Eran Lustig, Jamison Sloan, Jelena Vučković, David A. B. Miller, Shanhui Fan
Abstract: Integrated multimode quantum optics is a promising platform for scalable continuous-variable quantum technologies leveraging multimode squeezing in both the spatial and spectral domains. However, on-chip measurement, routing and processing the relevant ``supermodes'' over which the squeezing resource is distributed still scales quadratically with the number of modes $N$, causing rapid increase in photonic circuit size and number of required measurements. Here, we introduce a variational scheme, relying on self-configuring photonic networks (SCN) that learns and extracts the most-squeezed supermodes sequentially, reducing both the circuit size and the experimental overhead. Using homodyne measurement as a cost function, a sparse SCN discovers the $l\ll N$ most significant supermodes using $O(lN)$ physical elements and optimization steps. We analyze and numerically simulate these architectures for both real-space and frequency-domain implementations, showing a fidelity close to unity between the learned circuit and the supermode decomposition, even in the presence of optical losses and detection noise. In the frequency domain, we show that circuit size can be further reduced by using inverse-designed surrogate networks, which emulate the layers learned thus far. Using two different frequency encoding schemes -- uniformly- and non-uniformly-spaced frequency bins -- we reduce an entire network (learning all $N$ supermodes) to $O(N)$ and even $O(1)$ modulated cavities. Our results point toward chip-scale, resource-efficient quantum processing units and demultiplexers for continuous variable processing in multimode quantum optics, with applications ranging from quantum communication, metrology, and computation.

Title: Error stabilized logical qubits in qudit generalizations of the monitored Kitaev model
Authors: Aayush Vijayvargia, Ezra Day-Roberts, Onur Erten
Abstract: Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.

Title: Explicit Quantum Circuit Implementation for Simulating Nonunitary Dynamics via Dilation
Authors: Seonggeun Park
Abstract: Quantum simulation has primarily focused on unitary dynamics, while many physical and engineering systems are governed by nonunitary evolution due to dissipation. Recent studies indicate that such dynamics can be embedded into a larger unitary framework via dilation techniques, but their concrete realization on quantum circuits remains underexplored. In this paper we establish a concrete pipeline that connects the dilation formalism with explicit quantum circuit constructions. On the analytical side, we introduce a discretization of the continuous dilation operator that is tailored for quantum implementation. This construction ensures an exactly skew-Hermitian ancillary generator on the full space, which allows the moment conditions to be satisfied without imposing artificial constraints. We prove that the resulting scheme achieves a global error bound of order $O(M^{-3/2}+M2^{-M/4})$, which can be suppressed arbitrarily by refining the discretization, i.e., by increasing the number of discretization grid points $M$. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that the dilation triple $(F_h,|r_h\rangle,\langle l_h|)$ admits efficient quantum implementations. Using linear combination of unitaries together with primitives such as QFT-adder operators, as well as quantum singular value transformation for preparing the ancillary state, the framework requires resources ranging from $O(\log M)$ to $O((\log M)^2)$ depending on the stage of the pipeline. The block encodings of system operators $H$ and $K$ are left to the specific application, making the method broadly adaptable.

Title: Quantum Printing
Authors: Gabriel Aeppli, Alexander V. Balatsky, Stefano Bonetti, Gabriel Cardoso, Srinivas Raghu, Erlend Syljuåsen, Tien-Tien Yeh, Shi-Zeng Lin, Yuefei Liu, Jonas Weissenrieder, Patrick J. Wong
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum printing -- the imprinting of quantum states from photons and phonons onto quantum matter. The discussion is focusing on charged fluids (metals, superconductors, Hall fluids) and neutral systems (magnets, excitons). We demonstrate how structured light can generate topological excitations, including vortices in superconductors and skyrmions in magnets. We also discuss how quantum printing induces magnetization in quantum paraelectrics and strain-mediated magnetization in Dirac materials. Finally, we propose future applications, such as printing entangled photon states, creating entangled topological excitations, and discuss applications of quantum printing to light induced quantum turbulence in a charged fluid. This review represents the expanded version of the shorter review submitted to Nature Physics.

Title: A Study on Stabilizer Rényi Entropy Estimation using Machine Learning
Authors: Vincenzo Lipardi, Domenica Dibenedetto, Georgios Stamoulis, Mark H.M. Winands
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, as it quantifies the extent to which a quantum state diverges from those states that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, the stabilizer states. The stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) is one of the most investigated measures of nonstabilizerness because of its computational properties and suitability for experimental measurements on quantum processors. Because computing the SRE for arbitrary quantum states is a computationally hard problem, we propose a supervised machine-learning approach to estimate it. In this work, we frame SRE estimation as a regression task and train a Random Forest Regressor and a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) on a comprehensive dataset, including both unstructured random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the physics-motivated one-dimensional transverse Ising model (TIM). We compare the machine-learning models using two different quantum circuit representations: one based on classical shadows and the other on circuit-level features. Furthermore, we assess the generalization capabilities of the models on out-of-distribution instances. Experimental results show that an SVR trained on circuit-level features achieves the best overall performance. On the random circuits dataset, our approach converges to accurate SRE estimations, but struggles to generalize out of distribution. In contrast, it generalizes well on the structured TIM dataset, even to deeper and larger circuits. In line with previous work, our experiments suggest that machine learning offers a viable path for efficient nonstabilizerness estimation.

Title: A Comprehensive Protocol Stack for Quantum Networks with a Global Entanglement Module
Authors: Xiaojie Fan, C.R. Ramakrishnan, Himanshu Gupta
Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum networks requires not only advances in physical-layer technologies but also a comprehensive protocol stack that integrates communication, control, and resource management across all layers. We present the first such protocol stack, which introduces a Global Entanglement Module (GEM) that maintains a consistent, network-wide view of entanglement resources through distributed synchronization strategies. By enabling real-time adaptive execution of entanglement distribution plans, GEM bridges the gap between static planning and dynamic operation. The stack naturally supports pre-distributed entanglement, purification, and multi-partite state generation, making it applicable to a broad range of quantum networking applications. We design and evaluate multiple adaptive heuristics for real-time execution and show that a lightweight scoring-based strategy consistently achieves the best performance, improving entanglement generation rates by about 20% over a globally optimal but non-adaptive fixed-tree baseline and achieving more than a two-fold improvement relative to recent connectionless approaches. Across all scenarios-including predistribution and fidelity analysis-GEM consistently enables lower latency and robust operation. These results establish a practical pathway toward scalable, adaptive quantum internet systems.

Title: Quantum Fokker-Planck Master Equation with general signal filtering
Authors: Guilherme de Sousa
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a general master equation for continuous feedback based on arbitrary linear signals. This result is an extension of the Quantum Fokker-Planck Master Equation derived by Annby-Andersson et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 050401) to the case where the experiment has a general filtering structure. The filtering operation can include delayed information, memory effects, and non-Markovian signal processing. Using this general master equation, we derive analytical results for the ground state cooling of a quantum harmonic oscillator. We compared our results with those derived by De Sousa et al (Phys. Rev. E 111, 014152). Our framework aims to capture more realistic situations, to allow experiments to be better modeled, and to study non-Markovian effects in the spectral properties of the measurement signal.

Title: Quantum State Tomography for Tensor Networks in Two Dimensions
Authors: Zhen Qin, Zhihui Zhu
Abstract: Recent work has shown that for one-dimensional quantum states that can be effectively approximated by matrix product operators (MPOs), a polynomial number of copies of the state suffices for reconstruction. Compared to MPOs in one dimension, projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) and projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), which represent typical low-dimensional structures in two dimensions, are more prevalent as a looped tensor network. However, a formal analysis of the sample complexity required for estimating PEPS or PEPO has yet to be established. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees for the stable recovery of PEPS and PEPO. Our analysis primarily focuses on two quantum measurement schemes: $(i)$ informationally complete positive operator valued measures (IC-POVMs), specifically the spherical $t$-designs ($t \geq 3$), and $(ii)$ projective rank-one measurements, in particular Haar random projective measurements. We first establish stable embeddings for PEPSs (or PEPOs) to ensure that the information contained in the states can be preserved under these two measurement schemes. We then show that a constrained least-squares estimator achieves stable recovery for PEPSs (or PEPOs), with the recovery error bounded when the number of state copies scales linearly under spherical $t$-designs and polynomially under Haar-random projective measurements with respect to the number of qudits. These results provide theoretical support for the reliable use of PEPS and PEPO in practical quantum information processing.

Title: Constructing an approximate logical Markovian model of consecutive QEC cycles of a stabilizer code
Authors: Alex Kwiatkowski, Aaron J. Friedman, Shawn Geller, Jalan A. Ziyad, Scott Glancy, Emanuel Knill
Abstract: As quantum error correction (QEC) experiments continue to make rapid progress, there is increased interest in designing experiments with guarantees of logical performance. At present, one difficulty is the lack of a clear connection between logical performance and the low-level error models. In this work, we take an important step toward addressing this issue by proving that consecutive QEC cycles of a stabilizer code with Pauli stochastic noise and with a single-cycle infidelity $\epsilon_1 \leq 1/64$ admit an approximate logical Markovian model, meaning that consecutive noisy QEC cycles can be modeled by a memoryless error process acting only on the logical subsystem. The approximate logical Markovian model can be computed from the low-level error model, and the deviations from the true behavior are exponentially suppressed in the number of QEC cycles. Consequently, we expect that the approximate logical Markovian model will be both a useful tool for logical characterization and an aid for designing stabilizer-code implementations with guarantees of logical performance.

Title: Rapid Preparation of Rydberg Superatom W State Using Superadiabatic Techniques
Authors: Liping Yang, Jiping Wang, Li Dong, Xiaoming Xiu, Yanqiang Ji
Abstract: The W state, as a robust multipartite entangled state, plays an important role in quantum information processing, quantum network construction and quantum computing. In this paper, we encode quantum information on the effective energy levels of Rydberg superatoms and propose a fast scheme for preparing the Rydberg superatom W state based on the superadiabatic iterative technique, this scheme can be achieved in only one step by controlling the laser pulses. In the current scheme, the superatoms are trapped in spatially separated cavities connected by optical fibers, which significantly enhances the feasibility of experimental manipulation. A remarkable feature is that it does not require precise control of experimental parameters and interaction time. Meanwhile, the form of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian is the same as that of the effective Hamiltonian. Through numerical simulations, the fidelity of this scheme can reach 99.94%. Even considering decoherence effects, including atomic spontaneous emission and photon leakage, the fidelity can still exceed 97.5%, further demonstrating the strong robustness of the solution. In addition, the Rabi frequency can be characterized as a linear superposition of Gaussian functions, this representation significantly alleviates the complexity encountered in practical experiments. Futhermore, we also analyzed the impact of parameter fluctuations on the fidelity, the results show that this scheme is robust against parameter fluctuations. At last, the present scheme is extended to the cases of N Rydberg superatoms, which shows the scalability of our scheme.

Title: Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention for Financial Rebalancing: An Empirical Study on Automated Market Makers in Decentralized Finance
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Aidan Hung-Wen Tsai
Abstract: We formulate automated market maker (AMM) \emph{rebalancing} as a binary detection problem and study a hybrid quantum--classical self-attention block, \textbf{Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA)}. QASA constructs quantum queries/keys/values via variational quantum circuits (VQCs) and applies standard softmax attention over Pauli-$Z$ expectation vectors, yielding a drop-in attention module for financial time-series decision making. Using daily data for \textbf{BTCUSDC} over \textbf{Jan-2024--Jan-2025} with a 70/15/15 time-series split, we compare QASA against classical ensembles, a transformer, and pure quantum baselines under Return, Sharpe, and Max Drawdown. The \textbf{QASA-Sequence} variant attains the \emph{best single-model risk-adjusted performance} (\textbf{13.99\%} return; \textbf{Sharpe 1.76}), while hybrid models average \textbf{11.2\%} return (vs.\ 9.8\% classical; 4.4\% pure quantum), indicating a favorable performance--stability--cost trade-off.

Title: Quantifying multilevel coherence and multipartite correlation based on $α$-affinity
Authors: Yan Hong, Mengjia Zhang, Limin Gao, Xianfei Qi, Huaqi Zhou
Abstract: Compared with quantum coherence, multilevel quantum coherence offers a hierarchical classification that enables a more refined characterization. In this paper, we investigate multilevel coherence and introduce two $\alpha$-affinity-based indicators to quantify it, which exhibit a range of desirable properties. We further define $\alpha$-affinity-based indicators of multipartite correlation and analyze their properties. Finally, we explore and establish the relationship between these multilevel coherence indicators and the multipartite correlation indicators, thereby clarifying the connection between multilevel coherence and multipartite correlation.

Title: State complexity and phase identification in adaptive quantum circuits
Authors: Guoding Liu, Junjie Chen, Xiongfeng Ma
Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits, leveraging measurements and classical feedback, significantly expand the landscape of realizable quantum states compared to their non-adaptive counterparts, enabling the preparation of long-range entangled states and topological phases at constant depths. However, the ancilla overhead for preparing arbitrary states can be prohibitive, raising a fundamental question: which states can be efficiently realized with limited ancilla and low depth? Addressing this question requires a rigorous quantitative characterization of state complexity, or the minimum depth and ancillas, to realize a state in adaptive circuits. In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing two properties of quantum states: state weight and anti-shallowness, connected to the correlation range and correlation strength within a state, respectively. We prove that these quantities are bounded under limited circuit resources, thereby providing rigorous bounds on the approximate complexity of state preparation and gate implementation. Illustrative examples include the GHZ state, W state, QLDPC code states, and the Toffoli gate. Besides complexity, we show that states within the same quantum phase, defined by a set of quantum states connected with constant-depth circuits, must share the same scaling of weight or anti-shallowness. This establishes these quantities as indicators of quantum phases and their essential roles in many-body physics.

Title: Quantum phase transition in two dimension nonlinear cavity optomagnonic system
Authors: Yu Sang, Jie Liu, Lei Tan
Abstract: The superfluid-Mott insulator and ergodic-many body localization transitions based on a two dimension nonlinear cavity optomagnonic system are investigated, where a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is embedded at each site of a two-dimensional coupled cavity array. It can be demonstrated that, the introduction of phonon-photon coupling enhances the coherence of the system when considering the Kerr nonlinearity of the YIG sphere. In contrast, the Kerr nonlinearity of photons is more conducive to the Mott insulating phase than that of the YIG sphere. We further elucidate the underlying physical mechanism by calculating the effective repulsive potential of the system in the presence of photonic Kerr nonlinearity. Regarding the ergodic-many body localization transition, the results indicate that as the disorder strength of the Kerr nonlinearity increases, the system transitions from the ergodic phase to the many body localized phase, while increasing the chemical potential expands the region of the ergodic phase. This work provides a novel framework for characterizing quantum phase transitions in cavity optomagnonic systems and offers an experimentally feasible scheme for studying them, thereby yielding valuable insights for quantum simulation.

Title: Direct measurement of quantum geometric tensor in pseudo-Hermitian systems
Authors: Ze-Hao Huang, Hai-Tao Ding, Li-Jun Lang
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) fundamentally encodes the geometry and topology of quantum states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. While adiabatic perturbation theory links its real part (quantum metric) and imaginary part (Berry curvature) to energy fluctuations and generalized forces, respectively, in Hermitian systems, direct measurement of the QGT, which defined using both left and right eigenstates of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, remains challenging. Here we develop two quantum simulation schemes to directly extract all components of the QGT in pseudo-Hermitian systems with real spectra. Each scheme independently determines the complete QGT using generalized expectation values of either the energy fluctuation operator or the generalized force operator with respect to two time-evolved states prepared through distinct nonadiabatic evolutions, thereby establishing two self-contained measurement protocols. We illustrate the validity of these schemes on two $q$-deformed 2-band models: one with nontrivial topology, and the other with a nonvanishing off-diagonal quantum metric. Numerical simulations show that both schemes achieve high-fidelity agreement with theoretical predictions for measuring the QGT of both models, and successfully capture the topological phase transition of the first model using Chern numbers calculated from Berry curvatures. This work provides a framework for extending dynamical measurement schemes from Hermitian to pseudo-Hermitian systems with real spectra.

Title: Going beyond Landauer: Information-cost relations from inference based on the maximum entropy principle
Authors: Yuanyuan Xiao, Jian-Hua Jiang, Junjie Liu
Abstract: The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only partial information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost in scenarios with multiple charges, which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound; and (ii) an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in observable fluctuations which are ubiquitous at nanoscale, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.

Title: Proposal for macroscopic delocalisation of a large mass in a RF trap
Authors: Martine Schut, Valerio Scarani
Abstract: Engineering coherent spatial superpositions of levitated large masses is an ongoing challenge. Borrowing from recent experimental work, we consider a charged mass of hundreds of nanometers size (``nanoparticle'') co-trapped with an ion in a Paul trap, and propose a scheme to manipulate its spatial state through the Coulomb interaction with the ion. We focus on the achievable delocalisation, only sketching the other challenges of the protocol (initial cooling, preservation of coherence for long-enough times, and detection). We prove that our scheme can displace coherently the nanoparticle by a few nanometers, with state-of-the-art parameters. Though smaller than the nanoparticle's size, this is much larger than the wavefunction of the trap's ground state. Thus the co-trapping scheme is in principle able to demonstrate macroscopic delocalisation of a charged nanoparticle.

Title: Universal two-excitation scattering in two-dimensional subwavelength atomic arrays
Authors: Yidan Wang, Oriol Rubies-Bigorda, Valentin Walther, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering strong light-matter interactions, presenting exciting opportunities for quantum science. However, a full understanding of their multi-excitation dynamics remains a significant challenge. In this work, we uncover a remarkable universal phenomenon that emerges in these arrays. Using scattering theory to analyze two-excitation interactions, we reveal a profound simplification near critical points of the collective atomic excitation band structure, determined solely from single-excitation properties. At these critical points, scattering becomes universal and the full two-excitation scattering matrix decomposes into a block-diagonal form. Remarkably, all scattering processes involving the photon field are completely suppressed, resulting in the perfect isolation of a unitary, nonlinear interaction channel between collective dark spin waves. Our findings provide exact analytical insights into few-body nonlinearities and establish a universal framework for analyzing complex scattering phenomena in ordered atomic systems.

Title: Star products and their Hilbert space mirrors
Authors: Hendry M. Lim
Abstract: We discuss the Cahill-Glauber (CG) $s$-parameterized representation, a framework in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. We present the differential form of the hatted star product $\mathbin{\widehat{\star}_s}$, which emerges when we consider the inverse Cahill-Glauber (iCG) transform of a product of phase space functions. It appears to be the Hilbert space mirror of the usual star product $\mathbin{\star_s}$, and supports the interpretation of classical mechanics as the irreducible deformation of quantum mechanics by decoherence. Additionally, alternative forms of the evaluation of $\mathbin{\star_s}$ and $\mathbin{\widehat{\star}_s}$ are considered.

Title: Feynman's path to Schrödinger (and various other things)
Authors: Bernat Frangi, Héctor López
Abstract: Feynman's path integral formulation arose from his attempt to incorporate the Lagrangian framework into quantum mechanics, offering what he regarded as a more fundamental perspective than the Hamiltonian approach, particularly in the context of quantum electrodynamics. Inspired by an analogy proposed by P. A. M. Dirac, Feynman showed that Schrödinger's equation could be recovered by promoting this analogy to an equality, up to a constant factor. This insight laid the foundation for the path integral formalism. In this article, we first outline the historical development of dynamical frameworks in physics and then trace Feynman's reasoning as he constructed his formulation, beginning with the double-slit experiment and its interpretation. We subsequently derive the Schrödinger equation from the path integral and demonstrate the conservation of probability. These final sections aim to provide students with a clear link between this elegant yet less commonly presented approach and the more standard methods typically taught in undergraduate courses.

Title: Explicit construction of a 2-design of ${\rm U}(2)$ from the theory of angular momentum
Authors: Rocco Maggi, Cosmo Lupo, Saverio Pascazio
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to present an explicit construction of a 2-design of ${\rm U}(2)$, relying only on a tool that belongs to every physicists toolbox: the theory of angular momentum. Unitary designs are a rich and fundamental mathematical topic, with numerous fruitful applications in quantum information science and technology. In this work we take a peek under the hood. We begin with a minimal set of definitions and characterizations. Then we derive all 1-designs of ${\rm U}(2)$ of minimum size. Finally, we set out, step by step, a completion procedure extending such 1-designs to 2-designs. In particular, starting from the Pauli basis $\unicode{x2014}$ the prototypical unitary 1-design $\unicode{x2014}$ one $\unicode{x201C}$naturally$\unicode{x201D}$ obtains the 2-design originally employed by Bennett and coauthors in $\textit{Mixed State Entanglement and Quantum Error Correction}$. The present work also serves as a gentle and largely self-contained introduction to the subject.

Title: Multi-excitation scattering in subwavelength atomic arrays
Authors: Yidan Wang, Oriol Rubies-Bigorda, Valentin Walther, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering light-matter interactions, enabling near-perfect single-photon mirrors and robust quantum memories based on long-lived dark spin waves. However, a comprehensive theory of their nonlinear, multi-excitation dynamics has remained a significant challenge. We present a unified quantum scattering theory that treats both photons and collective atomic spin waves as distinct propagating excitations interacting across different spatial dimensions. Our central result is a powerful analytical reduction: we demonstrate that the complete multi-channel S-matrix and the associated scattering cross sections are exactly determined by the effective scattering dynamics solely within the atomic spin wave subspace. This maps the complex physical problem of photon-atom interactions to a conceptually simpler one involving only atomic modes. We apply this formalism to the two-excitation case, deriving the complete analytical S-matrix and scattering cross sections for systems with two-level nonlinearities. Our work provides a versatile analytic tool for analyzing and engineering complex quantum nonlinear phenomena, including multi-excitation subradiance, in large-scale atomic systems.

Title: Coherent oscillations in weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit

Abstract: The functionalization of quantum devices to increase their performance and extend their fields of application is an extremely active research area. One of the most promising approaches is to replace aluminum with more performant materials. Within this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials are ideal candidates since they would allow to embed their unique properties into qubits. However, the realization of qubits based on vdW materials other than graphene is yet to be achieved. In this work we present a weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit. Our device exhibits a relaxation time T1 = 6.5 +\- 0.4 us which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger of other vdW qubits in addition to robustness to photon noise up to 5-10 thermal photons. Our work serves as a demonstrator of the advantage of integration of vdW materials into quantum technologies as well as serving as the first step toward the application of quantum non demolition photon detection protocols in the challenging field of dark matter search.

Title: Quantum Late-Time Decay and Channel Dependence
Authors: Francesco Giacosa, Anna Kolbus, Krzysztof Kyziol, Magdalena Plodowska, Milena Piotrowska, Karol Szary, Arthur Vereijken
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts deviations from exponential decay at short and long times, yet experimental evidence is limited. We report a power-law tail after $\sim$10 lifetimes in erythrosine~B fluorescence, confirmed by two detectors probing distinct bands but yielding different power coefficients. The data match a divergent but normalizable spectral density, and theory predicts oscillations as a future test. A novel and general result is that in multichannel QM (and QFT) decay the lifetime is universal, but the late-time deviations exhibit a sizeable time window in which they are channel (or band) dependent, a feature consistent with our data.

Title: Fusion-based implementation of qLDPC codes with quantum emitters
Authors: Susan X. Chen, Matthias C. Löbl, Ming Lai Chan, Anders S. Sørensen, Stefano Paesani
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes offer higher encoding rate than topological codes, e.g. surface codes, making them favourable for practical, fault-tolerant quantum computing with low overhead. These codes are particularly well-suited for fusion-based photonic implementations as this platform readily supports non-local connections. We propose a method to implement any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) qLDPC code with fusions and photonic resource states, which can be deterministically produced by quantum emitters. We use this framework to perform a case study on small exemplary Bivariate Bicycle qLDPC codes. We analyse the performance of our constructions under relevant physical noise mechanisms, including erasures due to fusion failure or photon loss as well as Pauli errors. We obtain performances comparable with topological architectures despite the significantly higher encoding rate.

Title: Dimeric perylene-bisimide organic molecules: Application as a quantum battery
Authors: Samira Elghaayda, Mostafa Mansour
Abstract: This work introduces a unified theoretical framework for quantum batteries (QBs) constructed from thermally equilibrated arrays of dimeric perylene bisimide (PBI) molecules. These organic dimers, with chemically tunable transition energies and dipole-dipole interactions, constitute a scalable and practical platform for quantum energy storage. Using exact diagonalization of the Gibbs state supported by analytic and numerical resource-theoretic tools, we evaluate four performance metrics: ergotropy, instantaneous charging power, storage capacity, and quantum coherence. We find that exact resonance ($\nu_1 = \nu_2$) suppresses both ergotropy and charging power due to symmetric thermal population distributions. Introducing finite detuning ($\Delta = \nu_1 - \nu_2$) breaks this symmetry, redistributes populations, and significantly enhances extractable work, charging power, and storage capacity. Furthermore, while the capacity remains invariant under unitary dynamics, providing a useful reference bound, intermediate dipole-dipole coupling strengths ($V_{12}$) optimize the trade-off between ergotropy, coherence retention, and storage performance. Crucially, coherence-assisted energy storage persists up to experimentally relevant temperatures, underscoring the thermal resilience of PBI-based QBs. These results establish spectral detuning and dipole-dipole interaction tuning as essential design principles, positioning PBI dimers as a chemically realistic, experimentally accessible, and thermodynamically robust platform that bridges molecular engineering with quantum energy storage.

Title: Equivalence relations between conical 2-designs and mutually unbiased generalized equiangular tight frames
Authors: Katarzyna Siudzińska
Abstract: Quantum measurements play a fundamental role in quantum information. Therefore, increasing efforts are being made to construct symmetric measurement operators for qudit systems. A wide class of projective measurements corresponds to complex projective 2-designs, which include symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) POVMs and mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). In this paper, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between conical 2-designs and mutually unbiased generalized equiangular tight frames, both of which are common generalizations of SIC POVMs and MUBs to operators of arbitrary rank. It turns out that there exist rich families of operators that belong to only one of those two classes. This raises important questions about which symmetries have to be preserved for applicational prominence.

Title: Feasibility Study of 3D-Printed Micro Junction Array for Ion Trap Quantum Processor
Authors: Kento Taniguchi, Ke Sun, Shuqi Xu, Abhinav Parakh, Xiaoxing Xia, Michael Schecter, Curtis Volin, Eric Hudson, Hartmut Haeffner
Abstract: We introduce an ion trap platform based on a 3D-printed micro-junction array, designed to implement quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architectures for large-scale quantum information processing (QIP). The integration of three-dimensionally structured micro Radio-Frequency (RF) electrodes above a surface-electrode trap enables flexible control of electric field profiles across both linear and junction regions. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the linear region exhibits deeper and more harmonic ion confinement with reduced RF drive power compared to conventional planar traps. Crucially, we identify a junction geometry that maintains uniform ion confinement during transport while substantially reducing the pseudopotential barrier. This reduction facilitates low-heating, high-fidelity transport of single- and multi-species ion crystals. Our results establish a viable route toward fault-tolerant quantum computing by enabling modular and scalable QCCD systems based on the state-of-the-art 3D-printing technologies.

Title: A Depth-Independent Linear Chain Ansatz for Large-Scale Quantum Approximate Optimization
Authors: Zixu Wang, Jack Mandell, Yangyang Xu, Jian Shi
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization lies at the heart of numerous real-world applications. For a broad category of optimization problems, quantum computing is expected to exhibit quantum speed-up over classic computing. Among various quantum algorithms, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), as one of variational quantum algorithms, shows promise on demonstrating quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, with increasing problem size, the circuit depth demanded by original QAOA scales rapidly and quickly surpasses the threshold at which meaningful results can be obtained. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a variant of QAOA (termed linear chain QAOA) and demonstrate its advantages over original QAOA on paradigmatic MaxCut problems. In original QAOA, each graph edge is encoded with one entangling gate. In our ansatz, we locate a linear chain from the original MaxCut graph and place entangling gates sequentially along this chain. This linear-chain ansatz is featured by shallow quantum circuits and with the low execution time that scales independently of the problem size. Leveraging this ansatz, we demonstrate an approximation ratio of 0.78 (without post-processing) on non-hardware-native random regular MaxCut instances with 100 vertices in a digital quantum processor using 100 qubits. Our findings offer new insights into the design of hardware-efficient ansatz and point toward a promising route for tackling large-scale combinatorial optimization problems on NISQ devices.

Title: Efficient Measurement Error Mitigation with Subsystem-Balanced Pauli Twirling
Authors: Xiao-Yue Xu, Chen Ding, Wan-Su Bao
Abstract: Measurement error mitigation (MEM) is essential for realizing reliable quantum computation. Model-free measurement error mitigation (MF-MEM) is an important class of MEM methods that employs Pauli twirling-typically with a random twirling set-to convert measurement noise into a state-independent scaling factor, thereby enabling error mitigation through simple calibration. However, such methods face prohibitive sampling overhead, limiting their scalability. To address this, we introduce subsystem-balanced Pauli twirling (SB-PT), a twirling method designed for MF-MEM that enforces Pauli operator balance on measuring subsystems to selectively suppress dominant measurement noise. Theoretically, for a weight-r Pauli observable, SB-PT removes all independent error components using only O[4^r] random circuits, substantially reducing the sampling overhead over conventional Pauli twirling. This efficiency gain is most significant for sparse observables. To extend such resource-efficient mitigation to arbitrary observables, we develop a hardware-efficient measurement transformation framework that converts high-weight Pauli operators into low-weight effective ones via linear-depth circuits. The circuit noise introduced during this transformation is jointly mitigated with native measurement noise using a unified twirling protocol, ensuring robust performance. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate a greater than 16-fold improvement in sampling efficiency over conventional random twirling, with consistent performance gains across varying system sizes and error regimes. This work provides a resource-frugal and experimentally viable path toward high-fidelity measurement in near-term quantum devices.

Title: Quantum coherence induced by magnons
Authors: V. C. Vieira, F. M. de Paula
Abstract: We analyze quantum coherence generated by non-interacting magnons in a ferromagnetic spin chain described by the isotropic Heisenberg model. The exact expression derived for the reduced density operator of an arbitrary subsystem reveals that single-site coherence vanishes, while maximal coherence arises in a pure single-mode magnon state. Remarkably, this maximum depends solely on the number of coherently superposed microstates. Based on this property, we introduce coherence-based definitions of entropy, temperature, and heat capacity, establishing a formal analogy with standard thermodynamic quantities.

Title: Quantum Simulation Programming via Typing
Authors: Liyi Li, Federico Zahariev, Chandeepa Dissanayake, Jae Swanepoel, Amr Sabry, Mark S. Gordon
Abstract: Quantum simulations are designed to model quantum systems, and many compilation frameworks have been developed for executing such simulations on quantum computers. Most compilers leverage the capabilities of digital and analog quantum computers by representing quantum particle systems with Pauli strings or digital quantum circuits, making it challenging for users in physics, chemistry, and biology to program simulations effectively. QBLUE is proposed as the first programming language for describing the behaviors of quantum systems in terms of second quantization Hamiltonians. Within QBLUE, a novel type system is proposed to clearly define states across different quantum systems and treat quantum computers as quantum particle systems of specific types. The type system is compatible with the compilation of quantum simulations expressed in QBLUE for digital and analog quantum computers. With QBLUE, users can specify the desired quantum particle system and model the system on quantum computers.

Title: The Free Energy Barrier: An Eyring-Polanyi bound for stabilizer Hamiltonians, with applications to quantum error correction
Authors: Nouédyn Baspin
Abstract: The lack of an energy barrier in stabilizer Hamiltonians is well known to be an indication of short thermalisation times; and serves as a simple criteria to rule out self-correction. Its applicability has recently been challenged by the discovery of stabilizer codes with maximal energy barriers whose self-correcting status remains unclear. We address this question by introducing the more general notion of a free energy barrier, whose absence is also demonstrated to guarantee fast thermalisation. Applying these new results to the Layer codes, we prove that they lack self-correction.

Title: Stabilizer Rényi Entropy and its Transition in the Coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model
Authors: Pengfei Zhang, Shuyan Zhou, Ning Sun
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.

Title: Entanglement manifestation of knot topology in a non-Hermitian lattice
Authors: Guoying Zhang, Li Wang, Shu Chen
Abstract: Although the homotopy-knot theory has been utilized to implement effective topological classification for non-Hermitian systems, the physical implications underlying distinct knot topologies remain ambiguous and are rarely addressed. In this work, we propose a one-dimensional non-Hermitian four-band lattice model and map out its phase diagram according to the distinct knot structures residing in the moment space. The topological phase diagram is ascertained through a spectral winding number. Furthermore, we derive the exact analytic formula for the phase boundaries that delineate different knot topologies. To explore the concrete physical implications of distinct knot topologies, we investigate the many-body ground state entanglement entropy for free fermions loaded on such non-Hermitian lattice in real space. It turns out that different knot topologies imply different magnitudes of entanglement. Moreover, we show that the central charge c extracted from systematic finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy provides effective description of the phase diagram of the knot topology. Finally, we further confirm the phase boundaries for the topological phase transitions alternatively by numerical calculations of the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility. Our results showcase the connection between knot topology and entanglement of non-Hermitian systems and may facilitate further exploration of the profound and practical physical implications of knot topology.

Title: Free expansion of a charged nanoparticle via electrostatic compensation
Authors: David Steiner, Yaakov Y. Fein, Gregor Meier, Stefan Lindner, Paul Juschitz, Mario A. Ciampini, Markus Aspelmeyer, Nikolai Kiesel
Abstract: Coherent wavepacket expansion is a key component of recent proposals aiming to create non-classical states of a levitated dielectric nanoparticle. Free evolution, i.e., releasing the particle from its harmonic trapping potential and allowing its position variance to grow, is a simple but effective expansion scheme, but requires accurate force compensation to avoid significant mean displacements of the wavepacket during the free evolution. Here, using an optical trap-release-recapture sequence, we demonstrate an electrostatic compensation technique that enables free evolution without significant mean displacement in 3D, successfully compensating both gravity and stray electric fields. To achieve 100 microsecond free evolution times with charged particles, we developed methods to map and correct for force cross-talk, as well as to control the environmental charge state. Combined with a low decoherence environment, our approach enables the preparation of largely delocalized states without the need for long freefall trajectories or a low-gravity environment.

Title: QUT: A Unit Testing Framework for Quantum Subroutines
Authors: Mykhailo V. Klymenko, Thong Hoang, Hoa Nguyen, Samuel A. Wilkinson, Bahar Goldozian, Xing Zhenchang, Qinghua Lu, Muhammad Usman, Liming Zhu
Abstract: We present the architectural design and prototype implementation of QUT (Quantum Unit Testing), a framework for unit testing of quantum subroutines. The framework is developed with a focus on usability and simplicity, making the complex theoretical concepts behind quantum unit testing accessible to a wide range of users with diverse backgrounds. This is achieved through the implementation of polymorphic probabilistic assertions, whose evaluation methods adapt to the data types of the arguments used in assertion statements, which may vary according to the context-dependent semantics of quantum subroutines. These arguments can be represented as qubit measurement outcomes, density matrices, or Choi matrices. For each type, the architecture integrates a specific testing protocol - such as quantum process tomography, quantum state tomography, or Pearson's chi-squared test - while remaining flexible enough to incorporate additional protocols in the future. The framework is built on the Qiskit software stack, providing compatibility with a broad range of quantum hardware backends and simulation platforms. Drawing on the reasoning provided by the denotational semantics of quantum subroutines, this work also highlights the key distinctions between quantum unit testing and its classical counterpart.

Title: Detection of isolated specular reflection for calibration of cloud thermodynamic phase estimation with quantum parametric mode sorting LIDAR
Authors: Richard J. Murchie, Dolf Huybrechts, Aaron Strangfeld, Mateusz P. Mrozowski
Abstract: Specular reflection can be problematic for the determination of the cloud thermodynamic phase for near-nadir-pointing space LIDARs. A LIDAR system biased towards the specular contribution for backscatter, if near-concurrent to a conventional LIDAR, could calibrate the measurements required for cloud phase determination. One such system which shows promise for this is quantum parametric mode sorting (QPMS) LIDAR. Through a non-linear interaction and time-frequency mode selectivity, this system demonstrates in-band noise-rejection beyond what linear noise filtering can provide. This level of noise-rejection means the signal strength can be minimised, therefore biasing the specular contribution to the return signal. Here we provide a theoretical model of QPMS LIDAR applied to this scenario to instruct its feasibility.

Title: Conditioning in Generative Quantum Denoising Diffusion Models
Authors: Daniel Quinn, Lorenzo Buffoni, Stefano Gherardini, Gabriele De Chiara
Abstract: Quantum denoising diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful framework for generative quantum machine learning. In this work, we extend these models by introducing a conditioning mechanism that enables the generation of quantum states drawn from multiple target distributions. By sharing parameters across distinct classes of quantum states, our approach avoids the need to train separate models for each distribution. We validate our method through numerical simulations that span single-qubit generation tasks, entangled state preparation, and many-body ground state generation. Across these tasks, conditioning significantly reduced the error of targeted state generation by up to an order of magnitude. Finally, we perform an ablation study to quantify the effect of key hyperparameters on the model performance.

Title: Adaptive Policies for Resource Generation in a Quantum Network
Authors: Aksel Tacettin, Tianchen Qu, Bethany Davies, Boris Goranov, Ioana-Lisandra Draganescu, Gayane Vardoyan
Abstract: Protocols for distributed quantum systems commonly require the simultaneous availability of $n$ entangled states, each with a fidelity above some fixed minimum $F_{\mathrm{app}}$ relative to the target maximally-entangled state. However, the fidelity of entangled states degrades over time while in memory. Entangled states are therefore rendered useless when their fidelity falls below $F_{\mathrm{app}}$. This is problematic when entanglement generation is probabilistic and attempted in a sequential manner, because the expected completion time until $n$ entangled states are available can be large. Motivated by existing entanglement generation schemes, we consider a system where the entanglement generation parameters (the success probability $p$ and fidelity $F$ of the generated entangled state) may be adjusted at each time step. We model the system as a Markov decision process, where the policy dictates which generation parameters $(p,F)$ to use for each attempt. We use dynamic programming to derive optimal policies that minimise the expected time until $n$ entangled states are available with fidelity greater than $F_{\mathrm{app}}$. We observe that the advantage of our optimal policies over the selected baselines increases significantly with $n$. In the parameter regimes explored, which are based closely on current experiments, we find that the optimal policy can provide a speed-up of as much as a factor of twenty over a constant-action policy. In addition, we propose a computationally inexpensive heuristic method to compute policies that perform either optimally or near-optimally in the parameter regimes explored. Our heuristic method can be used to find high-performing policies in parameter regimes where finding an optimal policy is intractable.

Title: Noise robustness of problem-to-simulator mappings for quantum many-body physics
Authors: Rahul Trivedi, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics on digital or analog quantum simulators often requires ``problem-to-simulator" mappings such as trotterization, floquet-magnus expansion or perturbative expansions. When the simulator is noiseless, it is well understood that these problem-to-simulator mappings can be made as accurate as desired at the expense of simulator run-time. However, precisely because the simulator has to be run for a longer time to increase its accuracy, it is expected that noise in the quantum simulator catastrophically effects the simulator output. We show that, contrary to this expectation, these mappings remain stable to noise when considering the task of simulating dynamics of local observables in quantum lattice models. Specifically, we prove that in all of these mappings, local observables can be determined to a system-size independent, precision that scales sublinearly with the noise-rate in the simulator. Our results provide theoretical evidence that quantum simulators can be used for solving problems in many-body physics without or with modest error correction.

Title: Certifying localizable quantum properties with constant sample complexity
Authors: Zhenyu Du, Jinchang Liu, Elias X. Huber, Zi-Wen Liu, Xiongfeng Ma
Abstract: Characterizing increasingly complex quantum systems is a central task in quantum information science, yet experimental costs often scale prohibitively with system size. Certifying key properties -- such as entanglement, circuit complexity, and quantum magic -- using simple local measurements is highly desirable but challenging. In this work, we introduce a highly general certification framework based on a physical phenomenon that we call localizable quantumness: for generic many-body states, essential quantum properties are robustly preserved within the projected ensembles on small subsystems after performing local projective measurements on the rest of the system. Leveraging this insight, we develop certification protocols that certify global properties by witnessing them on a small, accessible subsystem. Our method dramatically reduces experimental cost by relying solely on local Pauli measurements, while achieving constant sample complexity, constant-level noise robustness, and soundness for mixed states -- exponentially improving the sample complexity and overcoming major limitations of previous methods. We further present a random-basis variant to certify state fidelity, with numerical evidence strongly suggesting it maintains constant sample complexity and robustness for generic states, representing a substantial improvement over existing methods. Our results provide a practical, scalable toolkit for certifying large-scale quantum processors and offer a novel lens for understanding complex many-body quantum systems.

Title: Demonstration of sequential processors with quantum advantage and analysis of classical performance limits
Authors: Shota Tateishi, Wenhao Wang, Baptiste Chevalier, Takafumi Ono, Masahiro Takeoka, Wojciech Roga
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally analyze sequential processors with limited communication between parts. We compare the expressivity of sequential quantum and classical processors under the same constraints. They consist of three or four modules each of which processes local data. The modules of the quantum processor are linked through one qubit or one qutrit communication, while those of the classical processor communicate through one bit or one trit. For the classical processor, we prove bounds on its performance in terms of inequalities on correlations of the output with a target function. We show that the quantum processor violates these inequalities. We show this violation experimentally on a silicon photonics setup. We describe how to find the classical bound on correlations with arbitrary target function by reducing the problem to minimization of an Ising-type spin-glass Hamiltonian. Our theory is applicable in general problems, such as the low-rank binary matrix approximation.

Title: Entropy dynamics for a harmonic propeller-shaped planar molecular quantum Brownian rotator
Authors: J. Jeknic-Dugic (1), I. Petrovic, M. Arsenijevic (2), M. Dugic (2) ((1) University of Nis, Faculty of Science and Mathematics Serbia, (2) University of Kragujevac, Faculty of Science, Serbia)
Abstract: Dynamic stability is vital for the operation and control of molecular nanodevices, particularly molecular cogwheels in an external harmonic field. We used the relative change in rotator entropy as a measure of dynamical stability. This rotator dynamic is described by the Caldeira-Leggett quantum master equation: the main challenge is the absence of a general solution for this equation. As an alternative, we look for the initial states (pure or mixed) of the rotator that result in low entropy change. In order to create candidate initial states, we use an ansatz that align with the maximum entropy principle. We then find conditions for state preparation and system/bath parameters to achieve a small relative change in both linear and differential entropy in underdamped and non-underdamped regimes. We identify cases with relatively small entropy change and discuss their practical feasibility.

Title: Iterative construction of $\mathfrak{S}_p \times \mathfrak{S}_p$ group-adapted irreducible matrix units for the walled Brauer algebra
Authors: Michał Horodecki, Michał Studziński, Marek Mozrzymas
Abstract: In this work, we present an algorithmic treatment of the representation theory of the algebra of partially transposed permutation operators, denoted by $\mathcal{A}^d_{p,p}$, which is a matrix representation of the abstract walled Brauer algebra. We provide an explicit and fully developed framework for constructing irreducible matrix units within the algebra. In contrast to the established earlier Gelfand-Tsetlin type constructions, the presented matrix units are adapted to the action of the subalgebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_p] \times \mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_p]$, where $\mathfrak{S}_p$ is the symmetric group. What is more, the basis is constructed in such a way that it produces the decomposition of the algebra into a direct sum of ideals, in contrast to its nested structure considered before. The decomposition of this kind has not been considered before in full generality. Our method reveals a recursive scheme for generating irreducible matrix units in all ideals of $\mathcal{A}^d_{p,p}$, offering a systematic approach that applies to small system sizes and arbitrary local dimensions. We apply the developed formalism to the algebra $\mathcal{A}^d_{2,2}$ and illustrate the algorithm in practice. In addition, using the constructed basis, we proved a novel contraction theorem for the elements from $\mathcal{A}^d_{3,3}$, which is the starting point for further investigations.

Title: Transfer of entanglement from nonlocal photon to non-Gaussian CV states
Authors: Mikhail S. Podoshvedov, Sergey A. Podoshvedov
Abstract: Continuous variable (CV) entanglement refers to the type of entanglement of quantum wave-like systems that are described by continuous variables in an inherently infinite-dimensional space. It can become a crucial resource for quantum communication, sensing and computation. We propose the mechanism of transfer of quantum entanglement (TQE) from a nonlocal photon to two initially separate single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) states. The nonlocal photon is the only original quantum resource from which entanglement is transferred to CV states of a certain parity without them directly interacting with each other in a deterministic manner. Measurement induced CV parity entanglement is tuned using initial squeezing and the beam splitter (BS) parameter allowing us to estimate the probability of transfer of maximum entanglement at sufficiently high brightness to be 0.2344 . If, instead of the original SMSV states, we use those from which one photon is initially subtracted, then the heralded technique can turn the probabilistic maximum entanglement transfer protocol into a nearly deterministic one, the probability of which is >0.98. Such a perfect TQE from the nonlocal photon to a maximally parity-entangled CV state can be considered the most suitable for applications, since it preserves the trade-off between the probability and brightness of the output non-Gaussian states.

Title: Enhanced fill probability estimates in institutional algorithmic bond trading using statistical learning algorithms with quantum computers

Abstract: The estimation of fill probabilities for trade orders represents a key ingredient in the optimization of algorithmic trading strategies. It is bound by the complex dynamics of financial markets with inherent uncertainties, and the limitations of models aiming to learn from multivariate financial time series that often exhibit stochastic properties with hidden temporal patterns. In this paper, we focus on algorithmic responses to trade inquiries in the corporate bond market and investigate fill probability estimation errors of common machine learning models when given real production-scale intraday trade event data, transformed by a quantum algorithm running on IBM Heron processors, as well as on noiseless quantum simulators for comparison. We introduce a framework to embed these quantum-generated data transforms as a decoupled offline component that can be selectively queried by models in low-latency institutional trade optimization settings. A trade execution backtesting method is employed to evaluate the fill prediction performance of these models in relation to their input data. We observe a relative gain of up to ~ 34% in out-of-sample test scores for those models with access to quantum hardware-transformed data over those using the original trading data or transforms by noiseless quantum simulation. These empirical results suggest that the inherent noise in current quantum hardware contributes to this effect and motivates further studies. Our work demonstrates the emerging potential of quantum computing as a complementary explorative tool in quantitative finance and encourages applied industry research towards practical applications in trading.

Title: Accelerated characterization of two-level systems in superconducting qubits via machine learning
Authors: Avinash Pathapati, Olli Mansikkamäki, Alexander Tyner, Alexander V. Balatsky
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach for extracting two-level system (TLS) parameters-frequency $\omega_{TLS}$, coupling strength $g$, dissipation time $T_{TLS, 1}$, and the pure dephasing time $T^{\phi}_{TLS, 2}$, labelled as a 4-component vector $\vec{q}$, directly from simulated spectroscopy data generated for a single TLS by a form of two-tone spectroscopy. Specifically, we demonstrate that a custom convolutional neural network model(CNN) can simultaneously predict $\omega_{TLS}$, $g$, $T_{TLS, 1}$ and $T^{\phi}_{TLS, 2}$ from the spectroscopy data presented in the form of images. Our results show that the model achieves superior performance to perturbation theory methods in successfully extracting the TLS parameters. Although the model, initially trained on noise-free data, exhibits a decline in accuracy when evaluated on noisy images, retraining it on a noisy dataset leads to a substantial performance improvement, achieving results comparable to those obtained under noise-free conditions. Furthermore, the model exhibits higher predictive accuracy for parameters $\omega_{TLS}$ and $g$ in comparison to $T_{TLS, 1}$ and $T^{\phi}_{TLS, 2}$.

Title: Digital controllability of transverse field Ising chains
Authors: Vincenzo Roberto Arezzo, Ruiyi Wang, Kiran Thengil, Giovanni Pecci, Giuseppe Santoro
Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) encounters limitations when the energy gap along the annealing path becomes exponentially small, leading to impractically long runtimes. In contrast, the success of hybrid digital methods like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which operate via discrete unitary operations, relies on the optimization of the variational parameters appearing in the state. We analyze a class of transverse-field Ising models which includes problems with exponentially small spectral gaps, but whose dynamics is described in terms of fermionic Gaussian states after Jordan-Wigner mapping. We show that, for digital alternating QAOA-like states, the number of unitaries required to reach the exact ground state scales quadratically with system size and is independent of the annealing gap. This number can be exactly computed from the algebraic properties of the Ansatz, revealing a fundamental distinction between digital methods and their analog counterpart.

Title: Quantum Public Key Encryption for NISQ Devices
Authors: Nishant Rodrigues, Walter O. Krawec, Brad Lackey, Deb Mukhopadhyay, Bing Wang
Abstract: Quantum public-key encryption (PKE), where public-keys and/or ciphertexts can be quantum states, is an important primitive in quantum cryptography. Unlike classical PKE (e.g., RSA or ECC), quantum PKE can leverage quantum-secure cryptographic assumptions or the principles of quantum mechanics for security. It has great potential in providing for secure cryptographic systems under potentially weaker assumptions than is possible classically. In addition, it is of both practical and theoretical interest, opening the door to novel cryptographic systems not possible with classical information alone. While multiple quantum PKE schemes have been proposed, they require a large number of qubits acting coherently, and are not practical on current noisy quantum devices. In this paper, we design a practical quantum PKE scheme, taking into account the constraints of current NISQ devices. Specifically, we design a PKE scheme with quantum-classical public keys and classical ciphertexts, that is noise-resilient and only requires a small number of qubits acting coherently. In addition, our design provides tradeoffs in terms of efficiency and the number of qubits that are required.

Title: Hybrid Trapping of Cold Atoms with Surface Forces and Blue-Detuned Evanescent Light on a Nanophotonic Waveguide
Authors: Riccardo Pennetta, Antoine Glicenstein, Philipp Schneeweiss, Jürgen Volz, Arno Rauschenbeutel
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel hybrid nanophotonic trap for cold neutral atoms, leveraging surface forces for attraction and blue-detuned evanescent light for repulsion. We attribute the attractive potential to a combination of Casimir-Polder interactions and electrostatic charges distributed on the waveguide surface. Despite the trap's shallow depth, we efficiently load atoms into it via adiabatic transfer from a conventional two-color dipole trap. Remarkably, the hybrid trap supports a long atomic storage time of 140(9) ms and exhibits a Ramsey coherence time of 16.8(2) ms, the latter exceeding significantly previous reports for nanophotonic systems. Our results pave the way for further exploration of atom-surface interactions at the nanoscale and illustrate the potential of harnessing surface forces to enhance storage and coherence times for atoms coupled to nanophotonic waveguides. This advancement offers new opportunities for neutral-atom quantum technologies.

Title: Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity
Authors: Arda Batin Tank
Abstract: This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.

Title: Exact gradient for universal cost functions in variational quantum algorithms
Authors: Jesus Urbaneja, Le Bin Ho
Abstract: We present a universal and exact framework for gradient derivation that is valid for all differentiable cost functions in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). The framework provides analytic gradients without relying on restrictive assumptions, thereby extending gradient-based optimization beyond conventional expectation-value settings. These gradients can be directly accessed on quantum hardware through the Hadamard and Hilbert-Schmidt tests, making the method experimentally accessible. We illustrate the approach in variational quantum compilation, where it enables efficient and stable optimization. By establishing a universal and hardware-compatible method, this work advances the scalability and reliability of VQAs.

Title: Fast and Accurate Decoder for the XZZX code Using Simulated Annealing
Authors: Tatsuya Sakashita (The University of Osaka)
Abstract: The XZZX code is a variant of the surface code designed to address biased noise in realistic quantum devices. For the XZZX code, we propose a decoder based on simulated annealing (SA). Our SA decoder can be readily and efficiently parallelized, by virtue of its simple MCMC-based algorithm. To prepare an initial configuration of SA, we propose to employ recovery chains obtained by a decoder which utilizes a kind of greedy matching graph algorithm. Although $Z$-biased noise is commonly assumed in real quantum devices, we focus on $Y$-biased noise, for which the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm fails to decode accurately. Our numerical simulation for the code capacity noise model, where only data qubits suffer errors, confirmed that our SA decoder is more accurate than the MWPM decoder. Furthermore, our SA decoder attained the accuracy equivalent to that of the optimal decoder formulated by integer programming, called CPLEX decoder. In our greedy matching decoder, we randomly determine order of matching pairs of incorrect syndromes that have the same distance. This randomness brings about a variety of initial configurations of SA, which leads to faster convergence of our SA decoder. By comparing decoding times of our SA decoder, the CPLEX decoder, and matrix product state (MPS) decoder, all of which can handle $Y$-biased noise appropriately, we confirmed that our SA decoder is fastest if parallelized. This result implies a potential for combining of our greedy matching and SA decoder for practical use in quantum computing.

Title: Fast qubit-based frequency recovery algorithm for quantum key distribution
Authors: Feng-Yu Lu, Zheng-Kai Huang, Jia-Jv Deng, Chi Zhang, Shuang Wang, De-Yong He, Zhen-Qiang Yin, Wei Chen, Guang-Can Guo, Zheng-Fu Han
Abstract: Clock synchronization serves as a foundational subsystem in quantum key distribution (QKD). The recently proposed Qubit-based synchronization (Qubit4Sync) has opportunities in eliminating additional cost, noise, and potential side channels. It offers a promising alternative to dedicated synchronization hardware. However, the current frequency recovery process in Qubit4Sync requires high data throughput and computational speed, limiting practical use. To overcome these issues, we developed a fast frequency recovery algorithm that increases the recovery rate by orders of magnitude and remains robust under bad signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This enables Qubit4Sync to operate effectively in mainstream gated-mode QKD systems. We further establish a theoretical model for frequency recovery, showing that our algorithm is robust against disturbances like dead time, jitter, and afterpulse. A frequency-domain SNR calculation method is also provided to guide parameter design for specific experimental conditions. This work opens the door to practical Qubit4Sync deployment in general QKD systems.

Title: Quantum Portfolio Optimization: An Extensive Benchmark
Authors: Eric Stopfer, Friedrich Wagner
Abstract: Recently, several researchers proposed portfolio optimization as a potential use case for quantum optimization. However, the literature is lacking an extensive benchmark quantifying the potential of quantum computers for portfolio optimization. In this work, we fill this gap. We provide a computational study, comparing quantum approaches against state-of-the-art classical methods on a meaningful, real-world instance set. In particular, we compare quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm against classical mixed-integer programming, simulated annealing, steepest descent local search, tabu search and a problem-tailored heuristics. We consider a variant of portfolio optimization which we show to be particular difficult for classical solvers in practice. Our benchmark comprises 250 instances with up to 1,000 assets from actual stock data. The results show that all instances can be solved to proven optimality by mixed-integer programming in the order of seconds. Moreover, the problem-tailored heuristic consistently outperforms quantum approaches in terms of solution quality for fixed runtime. Thus, we conclude that there is only very limited room for a potential quantum advantage in portfolio optimization.

Title: Comparison of trapped-ion entangling gate mechanisms for mixed species
Authors: V. M. Schäfer, A. C. Hughes, O. Bazavan, K. Thirumalai, G. Pagano, C. J. Ballance, D. M. Lucas
Abstract: Entangling gates are an essential capability of quantum computers. There are different methods for implementing two-qubit gates, with respective advantages and disadvantages. We investigate the experimentally relevant differences and commonalities of laser-based $\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z$ light-shift and $\sigma_\phi\otimes\sigma_\phi$ Moelmer-Soerensen gates, highlighting the phases of experimental control fields and their long-term stabilities, in the specific case of mixed-species gates. We implement these gates on qubits with very different magnetic field sensitivities, encoded in $^{43}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ and $^{88}\mathrm{Sr}^+$, achieving fidelities of $99.8\%$ for the $\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z$ and $99.6\%$ for the $\sigma_\phi\otimes\sigma_\phi$ gate.

Title: Bosonic content of three-fermion high-spin states
Authors: Jerzy Cioslowski, Krzysztof Strasburger, Denis K. Sunko
Abstract: A rigorous characterization of the information content of any high-spin threefermion wave function is presented. It is based upon a formal decomposition of the wave function into a finite set of fixed invariants, called shapes, whose sole purpose is to satisfy the Pauli principle, and a variable part, constituting the bosonic excitations of these invariants, that provides its physical content. As an example, this decomposition is applied to a benchmark-quality approximate wave function of the lowest-energy quartet electronic state of the lithium atom. This wave function, which comprises hundreds of basis functions, is reduced to eleven shape blocks, only five of which are numerically significant. Such a compact characterization is a generic example of the appearance of superselection rules in configuration space, and provides a qualitative aid in the search for robust few-particle entangled states

Title: Noise Protected Logical Qubit in a Open Chain of Superconducting Qubits with Ultrastrong Interactions
Authors: Roberto Stassi, Shilan Abo, Daniele Lamberto, Ye-Hong Chen, Adam Miranowicz, Salvatore Savasta, Franco Nori
Abstract: To achieve a fault-tolerant quantum computer, it is crucial to increase the coherence time of quantum bits. In this work, we theoretically investigate a system consisting of a series of superconducting qubits that alternate between XX and YY ultrastrong interactions. By considering the two-lowest energy eigenstates of this system as a {\it logical} qubit, we demonstrate that its coherence is significantly enhanced: both its pure dephasing and relaxation times are extended beyond those of individual {\it physical} qubits. Specifically, we show that by increasing either the interaction strength or the number of physical qubits in the chain, the logical qubit's pure dephasing rate is suppressed to zero, and its relaxation rate is reduced to half the relaxation rate of a single physical qubit. Single qubit and two-qubit gates can be performed with a high fidelity.

Title: The incompleteness of relativistic Spekkens' contextuality
Authors: Ruben Campos Delgado
Abstract: We show that the operational definition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens is, in general, not Lorentz invariant. Specifically, we consider particle states with both spin and momentum, apply a Lorentz transformation to obtain the states in a new inertial frame, and then trace out the momentum degrees of freedom in both frames. We find that spin states that are contextual in one frame can become non-contextual in the other. Hence, the Spekkens' notion of contextuality, when restricted to spin states only, is a frame-dependent concept. We apply our results to predict a novel relativistic effect concerning the task of discriminating between two quantum states. We show that the probability of success for a moving observer exceeds that of an observer at rest.

Title: How an Equi-ensemble Description Systematically Outperforms the Weighted-ensemble Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Akilan Rajamani, Martin Beseda, Benjamin Lasorne, Bruno Senjean
Abstract: Calculating excited states in chemistry is crucial to provide insight into photoinduced molecular behavior beyond the ground state, enabling innovations in spectroscopy, material sciences, and drug design. While several approaches have been developed to compute excited-state properties, finding the best ratio between computational cost and accuracy remains challenging. The advent of quantum computers brings new perspectives, with the development of quantum algorithms that promise an advantage over classical ones. Most of these new algorithms are inspired from previous classical ones, but with different pros and cons. In this Letter, we focus on the generalization of the variational principle for many-body excited-states that led to the ensemble variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We compare the performance of two ensemble VQE approaches, the equi-ensemble and weighted-ensemble ones, and conclude that the equi-ensemble is the way to go.

Title: Analysis of polymerized superconducting circuits
Authors: Sean Crowe, Stefan Evans, Alexei Smolyaninov
Abstract: We apply polymer quantization, a quantization technique sometimes used in high energy physics, to several superconducting circuits including: transmons, transmission line resonators, and LC circuits. In the case of transmon qubits and transmission line resonators, experimental predictions are very close to what is found with canonical quantization, though in this approach constant charge offsets can be interpreted as quantization ambiguities. In the case of LC circuits, polymer quantization predicts nonlinearities which are not present in the canonical approach. Based on this analysis we design and analyze a qubit which uses a meander inductor instead of a Josephson junction. Implications for qubit performance and fabrication are discussed. Given a choice for an effective phase operator, relevant parameters such as anharmonicity, frequency, and dispersive shifts are calculated for this meander inductor based qubit.

Title: Open-system quantum many-body scars: a theory
Authors: Lorenzo Gotta
Abstract: In this work, we undertake the problem of formally introducing a notion of quantum many-body scarring in open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad equation. To this goal, we rely on the commutant-algebra framework for the description of strong symmetries to introduce the unconventional strong-symmetry structure leading to the existence of anomalous stationary states, which we dub open-system quantum many-body scars (OSQMBS), besides a typical infinite-temperature state. We provide several benchmarks of the theoretical predictions on the stationary-state manifold and on convergence to stationarity, as well as describe the time-evolution of off-diagonal coherences among the Hilbert space symmetry sectors identified by OSQMBS and their orthogonal complement. Moreover, we investigate the existence of asymptotic OSQMBS (AOSQMBS), the latter being states that, despite converging to the typical infinite-temperature state in the large-time limit, display anomalously-large relaxation time scales, which we thoroughly describe by means of the behavior of their fidelity as a function of time through proper scaling Ansaetze.

Title: Probing the Ground State of the Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Model on the Kagome Lattice using Geometrically Informed Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Abdellah Tounsi, Nacer Eddine Belaloui, Abdelmouheymen Rabah Khamadja, Takei Eddine Fadi Lalaoui, Mohamed Messaoud Louamri, David E. Bernal Neira, Mohamed Taha Rouabah
Abstract: This work investigates the nature of the ground state of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on minimal kagome cells -- a triangle and a star -- using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on real quantum hardware. We demonstrate that the ground state preparation is achievable using a shallow hardware-efficient quantum circuit with a naturally Euclidean parameter space. Our custom ansatz is capable of accurately recovering essential properties such as the spin correlation terms for each edge without explicit error mitigation. These features are found to be less sensitive to noise. We exploited the Fubini-Study metric in constructing the ansatz, ensuring a singularity-free parameter space. With this ansatz design, the quantum natural gradient coincides with the normal gradient, complemented with a backtracking search for dynamic step size adaptation. We refer to this regime as the implicit adaptive quantum natural gradient descent. It achieves faster convergence in fewer iterations compared to simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), while maintaining competitive runtime with the metric being analytically constant. We further apply error mitigation techniques, including zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) and qubit-wise readout error mitigation (REM). While ZNE does not obey the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle, the conditions under which REM preserves it are discussed.

Abstract: Quantum pseudo-telepathy games, such as the Mermin-Peres magic square and the doily game, theoretically allow players to win with unit probability when using entangled quantum strategies. We quantitatively characterize the quantum advantage in these games and compare it with violations of two Bell inequalities: the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and the Collins-Gisin inequalities. The analysis is restricted to two families of two-qubit states: modified Werner states and Bell-diagonal states. For each case, we identify and quantify the regions of quantum state space that exhibit either a quantum advantage or a Bell inequality violation, relative to the set of all entangled states. Within these families, the doily game captures a larger fraction of entangled states than the Mermin-Peres magic square game, though both are significantly more limited than the regions associated with Bell inequality violations. Although both approaches are fundamentally linked to quantum contextuality, our analysis of the examined two-qubit state families indicates that Bell inequalities are more effective at revealing entanglement, even if pseudo-telepathy games offer a more intuitive and conceptually appealing perspective.

Title: Detection of long-range coherence in driven hot atomic vapors by spin noise spectroscopy
Authors: Rupak Bag, Sayari Majumder, Saptarishi Chaudhuri, Dibyendu Roy
Abstract: We study intriguing dynamical features of hot Rubidium atoms driven by two light fields. The fields resonantly drive multiple Zeeman states within two hyperfine levels, yielding a cascaded-$\Lambda$ like structure in the frequency space. A non-Hermitian Floquet tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping between the nearest states effectively describes the coherence dynamics between Zeeman states within the ground hyperfine manifold. By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal a power-law decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.

Title: Modelling optimal generation of an arbitrary N-qubit quantum gate within the generalized Bloch vectors formalism due to the Pontryagin principle
Authors: Sergey Kuznetsov, Elena R. Loubenets
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of optimal generation of N-qubit gates for closed quantum systems -- a key task for the practical implementation of various quantum applications. Based on the generalized Bloch vectors formalism for a finite-dimensional quantum system, we develop a new optimal gates generation model, which is universal in the sense that it is applicable for an arbitrary N-qubit gate, any Hamiltonian of a closed N-qubit system and within this model an optimal control is determined only by N-qubit system parameters and does not depend on its initial state. Within the developed model, the synthesis of optimal control, carried out via the Pontryagin principle, leads to the boundary value problem for the system of ODEs, which can be explored by various computational methods. Numerical experiments conducted for generation of a variety of one/two/three qubit gates demonstrate viability of the developed optimal model which allows one to generate N-qubit quantum gates with a high degree of precision.

Title: Efficient formulation of quantum network under amplitude damping noise: Highlighting benefits over its Pauli-twirled counterpart
Authors: Sudipta Mondal, Pritam Halder, Stav Haldar, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: At the heart of building a large-scale quantum internet lies the challenge of establishing long-distance entanglement using quantum repeaters, which mitigate direct transmission losses but introduce additional noise in the nodes via interactions with the environment and imperfect operations. This effect has typically been studied under a simplifying Pauli channel assumption. Our study focuses on distributing end-to-end entanglement in a homogeneous, repeater-based linear quantum network operating under a non-Pauli noise, specifically, amplitude damping noise, which we refer to as amplitude damping-affected quantum network (AQN). Unlike its twirled counterpart (TAQN), where the resulting state is fully Bell-diagonal with a single parameter, we prove that the AQN produces a block-diagonal state in the Bell basis with four parameters. We develop a method for the simulation of AQN, where we keep track of these four parameters of each entangled link, along with the number of times noise acts on it, i.e., its age, until it is consumed for swapping. Our results reveal that across diverse policies, including NESTING and SWAP-ASAP, AQN consistently outperforms TAQN in terms of both fidelity and average entanglement. The benefit is most significant in the low-probability regime of elementary link generation, highly relevant for near-term experiments. Notably, we also identify the coherence-time and link-probability regions where TAQN fails while AQN succeeds in distributing end-to-end entanglement.

Title: Distribution of non-Gaussian states in a deployed telecommunication fiber channel
Authors: Casper A. Breum, Xueshi Guo, Mikkel V. Larsen, Shigehito Miki, Hirotaka Terai, Ulrik L. Andersen, Jonas S. Neergaard-Nielsen
Abstract: Optical non-Gaussian states hold great promise as a pivotal resource for advanced optical quantum information processing and fault-tolerant long-distance quantum communication. Establishing their faithful transmission in a real-world communication channel, therefore, marks an important milestone. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of such non-Gaussian states in a functioning telecommunication channel that connects separate buildings within the DTU campus premises. We send photon-subtracted squeezed states, exhibiting pronounced Wigner negativity, through 300 m of deployed optical fibers to a distant building. Using quantum homodyne tomography, we fully characterize the states upon arrival. Our results show the survival of the Wigner function negativity after transmission when correcting for detection losses, indicating that the established link can potentially facilitate the violation of Bell's inequality and enable quantum steering. This achievement not only validates the practical feasibility of distributing non-Gaussian states in real-world settings, but also provides an exciting impetus towards realizing fully coherent quantum networks for high-dimensional, continuous-variable quantum information processing.

Title: Similarity as Thermodynamic Work: Between Depth and Diversity -- from Information Distance to Ugly Duckling
Authors: Kentaro Imafuku
Abstract: Defining similarity is a fundamental challenge in information science. Watanabe's Ugly Duckling Theorem highlights diversity, while algorithmic information theory emphasizes depth through Information Distance. We propose a statistical-mechanical framework that treats program length as energy, with a temperature parameter unifying these two aspects: in the low-temperature limit, similarity approaches Information Distance; in the high-temperature limit, it recovers the indiscriminability of the Ugly Duckling theorem; and at the critical point, it coincides with the Solomonoff prior. We refine the statistical-mechanical framework by introducing regular universal machines and effective degeneracy ratios, allowing us to separate redundant from core diversity. This refinement yields new tools for analyzing similarity and opens perspectives for information distance, model selection, and non-equilibrium extensions.

Title: Quantum-like representation of neuronal networks' activity: modeling "mental entanglement"
Authors: Andrei Khrennikov, Makiko Yamada
Abstract: Quantum-like modeling (QLM) - quantum theory applications outside of physics - are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for this http URL. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on mental entanglement detection using the EEG/MEG technique.

Title: Entanglement Asymmetry for Higher and Noninvertible Symmetries
Authors: Francesco Benini, Pasquale Calabrese, Michele Fossati, Amartya Harsh Singh, Marco Venuti
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.

Title: Fast momentum-selective transport of Bose-Einstein condensates via controlled non-adiabatic dynamics in optical lattices
Authors: Raja Chamakhi, Dana Codruta Marinica, Naceur Gaaloul, Eric Charron, Mourad Telmini
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical study of a protocol for momentum-selective transport of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice, achieving narrow momentum distributions through controlled non-adiabatic dynamics. The protocol consists of non-adiabatic loading into the lattice, coherent acceleration using a symmetric trapezoidal acceleration profile, and non-adiabatic release into free space. Using the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we simulate the full sequence and analyze the role of non-adiabatic excitations on the final momentum distribution. We identify the intra-site breathing dynamics as the dominant mechanism governing spectral purity under fast loading conditions. By tracking the condensate's spatial width during the evolution, we demonstrate a direct correlation with the final momentum spread. A variational model based on a Gaussian ansatz quantitatively reproduces the observed dynamics and provides physical insight into the breathing mechanism. Our results reveal the existence of magic times, i.e. specific loading or acceleration durations synchronized with the breathing oscillation period, where quasi-monochromatic momentum distributions can be achieved even with loading times as short as 100 $\mu$s, offering a route to coherent transport that is faster than adiabatic protocols. This approach is particularly relevant for quantum sensors operating under stringent timing constraints.

Title: Spontaneous excitation of a centripetally accelerated atom coupled to electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary
Authors: Yan Peng, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu
Abstract: We investigate the rate of change of the mean atomic energy for centripetally accelerated atoms interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary, using the Dalibard-Dupont-Roc-Cohen-Tannoudji formalism. The distinct contributions from vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction are analyzed separately. Our results reveal that, when the centripetal acceleration significantly exceeds the characteristic acceleration set by the atomic transition frequency, vacuum fluctuations dominates over radiation reaction, irrespective of the atom-boundary distance and the atomic polarization. In the near-zone regime, where the atom-boundary distance is much smaller than both the characteristic length associated with the acceleration and the transition wavelength of the atom, the boundary introduces substantial corrections to the rate of change of the mean atomic energy. These corrections are comparable in magnitude to those in free space and exhibit strong dependence on the atomic polarization. Remarkably, in the intermediate and far regions, contributions stemming from the combined effects of the boundary and acceleration can become the leading and subleading terms, respectively. An acceleration-independent term also arises from their interplay. These findings highlight the significant interplay between acceleration and the presence of a boundary in shaping atomic radiative properties and may have potential implications for experimentally probing the circular Unruh effect.

Title: $Δ_T$ Noise as a Robust Diagnostic for Chiral, Helical and Trivial Edge Modes
Authors: Sachiraj Mishra, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: In this article we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise provides a sensitive, practical probe for distinguishing chiral edge modes from topological helical and trivial (non-topological) helical edge transport. Measured under zero-current conditions, $\Delta_T$ noise reveals contrasts that conventional conductance measurements typically miss. Crucially, $\Delta_T$ requires no external energy input in the form of an applied voltage bias, yet encodes the same intrinsic information that shot noise yields in the zero-temperature, finite-bias limit, without the distorting effects of Joule heating. This absence of bias-induced heating makes $\Delta_T$ noise both more precise and more reliable than conventional shot-noise approaches. Moreover, the diagnostic power of $\Delta_T$ noise persists at finite frequencies $\omega$ too. The frequency-dependent signal $\Delta_{T}(\omega)$ exhibits distinctive spectral signatures (including sign changes) that further enhance its utility as an experimentally accessible fingerprint of edge-mode topology.

Title: pyRMG: A Python Framework for High-Throughput, Large-Cell Real-Space MultiGrid DFT Calculations
Authors: R. J. Morelock, S. Bagchi, E. L. Briggs, W. Lu, J. Bernholc, P. Ganesh
Abstract: Computational materials science has evolved toward materials informatics, where large datasets of complex, multispecies compounds are generated and evaluated using density functional theory (DFT). Materials genome projects mine these datasets for candidates with breakthrough properties, but existing databases remain limited to compounds with relatively small unit cells due to computational cost. Exascale computers now provide the power to simulate larger and more chemically realistic systems, but fully realizing this potential requires DFT codes that can efficiently scale to thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) DFT code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which form large, anisotropic supercells. Our results link strain and twist angle to material informatics properties, including stability and band gap, and show that pyRMG can initialize and converge challenging RMG-based workflows with limited user intervention.

Title: On the Ballistic Transport for limit-periodic Jacobi Matrices
Authors: Rui Han, Moises Gomez Solis
Abstract: Motivated by Open Problem 17 in Damanik-Fillman's manuscript , we study the decay rate of limit-periodic approximation such that ballistic transport persists in the limit-periodic setting. We show an exponential decay rate, roughly $\|\mathscr{J}-\mathscr{J}_{q_n}\|\sim e^{-\eta q_n}$, is sufficient. This improves on earlier results of Fillman arXiv:1603.01173

Title: Sublinear Time Quantum Sensitivity Sampling
Authors: Zhao Song, David P. Woodruff, Lichen Zhang
Abstract: We present a unified framework for quantum sensitivity sampling, extending the advantages of quantum computing to a broad class of classical approximation problems. Our unified framework provides a streamlined approach for constructing coresets and offers significant runtime improvements in applications such as clustering, regression, and low-rank approximation. Our contributions include: * $k$-median and $k$-means clustering: For $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, we give an algorithm that constructs an $\epsilon$-coreset in time $\widetilde O(n^{0.5}dk^{2.5}~\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering. Our approach achieves a better dependence on $d$ and constructs smaller coresets that only consist of points in the dataset, compared to recent results of [Xue, Chen, Li and Jiang, ICML'23]. * $\ell_p$ regression: For $\ell_p$ regression problems, we construct an $\epsilon$-coreset of size $\widetilde O_p(d^{\max\{1, p/2\}}\epsilon^{-2})$ in time $\widetilde O_p(n^{0.5}d^{\max\{0.5, p/4\}+1}(\epsilon^{-3}+d^{0.5}))$, improving upon the prior best quantum sampling approach of [Apers and Gribling, QIP'24] for all $p\in (0, 2)\cup (2, 22]$, including the widely studied least absolute deviation regression ($\ell_1$ regression). * Low-rank approximation with Frobenius norm error: We introduce the first quantum sublinear-time algorithm for low-rank approximation that does not rely on data-dependent parameters, and runs in $\widetilde O(nd^{0.5}k^{0.5}\epsilon^{-1})$ time. Additionally, we present quantum sublinear algorithms for kernel low-rank approximation and tensor low-rank approximation, broadening the range of achievable sublinear time algorithms in randomized numerical linear algebra.

Title: Inverse-Designed Photonic Crystal Cavities with Controllable Far-Field Numerical Aperture
Authors: Neelesh Kumar Vij, Purbita Purkayastha, Jasvith Raj Basani, Edo Waks
Abstract: Photonic crystal cavities confine light to subwavelength volumes, enabling strong light-matter interactions for applications in low-power photonics, opto-electronics, nonlinear optics, and quantum information. These applications demand cavities that combine high quality factors, low mode volumes, and high coupling efficiencies. However, optimizing across these metrics requires exploring a large design space, motivating the use of inverse design strategies. Previous inverse design efforts targeted high quality factors and low mode volumes, sacrificing the coupling efficiency or lacking the ability to precisely control the far-field radiation pattern. In this work, we present an inverse design framework that simultaneously optimizes cavity quality factor and far-field numerical aperture, both specified as design targets. Using this method, we design L3 photonic crystal cavities, with different far-field numerical apertures, in the visible wavelength and fabricate them in silicon nitride. Photoluminescence measurements confirm experimental control of the far-field numerical aperture and reveal a 28-fold and 3.9-fold improvement in the coupling efficiency and quality factor respectively when compared to the standard L3 cavity. Disorder analysis further shows that the designs retain significant performance despite nanofabrication imperfections. Our work demonstrates a versatile inverse design framework for multi-objective optimization of photonic crystal cavities to attain high quality factors and coupling efficiency.

Title: Spatial-mode demultiplexing for quantum-inspired superresolution experiments
Authors: Nickolay Erin Titov
Abstract: Conventional optical imaging is limited by diffraction, preventing discrimination of closely spaced incoherent sources. Inspired by quantum parameter estimation, this thesis explores spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) as a method to overcome this limit by projecting light onto an orthonormal mode basis. In this work, we design and experimentally validate a practical implementation of spatial-mode demultiplexing via Multi-Plane Light Conversion (MPLC).

Title: Green's functions for magnetic Dirac operators and bulk-edge correspondence
Authors: Jean-Marie Barbaroux, Horia D. Cornean, Loïc Le Treust, Nicolas Raymond, Edgardo Stockmeyer
Abstract: We study the resolvent kernel (Green's function) of magnetic Dirac operators on a half-plane with boundary conditions interpolating between infinite mass and zigzag cases, excluding the latter. We show that these kernels have all the required properties so that the proof of bulk-edge correspondence from the infinite mass case shown recently can be repeated ad litteram. The zigzag case exhibits qualitatively different behavior and will be addressed in future work.

Title: On the Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field with Magnetic Monopoles
Authors: Kanan Anwar
Abstract: We present a covariant framework for the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the presence of magnetic monopoles. Building on the two-potential formalism of Cabibbo and Ferrari, which treats electric and magnetic sources on equal footing and reveals a $U(1) \times U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we extend the theory into the quantum domain. Using the Gupta-Bleuler procedure in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge, we construct the physical Hilbert space and eliminate negative-norm states. The resulting theory predicts, in addition to conventional photons, the existence of dual photons associated with magnetic charges. We discuss the role of these dual excitations and their possible relevance in the broader context of electromagnetic duality and gauge theories.

Title: VQEzy: An Open-Source Dataset for Parameter Initialize in Variational Quantum Eigensolvers
Authors: Chi Zhang, Mengxin Zheng, Qian Lou, Hui Min Leung, Fan Chen
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, whose performance is highly sensitive to parameter initialization. Although recent machine learning-based initialization methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are typically restricted to a single domain, contain only a few hundred instances, and lack complete coverage of Hamiltonians, ansatz circuits, and optimization trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VQEzy, the first large-scale dataset for VQE parameter initialization. VQEzy spans three major domains and seven representative tasks, comprising 12,110 instances with full VQE specifications and complete optimization trajectories. The dataset is available online, and will be continuously refined and expanded to support future research in VQE optimization.

Title: DiffQ: Unified Parameter Initialization for Variational Quantum Algorithms via Diffusion Models
Authors: Chi Zhang, Mengxin Zheng, Qian Lou, Fan Chen
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are widely used in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, but their trainability and performance depend critically on initialization parameters that shape the optimization landscape. Existing machine learning-based initializers achieve state-of-the-art results yet remain constrained to single-task domains and small datasets of only hundreds of samples. We address these limitations by reformulating VQA parameter initialization as a generative modeling problem and introducing DiffQ, a parameter initializer based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). To support robust training and evaluation, we construct a dataset of 15,085 instances spanning three domains and five representative tasks. Experiments demonstrate that DiffQ surpasses baselines, reducing initial loss by up to 8.95 and convergence steps by up to 23.4%.

Title: Dimensionality effect on exceptional fermionic superfluidity with spin-dependent asymmetric hopping
Authors: Soma Takemori, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems host exceptional points (EPs), where eigenstates and eigenvalues coalesce, leading to unconventional many-body phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. While NH fermionic systems with complex interactions exhibit superfluid (SF) breakdown with EPs, spin-dependent asymmetric hopping can stabilize a NH superfluid (NH-SF) that coexists with EPs. In this work, we investigate the quasi-one-dimensional NH attractive Fermi-Hubbard model by using NH BCS theory. We demonstrate that, when the system is regarded as weakly-coupled chains, the exceptional SF phase becomes unstable and metastable (exceptional) SF state appears between the stable SF and normal states. In the one-dimensional limit, the exceptional SF disappear entirely and EPs only appear on the phase boundary between the normal and SF states. These results reveal how dimensional crossover governs the stability of the exceptional SF, providing the insights into the interplay between dimensionality and dissipation, with potential relevance for experimental implications in ultracold atoms.

Title: Investigating Roles of Triple Excitations for High-precision Determination of Clock Properties of Alkaline Earth Singly Charged Ions
Authors: A. Chakraborty, Vaibhav Katyal, B. K. Sahoo
Abstract: High-accuracy calculations of electric dipole polarizabilities and quadrupole moments ($\Theta$) of the clock states of the singly charged calcium (Ca$^+$), strontium (Sr$^+$) and barium (Ba$^+$) alkaline-earth ions are estimated by employing relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. It demonstrates importance of the triple excitations in the RCC method for precise determination of the above quantities. We also observe a different trend of correlations in the $\Theta$ values than an earlier study with respect to orbitals from higher angular momenta. Reliability of the results is verified by comparing the calculated energies, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants, and lifetimes of the atomic states with the experimental values of the $^{43}$Ca$^+$, $^{87}$Sr$^+$ and $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions. Nuclear quadrupole moments of these isotopes are also estimated by combining calculations with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants, showing large deviations from the literature values.

Title: Single-shot pulse retrieval of femtosecond bright squeezed vacuum
Authors: Yuval Kern, Ido Nisim, Michael Birk, Andrei Rasputnyi, Doron Behar, Zhaopin Chen, Ido Kaminer, Pavel Sidorenko, Oren Cohen, Michael Krüger
Abstract: Bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) is an intense quantum state of light with zero mean electric field and huge photon number fluctuations, sufficiently intense to drive extreme nonlinear processes and imprint nonclassical statistics. However, the temporal structure of single BSV shots has not been fully characterized. Here, we retrieve the spectral and temporal pulse characteristics of a set of single-peak BSV shots. It is obtained by realizing a femtosecond BSV source at 1040 nm with a single spatial mode and perform single-shot spectral interferometry with a fully characterized coherent-state reference pulse. Our approach reveals that the group delay is consistent between the various shots, resulting in an average pulse duration of 27.2 fs, much shorter than the pump pulse, and a variation of 5.5 fs (standard deviation). We also observe a characteristic nodal structure in the spectral interferograms, demonstrating the BSV's random phase ambiguity of $\pi$ rad. Our approach demonstrates that BSV is a viable source of femtosecond light pulses for attosecond sub-cycle metrology of ultrafast electron dynamics.

Title: Optimal local basis truncation of lattice quantum many-body systems
Authors: Peter Majcen, Giovanni Cataldi, Pietro Silvi, Simone Montangero
Abstract: We show how to optimally reduce the local Hilbert basis of lattice quantum many-body (QMB) Hamiltonians. The basis truncation exploits the most relevant eigenvalues of the estimated single-site reduced density matrix (RDM). It is accurate and numerically stable across different model phases, even close to quantum phase transitions. We apply this procedure to different models, such as the Sine-Gordon model, the $\varphi^{4}$ theory, and lattice gauge theories, namely Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, in one and two spatial dimensions. Our results reduce state-of-the-art estimates of computational resources for classical and quantum simulations.

Title: Sub-femtosecond stabilization of multicore fiber for high-fidelity quantum networking at 100% duty cycle
Authors: Takuma Nakamura, Nazanin Hoghooghi, Nicolas Fontaine, Tetsuya Hayashi, Takuji Nagashima, Nicholas V. Nardelli, Dileep V. Reddy, Martin J. Stevens, Tara Fortier, Lynden K. Shalm, Franklyn Quinlan
Abstract: Originally envisioned as a solution for the capacity crunch in telecommunications networks, multicore fibers (MCF) are contributing to scientific fields beyond telecom, such as sensing and metrology. Confined within the same cladding, the cores of MCF have a high degree of noise correlation which can be harnessed for a variety of applications. Here, we investigate MCF as a solution to the challenging problem of quantum and classical light co-existence in quantum networks by operating the quantum and stabilization light in separate but highly correlated cores of a 7-core MCF. Over 40 km of spooled fiber, we achieved 100 attosecond integrated jitter on one core by using phase information derived from another core. This allows for 100% duty cycle on a quantum channel while maintaining a low spurious photon rate from crosstalk between stabilization and quantum channels. With cycle-slip-free stabilization over 6 hours, frequency detuning between designated stabilization and quantum channels, and an additional 40 dB rejection of noise photons provided by the low optical crosstalk between cores, we achieved a Raman scattering-induced spurious photon rate of only 0.01 photons/s in 100 GHz bandwidth. Our results with MCF are a promising approach to ultra-stable quantum networks with 100% duty cycle on the quantum channel.

Title: Exploring molecular supersolidity via exact and mean-field theories: single microwave shielding
Authors: Tiziano Arnone Cardinale, Thomas Bland, Stephanie M. Reimann
Abstract: Ultracold polar molecules with microwave shielding provide a powerful platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with strong, anisotropic interactions. We develop an extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework for bosonic molecules under single microwave shielding, incorporating effective interactions and quantum fluctuations, and benchmark it against exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the regime of positive scattering lengths, our approach captures superfluid, supersolid, and droplet phases with excellent accuracy. We show that elliptic microwave polarization induces direction-dependent superfluidity - absent in cylindrically symmetric systems - enabling tunable anisotropy and potential applications in directional quantum sensing. A quasi-1D theory reveals that roton softening and instabilities can be controlled via ellipticity, consistent with recent experiments. Furthermore, we find that the nature of the superfluid-to-supersolid transition is strongly influenced by the ellipticity: the transition is sharp at low ellipticity and continuous at higher values. This tunability offers a potential route for low entropy preparation of molecular supersolids via adiabatic ramps. While double shielding is often used experimentally, our results demonstrate that single-shielded molecules already offer rich, controllable behavior, laying the groundwork for future studies with more complex shielding schemes.

Title: The Many Faces of Non-invertible Symmetries
Authors: Shadi Ali Ahmad, Marc S. Klinger, Yifan Wang
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.

Title: Pseudogap in a Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator
Authors: Lev Haldar Kendrick, Anant Kale, Youqi Gang, Alexander Dennisovich Deters, Martin Lebrat, Aaron W. Young, Markus Greiner
Abstract: Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials. The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures. Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics.

Title: Mitigating Source and Detection Noises in Auto-correlative Weak-Value Amplification
Authors: Xiang-Yun Hu, Jing-Hui Huang, Fei-Fan He, Guang-Jun Wang, Adetunmise C. Dada
Abstract: Weak-value amplification (WVA) is a post-selection-based technique that amplifies weak physical signals by preparing nearly orthogonal pre- and post-selected quantum states. It is intrinsically limited by various kinds of technical noise, which distorts amplified weak values, especially when discarding photons in post-selection. While prior work established the efficacy of auto-correlative weak-value amplification (AWVA) under Gaussian noise, practical implementations face challenges from band-limited laser-source noise and detection noise. Here, we demonstrate that the AWVA protocol robustly suppresses both laser-power fluctuations and detection noise. Numerical experiments in Simulink further reveal AWVA dual advantage. Under high-power conditions, the noise-reduction superiority of AWVA over WVA becomes increasingly pronounced as input laser power increases. In detection-limited regimes, AWVA achieves an order-of-magnitude lower uncertainty, closely approaching the Cramer-Rao bound. This work demonstrates that AWVA improves precision in both high-power laser-noise-dominated and photon-starved regimes, thereby bridging these operating extremes and advancing precision in applications from gravitational-wave detection to hybrid quantum systems.

Abstract: The detection of microwave fields at single-photon power levels is a much sought-after technology, with practical applications in nanoelectronics and quantum information science. Here we demonstrate a simple yet powerful criticality-enhanced method of microwave photon detection by operating a magnetic-field tunable Kerr Josephson parametric amplifier at the border of a first-order phase transition and close to the critical point. We obtain a 73\% efficiency and a dark-count rate of 167 kHz, corresponding to a responsivity of $1.3 \times 10^{17}~\mathrm{W}^{-1}$ and noise-equivalent power of 3.28 zW/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$. We verify the single-photon operation by extracting the Poissonian statistics of a coherent probe signal.

Title: Optimal Particle-Conserved Linear Encoding for Practical Fermionic Simulation
Authors: M. H. Cheng, Yu-Cheng Chen, Qian Wang, V. Bartsch, M. S. Kim, Alice Hu, Min-Hsiu Hsieh
Abstract: Number-conserved subspace encoding reduces resources needed for quantum simulations, but scalable complexity trade-off bounds for $M$ modes and $N$ particles with $\mathcal{O}(N\log M)$ qubits have remained unknown. We study qubit-gate-measurement trade-offs through the lens of classical/quantum error correction complexity, and develop a framework of fermionic gate and measurement complexity based on encoder and decoder complexities appeared in error correction framework. We demonstrate optimal encoding with random classical parity check code and propose the Fermionic Expectation Decoder for scalable probability decoding in $\mathcal{O}(M^4)$ bases. The protocol is tested with variational quantum eigensolver on LiH in the STO-3G and 6-31G basis, and $\text{H}_2$ potential energy curve in the 6-311G* basis.

Title: Measurement reduction for expectation values via fine-grained commutativity
Authors: Ben DalFavero, Rahul Sarkar, Jeremiah Rowland, Daan Camps, Nicolas Sawaya, Ryan LaRose
Abstract: We introduce a notion of commutativity between operators on a tensor product space, nominally Pauli strings on qubits, that interpolates between qubit-wise commutativity and (full) commutativity. We apply this notion, which we call $k$-commutativity, to measuring expectation values of observables in quantum circuits and show a reduction in the number measurements at the cost of increased circuit depth. Last, we discuss the asymptotic measurement complexity of $k$-commutativity for several families of $n$-qubit Hamiltonians, showing examples with $O(1)$, $O(\sqrt{n})$, and $O(n)$ scaling.

Title: Hartman Effect from a Geometrodynamic Extension of Bohmian Mechanics
Authors: Said Lantigua, Jonas Maziero
Abstract: This paper develops a geometrodynamic extension of Bohmian mechanics to describe quantum tunneling through a potential barrier, treating particle trajectories as geodesics in an Alcubierre-type spacetime. The model provides analytical expressions for the quantum potential, particle dynamics, and tunneling time, explicitly linked to the underlying spacetime geometry. For narrow barriers, the tunneling time depends on the barrier width, while for sufficiently wide barriers, it saturates to a constant value-recovering the Hartman effect. This behavior arises from a geometric self-regulation mechanism, where the quantum potential dynamically adjusts the spacetime distortion to maintain a fixed tunneling time, consistent with relativistic causality despite effective superluminal propagation. The results establish a direct connection between quantum tunneling and spacetime geometry, offering a unified framework to interpret the Hartman effect. This approach naturally incorporates relativistic constraints while suggesting that similar geometric mechanisms may underlie other quantum phenomena, such as topological phases in condensed matter systems.

Title: Simulating decoherence of two coupled spins using the generalized cluster correlation expansion
Authors: Xiao Chen, Silas Hoffman, James N. Fry, Hai-Ping Cheng
Abstract: We simulate the coherence of two coupled electron spins interacting with a bath of nuclei using the generalized cluster correlation expansion (gCCE) method. An exchange interaction between the electrons facilitates a family of entangling gates that can be spoiled by nuclear-induced dephasing. Consequently, we study the dephasing of the coherent two-electron system by characterizing the $T_2$ and $T_2^*$ of the two-electron reduced density matrix for various system parameters in the range mimicking magnetic molecules, including magnetic field strength and orientation, exchange interaction strength, distance between the two spins, minimum distance between electron and nuclei and between nuclei, and nuclei density. We find the optimal regime for each parameter in which the coherence time is maximized and provide a physical understanding of it.

Title: Quantum-Computer-Based Verification of Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation
Authors: Nobumasa Ishida, Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations establish fundamental trade-offs between the precision achievable in quantum systems and associated thermodynamic quantities such as entropy production or dynamical activity. While foundational, empirical demonstrations have thus far been confined to specific cases, either assuming time-reversal symmetry or involving particular measurement types, leaving the verification of their universal validity unrealized. This work leverages a quantum computer to report the first empirical verification of a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, valid for arbitrary dynamics and observables. We theoretically derive the relation, revealing survival activity as the pivotal thermodynamic quantity governing the precision bound. The verification is demonstrated on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor, which is treated as a real thermodynamic system. To achieve accurate results despite substantial device errors, we introduce a generic protocol for measuring survival activity and employ circuit reduction techniques based on the relation's properties. This strategy allows us to empirically identify survival activity for the first time and confirm the derived relation. Furthermore, the quantum computer's versatility enables the implementation of optimal observables, leading to the saturation of the relation and demonstrating the sharpness of our bound on a physical device. The method's broad applicability is further illustrated by verifying the trade-off for quantum time correlators. Our findings establish quantum computers as effective platforms for investigating fundamental thermodynamic trade-off relations.

Title: Error Correction in Dynamical Codes
Authors: Esther Xiao Zhen Fu, Daniel Gottesman
Abstract: We ask what is the general framework for a quantum error correcting code that is defined by a sequence of measurements. Recently, there has been much interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.

Title: A Provably Secure Framework for Noise-Aware Delegated Quantum Computation and Storage
Authors: Sanidhya Gupta, Ankur Raina
Abstract: As large-scale quantum computers become a reality, they will likely exist as centralized cloud resources accessible to a broad user base. Securely delegating private quantum computations to untrusted servers is therefore a foundational challenge. This requires rigorous, provable guarantees of privacy (blindness), cor- rectness (completeness), and integrity against malicious actions (verifiability). This paper presents a complete end-to-end framework for noise-aware distributed quantum computation. Our architecture is built on three technical pillars: (1) a distributed stabilizer code backbone to securely encode and store quantum states across multiple non-communicating server nodes; (2) a two-level error correction scheme, where each server node can locally correct errors based on its specific noise model; and (3) a trap-based verification protocol to detect any malicious deviation by the server. We formally provide a security analysis to prove that our framework achieves completeness, blindness, and verifiability. Our work thus provides a practical and provably secure blueprint for trustworthy distributed quantum computation framework, paving the way for secure quantum cloud services.

Title: Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials
Authors: Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.

Title: Light Cone Cancellation for Variational Quantum Eigensolver in Solving Noisy Max-Cut
Authors: Xinwei Lee, Xinjian Yan, Ningyi Xie, Yoshiyuki Saito, Leo Kurosawa, Nobuyoshi Asai, Dongsheng Cai, Hoong Chuin LAU
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm used to estimate the ground energy of a given Hamiltonian. It consists of a parameterized quantum circuit, which the parameters are optimized using a classical optimizer. With the increasing need in solving large-scale problems in real-world applications, solving those large problems with fewer qubits and fewer gates becomes essential, so that we reduce the simulation difficulty and mitigate the effect of noise in real quantum hardware. In this study, we applied the Light Cone Cancellation (LCC) method to reduce the number of qubits and gates required in a two-local ansatz. LCC removes redundant gates that are not required in the calculation of the expectation value for a local observable. This leads to two consequences: 1) the quantum circuit used to create the trial wavefunction of VQE can be broken down into multiple quantum subcircuits with fewer qubits, enabling large-scale problems to be solved without actually simulating the entire circuit; and 2) reduced number of quantum gates in the circuit leads to the noise mitigation in quantum hardware. The main purpose of this work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method (called the LCC-VQE) in mitigating the device noise when solving the Max-Cut problem up to 100 qubits, using simulations on small (7-qubit and 27-qubit) fake noisy backends. Employing a single-layer two-local ansatz circuit architecture, the reuslts show that LCC-VQE yields higher approximation ratios than those cases without LCC, implying that the effect of noise is mitigated when LCC is applied. An analysis of more than one layer of two-local ansatz is also performed, but empirical results show that the single-layer ansatz still performs the best among them. We also compare LCC-VQE under noiseless conditions with the Goemans-Williamson algorithm.

Title: Lossless Postselected Quantum Metrology with Quasi-pure Mixed States
Authors: Jing Yang
Abstract: Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for applying postselection techniques to technical noise suppression, realistic quantum imaging and postselected distributed quantum sensing and offers new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.

Title: A Quantum Information Perspective on Many-Body Dispersive Forces
Authors: Christopher Willby, Martin Kiffner, Joseph Tindall, Jason Crain, Dieter Jaksch
Abstract: Despite its ubiquity, the quantum many-body properties of dispersion remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the entanglement distribution in assemblies of quantum Drude oscillators, minimal models for dispersion-bound systems. We establish an analytic relationship between entanglement and correlation energy and show how entanglement monogamy determines whether many-body corrections to the pair potential are attractive, repulsive, or zero. These findings, demonstrated in trimers and extended lattices, apply in more general chemical environments where dispersion coexists with other cohesive forces.

Title: Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) for Adiabatic State Preparation and Time Evolution in Quantum Simulations
Authors: Zhiyao Li, Dorota M. Grabowska, Martin J. Savage
Abstract: We introduce the Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) scheme for reducing the resources required for state preparation and time evolution in quantum simulations, based upon a truncation in sequency. For the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial expansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency are derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in sequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by magic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing cutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state preparation of the $\lambda\phi^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using IBM's quantum computer ${\textit ibm\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of the required quantum circuits is reduced by $\sim 30\%$, leading to significantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum simulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in required resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of length scales.

Title: Analog Quantum Simulation of Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics in Molecules
Authors: Jong-Kwon Ha, Ryan J. MacDonell
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for quantum dynamics simulations. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. We present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.

Title: Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation
Authors: Nathan Claudet, Simon Perdrix
Abstract: Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.

Title: Bosonic Entanglement and Quantum Sensing from Energy Transfer in two-tone Floquet Systems
Authors: Yinan Chen, Andreas Elben, Angel Rubio, Gil Refael
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced sensors, which surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL) and approach the fundamental precision limits dictated by quantum mechanics, are finding applications across a wide range of scientific fields. This quantum advantage becomes particularly significant when a large number of particles are included in the sensing circuit. Achieving such enhancement requires introducing and preserving entanglement among many particles, posing significant experimental challenges. In this work, we integrate concepts from Floquet theory and quantum information to design an entangler capable of generating the desired entanglement between two paths of a quantum interferometer. We demonstrate that our path-entangled states enable sensing beyond the SQL, reaching the fundamental Heisenberg limit (HL) of quantum mechanics. Moreover, we show that a decoding parity measurement maintains the HL when specific conditions from Floquet theory are satisfied$\unicode{x2013}$particularly those related to the periodic driving parameters that preserve entanglement during evolution. We address the effects of a priori phase uncertainty and imperfect transmission, showing that our method remains robust under realistic conditions. Finally, we propose a superconducting-circuit implementation of our sensor in the microwave regime, highlighting its potential for practical applications in high-precision measurements.

Title: Strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics using a superconducting flux qubit
Authors: Rishabh Upadhyay, Bayan Karimi, Diego Subero, Christoforus Dimas Satrya, Joonas T. Peltonen, Yu-Cheng Chang, Jukka P. Pekola
Abstract: Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments.

Title: Information geometry of transitions between quantum nonequilibrium steady states
Authors: Artur M. Lacerda, Laetitia P. Bettmann, John Goold
Abstract: In a transition between nonequilibrium steady states, the entropic cost associated with the maintenance of steady-state currents can be distinguished from that arising from the transition itself through the concepts of excess/housekeeping entropy flux and adiabatic/nonadiabatic entropy production. The thermodynamics of this transition is embodied by the Hatano-Sasa relation. In this letter, we show that for a slow transition between quantum nonequilibrium steady states the nonadiabatic entropy production is, to leading order, given by the path action with respect to a Riemannian metric in the parameter space which can be connected to the Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov quantum Fisher information. We then demonstrate how to obtain minimally dissipative paths by solving the associated geodesic equation and illustrate the procedure with a simple example of a three-level maser. Furthermore, by identifying the quantum Fisher information with respect to time as a metric in state space, we derive an upper bound on the excess entropy flux that holds for arbitrarily fast processes.

Title: Quantum algorithm for the gradient of a logarithm-determinant
Authors: Thomas E. Baker, Jaimie A. Greasley
Abstract: The logarithm-determinant is an widely-present operation in many areas of physics and computer science. Derivatives of the logarithm-determinant compute physically relevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as well as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum gradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the logarithm-determinant. From this, the inverse of a sparse-rank input operator may be determined efficiently. Measuring an expectation value of the quantum state--instead of all $N^2$ elements of the input operator--can be accomplished in $O(k/\varepsilon^2)$ time in the idealized case for $k$ relevant eigenvectors of the input matrix with precision $\varepsilon$. A practical implementation of the required operator will likely need $\log_2N$ overhead, giving an overall complexity of $O((k\log_2 N)/\varepsilon^2)$. The method applies widely and converges super-linearly in $k$ when the condition number is high. The best classical method we are aware of scales as $N$. Given the same resource assumptions as other algorithms, such that an equal superposition of eigenvectors is available efficiently, the algorithm is evaluated in the practical case as $O(\log_2 N/\varepsilon^2)$. The output is given in $O(1)$ queries of oracle, which is given explicitly here and only relies on time-evolution operators that can be implemented with arbitrarily small error. The algorithm is envisioned for fully error-corrected quantum computers but may be implementable on near-term machines. We discuss how this algorithm can be used for kernel-based quantum machine-learning.

Title: Benchmarking quantum devices beyond classical capabilities
Authors: Rafał Bistroń, Marcin Rudziński, Ryszard Kukulski, Karol Życzkowski
Abstract: Rapid development of quantum computing technology has led to a wide variety of sophisticated quantum devices. Benchmarking these systems becomes crucial for understanding their capabilities and paving the way for future advancements. The Quantum Volume (QV) test is one of the most widely used benchmarks for evaluating quantum computer performance due to its architecture independence. However, as the number of qubits in a quantum device grows, the test faces a significant limitation: classical simulation of the quantum circuit, which is indispensable for evaluating QV, becomes computationally impractical. In this work, we propose modifications of the QV test that allow for direct determination of the most probable outcomes of a quantum circuit, eliminating the need for expensive classical simulations. This approach resolves the scalability problem of the Quantum Volume test beyond classical computational capabilities, while still examining key features of universal quantum computing.

Title: Deciding Local Unitary Equivalence of Graph States in Quasi-Polynomial Time
Authors: Nathan Claudet, Simon Perdrix
Abstract: We describe an algorithm with quasi-polynomial runtime $n^{\log_2(n)+O(1)}$ for deciding local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states. The algorithm builds on a recent graphical characterisation of LU-equivalence via generalised local complementation. By first transforming the corresponding graphs into a standard form using usual local complementations, LU-equivalence reduces to the existence of a single generalised local complementation that maps one graph to the other. We crucially demonstrate that this reduces to solving a system of quasi-polynomially many linear equations, avoiding an exponential blow-up. As a byproduct, we generalise Bouchet's algorithm for deciding local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states by allowing the addition of arbitrary linear constraints. We also improve existing bounds on the size of graph states that are LU- but not LC-equivalent. While the smallest known examples involve 27 qubits, and it is established that no such examples exist for up to 8 qubits, we refine this bound by proving that LU- and LC-equivalence coincide for graph states involving up to 19 qubits.

Title: Meissner-Like Currents of Photons in Anomalous Superradiant Phases
Authors: Linjun Li, Pengfei Huang, Zi-Xiang Hu, Yu-Yu Zhang
Abstract: We present Meissner-like photon currents in a quantum Rabi zigzag chain under staggered synthetic magnetic fields. The ground state of the Meissner superradiant phase hosts persistent chiral edge currents in a sequence of cancellation of antiparallel vortex pairs, akin to surface currents of the Meissner effect in superconductors. The Meissner phase displays distinct vortex structures and anomalous scaling exponents, arising from geometric frustration effects. Modifying the staggered flux triggers transitions to even- or odd-vortex superradiant phases, where the chiral edge currents flow exclusively in even or odd cavities with localized vortices, respectively. Enhanced interspecies interactions induce the vanishing of currents in a ferromagnetic superradiant phase. Our results enable observation of stabilized photon vortices and edge currents with analogy to quantum Hall-like robustness in light-matter coupling systems.

Title: Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics
Authors: Amit Vikram
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.

Title: Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut
Authors: Bikrant Bhattacharyya, Michael Capriotti, Reuben Tate
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization, especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths. For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly dependent on the problem type.

Title: Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Atom in a Cavity
Authors: M.I. Mazhari, Rituraj
Abstract: Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the main methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an atom in a doubly resonant cavity. The system, consisting of an atom interacting with two modes of the cavity, is modelled by the Lindblad Master Equation. An approximate analytical solution is derived, using a novel approximation method, to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. The model also predicts the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency turns out to be approximately $0.1\%$, which is about three orders of magnitude greater than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Fano Factor. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and the spectrum exhibits distinct peaks that correspond to transitions between the manifolds of the system.

Title: Excitation transfer and many-body dark states in waveguide quantum electrodynamics
Authors: Wei Chen, Guin-Dar Lin, H. H. Jen
Abstract: In one-dimensional waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, quantum emitters interact through infinite-range, dispersive, and dissipative dipole-dipole interactions mediated by guided photonic modes. These interactions give rise to long-range periodic behavior and rich many-body physics absent in free space. In this work, we construct a set of symmetrized multi-excitation dark states and derive analytic expressions for their time-evolution projections. This framework captures the essential dynamics of excitation transport and storage while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to full quantum simulations. Our analysis reveals a fundamental bound on energy redistribution governed by the structure of dark states and collective dissipation, and discovers that optimal excitation transfer between emitter ensembles converges toward an initial pumped fraction of $N_\text{p}/N \approx 0.55$ for large system sizes. We further examine the robustness of this mechanism under realistic imperfections, including positional disorder, nonradiative decay, and dephasing. These results highlight the role of many-body dark states in enabling efficient and controllable energy transfer, offering new insights into dissipative many-body dynamics in integrated quantum platforms.

Title: Detecting genuine multipartite entanglement in multi-qubit devices with restricted measurements
Authors: Nicky Kai Hong Li, Xi Dai, Manuel H. Muñoz-Arias, Kevin Reuer, Marcus Huber, Nicolai Friis
Abstract: Detecting genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a state-characterization task that benchmarks coherence and experimental control in quantum systems. Existing GME tests often require joint measurements on many qubits, posing experimental challenges for systems like time-bin encoded qubits and microwave photons from superconducting circuits, where qubit connectivity is limited or measurement noise grows with the number of jointly measured qubits. Here we introduce versatile GME and $k$-inseparability criteria applicable to any state, which only require measuring $O(n^2)$ out of $2^n$ (at most) $m$-body stabilizers of $n$-qubit target graph states, with $m$ upper-bounded by twice the underlying graph's maximum degree. For cluster or ring-graph states, only constant-weight stabilizers are needed. Using semidefinite programming, we further reduce both the number and weight of required stabilizers. Analytical and numerical results show that our criteria are noise-robust and can infer state infidelity from certified $k$-inseparability in microwave photonic graph states generated under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Levitation of macroscopic objects in a vacuum is key towards the development of high-precision inertial sensors and pressure sensors, as well as towards the fundamental studies of quantum mechanics and its relation to gravity. Diamagnetic levitation offers a passive method at room temperature to isolate macroscopic objects in vacuum environments, yet eddy current damping remains a critical limitation for electrically conductive materials. We show that there are situations where the motion of conductors in magnetic fields does not, in principle, produce eddy damping, and demonstrate an electrically conducting rotor diamagnetically levitated in an axially symmetric magnetic field in a high vacuum. Experimental measurements and finite-element simulations reveal gas collision damping as the dominant loss mechanism at high pressures, while residual eddy damping, which arises from symmetry-breaking factors such as platform tilt or material imperfections, dominates at low pressures. The conclusion is supported by an analytic proof and an analytic example of zero steady current density for a rotating conductor in a magnetic field. This demonstrates a macroscopic levitated rotor with extremely low rotational damping and paves the way to fully suppress rotor damping, enabling ultra-low-loss rotors for gyroscopes, pressure sensing, and fundamental physics tests.

Title: Enhanced spreading in continuous-time quantum walks using aperiodic temporal modulation of defects
Authors: José J. Ximenes, Marcelo A. Pires, José M. Villas-Bôas
Abstract: Parrondo's paradox, where the alternation of two losing strategies can produce a winning outcome, has recently been demonstrated in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) through periodic defect modulation. We extend this phenomenon to aperiodic protocols. We show that deterministic, non-repetitive defect switching can enhance quantum spreading in CTQWs compared to the defect-free case. Furthermore, we establish that the degree of this enhancement is strongly influenced by the autocorrelation and persistence characteristics of the applied aperiodic sequence. Our findings indicate that aperiodic defect modulation reliably maintains Parrondo's effect and provides new ways to control wavepacket properties in CTQWs.

Title: Hardware-efficient quantum phase estimation via local control
Authors: Benjamin F. Schiffer, Dominik S. Wild, Nishad Maskara, Mikhail D. Lukin, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation plays a central role in quantum simulation as it enables the study of spectral properties of many-body quantum systems. Most variants of the phase estimation algorithm require the application of the global unitary evolution conditioned on the state of one or more auxiliary qubits, posing a significant challenge for current quantum devices. In this work, we present an approach to quantum phase estimation that uses only locally controlled operations, resulting in a significantly reduced circuit depth. At the heart of our approach are efficient routines to measure the complex phase of the expectation value of the time-evolution operator, the so-called Loschmidt echo, for both circuit dynamics and Hamiltonian dynamics. By tracking changes in the phase during the dynamics, the routines trade circuit depth for an increased sampling cost and classical postprocessing. Our approach does not rely on reference states and is applicable to any efficiently preparable state, regardless of its correlations. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity and illustrate the results with numerical simulations. Our methods offer a practical pathway for measuring spectral properties in large many-body quantum systems using current quantum devices.

Title: Thermal Noise Measurement Below the Standard Quantum Limit
Authors: Ronald Pagano, Scott Aronson, Torrey Cullen, Garrett D. Cole, Thomas Corbitt
Abstract: We present a method characterizing thermal noise in an optical cavity independent from quantum noise despite the thermal noise falling below the quantum noise limit. Using this method, we measured the thermal noise contribution from a GaAs AlGaAs micro-mirror suspended on a GaAs cantilever microresonator when brought to a cryogenic temperature (approximately 25 K) and incorporated into a Fabry Perot cavity. An optical spring is formed in this optical cavity. Previously, this setup exploited an optical spring to produce a displacement sensitivity falling 2.8 dB below the free-mass standard quantum limit (SQL), as reported by Cullen et. al. Here we use a similar setup to measure thermal noise which fell a maximum of 5 dB below the SQL. This measurement, in turn, allowed for an investigation of quantum noise suppression resulting from the optical spring effect, falling a maximum of 10 dB below the SQL.

Title: Methods for Reducing Ancilla-Overhead in Block Encodings
Authors: Francisca Vasconcelos, András Gilyén
Abstract: Block encodings are a fundamental primitive in quantum algorithms, but can often have large ancilla overhead. In this work, we introduce novel techniques for reducing this overhead in two distinct ways. In Part I, we prove the existence of a "space-time tradeoff" by deriving an algorithm that, for any block encoding, approximately uncomputes all but one of its ancilla (freeing up those ancillae for reuse in later parts of a quantum algorithm). In Part II, we evaluate the minimum number of ancillae required to perform coherent multiplication of block encodings and introduce a "space-accuracy tradeoff". Specfically, we prove that logarithmic ancillae is optimal for exact multiplication of block encodings, but show that (in certain block encoding regimes) approximate multiplication of block encodings can be achieved to high-precision with just one ancilla.

Abstract: We investigate state-transfer in modular quantum computer architectures exploiting the ultrastrong coupling regime of interaction between quantum processing units and ICs. We show that protocols based on adiabatic coherent transport may achieve near-ideal single-letter quantum capacity and robustness against parametric fluctuations suppressing leakage induced by the dynamical Casimir effect.

Title: Planted Solutions in Quantum Chemistry: Generating Non-Trivial Hamiltonians with Known Ground States
Authors: Linjun Wang, Joshua T. Cantin, Smik Patel, Ignacio Loaiza, Rick Huang, Artur F. Izmaylov
Abstract: Generating large, non-trivial quantum chemistry test problems with known ground-state solutions remains a core challenge for benchmarking electronic structure methods. Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.

Title: Computational aspects of the trace norm contraction coefficient
Authors: Idris Delsol, Omar Fawzi, Jan Kochanowski, Akshay Ramachandran
Abstract: We show that approximating the trace norm contraction coefficient of a quantum channel within a constant factor is NP-hard. Equivalently, this shows that determining the optimal success probability for encoding a bit in a quantum system undergoing noise is NP-hard. This contrasts with the classical analogue of this problem that can clearly be solved efficiently. We also establish the NP-hardness of deciding if the contraction coefficient is equal to 1, i.e., the channel can perfectly preserve a bit. As a consequence, deciding if a non-commutative graph has an independence number of at least 2 is NP-hard. In addition, we establish a converging hierarchy of semidefinite programming upper bounds on the contraction coefficient.

Title: Security loophole in error verification in quantum key distribution
Authors: Toyohiro Tsurumaru, Akihiro Mizutani, Toshihiko Sasaki
Abstract: The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is evaluated based on the secrecy of Alice's key and the correctness of the keys held by Alice and Bob. A practical method for ensuring correctness is known as error verification, in which Alice and Bob reveal a portion of their reconciled keys and check whether the revealed information matches. In this paper, we point out that when error verification is performed in a QKD protocol, the definition of secrecy must be revised accordingly. We illustrate the necessity of this revision with a counterexample, showing that neglecting it can lead to an incorrect security claim. In particular, we observe that in the case of security proof method based on phase error correction, which is one of the mainstream approaches and also known as Koashi's approach, no explicit method has been established to properly incorporate the revised secrecy definition. To resolve this issue, we present a way to translate the phase error correction-based approach into another mainstream approach, called the leftover hashing lemma-based approach, also known as Renner's approach, where a solution has already been formulated. As a consequence, security proofs under the phase error correction-based approach automatically remain valid without any change in the secret key length, even if they implicitly consider error verification without revising the secrecy definition.

Title: Corner functions from entanglement indices of harmonic lattices
Authors: Masafumi Shimojo, Satoshi Ishihara, Hironobu Kataoka, Atsuko Matsukawa
Abstract: We study the entanglement indices such as logarithmic negativities (LNs) and mutual informations (MIs) between two adjacent subsets in a isolated universal set $U$ of harmonic oscillators arranged on a two dimensional lattice within a sufficiently large square. First, we verify the values of the corner functions of angle $\pi/2, \pi/4, 3\pi/4$ presented in the previous study which adopts periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for the $U$. The values of each corner function obtained from LNs are nearly equal to those in the previous ones, while those of $3\pi/4$ from MIs are not sufficiently consistent with those computed from LNs. Next, for the case where the universal system $U$ satisfies the fixed end boundary conditions(FBCs), we calculate LNs, MIs at several locations in $U$, compare them, especially corner functions with the values obtained in the PBCs case, and examine the effect of the fixed ends. In addition, we examine Renyi entropies for sets of three dimensional lattice sites, the corner functions and the edge terms with solid angles and dihedral angles $\pi/2,\pi/4$, respectively.

Title: Quantification of Quantum Dynamical Properties with Two Experimental Settings
Authors: Tzu-Liang Hsu, Kuan-Jou Wang, Chun-Hao Chang, Sheng-Yan Sun, Shih-Husan Chen, Ching-Jui Huang, Che-Ming Li
Abstract: Characterizing quantum dynamics is essential for quantifying arbitrary properties of a quantum process -- such as its ability to exhibit quantum-mechanical dynamics or generate entanglement. However, current methods require a number of experimental settings that increases with system size, leading to artifacts from experimental errors. Here, we propose an approximate optimization method that estimates property measures using only two mutually unbiased bases to compute their lower and upper bounds, and to reconstruct the corresponding processes. This system-size independence prevents error accumulation and allows characterization of the intrinsic quantum dynamics. Compared with quantum process tomography, we experimentally validate our method on photonic fusion and controlled-NOT operations, demonstrating accurate resource estimation while substantially reducing the number of required Pauli experimental settings: from 81 to 10 for the photonic fusion and to 2 for the controlled-NOT. These results show that our method is well-suited for estimation of dynamical properties in architectures ranging from chip-scale quantum processors to long-distance quantum networks.

Title: Cutting stabiliser decompositions of magic state cultivation with ZX-calculus
Authors: Kwok Ho Wan, Zhenghao Zhong
Abstract: We apply the cutting stabiliser decomposition techniques [arXiv:2403.10964] to the quantum states generated from magic state cultivation [arXiv:2409.17595], post-selected upon all $+1$ measured values for simplicity. The resultant states to the $d=3$ and $d=5$ variant magic state cultivation circuits can be expressed as a sum of $4$ and $8$ Clifford ZX-digrams respectively. Modifications to existing ZX-calculus stabiliser decomposition methods may enable better simulation of non-Clifford circuits containing a moderate number of $T$ gates in the context of quantum error correction.

Title: Ancilla-Free Quantum Protocol for Thermal Green's Functions
Authors: Changhao Yi, Cunlu Zhou
Abstract: We introduce a simple and noise-resilient quantum algorithm for computing both zero- and finite-temperature Green's functions, requiring no ancillas and relying only on native time evolution and measurements readily available on current platforms. Assuming parity symmetry of the system, as in the Fermi-Hubbard and Heisenberg models, we construct symmetric and antisymmetric thermal states and employ a tailored quench spectroscopy scheme to recover the exact real and imaginary parts of two-point time correlators. Green's functions are then reconstructed through efficient signal analysis. The protocol is theoretically efficient, experimentally accessible, and directly applicable to both digital quantum computers and analog quantum simulators. Beyond Green's functions, the same framework extends naturally to out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC). This work highlights a practical path toward probing finite-temperature dynamics of strongly correlated quantum systems on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum hardware.

Title: Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions and Many-Body Backflow in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Kai Zhang, Chang Shu, Kai Sun
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions characterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its time-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this phenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include environmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects. However, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes and interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under full open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by incorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that DQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle loss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both processes coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we uncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain (loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time behavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These phenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large dynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from non-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are general and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical simulations.

Title: Measuring Multiparticle Indistinguishability with the Generalized Bunching Probability
Authors: Shawn Geller, Emanuel Knill
Abstract: The indistinguishability of many bosons undergoing passive linear transformations followed by number basis measurements is fully characterized by the visible state of the bosons. However, measuring all the parameters in the visible state is experimentally demanding. We argue that the generalized bunching probability--which is the probability that all the input bosons arrive in a given subset of the output modes--provides useful partial information about the indistinguishability of the input bosons, by establishing that it is monotonic with respect to certain partial orders of distinguishability of the bosons. As an intermediate result, we prove that Lieb's permanental-dominance conjecture for immanants is equivalent to the following statement: for states that are invariant under permutations of the occupied visible modes, the generalized bunching probability is maximized when the bosons are perfectly indistinguishable. As a corollary, we show that if Lieb's conjecture holds, then the generalized bunching probability is monotonic with respect to the refinement partial order on what we refer to as partially labelled states. We also prove, unconditionally, that for states such that the single-particle density matrix is the same for each particle, the Haar average of the generalized bunching probability is Schur convex with respect to the eigenvalues of said single-particle density matrix. As an application of the Schur convexity, we show that when the single-particle density matrix is a Gibbs state, the mean generalized bunching probability serves as a thermometer.

Title: Certified Pruning from Counterfactual Consistency: Exact Certificates and Structured SAT Families
Authors: Maximilian Ralph Peter von Liechtenstein
Abstract: We introduce a certified pruning framework that consolidates the principles of counterfactual consistency and their networked extensions into a single operational model, with consequences for both quantum foundations and cryptographic hardness. First, we formalize epsilon-counterfactual instrumentation and epsilon-stability, capturing noisy but testable constraints in laboratory contextuality experiments. Second, we extend these constraints to networks of contexts, yielding contextuality-type inequalities that apply globally across a CNF-SAT instance. Third, we implement a propagate-and-prune solver in which every learned clause is certified by a dual Farkas certificate verified in exact arithmetic. This guarantees soundness while enabling sub-exponential pruning: if the induced network provides a per-variable pruning rate rho in (0,1) under epsilon-stable propagation, the search runs in time (2-rho)^n. These bounds do not contradict ETH or SETH: the worst case remains exponential, but structured families admit provable speedups. In cryptography, the results highlight how such reductions could affect hardness margins in idealized primitives; in foundations, they motivate laboratory tests of counterfactual bounds as potential probes of computational complexity. We explicitly distinguish experimental epsilon, which quantifies laboratory visibility, from numerical epsilon, which is a solver tolerance. This builds directly on our earlier framework for epsilon-instrumentation, here integrated into certified pruning with dual certificates.

Title: How to simulate magic state cultivation with around $8$ Clifford terms on average
Authors: Kwok Ho Wan, Zhenghao Zhong
Abstract: Building upon [arXiv:2509.01224], we present a sketch on how to simulate the non-Clifford $d=5$ magic state cultivation circuits [arXiv:2409.17595] with a sum of $\approx 8$ Clifford ZX-diagrams on average, at $0.1\%$ noise. Compared to a magic cat state stabiliser decomposition of all $53$ non-Clifford spiders ($6{,}377{,}292$ terms required), this is more than $7 \times 10^{5}$ times reduction in the number of terms. Our stabiliser decomposition has the advantage of representing the final non-Clifford state (in light of circuit errors) as a sum of Clifford ZX-diagrams. This will be useful in simulating the escape stage of magic state cultivation, where one need to port the resultant state of cultivation into a larger Clifford circuit with many more qubits. Still, it's necessary to only track $\approx 8$ Clifford terms. Our result sheds light on the simulability of operationally relevant, high $T$-count quantum circuits with some internal structure.

Title: Readout of a solid state spin ensemble at the projection noise limit
Authors: Rouven Maier, Cheng-I Ho, Andrej Denisenko, Marina Davydova, Peter Knittel, Jörg Wrachtrup, Vadim Vorobyov
Abstract: Spin ensembles are central to quantum science, from frequency standards and fundamental physics searches to magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum sensing. Their performance is ultimately constrained by spin projection noise, yet solid-state implementations have so far been limited by much larger photon shot noise. Here we demonstrate a direct, quantum non-demolition readout of a mesoscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that surpasses the photon shot-noise limit and approaches the intrinsic spin projection noise. By stabilizing the $^{14}$N nuclear spin bath at high magnetic fields and employing repetitive nuclear-assisted spin readout, we achieve a noise reduction of 3.8 dB below the thermal projection noise level. This enables direct access to the intrinsic fluctuations of the spin ensemble, allowing us to directly observe the signatures of correlated spin states. Our results establish projection noise-limited readout as a practical tool for solid-state quantum sensors, opening pathways to quantum-enhanced metrology, direct detection of many-body correlations, and the implementation of spin squeezing in mesoscopic solid-state ensembles.

Title: Multi-block exceptional points in open quantum systems
Authors: Aysel Shiralieva, Grigory A. Starkov, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: Open quantum systems can be approximately described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) and Lindbladians. The two approaches differ by quantum jump terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs -- multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels that serve as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds.

Title: Entanglement and optimization within autoregressive neural quantum states
Authors: Andrew Jreissaty, Hang Zhang, Jairo C. Quijano, Juan Carrasquilla, Roeland Wiersema
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful variational ansätze capable of representing highly entangled quantum many-body wavefunctions. While the average entanglement properties of ensembles of restricted Boltzmann machines are well understood, the entanglement structure of autoregressive NQS such as recurrent neural networks and transformers remains largely unexplored. We perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square modulus normalization function that restores them. Finally, we connect the insights gained from our entanglement and activation function analysis to initialization strategies for finding the ground states of strongly correlated Hamiltonians via variational Monte Carlo.

Title: Rare Event Simulation of Quantum Error-Correcting Circuits
Authors: Carolyn Mayer, Anand Ganti, Uzoma Onunkwo, Tzvetan Metodi, Benjamin Anker, Jacek Skryzalin
Abstract: We describe a practical approach for accessing the logical failure rates of quantum error-correcting (QEC) circuits under low physical (component) failure rate regimes. Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying the failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant error-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical failure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access circuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more difficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components (gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the circuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6} regime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work by Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works studied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is insufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To the best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription of the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise model. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard Monte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime. This work shows that we can access noise in the circuit-model prescription of quantum error-correcting code to failure rates below 10^{-20} regime.

Title: Magnetic-Field and Temperature Limits of a Kinetic-Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier
Authors: Lucas M. Janssen, Farzad Faramarzi, Henry G. LeDuc, Sahil Patel, Gianluigi Catelani, Peter K. Day, Yoichi Ando, Christian Dickel
Abstract: Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.

Title: Molecular entanglement as a signature of the Unruh effect
Authors: Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu
Abstract: The Unruh effect predicts that a uniformly accelerated observer perceives the vacuum seen by an inertial observer as a thermal bath at a temperature proportional to its proper acceleration. This phenomenon is often regarded as a flat spacetime ``cousin" of Hawking radiation. In this Letter, we first study the entanglement dynamics of a quantum system composed of two polarizable two-level subsystems undergoing centripetal acceleration in a vacuum. We demonstrate that the system's steady state can be entangled irrespective of the initial state, a distinct characteristic attributable to the circular manifestation of the Unruh effect. Through meticulous analysis, we then propose that this phenomenon can feasibly be detected using state-of-the-art optomechanical technologies, particularly with a quantum system of two molecules.

Title: Information Fusion Using Transferable Belief Functions Implemented on Quantum Circuits
Authors: Qianli Zhou, Hao Luo, Lipeng Pan, Yong Deng, Eloi Bosse
Abstract: The transferable belief model, as a semantic interpretation of Dempster-Shafer theory, enables agents to perform reasoning and decision making in imprecise and incomplete environments. The model offers distinct semantics for handling unreliable testimonies, allowing for a more reasonable and general process of belief transfer compared to the Bayesian approach. However, because both the belief masses and the structure of focal sets must be considered when updating belief functions-leading to extra computational complexity during reasoning-the transferable belief model has gradually lost favor among researchers in recent developments. In this paper, we implement the transferable belief model on quantum circuits and demonstrate that belief functions offer a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing framework. Furthermore, leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel belief transfer approaches. More broadly, this paper introduces a new perspective on basic information representation for quantum AI models, suggesting that belief functions are more suitable than Bayesian approach for handling uncertainty on quantum circuits.

Title: Does connected wedge imply distillable entanglement?
Authors: Takato Mori, Beni Yoshida
Abstract: The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two boundary subsystems $A$ and $C$ can exhibit large mutual information $I(A:C)$ even when they are spatially disconnected on the boundary and separated by a buffer subsystem $B$, as long as $A$ and $C$ have connected entanglement wedge in the bulk. However, whether the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ contains distillable EPR pairs has remained a longstanding open problem. In this work, we resolve this problem by showing that: i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at leading order in $G_N$, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement in a holographic mixed state $\rho_{AC}$, and ii) one-shot, one-way LOCC-distillable entanglement is given at leading order by locally accessible information $J^W(A|C)$, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system $B$ via $J^W(A|C) = S_A - E^W(A:B)$. Namely, we demonstrate that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement in one-shot, one-way LOCC. We also show that entanglement of formation $E_{F}(A:C)$ is given by $E^W(A:C)$ at leading order in holography.

Title: Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for commuting long-range interactions
Authors: Marius Lemm, Tom Wessel
Abstract: Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In $D$ spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law $r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha > 2 D+1$ exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold $2D +1$ is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form $t \, r^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha>0$, and this scaling is sharp. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at $\alpha = 1$ in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.

Abstract: We describe how the annihilation of antiprotons can be utilized to generate highly charged isomeric ions in an ion-trap setup. We identify optical transitions in the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen-like atoms composed of an isomer and a single electron in the ground state. We identify promising candidates in the isomers of Y, Nb, Rh, In, and Sb, for which the hyperfine transition lies in the infrared and whose excited state level lifetime is in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is suitable for metrology applications.

Title: Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer
Authors: Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.

Title: Contrasting exchange-field and spin-transfer torque driving mechanisms in all-electric electron spin resonance
Authors: Jose Reina-Galvez, Matyas Nachtigall, Nicolas Lorente, Jan Martinek, Christoph Wolf
Abstract: Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.

Title: Strain effect on optical properties and quantum weight of monolayer MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S)
Authors: Nguyen Tuan Hung, Vuong Van Thanh, Mingda Li, Takahiro Shimada
Abstract: Manipulating the optical and quantum properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials through strain engineering is not only fundamentally interesting but also provides significant benefits across various applications. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of the monolayer MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.

Title: Search for Dark Photon Dark Matter with a Mass around $36.1\text{ }\mathrm{μeV}$ Using a Frequency-tunable Cavity Controlled through a Coupled Superconducting Qubit
Authors: K. Nakazono, S. Chen, H. Fukuda, Y. Iiyama, T. Inada, T. Moroi, T. Nitta, A. Noguchi, R. Sawada, S. Shirai, T. Sichanugrist, K. Terashi, K. Watanabe
Abstract: We report the results of a search for dark photon dark matter using a cavity that employs a transmon qubit as a frequency tuner. The tuning mechanism utilizes the energy level shift arising from the mode mixing between the qubit and the cavity mode. This method is advantageous in the absence of thermal noise and electromagnetic leakage. We searched for a dark matter signal in the mass range $36.079 \, \mathrm{\mu eV} - 36.176 \, \mathrm{\mu eV}$ and found no significant evidence. As a result, we set the exclusion limit on the kinetic mixing parameter down to approximately $10^{-12}$, surpassing the existing bound set by cosmology.

Title: Zitterbewegung, momentum and spin dynamics of electromagnetic waves in linear dielectric medium
Authors: Adam B. Cahaya
Abstract: The momentum of light in dielectric media has been a century-long controversy that continues to attract significant interest. In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n, the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Abraham, and larger by the same factor according to Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung-like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wavepacket motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.

Title: Parton Distributions on a Quantum Computer
Authors: Jiunn-Wei Chen, Yu-Ting Chen, Ghanashyam Meher
Abstract: We perform the first quantum computation of parton distribution function (PDF) with a real quantum device by calculating the PDF of the lightest positronium in the Schwinger model with IBM quantum computers. The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.

Title: Hyperfine van der Waals repulsion between open-shell polar molecules
Authors: Etienne F. Walraven, Tijs Karman
Abstract: We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.

Title: TASI/CERN/KITP Lecture Notes on "Toward Quantum Computing Gauge Theories of Nature"
Authors: Zohreh Davoudi
Abstract: A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics. These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.

Title: Invariant Random Subgroups, Soficity, and Lück's determinant conjecture
Authors: Aareyan Manzoor
Abstract: We extend Lück's determinant conjecture from groups to invariant random subgroups (IRS) of free groups, a framework generalizing groups where a non-sofic object is known to exist. For every free group, we prove the existence of an IRS satisfying the determinant conjecture that is not co-hyperlinear, and hence not co-sofic. This provides evidence that satisfying the determinant conjecture might be a weaker property than soficity for groups, and consequently the conjecture possibly holds for all groups. We use techniques from non-local games and $\mathsf{MIP}^* = \mathsf{RE}$, showing more generally when the latter can be used to narrow down when a von Neumann algebra (or IRS) contains a non-Connes embeddable object.

Title: Exact Solution for Two $δ$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $δ$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States
Authors: Maxim Olshanii, Mathias Albert, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Patrizia Vignolo, Steven G. Jackson
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.

Title: Extensive entanglement between coupled Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids in and out of equilibrium
Authors: Taufiq Murtadho, Marek Gluza, Nelly H. Y. Ng
Abstract: Quantum entanglement exists in nature but is absent in classical physics, hence it fundamentally distinguishes quantum from classical theories. While entanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly more challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we theoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In particular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate two experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite temperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically calculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below which the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is accessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the vicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with mutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by the coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain generalized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization. Moreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale extensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement between coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is largely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of entanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium regimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive entanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.

Title: An Orbit-qubit Quantum Processor of Ultracold Atoms
Authors: Ming-Gen He, Wei-Yong Zhang, Zhen-Sheng Yuan, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: It is challenging to build scalable quantum processors capable of both parallel control and local operation. As a promising platform to overcome this challenge, optical lattices offer exceptional parallelism. However, it has been struggling with precise local operations due to relatively narrow lattice spacings. Here, we introduce a new quantum processor incorporating orbit-qubit encoding and internal states (as auxiliary degrees of freedom) to achieve spatially selective operations together with parallel control. With this processor, we generate one-dimensional and two-dimensional cluster states using minimal layers of controlled-Z gates. We experimentally detect the multipartite entanglement of a two-dimensional cluster state involving 123 orbit qubits through direct stabilizer measurements, verifying the full bipartite non-separability. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-based quantum computation by implementing single-qubit and two-qubit logical gates, highlighting the flexibility of orbit-qubit operations. Our results establish orbit-qubit optical lattices as a scalable quantum processing architecture, opening new pathways for quantum computation applications.

Title: Classical and Quantum theory of magnonic and magnetoelastic nonlinear dynamics in continuum geometries
Authors: Marco Brühlmann, Yunyoung Hwang, Jorge Puebla, Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero
Abstract: We provide a theory of spin and acoustic wave coupled nonlinear dynamics in continuum systems. Combining the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations with the magnetoelastic Hamiltonian, we derive classical equations of motion for the magnetization and acoustic wave amplitudes, that include magnonic nonlinearity -- both three- and four-magnon processes -- as well as linear and nonlinear magnetoelastic interactions. We focus on two-dimensional magnetic films sustaining surface acoustic waves, a geometry where our model successfully reproduces our recent experimental observation of phonon-to-magnon down-conversion under acoustic drive. We provide analytical expressions for all the rates in our equations, which make them particularly suitable for quantization. We then quantize our model, deriving Heisenberg-Langevin equations of motion for magnon and phonon operators, and show how to compute quantum expectation values in the mean field approximation. Our work paves the way toward acoustic control of magnons in the quantum regime.
