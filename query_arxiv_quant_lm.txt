Title: The Cost of Nonlocality: A Dynamical Performance Equation of Energy-Entanglement-Complexity
Authors: HongZheng Liu, YiNuo Tian, Zhiyue Wu
Abstract: This work aims to quantify the physical cost of generating non-local entanglement in systems governed by local interactions. By unifying the quantum speed limit and Lieb-Robinson bounds, we establish an "energy-entanglement performance equation." This framework connects theoretical computational complexity with experimental observables by introducing a measurable proxy for complexity, thereby revealing a performance trade-off among the "energy variance-entanglement product," the strength of local interactions, and dynamical efficiency. Our work not only defines a "performance frontier"-constrained by theoretical bounds and amenable to experimental benchmarking-but also provides a novel diagnostic tool for identifying the performance bottlenecks of a process.

Title: Do GNN-based QEC Decoders Require Classical Knowledge? Evaluating the Efficacy of Knowledge Distillation from MWPM
Authors: Ryota Ikeda
Abstract: The performance of decoders in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to realizing practical quantum computers. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies are not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring theoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can effectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first is a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels, while the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the theoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from Google, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the knowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training loss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of approximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess a high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from real hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models.

Title: Probing and Enhancing the Robustness of GNN-based QEC Decoders with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ryota Ikeda
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: Fault-tolerant Fusion-based Quantum Computing with the Four-legged Cat Code
Authors: Harshvardhan K. Babla, James D. Teoh, Jahan Claes, Daniel K. Weiss, Shraddha Singh, Robert J. Schoelkopf, Shruti Puri
Abstract: The four-legged cat code is a quantum error-correcting code designed to address the predominant error in bosonic modes: single-photon loss. It was the first such code to surpass the break-even point, thereby demonstrating the practical utility of quantum error correction. In this work, we propose a planar fault-tolerant architecture for this code by concatenating it with the XZZX code via fusion-based error-correction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 2D nearest-neighbor architecture for fault-tolerant fusion-based error-correction. We demonstrate how all the required operations, namely resource state preparation and Bell measurements, can be carried out using standard circuit-QED techniques, such as intercavity beam-splitter coupling, cavity displacements, cavity-transmon dispersive coupling, and transmon drives. We show analytically and numerically that all dominant hardware errors in the bosonic modes and control ancillae are corrected, to first-order, at the hardware level. Consequently, the outer XZZX code only needs to address smaller residual errors, which are quadratically suppressed, effectively doubling the architecture's fault-distance. Moreover, the performance of our architecture is not limited by unwanted nonlinearities such as cavity self-Kerr, and it avoids demanding coupling techniques like $\chi$-matching or high-order coupling. Overall, our architecture substantially reduces the hardware complexity needed to achieve fault tolerance with the four-legged cat code.

Title: QPing: a Quantum Ping Primitive for Quantum Networks
Authors: Jorge Miguel-Ramiro, Jessica Illiano, Francesco Mazza, Alexander Pirker, Julia Freund, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti, Marcello Caleffi, Wolfgang Dür
Abstract: We introduce the concept of Quantum Ping (QPing) as a diagnostic primitive for future quantum networks, designed to assess whether two or more end nodes can establish practical quantum entanglement with efficient resource consumption, limited overhead, and time-adaptive fidelity thresholds. Unlike classical ping, which probes network-layer connectivity through ICMP messages, our proposed quantum version is adapted to the unique features of quantum networks, where connectivity depends on the availability and quality of shared entanglement. We develop a formal framework for QPing and leverage different tools such as sequential hypothesis testing to probe quantum connectivity. We present several strategies, including active strategies, with path-based and segment-based variants, and passive strategies that utilize pre-shared entangled resources. QPing can serve as a flexible diagnostic building block for quantum networks, designed to work alongside fundamental network operations, while remaining suitable to different architectural and protocol design approaches.

Title: One-dimensional quantum droplets under linear gravitational-like trap
Authors: Saurab Das, Jayanta Bera, Ajay Nath
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a constant and time-dependent linear gravitational-like potential on one-dimensional quantum droplets (QDs), governed by an extended GPE incorporating a repulsive cubic effective mean-field (EMF) term and an attractive quadratic beyond-mean-field (BMF) correction. Within a tailored external confinement, we analytically characterize the QDs wavefunction and derive the effective interaction contributions. Analogous to classical Newtonian dynamics, the falling velocity of the droplet within a finite domain is found to depend solely on the strength of the linear gravitational like potential, remaining independent of both the total atom number and the magnitude of EMF nonlinearity. When the linear potential is temporally modulated, deviations in the trajectory of the droplet emerge relative to the static case, indicating potential applicability in precision gravimetry. To further probe the dynamical coherence properties, we compute the Shannon entropy and the Wigner quasi-probability distribution. Both measures reveal distinct signatures of the constant and time varying linear potential, with the modulation strength directly influencing the phase-space localization and coherence structure of the droplet. Numerical simulations substantiate the stability of the analytical solutions, demonstrating their robustness. These findings suggest promising implications for quantum sensing and metrological applications using ultradilute quantum fluids.

Title: The Covariant Relativistic Derivation of De Broglie Relation
Authors: Samuel Bueno Soltau
Abstract: This paper provides an examination of the de Broglie relation, tracing its historical development from the quantum hypotheses proposed by Planck and Einstein to its covariant relativistic derivation. The discussion begins by situating de Broglie's seminal insight within the early framework of quantum theory. We then reconstruct his original heuristic derivation. The primary focus of this work, however, is the derivation of the de Broglie relation directly from the principles of special relativity, employing the four-momentum formalism. A comparative analysis between the heuristic and relativistic approaches underscores the universality and conceptual coherence of the latter. The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of relativistic mechanics in establishing a consistent foundation for wave-particle duality, further reinforcing this through a quantum field theoretical perspective.

Title: Moveless: Minimizing Overhead on QCCDs via Versatile Execution and Low Excess Shuttling
Authors: Sahil Khan, Suhas Vittal, Kenneth Brown, Jonathan Baker
Abstract: One of the most promising paths towards large scale fault tolerant quantum computation is the use of quantum error correcting stabilizer codes. Just like every other quantum circuit, these codes must be compiled to hardware in a way to minimize the total physical error introduced into the system, for example either due to high latency execution or excessive gates to meet connectivity limitations of the target hardware. However, unlike arbitrary quantum circuits, all syndrome extraction circuits have several common properties, for example they have a bipartite connectivity graph, consist only of commuting subcircuits, among other properties. For the most part, compilation methods have aimed at being generic, able to map any input circuit into executables on the hardware, and therefore cannot appropriately exploit these properties and result in executables which have higher physical error. In the case of modular trapped ion systems, specifically QCCDs, this corresponds to the insertion of excessive shuttling operations necessary to realize arbitrary qubit interactions. We propose a compilation scheme explicitly tailored for the structural regularity of QEC circuits based on several key observations: 1. only ancilla or data (but not both) should be shuttled, 2. stabilizers can be executed in any order meaning we can dynamically modify circuit execution on a per-cycle basis 3. ancilla are indistinguishable meaning any can be selected to begin a stabilizer measurement and retain a fixed-point mapping between cycles, and 4. QCCD hardware limits the number of parallel operations equal to the number traps in the system, meaning fewer ancilla are necessary and can be reused. Our resulting compiler, leads to QEC circuits which are on average 3.38x faster to execute, and lead to up to two orders of magnitude of improvement in logical error rates with realistic physical error rates.

Title: Quantum chemistry for solids made simple with the Clifford formalism
Authors: Amer Alrakik, Gian Luigi Bendazzoli, Stefano Evangelisti, J. Arjan Berger
Abstract: We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.

Title: Calculating Vibronic Spectra with a linear algorithm based on Gaussian Boson Sampling
Authors: I. Konyshev (1), R. Pradip (1), O. Page (1), C. Ünlüer (1), R. T. Nasibullin (2), V. V. Rybkin (3), W. Pernice (1), S. Ferrari (1) ((1) University of Heidelberg, Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics, (2) University of Helsinki, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, (3) HQS Quantum Simulations GmbH)
Abstract: Accurately simulating molecular vibronic spectra remains computationally challenging due to the exponential scaling of required calculations. Here, we show that employing the linear coupling model within the gaussian boson sampling framework effectively addresses this limitation. We implement the algorithm for simulating the pentacene molecule through three distinct approaches, using numerical simulation on a classical computer and experimentally using two optical setups equipped with different photon detectors (SNSPD and SPAD). High fidelity $(F>0.999)$ was achieved between the simulated Franck-Condon profiles and analytically calculated profiles obtained by enumerating all possible transitions within the linear coupling model. Furthermore, simulations were performed for larger molecular systems using 48 vibrational modes of naphthalene and 64 vibrational modes of anthracene. Comparison with experimental data confirms that the simulated spectra accurately reproduce both the positions and shapes of the measured spectral bands. A notable advantage of our algorithm is its scalability, requiring only a fixed minimal set of optical components irrespective of the size of the studied system.

Title: Nonreciprocity in Quantum Technology
Authors: Shabir Barzanjeh, André Xuereb, Andrea Alù, Sander A. Mann, Nikita Nefedkin, Vittorio Peano, Peter Rabl
Abstract: Nonreciprocity-the ability to transmit signals in one direction while blocking them in the reverse-has become a powerful resource in quantum technologies, enabling directional amplification, routing of quantum information, and topologically protected quantum states. Recent experimental advances have demonstrated nonreciprocal behavior in low-loss, fully integrated devices operating with weak or no magnetic bias, enabled by synthetic gauge fields, optomechanical interactions, and chiral light-matter coupling. These achievements overcome the limitations of more traditional approaches, making nonreciprocity compatible with superconducting circuits and scalable quantum photonic architectures as well as an integral part of the next generation of modular quantum computers, distributed quantum networks, and precision metrology. Here we highlight the key concepts for engineering nonreciprocity in quantum systems and describe how this functionality can be employed for high-fidelity qubit readout, robust quantum state transfer, and boosting the sensitivity of quantum sensors.

Title: Charge sensitivity in the transmon regime
Authors: Rocio Gonzalez-Meza, Vito Iaia, Anika Zaman, Hiu-Yung Wong, Yujin Cho, Kristin Beck, Yaniv J. Rosen
Abstract: Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.

Title: Graphical Calculus for Fermionic Tensors
Authors: Yuanjie Ren, Kaifeng Bu, Andreas Bauer
Abstract: We introduce a graphical calculus, consisting of a set of fermionic tensors with tensor-network equations, which can be used to perform various computations in fermionic many-body physics purely diagrammatically. The indices of our tensors primarily correspond to fermionic modes, but also include qubits and fixed odd-parity states. Our graphical calculus extends the ZX calculus for systems involving qubits. We apply the calculus in order to represent various objects, operations, and computations in physics, including fermionic Gaussian states, the partial trace of Majorana modes, purification protocols, fermionization and bosonization maps, and the construction of fermionic codes.

Title: A simpler Gaussian state-preparation
Authors: Parker Kuklinski, Benjamin Rempfer, Kevin Obenland, Justin Elenewski
Abstract: The ability to efficiently state-prepare Gaussian distributions is critical to the success of numerous quantum algorithms. The most popular algorithm for this subroutine (Kitaev-Webb) has favorable polynomial resource scaling, however it faces enormous resource overheads making it functionally impractical. In this paper, we present a new, more intuitive method which uses exactly $n-1$ rotations, $(n-1)(n-2)/2$ two-qubit controlled rotations, and $\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor$ ancilla to state-prepare an $n$-qubit Gaussian state. We then apply optimizations to the circuit to render it linear in T-depth. This method can be extended to state-preparations of complex functions with polynomial phase.

Title: Thermalization with partial information
Authors: Philippe Faist, Sumeet Khatri
Abstract: A many-body system, whether in contact with a large environment or evolving under complex dynamics, can typically be modeled as occupying the thermal state singled out by Jaynes' maximum entropy principle. Here, we find analogous fundamental principles identifying a noisy quantum channel $\mathcal{T}$ to model the system's dynamics, going beyond the study of its final equilibrium state. Our maximum channel entropy principle states that $\mathcal{T}$ should maximize the channel's entropy, suitably defined, subject to any available macroscopic constraints. These may correlate input and outputs, and may lead to restricted or partial thermalizing dynamics including thermalization with average energy conservation. This principle is reinforced by an independent extension of the microcanonical derivation of the thermal state to channels, which leads to the same $\mathcal{T}$. Our technical contributions include a derivation of the general mathematical structure of $\mathcal{T}$, a custom postselection theorem relating an arbitrary permutation-invariant channel to nearby i.i.d. channels, as well as novel typicality results for quantum channels for noncommuting constraints and arbitrary input states. We propose a learning algorithm for quantum channels based on the maximum channel entropy principle, demonstrating the broader relevance of $\mathcal{T}$ beyond thermodynamics and complex many-body systems.

Title: Maximum channel entropy principle and microcanonical channels
Authors: Philippe Faist, Sumeet Khatri
Abstract: The thermal state plays a number of significant roles throughout physics, information theory, quantum computing, and machine learning. It arises from Jaynes' maximum-entropy principle as the maximally entropic state subject to linear constraints, and is also the reduced state of the microcanonical state on the system and a large environment. We formulate a maximum-channel-entropy principle, defining a thermal channel as one that maximizes a channel entropy measure subject to linear constraints on the channel. We prove that thermal channels exhibit an exponential form reminiscent of thermal states. We study examples including thermalizing channels that conserve a state's average energy, as well as Pauli-covariant and classical channels. We propose a quantum channel learning algorithm based on maximum channel entropy methods that mirrors a similar learning algorithm for quantum states. We then demonstrate the thermodynamic relevance of the maximum-channel-entropy channel by proving that it resembles the action on a single system of a microcanonical channel acting on many copies of the system. Here, the microcanonical channel is defined by requiring that the linear constraints obey sharp statistics for any i.i.d. input state, including for noncommuting constraint operators. Our techniques involve convex optimization methods to optimize recently introduced channel entropy measures, typicality techniques involving noncommuting operators, a custom channel postselection technique, as well as Schur-Weyl duality. As a result of potential independent interest, we prove a constrained postselection theorem for quantum channels. The widespread relevance of the thermal state throughout physics, information theory, machine learning, and quantum computing, inspires promising applications for the analogous concept for quantum channels.

Title: Graph theory-based automated quantum algorithm for efficient querying of acyclic and multiloop causal configurations
Authors: Salvador A. Ochoa-Oregon, Juan P. Uribe-Ramírez, Roger J. Hernández-Pinto, Selomit Ramírez-Uribe, Germán Rodrigo
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a promising framework in high-energy physics, in particular, for unraveling the causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams by identifying Feynman propagators with qubits, a challenge analogous to querying directed acyclic graphs in graph theory. In this paper, we present the Minimum Clique-optimised quantum Algorithm (MCA), an automated quantum algorithm designed to efficiently query the causal structures within the Loop-Tree Duality. The MCA quantum algorithm is optimised by exploiting graph theory techniques, specifically, by analogy with the Minimum Clique Partition problem. The evaluation of the MCA quantum algorithm is exhibited by analysing the transpiled quantum circuit depth and quantum circuit area.

Title: Generalized Quantum Hadamard Test for Machine Learning
Authors: Vivek Mehta, Arghya Choudhury, Utpal Roy
Abstract: Quantum machine learning models are designed for performing learning tasks. Some quantum classifier models are proposed to assign classes of inputs based on fidelity measurements. Quantum Hadamard test is a well-known quantum algorithm for computing these fidelities. However, the basic requirement for deploying the quantum Hadamard test maps input space to L2-normalize vector space. Consequently, computed fidelities correspond to cosine similarities in mapped input space. We propose a quantum Hadamard test with the additional capability to compute the inner product in bounded input space, which refers to the Generalized Quantum Hadamard test. It incorporates not only L2-normalization of input space but also other standardization methods, such as Min-max normalization. This capability is raised due to different quantum feature mapping and unitary evolution of the mapped quantum state. We discuss the quantum circuital implementation of our algorithm and establish this circuit design through numerical simulation. Our circuital architecture is efficient in terms of computational complexities. We show the application of our algorithm by integrating it with two classical machine learning models: Logistic regression binary classifier and Centroid-based binary classifier and solve four classification problems over two public-benchmark datasets and two artificial datasets.

Title: A Lazy Resynthesis Approach for Simultaneous T Gate and Two-Qubit Gate Optimization of Quantum Circuits
Authors: Mu-Te Lau, Hsiang-Chun Yang, Hsin-Yu Chen, Chung-Yang (Ric)Huang
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimization (QCO) algorithms for T-count reduction often lead to a substantial increase in two-qubit gate count (2Q-count) -- a drawback that existing 2Q-count optimization techniques struggle to address effectively. In this work, we propose a novel lazy resynthesis approach for modern tableau-based QCO flows that significantly mitigates the 2Q-gate surges commonly introduced during T-count optimization in Clifford+T circuits. Experimental results show that our approach reduces 2Q-count overhead by 54.8%, 15.3%, and 68.0% compared to tableau-based, ZX-calculus-based, and path-sum-based QCO algorithms, respectively. In terms of runtime, our method achieves speedups of 1.81$\times$ and 13.1$\times$ over the tableau-based and ZX-calculus-based methods, while performing comparably to the path-sum-based approach. In summary, the proposed lazy resynthesis technique not only enhances the quality and performance of tableau-based QCO algorithms but also demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability compared to alternative QCO approaches such as ZX-calculus and path-sum-based techniques.

Title: Trapping an Atomic Ion without Dedicated Digital-to-analog Converters
Authors: Ryutaro Ohira, Masanari Miyamoto, Shinichi Morisaka, Ippei Nakamura, Atsushi Noguchi, Utako Tanaka, Takefumi Miyoshi
Abstract: Independent control of numerous electrodes in quantum charge-coupled device architectures presents a significant challenge for wiring and hardware scalability. To address this issue, we demonstrate a voltage control method based on time-division multiplexing (TDM). This approach utilizes a single high-update-rate digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to sequentially generate control signals for multiple electrodes, thereby reducing both the number of required DACs and associated wiring. We experimentally validate this concept by developing a 10-channel system that operates with only two DACs. The developed TDM-based voltage control system is applied to a surface-electrode trap, where we successfully trap a single $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion. This approach offers a resource-efficient and scalable solution for advanced quantum computing systems based on trapped ions.

Title: Hybrid Quantum--Classical Machine Learning Potential with Variational Quantum Circuits
Authors: Soohaeng Yoo Willow, D. ChangMo Yang, Chang Woo Myung
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative, suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials modeling.

Title: Advantages of Co-locating Quantum-HPC Platforms: A Survey for Near-Future Industrial Applications
Authors: Daigo Honda, Yuta Nishiyama, Junya Ishikawa, Kenichi Matsuzaki, Satoshi Miyata, Tadahiro Chujo, Yasuhisa Yamamoto, Masahiko Kiminami, Taro Kato, Jun Towada, Naoki Yoshioka, Naoto Aoki, Nobuyasu Ito
Abstract: We conducted a systematic survey of emerging quantum-HPC platforms, which integrate quantum computers and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems through co-location. Currently, it remains unclear whether such platforms provide tangible benefits for near-future industrial applications. To address this, we examined the impact of co-location on latency reduction, bandwidth enhancement, and advanced job scheduling. Additionally, we assessed how HPC-level capabilities could enhance hybrid algorithm performance, support large-scale error mitigation, and facilitate complex quantum circuit partitioning and optimization. Our findings demonstrate that co-locating quantum and HPC systems can yield measurable improvements in overall hybrid job throughput. We also observe that large-scale real-world problems can require HPC-level computational resources for executing hybrid algorithms.

Title: Dynamic Solutions for Hybrid Quantum-HPC Resource Allocation

Peña, Petter Sandås, Alberto Scionti, Olivier Terzo, Chiara Vercellino, Giacomo Vitali, Paolo Viviani, Jonathan Frassineti, Sara Marzella, Daniele Ottaviani, Iacopo Colonnelli, Daniele Gregori
Abstract: The integration of quantum computers within classical High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures is receiving increasing attention, with the former expected to serve as accelerators for specific computational tasks. However, combining HPC and quantum computers presents significant technical challenges, including resource allocation. This paper presents a novel malleability-based approach, alongside a workflow-based strategy, to optimize resource utilization in hybrid HPC-quantum workloads. With both these approaches, we can release classical resources when computations are offloaded to the quantum computer and reallocate them once quantum processing is complete. Our experiments with a hybrid HPC-quantum use case show the benefits of dynamic allocation, highlighting the potential of those solutions.

Title: Challenges in Applying Variational Quantum Algorithms to Dynamic Satellite Network Routing
Authors: Phuc Hao Do, Tran Duc Le
Abstract: Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic 8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.

Title: The decohered ZX-calculus
Authors: Titouan Carette, Daniela Cojocaru, Renaud Vilmart
Abstract: The discard ZX-calculus is known to be complete and universal for mixed-state quantum mechanics, allowing for both quantum and classical processes. However, if the quantum aspects of ZX-calculus have been explored in depth, little work has been done on the classical side. In this paper, we investigate a fragment of discard ZX-calculus obtained by decohering the usual generators of ZX-calculus. We show that this calculus is universal and complete for affinely supported probability distributions over $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$. To do so, we exhibit a normal form, mixing ideas from the graphical linear algebra program and diagrammatic Fourier transforms. Our results both clarify how to handle hybrid classical-quantum processes in the discard ZX-calculus and pave the way to the picturing of more general random variables and probabilistic processes.

Title: Coupling phase enabled level transitions in pseudo-Hermitian magnon-polariton systems
Authors: Huang Xin, Liu Jingyu, Lin Shirong
Abstract: While cavity-magnon hybridization offers intriguing physics, its practical implementation is hindered by intrinsic damping in both cavity and magnon modes, leading to short coherence times and constrained applications. Recently, with the emergence of tunable external gain at the macroscopic scale, the research focus has shifted from purely lossy systems to gain-loss balanced non-Hermitian systems. Here, we propose a pseudo-Hermitian model with two magnon and two cavity modes coupled via phase-dependent interaction. We link the energy spectrum to phase transitions, observing exceptional points when pseudo-Hermitian symmetry breaks. We also observed level attraction and level repulsion. The former corresponds to four phase transitions and manifests as a double Z-shaped energy spectrum, the latter corresponds to two phase transitions, with the repulsive gap depending on the coupling phase. In the phase diagram defined by non-Hermiticity and coupling phase, we reveal a distinctive correspondence: pseudo-Hermitian symmetry breaking is intrinsically linked to coupling mode transitions, enabling new strategies for controlling hybrid quantum states in spintronic systems.

Title: Quantum Advantage in Identifying the Parity of Permutations with Certainty
Authors: Arnau Diebra, Santiago Llorens, David González-Lociga, Albert Rico, John Calsamiglia, Mark Hillery, Emili Bagan
Abstract: We establish a sharp quantum advantage in determining the parity (even/odd) of an unknown permutation applied to any number $n \ge 3$ of particles. Classically, this is impossible with fewer than~$n$ labels, being the success limited to random guessing. Quantum mechanics does it with certainty with as few as $\lceil \sqrt{n}\, \rceil$ distinguishable states per particle, thanks to entanglement. Below this threshold, not even quantum mechanics helps: both classical and quantum success are limited to random guessing. For small $n$, we provide explicit expressions for states that ensure perfect parity identification. We also assess the minimum entanglement these states need to carry, finding it to be close to maximal, and even maximal in some cases. The task requires no oracles or contrived setups and provides a simple, rigorous example of genuine quantum advantage.

Title: Hydrodynamic Effects in Cryogenic Buffer Gas Cells: Design Insights from Hybrid Simulations
Authors: Nick Vogeley, Bernd Bauerhenne, Daqing Wang
Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas beam sources have become an essential tool for experiments requiring cold molecular beams with low forward velocities. Although recent experimental advances have led to significant progress in source optimization, numerical studies remain limited due to the challenges posed by the large parameter ranges required to describe both the dense buffer gas and the dilute seed molecules. In this work, we report a numerical evaluation of cryogenic buffer gas beam cells operating in the hydrodynamic extraction regime. While most prior studies focused on box-like or cylindrical cells, we investigated hydrodynamic effects including vortex formation in a spherical cell and assessed whether these could be utilized to enhance the performance in molecule cooling and extraction. To achieve this, we performed steady-state slip-flow simulations for helium buffer gas and employed a direct-simulation Monte Carlo diffusion routine to track particle trajectories. We compared the performance of the source across different buffer gas throughputs and injection angles and identified parameter regimes where vortex formation enhances molecule extraction. From the simulations, we extracted experimental observables, which allow these effects to be verified through velocity or time-of-flight measurements on the molecular beam.

Title: Universal Configuration for Optimizing Complexity in Variational Distributed Quantum Circuits
Authors: J. Montes, F. Borondo, Gabriel G. Carlo
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing represents at present one of the most promising approaches to scaling quantum processors. Current implementations typically partition circuits into multiple cores, each composed of several qubits, with inter-core connectivity playing a central role in ensuring scalability. Identifying the optimal configuration -- defined as the arrangement that maximizes circuit complexity with minimal depth -- thus constitutes a fundamental design challenge. In this work, we demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, the existence of a universal optimal configuration for distributing single and two qubit gates across arbitrary intercore communication topologies in variational distributed circuits. Our proof is based on a complexity measure based on Markov matrices, which quantifies the convergence rate toward the Haar measure, as introduced by Weinstein et al. Finally, we validate our predictions through numerical comparisons with the well established majorization criterion proposed in Ref 2.

Title: Simulation and Benchmarking of Real Quantum Hardware
Authors: T. Piskor, M. Schöndorf, M. Bauer, D. Smith, T. Ayral, S. Pogorzalek, A. Auer, M. Papič
Abstract: The effects of noise are one of the most important factors to consider when it comes to quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing (NISQ) era that we are currently in. Therefore, it is important not only to gain more knowledge about the noise sources appearing in current quantum computing hardware in order to suppress and mitigate their contributions, but also to evaluate whether a given quantum algorithm can achieve reasonable results on a given hardware. To accomplish this, we need noise models that can describe the real hardware with sufficient accuracy. Here, we present a noise model that has been evaluated on superconducting hardware platforms and could be adapted to other common architectures such as trapped-ion or neutral atom devices. We then benchmark our model by simulating a 20-qubit superconducting quantum computer, and compare the accuracy of our model to similar approaches from the literature and demonstrate an improvement in the overall prediction accuracy.

Title: Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order
Authors: Yanming Che, Clemens Gneiting, Xiaoguang Wang, Franco Nori
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and machine learning of topological quantum order.

Title: Benchmarking Quantum and Classical Sequential Models for Urban Telecommunication Forecasting
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Yun-Cheng Tsai
Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM (QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.

Title: Efficient classical computation of the neural tangent kernel of quantum neural networks
Authors: Anderson Melchor Hernandez, Davide Pastorello, Giacomo De Palma
Abstract: We propose an efficient classical algorithm to estimate the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with a broad class of quantum neural networks. These networks consist of arbitrary unitary operators belonging to the Clifford group interleaved with parametric gates given by the time evolution generated by an arbitrary Hamiltonian belonging to the Pauli group. The proposed algorithm leverages a key insight: the average over the distribution of initialization parameters in the NTK definition can be exactly replaced by an average over just four discrete values, chosen such that the corresponding parametric gates are Clifford operations. This reduction enables an efficient classical simulation of the circuit. Combined with recent results establishing the equivalence between wide quantum neural networks and Gaussian processes [Girardi \emph{et al.}, Comm. Math. Phys. 406, 92 (2025); Melchor Hernandez \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2412.03182], our method enables efficient computation of the expected output of wide, trained quantum neural networks, and therefore shows that such networks cannot achieve quantum advantage.

Title: Efficient detection of spectrally multimode squeezed light through optical parametric amplification
Authors: Mahmoud Kalash, Ui-Nyung Han, Young-Sik Ra, Maria V. Chekhova
Abstract: Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional photonic quantum technologies, enabling applications in quantum-enhanced sensing, quantum communication, and quantum computing. Efficient detection of such a multimode squeezed state is essential for unlocking its full potential. Optical parametric amplification (OPA) has recently gained attention as a powerful technique offering loss-tolerant, direct broadband detection, and multimode operation. While OPA has been used to characterize spatially multimode squeezing, its application to spectrally multimode squeezing has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report on the first experimental demonstration of spectrally multimode squeezing detection using OPA. We achieve simultaneous detection of squeezing across more than 60 spectral modes of a broadband squeezed vacuum state. The observed squeezing is nearly uniform, ranging from -6.5 to -7 dB, which makes the source particularly suitable for constructing continuous-variable cluster states, and indicates the multimode capability of the OPA. The results extend the capabilities of OPA detection into the spectral domain, advancing spectral-mode-based high-dimensional photonic quantum technologies.

Title: Entanglement distribution in quantum networks via swapping of partially entangled states
Authors: Henrique Guerra, Tailan S. Sarubi, Rafael Chaves, Jonas Maziero
Abstract: The entanglement swapping protocol (ESP) is a fundamental primitive for distributing quantum correlations across distant nodes in a quantum network. Recent studies have demonstrated that even when the involved qubit pairs are only partially entangled, it is still possible to concentrate and transmit entanglement via Bell-basis measurements. In this work, we extend these ideas to quantum networks with various topologies - including linear, star, and hybrid configurations - by analyzing the application of the ESP to initially partially entangled states. We investigate how entanglement evolves under such protocols by examining the transformations of the initial states and evaluating the success probabilities for generating maximally entangled states at the output. Our results offer new insights into the dynamics of the entanglement distribution in quantum networks and provide practical guidelines for designing robust quantum communication strategies under realistic conditions.

Title: Spectro-temporally tailored Non-Gaussian Quantum Operations in Thin-Film Waveguides
Authors: Peter Namdar, Patrick Folge, Carlos E. Lopetegui, Silia Babel, Benjamin Brecht, Christine Silberhorn, Valentina Parigi
Abstract: Advancements in photonic platforms have enabled the precise control of light's spectral and temporal degrees of freedom, a capability crucial for the development of scalable quantum information systems. In this work, we address the challenge of implementing spectro-temporal mode-selective non-Gaussian quantum operations, specifically single-photon subtraction (SPS) and addition (SPA), in the telecom wavelength regime. Building on prior experimental demonstrations of mode-selective near-infrared SPS, we present the first design framework for achieving mode-selective SPA and SPS using thin-film lithium niobate nonlinear waveguide platforms. We introduce an inverse-design optimization scheme by modeling the quantum-optical response via the Joint Spectral Amplitude and Transfer Function, in order to identify optimal waveguide and pump parameters that maximize mode selectivity and state purity. This approach is first tested on a metallic waveguide design. We then exploit the dispersion engineering capabilities of thin-film waveguides, which offer enhanced nonlinear interactions through tighter light confinement. Our findings demonstrate that tailored nonlinear processes, particularly parametric down-conversion and frequency up-conversion, can support high-fidelity non-Gaussian operations essential for next-generation quantum photonic networks.

Title: Optimizing quantum transport via the quantum Doob transform
Authors: Dolores Esteve, Carlos Pérez-Espigares, Ricardo Gutiérrez, Daniel Manzano
Abstract: Quantum transport plays a central role in both fundamental physics and the development of quantum technologies. While significant progress has been made in understanding transport phenomena in quantum systems, methods for optimizing transport properties remain limited, particularly in complex quantum networks. Building on recent advances in classical network optimization via the generalized Doob transform, we introduce a novel method that extends this approach to quantum networks. Our framework leverages a single diagonalization of the system generator to efficiently tailor both the Hamiltonian and dissipative contributions, optimizing transport observables such as currents and activities. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through extensive numerical explorations, showing that optimal performance arises from non-trivial modifications to both coherent and incoherent dynamics. We also assess the robustness of the optimization under constraints that preserve specific physical features, such as fixed dissipative structures and input-output interactions. Finally, we discuss the connection between optimized transport and centrosymmetry, highlighting the relevance of this property for enhanced transport efficiency in quantum systems.

Title: Experimental device-independent certification of indefinite causal order
Authors: Dengke Qu, Quan Lin, Lei Xiao, Xiang Zhan, Peng Xue
Abstract: Understanding the physical world fundamentally relies on the assumption that events are temporally ordered, with past events serving as causes for future ones. However, quantum mechanics permits events to occur in a superposition of causal orders, providing new types of quantum resources for quantum information tasks. Previous demonstrations of indefinite causal order have relied on a process known as quantum switch and depended on specific assumptions about the devices used in the laboratory. Recently, a theoretical scheme for the certification of indefinite causal order in the quantum switch has been obtained solely from the output statistics of the devices, analogous to the device-independent proofs of nonlocality through violations of the Bell inequality. Here, we report an experimental verification of the causal inequality using spacelike-separated entangled photons, where one photon functions as the control qubit in a quantum switch and the other serves as an additional observer. Through local measurement statistics, we observe a violation of the causal inequality by 24 standard deviations. This work provides evidence for a device-independent certification of indefinite causal order, relying solely on observed correlations without requiring device characterization. Our results pave the way toward a complete understanding of indefinite causal order and its potential applications in quantum information processing.

Title: Cybersecurity of Quantum Key Distribution Implementations
Authors: Ittay Alfassi, Ran Gelles, Rotem Liss, Tal Mor
Abstract: Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) often deviate from the theoretical protocols, exposing the implementations to various attacks even when the underlying (ideal) protocol is proven secure. We present new analysis tools and methodologies for quantum cybersecurity, adapting the concepts of vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and exploits from classical cybersecurity to QKD implementation attacks. We present three additional concepts, derived from the connection between classical and quantum cybersecurity: "Quantum Fuzzing", which is the first tool for black-box vulnerability research on QKD implementations; "Reversed-Space Attacks", which are a generic exploit method using the attack surface of imperfect receivers; and a concrete quantum-mechanical definition of "Quantum Side-Channel Attacks", meaningfully distinguishing them from other types of attacks. Using our tools, we analyze multiple existing QKD attacks and show that the "Bright Illumination" attack could have been fully constructed even with minimal knowledge of the device implementation. This work begins to bridge the gap between current analysis methods for experimental attacks on QKD implementations and the decades-long research in the field of classical cybersecurity, improving the practical security of QKD products and enhancing their usefulness in real-world systems.

Title: A probabilistic quantum algorithm for Lyapunov equations and matrix inversion
Authors: Marcello Benedetti, Ansis Rosmanis, Matthias Rosenkranz
Abstract: We present a probabilistic quantum algorithm for preparing mixed states which, in expectation, are proportional to the solutions of Lyapunov equations -- linear matrix equations ubiquitous in the analysis of classical and quantum dynamical systems. Building on previous results by Zhang et al., arXiv:2304.04526, at each step the algorithm either returns the current state, applies a trace non-increasing completely positive map, or restarts depending on the outcomes of a biased coin flip and an ancilla measurement. We introduce a deterministic stopping rule which leads to an efficient algorithm with a bounded expected number of calls to a block-encoding and a state preparation circuit representing the two input matrices of the Lyapunov equations. We also consider approximating the normalized inverse of a positive definite matrix $A$ with condition number $\kappa$ up to trace distance error $\epsilon$. For this special case the algorithm requires, in expectation, at most $\lceil \kappa\ln(1/\epsilon) \rceil+1$ calls to a block-encoding of $\sqrt{A/\|A\|}$. This matches the optimal query complexity in $\kappa$ and $\epsilon$ of the related, but distinct, quantum linear system solvers. In its most general form, the algorithm generates mixed states which approximate matrix-valued weighted sums and integrals.

Title: FFTArray: A Python Library for the Implementation of Discretized Multi-Dimensional Fourier Transforms
Authors: Stefan J. Seckmeyer, Christian Struckmann, Gabriel Müller, Jan-Niclas Kirsten-Siemß, Naceur Gaaloul
Abstract: Partial differential equations describing the dynamics of physical systems rarely have closed-form solutions. Fourier spectral methods, which use Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to approximate solutions, are a common approach to solving these equations. However, implementing those requires careful attention to grid selection and coordinate-dependent phase and scale factors when mapping the Fourier integrals to discrete FFTs. Most existing software packages integrate the Fourier transform discretization tightly into their full-stack implementations. This integrated design sacrifices generality, making it difficult to adapt to new coordinate systems, boundary conditions, or problem-specific requirements. To address these challenges, we present FFTArray, a Python library that automates the general discretization of Fourier transforms. It allows to easily define valid coordinate grids and efficiently applies the coordinate grid specific corrections with minimal impact on computational performance. Built on the Python Array API Standard, FFTArray supports GPU acceleration and integrates seamlessly with array backends like NumPy, JAX and PyTorch. Its interface enables the direct translation of textbook equations and complex research problems into code, while its modular design scales naturally to multiple dimensions. FFTArray allows scientists to focus on their core scientific challenges and thereby reduces the barrier to developing high-performance, maintainable code for pseudo-spectral Fourier methods. The code is openly available at this https URL under Apache-2.0 license.

Title: Revisiting the operator extension of strong subadditivity
Authors: Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming
Abstract: We give a new proof of the operator extension of the strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy $\rho_{AB} \otimes \sigma_{C}^{-1} \leq \rho_{A} \otimes \sigma_{BC}^{-1}$ by identifying the mathematical structure behind it as Connes' theory of spatial derivatives. This immediately generalizes the inequality to arbitrary inclusions of von Neumann algebras. In the case of standard representations, it reduces to the monotonicity of the relative modular operator.

Title: Geometric fragmentation and anomalous thermalization in cubic dimer model
Authors: Joel Steinegger, Debasish Banerjee, Emilie Huffman, Lukas Rammelmüller
Abstract: While quantum statistical mechanics triumphs in explaining many equilibrium phenomena, there is an increasing focus on going beyond conventional scenarios of thermalization. Traditionally examples of non-thermalizing systems are either integrable, or disordered. Recently, examples of translationally-invariant physical systems have been discovered whose excited energies avoid thermalization either due to local constraints (whether exact or emergent), or due to higher-form symmetries. In this article, we extend these investigations for the case of 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models, which are lattice gauge theories with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces (also generically called quantum link models) with staggered charged static matter. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we uncover a class of athermal states that arise in large winding sectors, when the system is subjected to external electric fields. The polarization of the dynamical fluxes in the direction of applied field traps excitations in 2D planes, while an interplay with the Gauss Law constraint in the perpendicular direction causes exotic athermal behaviour due to the emergence of new conserved quantities. This causes a geometric fragmentation of the system. We provide analytical arguments showing that the scaling of the number of fragments is exponential in the linear system size, leading to weak fragmentation. Further, we identify sectors which host fractonic excitations with severe mobility restrictions. The unitary evolution of fragments dominated by fractons is qualitatively different from the one dominated by non-fractonic excitations.

Title: Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions
Authors: Liang Mao
Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem that generic quadratic open fermionic systems, governed by Lindblad master equations, cannot host dissipation-free topological edge states. Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes the band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly dissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a topologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s rigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property. Thus, there is no robust dissipation-free edge modes protected by the bulk topology in quadratic open fermions, under any unitary or anti-unitary symmetries. Our result applies to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians, requiring only gapped bulk and bounded spectrum for technical convenience. Our result establish a definitive boundary for the existence of robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.

Abstract: Superconductor qubits typically use aluminum-aluminum oxide tunnel junctions to provide the non-linear inductance. Junctions with semiconductor barriers make it possible to vary the superconductor material and explore beyond aluminum. We use InAs semiconductor nanowires coated with thin superconducting shells of beta-Sn to realize transmon qubits. By tuning the Josephson energy with a gate voltage, we adjust the qubit frequency over a range of 3 GHz. The longest energy relaxation time, T1 = 27 microseconds, is obtained at the lowest qubit frequencies, while the longest echo dephasing time, T2 = 1.8 microseconds, is achieved at higher frequencies. We assess the possible factors limiting coherence times in these devices and discuss steps to enhance performance through improvements in materials fabrication and circuit design.

Title: Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer
Authors: Krishnakanta Barik, Goutam Paul
Abstract: The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al. [\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit depth.

Title: Dynamical generation of geometric squeezing in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Li Chen, Fei Zhu, Zheng Tang, Liang Zeng, Jae Joon Lee, Han Pu
Abstract: When the rotating frequency of a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined in a weak anisotropic harmonic potential is suddenly quenched to its trapping frequency, the condensate evolves from its ground state to a single-mode squeezed state with exponentially growing quantum fluctuation anisotropy. Such a squeezed state is called the geometrically squeezed state. However, for interacting BECs with two-body collisions, a similar quench only results in quantum fluctuations oscillating periodically without squeezing. In this work, we identify superfluid stability as the key factor behind this non-squeezing phenomenon, with the periodic oscillations arising from collective excitations of a stable collective excitation mode. By strategically breaking the stability criteria, we propose a dynamical approach for generating squeezing that can exponentially suppress quantum fluctuations in a relatively short time, surpassing the efficiency of existing experimental preparation schemes.

Title: Four-mode quantum sensing and Fisher information in a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas
Authors: Fei Zhu, Zheng Tang, Liang Zeng, Shu Wang, Li Chen
Abstract: Multi-mode squeezing and entanglement are important resources in quantum metrology and sensing. For spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensates subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), previous studies on spin squeezing have been limited to two-mode systems. In this work, we demonstrate that such a system can naturally construct a four-mode model spanning an $\mathfrak{su}(4)$ algebra with six SU(2) subspaces. Using spin squeezing parameters and quantum Fisher information matrices, we analyze the dynamical evolution of coherent spin states. The results show that, beyond two-mode models, the SOC-induced four-mode couplings give rise to richer entanglement-enhanced sensing approaching the Heisenberg limit across various SU(2) subspaces. Additionally, by tuning a single system parameter (the Raman Rabi frequency), one can selectively control the optimal measurement directions across different subspaces.

Title: Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach
Authors: Pramod Kamal Kharel, Mausam Ghimire, Ashish Khanal, Samyam Pudasaini, Nabaraj Khatri, Sayujya Bhandari, Divash Rai, Kiran Adhikari, Rajeev Singh
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic Rényi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.

Title: Density of States (Gate) - Controlled Andreev Molecule and Sensor

Abstract: Topological quantum computing typically relies on topological Andreev bound states (ABSs) engineered in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices, where gate control offers key advantages. While strong Zeeman fields can induce such states, an alternative approach emerges through Andreev molecules -- closely spaced, coupled ABSs, also key building-block for Kitaev chain -- that enable topological behavior without high magnetic fields. However, existing Andreev molecules are controlled via magnetic flux in superconducting loops, limiting scalability. Here, we introduce a gate-controlled Andreev molecule, where electrostatic tuning of the density of states in one site nonlocally enhances the critical current of another. This eliminates superconducting loops, offering superior tunability, scalability, and sensitivity. We further extend such an Andreev molecule to a multi-site Kitaev chain, and a noninvasive sensor resolving single-Cooper-pair charge for parity readout. This platform bridges the gap between scalable ABS engineering and high-sensitivity quantum sensing, advancing the development for constructing and parity-readout in topological ABSs and long Kitaev chains towards topological qubits.

Title: Unveiling quantum criticality of disordered Aubry-André-Harper models via typical fidelity susceptibility
Authors: Tian-Cheng Yi, Ying-Ying Fang, Wen Chen, Wen-Long You, Yunbo Zhang
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localization transition and quantum criticality {in the ground state of the} disordered Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model, where a quasiperiodic potential is hybridized with a disordered potential. In the clean limit, the AAH model undergoes a localization transition from an extended phase to a localized phase via an intermediate critical phase as the strength of the quasiperiodic potential is varied. While the staggered potential merely shifts the critical point to a lower value, Fibonacci and Thue-Morse potentials induce immediate localization. This contrast reveals the sensitivity of localization behavior to the structural complexity of the potential, with the onset of localization correlating with the sequence's complexity. More specifically, the system follows a hierarchy defined by the complexity measures of the applied potentials. In addition, the typical fidelity susceptibility exhibits a power-law scaling behavior at the localization transition, enabling reliable extraction of the critical exponent. We focus on the AAH model with the Fibonacci potential due to its minimal finite-size effects compared to other cases. For the disordered AAH model with the Fibonacci potential, we determine critical exponents that differ from those of the AAH model without disorder and the Anderson model. Moreover, despite differences in localization behavior, we find that the disordered AAH models with the staggered potential and the Fibonacci potential share the same correlation-length critical exponent. These findings provide a unified framework for understanding localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems and are amenable to experimental validation using emerging techniques.

Abstract: The integration of coherent quantum emitters with silicon photonic platforms essential for scalable quantum technologies. We demonstrate electrically controlled self-assembled quantum dots embedded in GaAs waveguides bonded onto a SiO2/Si substrate and coupled to low-loss SiN waveguides. Our approach uses a die-to-die adhesive bonding process to realize a GaAs-on-insulator platform incorporating a p-i-n junction for charge noise suppression and Stark tuning of excitonic transitions. Resonance fluorescence measurements reveal narrow optical linewidths below 2 {\mu}eV and high single-photon purity, matching the performance of unprocessed GaAs devices. These results establish a practical route to integrate high-coherence quantum light sources with mature silicon photonics, enabling scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits

Title: Optimal compilation of parametrised quantum circuits
Authors: John van de Wetering, Richie Yeung, Tuomas Laakkonen, Aleks Kissinger
Abstract: Parametrised quantum circuits contain phase gates whose phase is determined by a classical algorithm prior to running the circuit on a quantum device. Such circuits are used in variational algorithms like QAOA and VQE. In order for these algorithms to be as efficient as possible it is important that we use the fewest number of parameters. We show that, while the general problem of minimising the number of parameters is NP-hard, when we restrict to circuits that are Clifford apart from parametrised phase gates and where each parameter is used just once, we *can* efficiently find the optimal parameter count. We show that when parameter transformations are required to be sufficiently well-behaved, the only rewrites that reduce parameters correspond to simple 'fusions'. Using this we find that a previous circuit optimisation strategy by some of the authors [Kissinger, van de Wetering. PRA (2019)] finds the optimal number of parameters. Our proof uses the ZX-calculus. We also prove that the standard rewrite rules of the ZX-calculus suffice to prove any equality between parametrised Clifford circuits.

Title: Classical certification of quantum gates under the dimension assumption
Authors: Jan Nöller, Nikolai Miklin, Martin Kliesch, Mariami Gachechiladze
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum hardware necessitates the development of reliable methods to certify its correct functioning. However, existing certification tests fall short, as they either suffer from systematic errors or do not guarantee that only a correctly functioning quantum device can pass the test. We introduce a certification method for quantum gates tailored for a practical server-user scenario, where a classical user tests the results of exact quantum computations performed by a quantum server. This method is free from the systematic state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. For single-qubit gates, including those that form a universal set for single-qubit quantum computation, we demonstrate that our approach offers soundness guarantees based solely on the dimension assumption. Additionally, for a highly-relevant phase gate - which corresponds experimentally to a $\pi/2$-pulse - we prove that the method's sample complexity scales as $\mathrm{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ relative to the average gate infidelity $\varepsilon$. By combining the SPAM-error-free and sound notion of certification with practical applicability, our approach paves the way for promising research into efficient and reliable certification methods for full-scale quantum computation.

Title: Self-Induced Superradiant Masing
Authors: Wenzel Kersten, Nikolaus de Zordo, Oliver Diekmann, Elena S. Redchenko, Andrew N. Kanagin, Andreas Angerer, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto, Igor E. Mazets, Stefan Rotter, Thomas Pohl, Jörg Schmiedmayer
Abstract: In cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and particularly superradiance, emitters are typically assumed to be independent, interacting only through light shared via a common mode. While such photon-mediated interactions lead to a rich spectrum of collective optical effects, direct dipole-dipole interactions within the emitter ensemble are generally viewed as a source of decoherence. Here, we uncover a new role for direct spin-spin interactions as a drive for the superradiant dynamics of a hybrid system of nitrogen-vacancy center spins in diamond coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity. After an initial fast superradiant burst, we observe an unexpected train of subsequent emission pulses followed by quasi-continuous masing for up to one millisecond. We show that this surprising behavior arises from spectral hole refilling, where spin inversion is redistributed into the superradiant window of spins resonant with the cavity. We report measurements that clearly exclude other cQED-related effects, and performed microscopic simulations of up to one million spins, which demonstrate that the observed self-induced masing is indeed driven by dipole-dipole interactions between the spins. These findings open new pathways for exploring complex spin-spin interactions in dense disordered systems and offer possibilities for ultra-narrow linewidth solid-state superradiant masers powered purely by microwave-driven spin control.

Title: A Generalized Formulation of Two-Particle Interference
Authors: Kamran Nazir, Tabish Qureshi
Abstract: Two-photon interference is an interesting quantum phenomenon that is usually captured in two distinct types of experiments, namely the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) experiment and the Hong- Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment. While the HBT experiment was carried out much earlier in 1956, with classical light, the demonstration of the HOM effect came much later in 1987. Unlike the former, the latter has frequently been argued to be a purely quantum effect. A generalized formulation of two-particle interference is presented here. The HOM and the quantum HBT effects emerge as special cases in the general analysis. A realizable two-particle interference experiment, which is intermediate between the two effects, is proposed and analyzed. Thus two-particle interference is shown to be a single phenomenon with various possible implementations, including the HBT and HOM setups.

Title: Witnessing mass-energy equivalence with trapped atom interferometers
Authors: Jerzy Paczos, Joshua Foo, Magdalena Zych
Abstract: We propose an experimental setup to probe the interplay between the quantum superposition principle and gravitational time dilation arising from the mass-energy equivalence. It capitalizes on state-of-the-art atom interferometers that can keep atoms trapped in a superposition of heights in Earth's gravitational field for exceedingly long times, reaching the minute scale. Our proposal consists of adding two additional laser pulses to the existing experiments that would set up a clock trapped at a superposition of heights, reading a quantum superposition of relativistic proper times. We develop a method to include relativistic corrections to Bloch oscillations, which describe the trapped part of the interferometer. We derive the trajectories and corresponding phases acquired in each arm of the interferometer. We then show that a superposition of proper times manifests in the interference pattern in two ways: visibility modulations and a shift of the atom's resonant frequency. We argue that the latter might be observable with current technology.

Title: A simple gravitational self-decoherence model
Authors: Gabriel H. S. Aguiar, George E. A. Matsas
Abstract: One of the most significant debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for the latter and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. For this purpose, we postulate the existence of a Heisenberg cut such that particles with masses $m$ much smaller and larger than a critical mass $M_{\rm C}$ (of the order of the Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$) would be necessarily treated according to quantum and classical rules, respectively. Our effective model is designed to capture the new physics that free quantum particles would experience as their masses approach $M_{\rm C}$. The purity loss for free quantum particles is evaluated and shown to be highly inefficient for quantum particles with $m \ll M_{\rm C}$ but very effective for those with $m \sim M_{\rm C}$. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would (easily) leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom. Finally, we contextualize our proposal with state-of-the-art experiments and show how it can be tested in a future Stern-Gerlach-like experiment.

Title: Measuring Correlation and Entanglement between Molecular Orbitals on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer
Authors: Gabriel Greene-Diniz, Chris N. Self, Michal Krompiec, Luuk Coopmans, Marcello Benedetti, David Muñoz Ramo, Matthias Rosenkranz
Abstract: Quantifying correlation and entanglement between molecular orbitals can elucidate the role of quantum effects in strongly correlated reaction processes. However, accurately storing the wavefunction for a classical computation of those quantities can be prohibitive. Here we use the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer to calculate von Neumann entropies which quantify the orbital correlation and entanglement in a strongly correlated molecular system relevant to lithium-ion batteries (vinylene carbonate interacting with an O$_2$ molecule). As shown in previous works, fermionic superselection rules decrease correlations and reduce measurement overheads for constructing orbital reduced density matrices. Taking into account superselection rules we further reduce the number of measurements by finding commuting sets of Pauli operators. Using low overhead noise reduction techniques we calculate von Neumann entropies in excellent agreement with noiseless benchmarks, indicating that correlations and entanglement between molecular orbitals can be accurately estimated from a quantum computation. Our results show that the one-orbital entanglement vanishes unless opposite-spin open shell configurations are present in the wavefunction.

Abstract: This review presents recent developments in the study of inhomogeneous XX spin chains, highlighting results on perfect state transfer, out-of-equilibrium stationary dynamics in open systems, and entanglement and correlations in ground states. We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.

Title: Continuous majorization in quantum phase space for Wigner-positive states and proposals for Wigner-negative states
Authors: Jan de Boer, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Erik Tonni
Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.

Title: Violation of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation in quantum collisional models
Authors: Arghya Maity, Ahana Ghoshal
Abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is a fundamental principle in non-equilibrium thermodynamics that relates entropy production to fluctuations in a system, establishing a trade-off between the precision of an observable and the thermodynamic cost. Investigating TUR violations challenges classical thermodynamic limits, offering the potential for improved precision-entropy trade-offs, which is crucial for enhancing performance and optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relation within a quantum collisional model, which offers the advantage of discretizing interactions into successive collisions with auxiliaries, allowing for precise tracking of dynamics and the incorporation of memory effects and non-Markovian behavior. We consider three types of dynamics in the collisional model: one is Markovian evolution, achieved by taking the continuous time limit and imposing the stability condition, while the other two are non-Markovian dynamics-one arising from increasing the collision time between the system and the auxiliaries, and the other from incorporating interactions between the auxiliaries. For the Markovian dynamics, we examine the classical and quantum TUR bounds in the non-equilibrium steady-state regime, and also the finite-time TUR bound. We identify two distinct regimes of classical TUR violation: in some cases, the maximum violation occurs in the steady state, while in others, it is necessarily transient-appearing only at early times and vanishing with further evolution. For the two non-Markovian approaches, we find that both the degree and type of non-Markovianity crucially affect TUR violations. The second approach shows more pronounced violations during transient times, while the first approach has much stronger violations in the steady-state regime for a certain parameter window.

Title: Exact amplitudes of parametric processes in driven Josephson circuits
Authors: Roman Baskov, Daniel K. Weiss, Steven M. Girvin
Abstract: We present a general approach for analyzing arbitrary parametric processes in Josephson circuits within a single degree of freedom approximation. Introducing a systematic normal-ordered expansion for the Hamiltonian of parametrically driven superconducting circuits we present a flexible procedure to describe parametric processes and to compare and optimize different circuit designs for particular applications. We obtain formally exact amplitudes (`supercoefficients') of these parametric processes for driven SNAIL-based and SQUID-based circuits. The corresponding amplitudes contain complete information about the circuit topology, the form of the nonlinearity, and the parametric drive, making them, in particular, well-suited for the study of the strong drive regime. We present a closed-form expression for supercoefficients describing circuits without stray inductors and a tractable formulation for those with it. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by applying it to the estimation of Kerr-cat qubit Hamiltonian parameters and by examining the criterion for the emergence of chaos in Kerr-cat qubits. Additionally, we extend the approach to multi-degree-of-freedom circuits comprising multiple linear modes weakly coupled to a single nonlinear mode. We apply this generalized framework to study the activation of a beam-splitter interaction between two cavities coupled via driven nonlinear elements. Finally, utilizing the flexibility of the proposed approach, we separately derive supercoefficients for the higher-harmonics model of Josephson junctions, circuits with multiple drives, and the expansion of the Hamiltonian in the exact eigenstate basis for Josephson circuits with specific symmetries.

Title: Highly-entangled, highly-doped states that are efficiently cross-device verifiable
Authors: Janek Denzler, Santiago Varona, Tommaso Guaita, Jose Carrasco
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of highly entangled real quantum states that cannot be approximated by circuits with $\log$-many non-Clifford gates and prove that Bell sampling enables efficient cross-device verification (or distributed inner product estimation) for these states. That is, two remote parties can estimate the inner product ${\rm tr}(\rho\sigma)$, each having black-box access to copies of a state $\rho$ (or respectively $\sigma$) in this class. This is significant because it is clear that this task can be achieved in those cases (such as low entanglement or low non-Clifford gate count) where one can independently learn efficient classical descriptions of each state using established techniques and share the description to compute the overlap. Instead, our results demonstrate that this is possible even in more complex scenarios where these "learn and share" methods are insufficient. Our proposal is scalable, as it just requires a number of two-copy Bell measurements and single-copy Pauli measurements that grows polynomially with both the number of qubits and the desired inverse-error, and can be implemented in the near term. Moreover, the required number of samples can be efficiently experimentally determined by the parties in advance, and our findings are robust against preparation errors. We anticipate that these results could have applications in quantum cryptography and verification.

Title: Foundation Neural-Networks Quantum States as a Unified Ansatz for Multiple Hamiltonians
Authors: Riccardo Rende, Luciano Loris Viteritti, Federico Becca, Antonello Scardicchio, Alessandro Laio, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at this https URL, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.

Title: Noncontextual ontological models of operational probabilistic theories
Authors: Sina Soltani, Marco Erba, David Schmid, John H. Selby
Abstract: An experiment or theory is classically explainable if it can be reproduced by some noncontextual ontological model. In this work, we adapt the notion of ontological models and generalized noncontextuality so it applies to the framework of operational probabilistic theories (OPTs). A defining feature of quotiented OPTs, which sets them apart from the closely related framework of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), is their explicit specification of the structure of instruments, these being generalizations of $\textit{quantum instruments}$ (including nondestructive measurements); in particular, one needs to explicitly declare which collections of transformations constitute a valid instrument. We are particularly interested in strongly causal OPTs, in which the choice of a future instrument can be conditioned on a past measurement outcome. This instrument structure might seem to permit the possibility of a contextual kind of ontological representation, where the representation of a given transformation depends on which instrument it is considered a part of. However, we prove that this is not possible by showing that for strongly causal quotiented OPTs the structure of instruments does $\textit{not}$ allow for such a contextual ontological representation. It follows that ontological representations of strongly causal quotiented OPTs are entirely determined by their action on individual transformations, with no dependence on the structure of instruments.

Title: Single-shot and two-shot decoding with generalized bicycle codes
Authors: Hsiang-Ku Lin, Xingrui Liu, Pak Kau Lim, Leonid P. Pryadko
Abstract: Generalized-bicycle (GB) and more general two-block group-algebra (2BGA) quantum error-correcting codes have naturally redundant minimum-weight stabilizer generators. To use this redundancy, we constructed a large number of ``planar'' 2BGA codes over abelian groups with one and two generators, with each block row of weight 3, relatively large dimensions, distances, and maximum syndrome distance $d_{\rm S}=3$. We simulated the performance of three such codes under phenomenological noise and standard circuit noise, using sliding window sequential decoding protocol covering $T\ge 1$ measurement rounds at a time, based on an in-house binary BP+OSD decoder. While true single-shot decoding ($T=1$) suffers from a significant loss of accuracy, already two-shot ($T=2$) decoding gives nearly the same logical error rates as multi-shot with much larger $T$. Comparison with the same codes but additional stabilizer generators dropped shows that redundancy significantly improves decoding accuracy for all $T\ge 1$.

Title: State-Agnostic Approach to Certifying Electron-Photon Entanglement in Electron Microscopy
Authors: Phila Rembold, Santiago Beltrán-Romero, Alexander Preimesberger, Sergei Bogdanov, Isobel C. Bicket, Nicolai Friis, Elizabeth Agudelo, Dennis Rätzel, Philipp Haslinger
Abstract: Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) enable atomic-scale imaging and characterisation, driving advances across fields from materials science to biology. Quantum correlations, specifically entanglement, may provide a basis for novel hybrid sensing techniques to make TEMs compatible with sensitive samples prone to radiation damage. We present a protocol to certify entanglement between electrons and photons naturally arising from certain coherent cathodoluminescence (CL) processes. Using mutually unbiased bases in position and momentum, our method allows robust, state-agnostic entanglement verification and provides a lower bound on the entanglement of formation, enabling quantitative comparisons across platforms. Simulations under experiment-inspired conditions and preliminary experimental data highlight the feasibility of implementing this approach in modern TEM systems with optical specimen access. Our work integrates photonic quantum information techniques with electron microscopy. It establishes a foundation for entanglement-based imaging at the atomic scale, offering a potential pathway to reduce radiation exposure.

Title: Partial Blind Quantum Computation: A Framework for Selective Circuit Protection
Authors: Youngkyung Lee, Doyoung Chung
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly advancing toward cloud-based services, raising significant concerns about the privacy and security of computations outsourced to untrusted quantum servers. Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC) protocols enable clients with limited quantum resources to delegate computations while concealing both inputs and circuit details. However, applying UBQC uniformly to an entire quantum circuit incurs additional quantum resources and computational overhead, which can be a significant burden in practical implementations. In many cases, such as Grover's algorithm, only specific subroutines-like oracles-contain sensitive information, while the rest of the circuit does not require the same level of protection. Therefore, selectively applying UBQC to critical components can enhance computational efficiency while maintaining security. In this work, we propose a selective application of UBQC that targets only the critical components of quantum circuits. By integrating techniques from Quantum Homomorphic Encryption (QHE) and UBQC, our approach secures the sensitive subcircuits while allowing the remaining, non-sensitive portions to be executed more efficiently. In our framework, UBQC-protected sections output quantum states that are encrypted via bit-flip and phase-flip operations, and we devise a mechanism based on selective X and Z gate corrections to seamlessly interface these with unprotected sections. We provide a security analysis demonstrating that our selective UBQC approach preserves universality, correctness, and blindness, and we illustrate its practical advantages through an application to Grover's algorithm. This work paves the way for more efficient and practical secure quantum computing on near-term devices.

Title: Optimized Clifford Noise Reduction: Theory, Simulations and Experiments
Authors: Edwin Tham, Nicolas Delfosse
Abstract: We propose several optimizations of the CliNR partial error correction scheme which implements Clifford circuits by consuming a resource state. Errors are corrected by measuring a sequence of Pauli operators that we refer to as the verification sequence. We first propose a global optimization algorithm searching for a verification sequence resulting in a low logical error rate using tabu search. Then, we introduce a proxy for the logical error rate which is easier to evaluate and we design a two-step optimization algorithm. First, a verification sequence minimizing the proxy is computed, then this sequence is refined by reintroducing the logical error rate. Finally, we identify a large group of automorphisms of the search space which preserve the proxy and we use this symmetry to reduce the size of the search space. This results in a 168 $\times$ (respectively 20,160 $\times$) reduction of the size of the search space for the optimization of verification sequences with three (respectively four) Pauli operators. Our numerical simulations for 20-qubit Clifford circuits with size 400 under the ion chain model show that our optimization algorithms improve the performance of CliNR by 25% and that the two-step optimization achieves the same results as the global optimization with 64% fewer evaluations of the logical error rate. Finally, we perform experiments on a 36-qubit trapped ion quantum computer, without mid-circuit measurements, showing that the CZNR variant of CliNR is at breakeven.

Title: Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices
Authors: Alto Osada, Koichiro Miyanishi
Abstract: Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.

Title: On the Hamiltonian with Energy Levels Corresponding to Riemann Zeros
Authors: Xingpao Suo
Abstract: A Hamiltonian with eigenenergies $E_n = \rho_n(1-\rho_n) $ has been constructed, where $\rho_n $ denotes the $n$-th non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. To construct such a Hamiltonian, we generalize the Berry-Keating's paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian through modular forms. Even though our construction does not resolve the Hilbert-Pólya conjecture -- since the eigenstates corresponding to $E_n$ are \emph{not} normalizable states -- it offers a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis(RH). Especially, we proposed a physical statement of RH, which may serve as a potential pathway toward its proof.

Title: Detecting PPT entangled and PPT edge states via rank properties of matrices
Authors: Aabhas Gulati
Abstract: We develop a new method for entanglement detection in bipartite quantum states, using the violation of the rank-1 generated property of matrices. The positive-semidefinite matrices form a convex cone that has extremal elements of rank-1. But convex conic subsets resulting from presence of linear constraints allow extremal elements of rank >= 2. The problem of deciding when a matrix is rank-1 generated, i.e a sum of rank-1 PSD matrices, has been studied extensively in optimization theory. This rank-1 generated property acts as an entanglement criterion, and we use this property to find novel classes of PPT entangled states. We do this by mapping some faces of PPT density matrices to convex cones that are not rank-1 generated. We show that for all separable states, this maps to a rank-1 generated state. In general, the same is not true for the corresponding matrices of PPT entangled states. We also extend this approach to construct PPT entangled edge states by showing that states that get mapped to extremal elements are PPT entangled edge states, that violate the range criterion in an extreme fashion. Finally, we provide different methods that detect the violation of rank-1 generated property for convex cones we consider.

Title: Unified Framework for Quantum Code Embedding
Authors: Andrew C. Yuan
Abstract: Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to modify the stabilizer code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and parity checks. Motivations may include embedding a high-dimensional quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) code into finite-dimensional Euclidean space, or reducing the weights of an arbitrary CSS code. During this embedding, it is essential that the modified CSS code possesses an isomorphic set of logical qubits as the original CSS code. However, despite numerous explicit constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known in general. Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and input codes. In particular, we explicitly show how previous works fit into our framework.

Title: Probing Defects with Quantum Simulator Snapshots
Authors: Abhijat Sarma, Nayan Myerson-Jain, Yue Liu, Nandagopal Manoj, Jason Alicea, Roger G. Melko, Cenke Xu
Abstract: Snapshots, i.e. projective measurements of local degrees of freedom, are the most standard data taken in experiments on quantum simulators. Snapshots are usually used to probe local physics. In this work we propose a simple protocol to experimentally probe physics of defects with these snapshots. Our protocol relies only on snapshots from the bulk system, without introducing the defect explicitly; as such, the physics of different kinds of defects can be probed using the same dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that with snapshots of local spin configurations of, for example, the $1d$ Rydberg atom realization of the quantum Ising criticality, we can (1) extract the ``defect entropy", and (2) access the continuous line of fixed points of effective defect conformal field theory, which was recently discussed in the context of the ``weak-measurement altered criticality".

Title: Data-Driven Reconstruction and Characterization of Stochastic Dynamics via Dynamical Mode Decomposition
Authors: Adva Baratz, Loris Maria Cangemi, Assaf Hamo, Sivan Refaely-Abramson, Amikam Levy
Abstract: Noise fundamentally limits the performance and predictive capabilities of classical and quantum dynamical systems by degrading stability and obscuring intrinsic dynamical characteristics. Characterizing such noise accurately is essential for enhancing measurement precision, understanding environmental interactions, and designing effective control strategies across diverse scientific and engineering domains. However, extracting spectral features and associated characteristic decay or coherence times from limited and noisy datasets remains challenging. Here, we introduce a general, data-driven framework based on Dynamical Mode Decomposition (DMD) to analyze system dynamics under stochastic noise. We reinterpret DMD modes as statistical weights over ensembles of stochastic trajectories, using a nonlinear transformation to construct noise power spectral densities (PSDs). This enables the identification of dominant frequency contributions in both broadband (white) and correlated ($1/f$) noise environments, as well as direct extraction of intrinsic characteristic decay times from DMD eigenvalues. To overcome instability in standard DMD-based extrapolation, we develop a constrained reconstruction method using extracted decay times as physical bounds and the learned PSD as weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through simulations of quantum system dynamics subjected to decoherence from noise, validating its robustness and predictive capabilities. This methodology provides a broadly applicable tool for diagnostic, predictive, noise mitigation analyses, and control in complex stochastic systems.

Title: Studies of properties of bipartite graphs with quantum programming
Authors: Kh. P. Gnatenko
Abstract: Multi-qubit quantum states corresponding to bipartite graphs $G(U,V,E)$ are examined. These states are constructed by applying $CNOT$ gates to an arbitrary separable multi-qubit quantum state. The entanglement distance of the resulting states is derived analytically for an arbitrary bipartite graph structure. A relationship between entanglement and the vertex degree is established. Additionally, we identify how quantum correlators relate to the number of vertices with odd and even degrees in the sets $U$ and $V$. Based on these results, quantum protocols are proposed for quantifying the number of vertices with odd and even degrees in the sets $U$ and $V$. For a specific case where the bipartite graph is a star graph, we analytically calculate the dependence of entanglement distance on the state parameters. These results are also verified through quantum simulations on the AerSimulator, including noise models. Furthermore, we use quantum calculations to quantify the number of vertices with odd degrees in $U$ and $V$. The results agree with the theoretical predictions.

Title: Reconstructing the unitary part of a noisy quantum channel
Authors: Adrian Romer, Daniel M. Reich, Christiane P. Koch
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing the unitary describing the evolution of a quantum system, or quantum channel, from a set of input and output states. For ideal, fully coherent evolution, we show that the unitary can be reconstructed from two mixed states or $d+1$ pure states, where $d$ is the size of Hilbert space. The reconstruction method can be extended to approximate the unitary part of a dynamical map, provided the decoherence is not too strong to render this question meaningless. We exemplify the method for the example of the cross-resonance gate as well as a random set of unitaries, comparing the reconstruction from pure, respectively mixed, states to an approach based on the Choi matrix. We find that the pure state reconstruction requires the least amount of resources when the dynamics is close to unitary, whereas the mixed state approach outperforms the pure state reconstruction in terms of channel uses for appreciable decoherence.

Title: Apparent energy-speed relationship poses no challenge to Bohmian mechanics
Authors: Matthew Dickau
Abstract: A recent article claims to measure the speed of quantum particles in the classically forbidden regime where the energy of the particles is lower than the local potential, and further claims that the results of this experiment challenge Bohmian mechanics. But this interpretation of the experiment is incorrect (and dubious even in the context of ordinary quantum mechanics). A proper analysis of the system from a pilot-wave perspective shows that it predicts the same distribution of particle positions (and so the same experimental results) as ordinary quantum theory. The speed measured by the experiment in this regime is fictitious.

Title: Benchmarking a Tunable Quantum Neural Network on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Hardware
Authors: Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Xingxin Liu, Richard Barney, Sarah H. Miller, Alaina M. Green, Norbert M. Linke, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.

Title: Scalable and (quantum-accessible) adaptive pseudorandom quantum states and pseudorandom function-like quantum state generators
Authors: Rishabh Batra, Zhili Chen, Rahul Jain, YaoNan Zhang
Abstract: Pseudorandom quantum states (PRSs) and pseudorandom function-like quantum state (PRFS) generators are quantum analogues of pseudorandom generators and pseudorandom functions. It is known that PRS (and PRFS) can exist even if BQP = QMA (relative to a quantum oracle) [Kre21] or if P = NP (relative to a classical oracle) [KQST23], which does not allow for the existence of one-way functions (relative to these oracles). Hence, these are potentially weaker objects than quantum-secure one-way functions, which can be used to do quantum cryptography. A desirable property of PRS and PRFS constructions is scalability, which ensures that the security parameter $\lambda$ (which determines indistinguishability from their Haar-random counterparts) can be much larger than $n$ (the number of qubits of the output states). This may be important in some applications where PRS and PRFS primitives are used. We present an isometric procedure to prepare quantum states that can be arbitrarily random (i.e., the trace distance from the Haar-random state can be arbitrarily small for the true random case, or the distinguishing advantage can be arbitrarily small for the pseudorandom case). Our procedure provides a new method for scalable PRS that introduces no entanglement or correlations with the environment. This naturally gives the first construction for scalable and (quantum-accessible) adaptive PRFS assuming quantum-secure one-way functions. Our PRFS construction implies various primitives, including long-input PRFS, short-input PRFS, short-output PRFS, non-adaptive PRFS, and classical-accessible adaptive PRFS [AQY22, AGQY22]. This new construction may be helpful in some simplification of the microcrypt zoo (this https URL).

Title: Atom-Induced Field Squeezing Predicted by Magnus Expanding the Jaynes-Cummings Model for a Two-Level Atom
Authors: Phoenix M. M. Paing
Abstract: By performing up to the second-order Magnus expansion on the Jaynes-Cummings Model Hamiltonian governing the interaction of a two-level atom and a single cavity mode electromagnetic field, we find the term involving the squeezing of light beyond the Rotating Wave Approximation. Our results demonstrate that the Magnus expansion provides a systematic framework to capture atom-induced squeezing effects. These findings suggest new avenues for engineering nonclassical states in simple light-matter systems without requiring multi-level structures or strong nonlinear media.

Title: A class of 2x2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution
Authors: Jamal Sakhr
Abstract: A class of 2x2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained finite sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present class of models, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2x2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues. Various generalizations and extensions are discussed including a simple modification that effectuates cross-over transitions between other classes of eigenvalue spacing statistics. The case of a cross-over transition between semi-Poisson and Ginibre spacing statistics is presented as a novel example.

Title: A Low-Power Evanescent Field Atom Guide Based on Nanofiber Testbeds for Chip-Scale Quantum Inertial Sensors with Photonic Integrated Circuits
Authors: Adrian Orozco, William Kindel, Nicholas Karl, Yuan-Yu Jau, Michael Gehl, Grant Biedermann, Jongmin Lee
Abstract: Recent advancements in cold atom interferometry have facilitated the practical application of quantum inertial sensors. To mitigate the detrimental effects of operating in dynamic environments, optical or magnetic atom guides are essential for transverse confinement. One notable approach involves the use of evanescent field (EF) optical dipole traps as atom guides (i.e. EF atom guides). In this study, we first investigated the feasibility of EF atom guides using nanofiber testbeds for application in photonic integrated circuits (PICs). We successfully demonstrated EF atom guiding with traveling evanescent waves and validated the atomic coherence of EF-guided atoms through microwave fields and fiber-guided sub-microwatt EF Doppler-free Raman beams. Our low-power EF atom guides, based on nanofiber testbeds, utilize 793 and 937 nm light to trap 133Cs atoms. This approach reduces power requirements to <10mW, enabling easier thermal management in vacuum environments. These wavelengths were also selected to facilitate the integration of EF atom guides on membrane PIC platforms, which we previously demonstrated with a suspended membrane waveguide capable of handling in-vacuum optical powers suitable for EF atom guiding (Gehl et al., Opt. Express 29, 13129, 2021). Our design includes an open hole in a transparent membrane, which facilitates the loading of sub-Doppler cooled atoms using a membrane magneto-optical trap (Lee et al., Sci. Rep. 11, 8807, 2021). These developments offer a unique path for integrating EF atom guides on the PIC platforms. All these findings represent a significant first step toward EF-guided atom interferometry and the first demonstration of chip-scale quantum inertial sensors.

Title: Tripartite entanglement and Bell non-locality in loop-induced Higgs boson decays
Authors: R. A. Morales
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum entanglement properties of the three-body $H\to\gamma l\bar{l}$ decays (for $l=e,\mu,\tau$) within the context of the Standard Model augmented with CP-violating interactions in the lepton Yukawa sector. Our aim is to elucidate the distribution of entanglement between the final photon, lepton and antilepton across the phase-space. These rare Higgs boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality. Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime. We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations. Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.

Title: Brain functions emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the connectome
Authors: Elkaïoum M. Moutuou, Habib Benali
Abstract: A fundamental idea in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped and constrained by the brain's structural organization. Despite significant progress in mapping and analyzing structural connectomes, the principles linking the brain's physical architecture to its functional capabilities remain elusive. Here, we introduce an algebraic quantum model to bridge this theoretical gap, offering new insights into the relationship between the connectome and emergent brain functions, while connecting structural data to functional predictions. Using the well-mapped C. elegans anatomical and extrasynaptic connectomes, we demonstrate that brain functions, defined as functional networks of a neural system, emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system derived from the graph algebra of the underlying directed multigraph. Specifically, these equilibrium states, characterized by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) formalism, reveal how individual neurons contribute to functional network formation. Our model illuminates the structure-function relationship in neural circuits through two key features: (1) a functional connectome that delineates topologically driven neuronal interactions and (2) an Integration Capacity (IC) index that quantifies how effectively neurons coordinate and modulate diverse information flows. Together, these features provide a statistical and mechanistic account of information flow and reveal how the network topology of the connectome predicts cognition and complex behaviors.

Title: Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra
Authors: Attila Szabó
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.

Title: Analog phase-sensitive time-reversal of optically-carried radiofrequency signals

Abstract: Achieving low-latency time-reversal of broadband radiofrequency signals is crucial for reliable communications in dynamic, uncontrolled environments. However, existing approaches are either digitally assisted -- making broadband extension challenging -- or limited to amplitude modulation. In this work, we report the very first experimental realization of a fully analog, phase-preserving time-reversal architecture for optically-carried radiofrequency signals. The method exploits the exceptional coherence properties of rare-earth ion-doped materials, and leverages the well-established photon echo mechanism, widely used in quantum technologies. While our demonstration is conducted with a modest bandwidth, we identify the fundamental cause of this limitation and propose solutions for future scalability.

Title: Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive
Authors: Raúl A. Briceño, William Gyory, Thomas Iadecola, Srimoyee Sen
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.

Title: Entanglement of Inhomogeneous Free Bosons and Orthogonal Polynomials
Authors: Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Gilles Parez, Eric Ragoucy, David Raveh, Luc Vinet
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.
