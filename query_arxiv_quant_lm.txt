Title: Simultaneous Quantization and Reduction of Constrained Systems
Authors: Jianhao M. Yang
Abstract: We present a novel framework for quantizing constrained quantum systems in which the processes of quantization and constraint enforcement are performed simultaneously. The approach is based on an extension of the stationary action principle, incorporating an information-theoretic term arising from vacuum fluctuations. Constraints are included directly in the Lagrangian via Lagrange multipliers, allowing the subsequent variational procedure to yield the quantum dynamics without ambiguity regarding the order of quantization and reduction. We demonstrate the method through two examples: (i) a one-dimensional system with vanishing local momentum, where the simultaneous approach produces the time-independent Schrödinger equation while conventional reduced and Dirac quantization yield only trivial states, and (ii) a bipartite system with global translational invariance, where all three methods agree. These results show that the proposed framework generalizes standard quantization schemes and provides a consistent treatment of systems with constraints that cannot be expressed as linear operators acting on the wave function. In addition to a unified variational principle for constrained quantum systems, the formalism also offers an information-theoretic perspective on quantum effects arising from vacuum fluctuations.

Title: Proposal of method to solve a Traveling Salesman Problem using Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
Authors: Hikaru Wakaura
Abstract: Traveling salesman problems (TSP) are one of the well-known combinatorial optimization problems that many groups tackle to solve. This problem appears in many types of combinational optimization, such as scheduling, route optimization, and circuit optimization. However, this problem is NP-hard, as the number of combinations increases exponentially as the number of sites increases. Quantum Annealers and Adiabatic Quantum Computers are good at solving it, and universal quantum computers are limited by the number of qubits they have. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that solves it using a Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold network (VQKAN). Our approach requires a smaller number of qubits than the former approaches on quantum computers. We confirmed that our approach can optimize the paths on the graphs whose length of each path is time-dependent, partial.

Title: On a discrete version of the position-momentum commutation relation
Authors: Nicolae Cotfas
Abstract: The usual position-momentum commutation relation plays a fundamental role in the mathematical description of continuous-variable quantum systems. In the case of a qudit described by a Hilbert space of a high enough dimension, there exists a discrete version of the position-momentum commutation relation approximately satisfied by a large part of the pure quantum states. Our purpose is to explore in more details the set of these states. We show that it contains a family of discrete-variable Gaussian states depending on a continuous parameter and certain discrete coherent states. It also contains various discrete-variable versions of the Hermite-Gauss states, defined either as eigenstates of certain discrete versions of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian or generated by using a discrete version of the creation or annihilation operator. As a direct consequence, a discrete version of the incertitude relation is satisfied by the considered quantum states.

Title: Supervised Machine Learning for Predicting Open Quantum System Dynamics and Detecting Non-Markovian Memory Effects
Authors: Ali Abu-Nada, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: We present a \emph{novel} and scalable supervised machine learning framework to predict open-quantum system dynamics and detect non-Markovian memory using only local ancilla measurements. A system qubit is coherently coupled to an ancilla via a symmetric XY Hamiltonian; the ancilla interacts with a noisy environment and is the only qubit we measure. A feedforward neural network, trained on short sliding windows of supplementary data from the past, forecasts the observable system $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ without state tomography or knowledge of the bath. To quantify memory, we introduce a normalized revival-based metric that counts upward 'turn-backs' in \emph{predicted} $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ and reports the fraction of evaluated samples that exceeds a small threshold. This bounded score provides an interpretable, model-independent indicator of non-Markovianity. We demonstrate the method on two representative noise channels, non-unital amplitude damping and unital dephasing from random telegraph noise (RTN). Under matched conditions, the model accurately reproduces the dynamics and flags memory effects, with RTN exhibiting a larger normalized revival score than amplitude damping. Overall, the approach is experimentally realistic and readily extensible, enabling real-time, interpretable non-Markovian diagnostics from accessible local measurements.

Title: Universality of Shallow Global Quenches in Critical Spin Chains
Authors: Julia Wei, Méabh Allen, Jack Kemp, Chenbing Wang, Zixia Wei, Joel E. Moore, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: Measuring universal data in the strongly correlated regime of quantum critical points remains a fundamental objective for quantum simulators. In foundational work, Calabrese and Cardy demonstrated how this data governs the dynamics of certain global quenches to 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories. While the quasiparticle picture they introduce has been widely successful in both theory and experiment, their seminal prediction that the critical exponents are simply encoded in the relaxation rates of local observables is more challenging to investigate experimentally; in particular, the specific initial state required for their analysis is generated via imaginary time evolution. In this work, we examine the critical quench dynamics of local observables from two types of readily-accessible initial conditions: ground states and finite-temperature ensembles. We identify universal scaling collapses and scaling functions in both cases, utilizing a combination of conformal perturbation theory and tensor network numerics. For the finite-temperature quenches, we determine a regime in which the conformal field theory results are recovered, thereby allowing universal quantum critical data to be extracted from realistic quenches.

Title: Cost-aware Photonic Graph State Generation: A Graphical Framework
Authors: Sobhan Ghanbari, Hoi-Kwong Lo
Abstract: Photonic graph states are essential resources for quantum computation and communication. Deterministic emitter-based generation of graph states overcomes the scalability issues of probabilistic approaches, but their experimental realization is constrained by technological demands, often expressed by the number of two-qubit gates and the depth and/or width of the quantum circuits used to model the generation process. We introduce a cost-aware framework for the generation of photonic graph states of arbitrary size and shape, built on a complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions and a universal set of elementary graph operations that govern the evolution of the state toward the target. Within this framework, we develop Graph Builder, a deterministic generation algorithm that achieves substantial reductions (up to an order of magnitude) in two-qubit gate usage for both random and structured graphs, compared with alternative approaches. The algorithm uses the minimum number of emitters possible for a fixed emission sequence, while also supporting the use of extra emitters for controlled trade-offs between emitter count and other cost metrics. Moreover, by systematically identifying the degrees of freedom at each stage of the generation process, this framework fully characterizes the optimization landscape, enabling analytic, heuristic, or exhaustive strategies for further cost reductions. Our approach provides a general and versatile tool for designing and optimizing emitter-based photonic graph state generation protocols, essential for scalable and resource-efficient photonic quantum information processing.

Title: Quantum-limited optical delay sensing across an enhanced dynamic range by frequency-resolving two-photon interference
Authors: Russell M. J. Brooks, Luca Maggio, Thomas Jaeken, Joseph Ho, Erik Gauger, Vincenzo Tamma, Alessandro Fedrizzi
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry is an effective tool for precision sensing, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between dynamic range and measurement precision. To overcome this limitation, we sample the frequencies of two interfering photons, which extends the sensitivity in the time domain. This enhances the dynamic range of optical delay estimation by up to twenty times compared to the non-resolved estimates. We demonstrate this approach with independent photon sources and show the precision scaling with the detector frequency resolution. This technique enables scan-free nanometre resolution depth sensing over a millimetre-scale range, with applications in biological and nanomaterial imaging.

Title: Learning with errors may remain hard against quantum holographic attacks
Authors: Yunfei Wang, Xin Jin, Junyu Liu
Abstract: The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem underlies modern lattice-based cryptography and is assumed to be quantum hard. Recent results show that estimating entanglement entropy is as hard as LWE, creating tension with quantum gravity and AdS/CFT, where entropies are computed by extremal surface areas. This suggests a paradoxical route to solving LWE by building holographic duals and measuring extremal surfaces, seemingly an easy task. Three possible resolutions arise: that AdS/CFT duality is intractable, that the quantum-extended Church-Turing thesis (QECTT) fails, or that LWE is easier than believed. We develop and analyze a fourth resolution: that estimating surface areas with the precision required for entropy is itself computationally hard. We construct two holographic quantum algorithms to formalize this. For entropy differences of order N, we show that measuring Ryu-Takayanagi geodesic lengths via heavy-field two-point functions needs exponentially many measurements in N, even when the boundary state is efficiently preparable. For order one corrections, we show that reconstructing the bulk covariance matrix and extracting entropy requires exponential time in N. Although these tasks are computationally intractable, we compare their efficiency with the Block Korkine-Zolotarev lattice reduction algorithm for LWE. Our results reconcile the tension with QECTT, showing that holographic entropy remains consistent with quantum computational limits without requiring an intractable holographic dictionary, and provide new insights into the quantum cryptanalysis of lattice-based cryptography.

Title: Interfacing of an Optical Nanofiber with Tunably Spaced Atoms in an Optical Lattice
Authors: Hyok Sang Han, Ahreum Lee, Sarthak Subhankar, Fredrik K. Fatemi, S. L. Rolston
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate efficient interfacing of a large number of atoms to an optical nanofiber using an optical lattice with tunable spacing ($0.88-1.5~\mu$m) [1] projected onto the nanofiber. The lattice beam and reflections from the nanofiber yield trap potentials that provide tight confinement in all motional degrees of freedom $\approx 220$ nm above the nanofiber surface, enabling efficient atom-photon coupling. We achieved trapping of $\approx1300$ atoms in periodic trap sites with a trap lifetime of $\approx15$ ms. We also observe the effect of varied lattice period on the atomic motional frequencies. Our new scheme is adaptable to other nanophotonic cold-atom systems and provides a versatile and scalable platform for studying photon-mediated long-range collective interactions. Our tunable lattice-nanofiber system could be seamlessly integrated with optical tweezers, allowing both the scalable atom-photon interface and individual single-atom access, and its intrinsic connectivity to conventional fiber provides a significant advantage towards quantum networks.

Title: From statistical dependence to the space of possible superdeterministic theories
Authors: Mordecai Waegell, Kelvin J. McQueen
Abstract: Bell's theorem demonstrates that any physical theory that is consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, and which satisfies some apparently innocuous assumptions, must violate the principle of local causality. It may therefore be possible to maintain local causality by rejecting one of these other assumptions instead. One possibility that has recently received significant attention involves rejecting the principle of statistical independence (SI). In this paper, we consider the frequency interpretation of SI, which states that $\rho(\lambda) \approx \rho(\lambda | Z)$, where $\rho(\lambda)$ is the relative frequency of an element of an ensemble being in the state $\lambda$, and $Z$ is a label that separates the ensemble into apparently randomly selected sub-ensembles. SI is violated when the sub-ensemble frequency $\rho(\lambda | Z)$ fails to be representative of the ensemble frequency $\rho(\lambda)$. We argue that physical theories that systematically violate SI should all be understood as superdeterministic. This perspective on SI sheds light on a number of issues that are being debated in the superdeterminism literature, especially concerning its scope and philosophical consequences. Regarding scope, we argue that superdeterministic theories fall into three categories, deterministic theories with fine-tuned initial conditions, fluke theories, and nomic exclusion theories. We also argue that retrocausal and invariant set theories need not violate SI, which is contrary to how they are normally presented. Regarding philosophical implications, we argue that superdeterminism is incompatible with free will according to some prominent compatibilist accounts. We also argue that although superdeterminism is conspiratorial, it is not unscientific, but pre-scientific.

Title: Tracking Quantum State Collapse/Decoherence in Real Time via a Superposition Trap
Authors: Hardeep Singh, Tim Kovachy
Abstract: We propose a novel method for probing quantum state collapse and decoherence in real time using a mechanism we term the superposition trap. This approach exploits the continuity equation in quantum mechanics to engineer a configuration that spatially confines only coherent superpositions, while allowing decohered or collapsed states to escape. By monitoring this leakage, the dynamics of collapse processes-whether environmentally induced or intrinsic to objective collapse models-can be experimentally accessed without disturbing the coherent evolution itself. We outline a concrete implementation using an atom interferometer with strontium atoms, where internal-state-selective operations enable physical separation of collapsed components. This technique offers a new experimental avenue to test collapse models, measure decoherence rates, and investigate the quantum-to-classical transition.

Title: U-generating system dynamics with a product state using local operations
Authors: Daniel Dilley, Alvin Gonzales, Jeffrey Larson, Mark Byrd
Abstract: A quantum system may undergo undesired dynamics if it is already correlated with its environment before global unitary evolution takes place. To mitigate these effects, we apply local operations on the system of interest prior to the global evolution. This ensures that a specific dynamics-matching condition is satisfied - namely, that the system's dynamics can be U-generated starting from an initial product state. We review two strategies for achieving this: local measurements and local unitaries. For each, we outline their respective advantages and disadvantages and provide examples illustrating when the dynamics-matching condition can be satisfied. Since most operations inevitably alter the system's initial state, we optimize the fidelity between the original system state and the post-operation state, ensuring the condition can be met with minimal perturbation. Local measurements always guarantee that the system dynamics can be U-generated from a product state, but this comes at the cost of reduced fidelity. By contrast, local unitary transformations typically avoid this loss of fidelity: in our numerical study of 402 cases, they succeeded in nearly all instances, with a minimum fidelity of about 94.2%. We further strengthen these results by showing that a single unitary operation can prevent all non-completely positive quantum dynamics for a system and environment undergoing time-dependent global evolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that a general two-term Kraus channel - implementable with the addition of just one qubit - can raise all fidelities to 1 across the 402 cases, while still ensuring that the dynamics-matching condition is satisfied.

Title: Leveraging Quantum Computing For Recourse-Based Energy Management Under PV Generation Uncertainty
Authors: Daniel Müssig, Mustafa Musab, Markus Wappler, Jörg Lässig
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources, particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems and electric vehicles (EVs), introduces significant uncertainty and complexity into modern energy systems. This paper explores a novel approach to address these challenges by formulating a stochastic optimization problem that models the uncertain nature of PV power generation and the flexibility of bi-directional EV charging. The problem is structured as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse, enabling the system to make optimal day-ahead decisions while incorporating corrective actions in real time based on actual PV output and EV availability. Leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing, we implement and solve the stochastic model using quantum algorithms, demonstrating the potential of quantum-enhanced optimization for high-dimensional and uncertainty-driven energy management problems. Our results indicate that quantum computing can provide efficient and scalable solutions for complex recourse problems in smart grid applications, particularly when integrating variable renewable generation and flexible demand resources.

Title: Room-temperature quantum entanglement in a van der Waals material
Authors: Xingyu Gao, Zhun Ge, Saakshi Dikshit, Sumukh Vaidya, Peng Ju, Tongcang Li
Abstract: Entanglement is central to quantum science and technology. Atomic defects in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exciting prospects for quantum sensing, with spatial resolution reaching 1 nm demonstrated using scanning probe techniques. However, entangling qubits in vdW materials remains elusive. Here we report room-temperature quantum entanglement between an optically addressable electron spin and a strongly coupled $^{13}$C nuclear spin in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We extend the electron spin coherence to 38 $\mu$s with dynamical decoupling, and create maximally entangled Bell states with a fidelity up to 0.89. We further use the nuclear spin as a long-lived quantum memory to enhance AC magnetic field sensing via correlation spectroscopy. These results establish entangled spin qubits in hBN as a robust platform for advanced quantum technologies based on 2D materials.

Title: Ultra-narrow homogeneous linewidths of erbium-doped silica glass fibers at millikelvin temperatures: magnetic field and temperature dependence
Authors: Farhad Rasekh, Nasser Gohari Kamel, Mahdi Bornadel, Sourabh Kumar, Erhan Saglamyurek, Christoph Simon, Daniel Oblak
Abstract: Erbium-doped solids are promising candidates for fiber-based quantum networks due to their emission wavelength, which aligns with the telecom band over which optical fibers exhibit minimal loss. Among these, erbium-doped silica fiber (EDF) stands out for its availability, ease of use, and seamless integration with existing fiber-optic infrastructure. In this work, using the two-pulse photon-echo (2PPE) technique, we measured the homogeneous linewidth of the 4I13/2 <-> 4I15/2 optical transition under varying magnetic fields and temperatures. We observed an effective homogeneous linewidth of approximately 8 kHz at approximately 7mK at an optimal magnetic field of 0.09 T, representing over two orders of magnitude improvement compared to earlier reports measured at T = 700 mK. We also present a comprehensive model for the combined magnetic field and temperature dependency of the effective homogeneous linewidth. Additionally, we employed three-pulse photon-echo (3PPE) measurements to investigate spectral diffusion and decoherence processes, and conclude that Two-Level System (TLS) effects are significantly suppressed at sufficiently low temperatures, below approximately 100 mK.

Title: INTRODUCTION AUX SYSTEMES QUANTIQUES NON-HERMITIQUES: PT-symétrie et pseudo Hermiticité
Authors: Maamache Mustapha
Abstract: In recent decades, an important shift has taken place with the growing role of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. What makes this framework remarkable is that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonians involved can still be real, just as in the Hermitian case. Before turning to non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, we will first review some basic ideas and mathematical tools from the standard Hermitian formulation. This review is intended as a survey: most results will be stated without proof and without going into detailed discussion.

Title: Anticoherent $k$-planes and coding techniques for a 3-qubit scheme of universal quantum computing
Authors: L. Aragón-Muñoz, C. Chryssomalakos, A. G. Flores-Delgado, V. Rascón-Barajas, I. Vázquez Mota
Abstract: Toponomic quantum computing (TQC) employs rotation sequences of anticoherent $k$-planes to construct noise-tolerant quantum gates. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of generalized Toffoli gates, using $k$-planes of spin systems with $s \geq k + 1$, and of the Hadamard gate for a 3-qubit system, using a spin $s \!= \! 15$ 8-plane. We propose a universal quantum computing scheme for 3-qubit systems (via Hadamard + Toffoli gates) based on coding techniques. A key advantage of this construction is its inherent robustness against noise: apart from reparametrization invariance, our scheme is characterized by immunity to arbitrarily large deformations of the path in (rotational) parameter space.

Title: Ultrafast Single-Qubit Gates in the Diabatic Regime
Authors: Deniz Türkpençe, Selçuk Çakmak
Abstract: Logic gates in superconducting quantum processors are implemented through precise quantum control techniques in the microwave regime. The choice of drive frequency and other control parameters directly determines the duration of quantum gate operations. Because current devices remain too noisy to reach fault tolerance, reducing gate durations, and thereby the overall circuit depth, is of critical importance. In this work, we present a model of single qubit gate execution in both the adiabatic regime, where the rotating wave approximation (RWA) is valid, and the diabatic regime, where the RWA no longer applies. Using parameters representative of superconducting qubits, we investigate how gates can be driven at durations well below conventional timescales, and we examine the associated limitations, performance trade offs. The results demonstrate that ultrashort control pulses in the diabatic regime can achieve fidelities comparable to those obtained under standard RWA conditions, offering a possible route to faster quantum logic without sacrificing accuracy under idealized conditions.

Title: Bayesian and geometric analyses of power spectral densities of spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantum dot devices
Authors: Yujun Choi (1), Hruday Mallubhotla (2), Mark Friesen (2), Susan N. Coppersmith (3), Robert Joynt (2) ((1) Virginia Tech, (2) University of Wisconsin-Madison, (3) University of New South Wales)
Abstract: Charge noise with a power-law spectrum poses a significant challenge to high-fidelity operation of spin qubits in semiconductor devices. Recently, considerable experimental work characterized this noise using qubits as spectrometers. It apparently arises from a collection of two-level fluctuating electric dipole systems (TLS). This suggests using the data to infer the positions, orientations, and other physical characteristics of the TLS. We identify a fundamental difficulty in this program: the inference of the TLS parameters is strongly undetermined, since the quantity of data is not sufficient to fix them uniquely. We describe two approaches to deal with this situation. The first approach is a qualitative method based on analytic calculations and simulations of small model systems that recognizes certain patterns. The second approach, more appropriate for detailed data analysis, is a Bayesian computation that assigns probabilities to candidate dipole configurations. We propose that the Brier score, a measure of confidence in the probabilities, can be used as a quantitative tool to judge the efficacy of experimental noise-measurement setups. Together, the analytical and computational Bayesian methods constrain, but do not fix, the density, the positions, the orientations, and the strengths of the dipole noise sources.

Title: Scrambling-Enhanced Quantum Battery Charging in Black Hole Analogues
Authors: Zhilong Liu, Ying Li, Zehua Tian, Jieci Wang
Abstract: Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, we explore how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches of preset scrambling parameters. Our analysis reveals that the intentionally engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters could significantly enhance both maximum stored energy $E_{\max}$ and peak charging power $P_{\max}$ in the quench charging protocol. The optimal charging time $\tau_*$ exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon parameter $x_{h0}$, while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench horizon parameter $x_{ht}$. This temporal compression confines high-power operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling $x_{ht} > x_{h0}$, demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling dynamics.

Title: Low-Overhead and High-Fidelity Preparation of Logical Non-Clifford States with Multi-Level Transversal Injection
Authors: Jiaxuan Zhang, Tian-Hao Wei, Xi-Ning Zhuang, Zhao-Yun Chen, Wei-Cheng Kong, Yu-Chun Wu, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: Rotation gates are widely used in various quantum algorithms. To implement fault-tolerant rotation gates, state distillation or gate synthesis is typically employed. However, the overhead of these schemes scales rapidly with increasing Clifford hierarchy levels and required fidelity, limiting their use in large-scale quantum algorithms. In this letter, we propose a method termed multi-level transversal injection (MLTI) for preparing rotation states at arbitrary Clifford hierarchy levels, which achieves high fidelity while significantly reducing overhead compared to previous methods. Unlike the linear cost scaling of state distillation, the overhead of MLTI drops with Clifford hierarchy levels and then plateaus at higher levels, slashing the required space-time volume by up to several orders of magnitude. Additionally, we introduce a method for eliminating the off-diagonal terms of rotation states without extra overhead, unifying the metrics of infidelity and trace distance. These results render the overhead for high-precision rotation gates no longer prohibitive, and thus bring the broad adoption of large-scale quantum algorithms a critical step closer to reality.

Title: Quantum Resonance Beyond Direct Measurement: Insights from Weak Measurement
Authors: Daiki Ueda, Izumi Tsutsui
Abstract: Aharonov's weak value amplification realized via weak measurement provides a versatile means to measure physical parameters with high accuracy, similar to quantum resonance epitomized by the Rabi and Ramsey resonances. The similarity between the two is not accidental: in fact, these two methods of precision measurement have recently been shown to be interconnected for the particular case of direct weak measurement. Here we show that this connection also holds in the case of indirect weak measurement, which is the standard scheme used mostly for studies of weak value amplification. We present a unified framework of weak measurements in which direct measurement appears as a special case of indirect measurement. This allows us to compare the measurement precision of different methods on a common basis, as demonstrated explicitly for the Rabi and Ramsey resonances, showing how the precision of the latter surpasses that of the former in the context of weak value amplification.

Abstract: We propose an atom beam splitter that enables the manipulation of the internal spin state of the atoms in the output beams using a spin-dependent optical potential. The utility of such an atom beam splitter is demonstrated through its application in measuring the Aharonov-Casher phase of atoms subjected to a constant homogeneous electric field, thereby enabling measurement of the electric field strength.

Title: Non-Abelian interference of topological edge states
Authors: Shi Hu, Meiqing Hu, Zhoutao Lei
Abstract: Topological boundary states exhibit distinctive properties, including unidirectional propagation and noise robustness, which hold significant potential for advancing the performance of quantum science and technology. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of non-Abelian quantum interference and entanglement generation, protected by dual symmetries (time-independent inversion and time-dependent interchain), in coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. Specifically, in a multi-chain system, we first achieve tunable topological transfer of a single particle, where the destination chain is selected by the braiding sequence. We then extend this to two particles, observing a non-Abelian Hong-Ou-Mandel interference that generates spatially entangled NOON states whose properties are dictated by the braiding order. Our work establishes an alternative pathway for exploring non-Abelian topology applied to quantum science and technology, enabled by the unique protection of time-dependent symmetry.

Title: Mode Selection in Quantum Nonlinear Optics Using Optical Resonators
Authors: Xin Chen
Abstract: Nonlinear optics underpins quantum photonics by enabling the generation and control of quantum states of light. We present new applications of optical resonators as mode selectors in nonlinear processes. First, we show that cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion can generate spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs with improved decorrelation and wavelength flexibility. Second, we demonstrate that a cavity-assisted sum-frequency generation process realizes a quantum pulse gate with high-resolution temporal-mode selectivity and precise spectral control. Our theoretical framework provides a general methodology for analyzing cavity-enhanced nonlinear processes and highlights the versatility of optical resonators as powerful tools for engineering quantum light.

Title: Fractional Control Gate Protocols For Quantum Engines
Authors: Elliot John Fox, Taysa Mendes de Mendonça, Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler, Irene D'Amico
Abstract: Nth-root gates allow for a paced application of two-qubit operations. We apply them in quantum thermodynamic protocols for operating a quantum heat engine. A set of circuits for two and three qubits are compared by considering maximum work production and related efficiency. Our results show that for all circuits considered and most regions of initial parameter space, quantum coherence of one of the qubits strongly increases the maximum work production and improves the system's performance as a quantum heat engine. In such circuits, coherence is initially imprinted into one of the qubits, improving the overall maximum extractable work. Work gets generated with 84% to 100% efficiency. Further, we uncover a strong linear correlation between work production and many-body correlations in the working medium generated by these gates.

Title: Exponential Advantage from One More Replica in Estimating Nonlinear Properties of Quantum States
Authors: Qi Ye, Zhenhuan Liu, Dong-Ling Deng
Abstract: Inferring nonlinear features of quantum states is fundamentally important across quantum information science, but remains challenging due to the intrinsic linearity of quantum mechanics. It is widely recognized that quantum memory and coherent operations help avoid exponential sample complexity, by mapping nonlinear properties onto linear observables over multiple copies of the target state. In this work, we prove that such a conversion is not only sufficient but also necessary. Specifically, we prove that the estimation of $\mathrm{tr}(\rho^{k} O)$ for a broad class of observables $O$ is exponentially hard for any protocol restricted to $(k-1)$-replica joint measurements, whereas access to one additional replica reduces the complexity to a constant. These results establish, for the first time, an exponential separation between $(k-1)$- and $k$-replica protocols for any integer $k>2$, thereby introducing a fine-grained hierarchy of replica-based quantum advantage and resolving an open question in the literature. The technical core is a general indistinguishability principle showing that any ensemble constructed from large Haar random states via tensor products and mixtures is hard to distinguish from its average. Leveraging this principle, we further prove that $k$-replica joint measurements are also necessary for distinguishing rank-$k$ density matrices from rank-$(k-1)$ ones. Overall, our work delineates sharp boundaries on the power of joint measurements, highlighting resource--complexity trade-offs in quantum learning theory and deepening the understanding of quantum mechanics' intrinsic linearity.

Title: The Aharonov-Casher theorem on a line
Authors: Lucas Sourrouille
Abstract: In this note, we care to study the degeneracy of the zero modes for a spin-$1/2$ charged particle in a one-dimensional space. We analyze the arguments proposed by Aharonov and Casher in a two-dimensional space. In two dimensions the zero energy states are constructed in terms on a scalar potential $\lambda(x,y)$, which is uniquely determined. We show that in one dimension it is possible the existence of an infinite family of the scalar potentials. This family is determined by a quantum number $k$, which is restricted by the relation $|k| < \frac{1}{2} \int dx B(x)$, where $B(x)$ is a scalar field localized in a restricted region of the space. This implies that the degeneracy of the zero energy states is infinite, which contrasts with the two dimensional case in which the degeneracy is finite. Finally we apply our results to a two dimensional case in which magnetic field have a translational symmetry along a direction.

Title: Genuine multipartite entanglement detection with mutually unbiased bases (MUBs)
Authors: Sumit Nandi
Abstract: In the present paper, a novel framework to detect genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) has been presented by computing correlations in mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). It has been shown that correlation obtained by measuring in MUBs of all biseparable multipartite states satisfy a bound, whereas GME states violate it. Thus, the presented framework turns out to be a sufficient criterion to detect entanglement in many body scenario. The methodology paves a suitable way to demonstrate certification of different classes of tripartite and quadripartite GME states. In addition to its operational universality, correlation obtained by measuring in MUBs is shown to be juxtaposed with few well known genuine tripartite and quadripartite entanglement measures.

Title: Path Integral Quantum Control for Quantum Chemistry Applications
Authors: Peyman Najafi, Aarón Villanueva, Hilbert Kappen
Abstract: The Path integral Quantum Control (PiQC) algorithm was recently introduced by Villanueva et al. (2025) as a new approach for computing optimal controls in open and closed quantum systems. Originally proposed for pulse-based quantum control, PiQC estimates optimal controls through global averages over quantum trajectories. In this work, we adapt the PiQC algorithm to optimize parametrized quantum circuits by showing that the quantum circuit can be randomized using a continuous dynamics governed by a stochastic Schrödinger equation that is compatible with the path integral control framework. In this adaptation, the circuit parameters become the controls to be optimized within PiQC. We refer to this instance of PiQC as the Gate-based PiQC (GB-PiQC) algorithm. We apply GB-PiQC for ground state preparation of electronic structure problems. We benchmark the gate-based and pulse-based versions of PiQC against the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which is optimized using the common Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) optimizer, on a set of standard molecular Hamiltonians: H2, LiH, BeH2, and H4, mapped to 2-, 4-, 6-, and 6-qubit systems, respectively. For each molecule, the benchmark is implemented at different bond distances, after performing a hyperparameter tuning of each algorithm at a fixed bond distance near the equilibrium geometry. We find that both PiQC algorithms exhibit greater robustness than SPSA to variations in the target Hamiltonian induced by changes in molecular bond distances. Furthermore, PiQC algorithms also achieve superior performance compared to SPSA in most instances, particularly at stretched bond lengths, where the Hartree-Fock solution becomes less accurate and its error grows relative to equilibrium.

Title: Comparison of Hyperplane Rounding for Max-Cut and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm over Certain Regular Graph Families
Authors: Reuben Tate, Swati Gupta
Abstract: There is a strong interest in finding challenging instances of NP-hard problems, from the perspective of showing quantum advantage. Due to the limits of near-term NISQ devices, it is moreover useful if these instances are small. In this work, we identify two graph families ($|V|<1000$) on which the Goemans-Williamson algorithm for approximating the Max-Cut achieves at most a 0.912-approximation. We further show that, in comparison, a recent quantum algorithm, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (depth $p=1$), is a 0.592-approximation on Karloff instances in the limit ($n \to \infty$), and is at best a $0.894$-approximation on a family of strongly-regular graphs. We further explore construction of challenging instances computationally by perturbing edge weights, which may be of independent interest, and include these in the CI-QuBe github repository.

Title: Hyperbolic Floquet code with graph-edge syndromes
Authors: Hideyuki Ozawa, Isamu Kudo, Yuki Takeuchi, Tsuyoshi Yoshida
Abstract: Quantum error correction would be a primitive for demonstrating quantum advantage in a realistic noisy environment. Floquet codes are a class of dynamically generated, stabilizer-based codes in which low-weight parity measurements are applied in a time-periodic schedule. Furthermore, for several Floquet codes, the encoding rate becomes finite even for an infinitely large qubit number. However, despite these advantageous properties, existing Floquet codes require handling more intricate, often hypergraph-structured syndromes from the decoding perspective, which makes decoding comparatively demanding. We give a concrete method for solving this issue by proposing hyperbolic color Floquet (HCF) code. To this end, we simultaneously take advantage of hyperbolic Floquet and Floquet color codes. Parity measurements in our code consist of the repetitions of six-step measurements on (semi-)hyperbolic three-colorable tilings. Since each step just measures $X \otimes X$ or $Z \otimes Z$, our code on the regular $\{8,3\}$ lattice has the following three advantages: (i) parity measurements are weight-2, (ii) for the numbers $k$ and $n$ of logical and physical qubits, respectively, the encoding rate is finite, i.e., $\lim_{n \to \infty} k/n = 1/8$, and (iii) the code distance is proportional to $\log n$. From the above property, each single-fault event generally affects at most two detectors, which implies ``graph-edge'' syndromes, and hence decoding with a minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder is efficient and virtually scales near-linearly in the number of physical qubits $n$. This is a stark contrast to several known Floquet codes because their parity measurements repeat the measurements of $X\!\otimes\!X$, $Y\!\otimes\!Y$, and $Z\!\otimes\!Z$, and thus the syndromes are represented as a hypergraph, which basically requires decoders with longer decoding time.

Title: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of higher-form non-invertible symmetries in Kitaev's quantum double model
Authors: Zijian Song, Jian-Hao Zhang
Abstract: Topological orders can be understood as spontaneous symmetry breaking of higher-form symmetries. In the non-Abelian case, the broken higher-form symmetries are notably non-invertible. In this work, we extend this framework to mixed states, where symmetries can be either strong or weak. In particular, we investigate the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) of non-invertible higher-form symmetries in non-Abelian Kitaev's quantum double models under decoherence. We further show that the resulting decohered quantum double mixed states form a locally indistinguishable set, which also constitutes an information convex set. Importantly, we emphasize that the dimension of this convex set equals the ground-state degeneracy of the corresponding pure state, highlighting that the quantum information encoded in the ground-state subspace is degraded into classical information captured by the convex set of decohered density matrices.

Title: Non-Gaussian Quantum State Engineering with Postselected von Neumann Measurements
Authors: Xiao-Xi Yao, Yusuf Turek
Abstract: We introduce a feasible protocol for generating non-Gaussian (nG) states via postselected von Neumann measurement for continuous-variable quantum information processing. The method uses a two-level system coupled to a Gaussian pointer state through an observable $A$ with $A^{2}=\mathbb{I}$. By operating beyond the weak-coupling regime and selecting different pointer states -- squeezed, coherent, or vacuum -- allows generation of a wide range of nG states, including squeezed cat states, two-mode entangled cat states, approximate Bell states, and a continuum of intermediate nG states with considerable success probabilities. The properties of these states are widely tunable via the postselection-induced weak value and the measurement interaction strength. We characterize the non-Gaussianity via Wigner function negativities and quantify entanglement using linear entropy and concurrence. The protocol offers a scalable route to high-purity nG state engineering.

Title: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: Performance on Simulators and Quantum Hardware
Authors: Abyan Khabir Irfan, Chansu Yu
Abstract: Running quantum circuits on quantum computers does not always generate "clean" results, unlike on a simulator, as noise plays a significant role in any quantum device. To explore this, we experimented with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on quantum simulators and real quantum hardware. QAOA is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and requires hundreds or thousands of independent executions of the quantum circuit for optimization, which typically goes beyond the publicly available resources for quantum computing. We were granted access to the IBM Quantum System One at the Cleveland Clinic, the first on-premises IBM system in the U.S. This paper explores different optimization methods, techniques, error mitigation methods, and QAOA variants to observe how they react to quantum noise differently, which is helpful for other researchers to understand the complexities of running QAOA on real quantum hardware and the challenges faced in dealing with noise.

Title: Continuous Wave Quantum Detection and Ranging with quantum heterodyne dectction
Authors: Ming-Da Huang, Zhan-Feng Jiang, M. Hunza, Long-Yang Cao, Hong-Yi Chen, Yuan-Feng Wang, Yuan-Yuan Zhao, Hai-Dong Yuan, Qi Qin
Abstract: In the continuous-wave Detection and Ranging technology, simultaneous and accurate range and velocity measurements of an unknown target are typically achieved using a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) with a heterodyne receiver. The high time-bandwidth product of the FMCW waveform facilitates the optimization and high-precision of these measurements while maintaining low transmission power. Despite recent efforts to develop the quantum counterpart of this technology, a quantum protocol for FMCW that enhances measurement precision in lossy channels with background noise has yet to be established. Here, we propose a quantum illumination protocol for FMCW technology that utilizes sum frequency generation and an entangled light source with low transmission power. This protocol demonstrates a 3 dB enhancement in the precision limit for high-loss channels compared to classical approaches, independent of the background noise level. This precision limit is achieved through quantum heterodyne detection (QHD), followed by signal processing. Moreover, in classical approaches, QHD is only optimal in high-loss channels when strong background noise is present. In weak background noise scenarios, our protocol can further provides precision enhancements up to 6 dB over classical methods with QHD.

Title: Probabilistic Graybox Characterization of Quantum Devices with Bayesian Neural Networks
Authors: Poramet Pathumsoot, Michal Hajdušek, Rodney Van Meter
Abstract: While the Graybox characterization method allows for implicit noise models and is platform-agnostic, the method lacks uncertainty quantification. Characterization of quantum devices is a crucial process that enables researchers to gain insight from experimental settings. Graybox characterization combines known system dynamics with unknown transformations, where the latter is modeled using machine learning. Prediction uncertainty helps researchers make informed decisions. It allows valuable insights from the devices without overconfidence. We therefore develop a probabilistic Graybox characterization model using probabilistic machine learning, specifically Bayesian Neural Networks, and utilize binary measurement outcomes directly for inference. With stochastic noise in a quantum device, we analyze statistical properties of the measurement data. Our results show that the model's prediction performance solely depends on its ability to capture the expected value of the true expectation value. Our proposed probabilistic Graybox model outperforms the original model by up to 1.9 times in capturing the distribution of observed data. We expect that our results will serve as an additional tool for characterizing quantum devices with uncertainty estimation, as they provide a flexible choice that can be utilized even without extensive prior knowledge of the noise model of the devices.

Title: Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system
Authors: Gang Liu, Gen Li, Rong-Can Yang, Wei Xiong, Jie Li
Abstract: Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.

Title: SQuaD: Smart Quantum Detection for Photon Recognition and Dark Count Elimination
Authors: Karl C. Linne (Kai Li), Sho Uemura, Yue Ji, Andrew Karmen, Allen Zang, Alex Kolar, Martin Di Federico, Orlando Quaranta, Gustavo Cancelo, Tian Zhong
Abstract: Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.

Title: Two bases suffice for QMA1-completeness
Authors: Henry Ma, Anand Natarajan
Abstract: We introduce a basis-restricted variant of the Quantum-k-SAT problem, in which each term in the input Hamiltonian is required to be diagonal in either the standard or Hadamard basis. Our main result is that the Quantum-6-SAT problem with this basis restriction is already QMA1-complete, defined with respect to a natural gateset. Our construction is based on the Feynman-Kitaev circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction, with a modified clock encoding that interleaves two clocks in the standard and Hadamard bases. In light of the central role played by CSS codes and the uncertainty principle in the proof of the NLTS theorem of Anshu, Breuckmann, and Nirkhe (STOC '23), we hope that the CSS-like structure of our Hamiltonians will make them useful for progress towards a quantum PCP theorem.

Heyrovský Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Dolejškova 2155/3, 182 23 Prague 8, Czech Republic)
Abstract: We present a technical guide to developing a quantum-mechanical system with co-trapped laser-cooled ions and electrons, aiming to utilize this mixed-species system in quantum computing and sensing. We outline a method to control the system's quantum state and provide a blueprint for a forward-compatible design for containing it. The proposed technical solution features a planar configuration with a large trapping volume located at a considerable height above the electrode plane. We detail a manufacturing method using copper-coated, laser-machined glass substrates suitable for a high-power microwave drive signal. We discuss electron state decoherence in this trap and suggest that using superconductive films could enhance trapping abilities, though initial experiments are feasible with the current design.

Title: Orchestrating multi-level magic state distillation: a dynamic pipeline architecture
Authors: Junshi Wang (1), Prakash Murali (1) ((1) University of Cambridge)
Abstract: Practical quantum computation requires high-fidelity instruction executions on qubits. Among them, Clifford instructions are relatively easy to perform, while non-Clifford instructions require the use of magic states. This makes magic state distillation a central procedure in fault-tolerant quantum computing. A magic state distillation factory consumes many low-fidelity input magic states and produces fewer, higher-fidelity states. To reach high fidelities, multiple distillation factories are typically chained together into a multi-level pipeline, consuming significant quantum computational resources. Our work optimizes the resource usage of distillation pipelines by introducing a novel dynamic pipeline architecture. Observing that distillation pipelines consume magic states in a burst-then-steady pattern, we develop dynamic factory scheduling and resource allocation techniques that go beyond existing static pipeline organizations. Dynamic pipelines reduce the qubit cost by 16%-70% for large-scale quantum applications and achieve average reductions of 26%-37% in qubit-time volume on generated distillation benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art static architectures. By significantly reducing the resource overhead of this building block, our work accelerates progress towards the practical realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Title: Q-REACH: Quantum information Repetition, Error Analysis and Correction using Caching Network
Authors: Karl C. Linne (Kai Li), Yuanyuan Li, Debashri Roy, Kaushik Chowdhury
Abstract: Quantum repeaters incorporating quantum memory play a pivotal role in mitigating loss in transmitted quantum information (photons) due to link attenuation over a long-distance quantum communication network. However, limited availability of available storage in such quantum repeaters and the impact on the time spent within the memory unit presents a trade-off between quantum information fidelity (a metric that quantifies the degree of similarity between a pair of quantum states) and qubit transmission rate. Thus, effective management of storage time for qubits becomes a key consideration in multi-hop quantum networks. To address these challenges, we propose Q-REACH, which leverages queuing theory in caching networks to tune qubit transmission rate while considering fidelity as the cost metric. Our contributions in this work include (i) utilizing a method of repetition that encodes and broadcasts multiple qubits through different quantum paths, (ii) analytically estimating the time spent by these emitted qubits as a function of the number of paths and repeaters, as well as memory units within a repeater, and (iii) formulating optimization problem that leverages this analysis to correct the transmitted logic qubit and select the optimum repetition rate at the transmitter.

Title: Nonclassical phonon pair
Authors: Yu Wang, Zhen Shen, Mai Zhang, Zhi-Peng Shi, Hong-Yi Kuang, Shuai Wan, Fang-Wen Sun, Guang-Can Guo, Chun-Hua Dong
Abstract: Quantum-correlated photon pairs are crucial resources for modern quantum information science. Similarly, the reliable generation of nonclassical phonon pairs is vital for advancing engineerable solid-state quantum devices and hybrid quantum networks based on phonons. Here, we present a novel approach to generate quantum-correlated phonon pairs in a suspended silicon microstructure initialized in its motional ground state. By simultaneously implementing red- and blue-detuned laser pulses, equivalent high-order optomechanical nonlinearity--specifically, an effective optomechanical four-wave mixing process--is achieved for generating a nonclassical phonon pair, which is then read out via a subsequent red-detuned pulse. We demonstrate the nonclassical nature of the generated phonon pair through the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Our experimentally observed phonon pair violates the classical bound by more than 5 standard deviations and maintains a decoherence time of 132 ns. This work reveals novel quantum manipulation of phonon states enabled by equivalent high-order optomechanical nonlinearity within a pulse scheme and provides a valuable quantum resource for mechanical quantum computing.

Title: Pseudorandom Unitaries in the Haar Random Oracle Model
Authors: Prabhanjan Ananth, John Bostanci, Aditya Gulati, Yao-Ting Lin
Abstract: The quantum Haar random oracle model is an idealized model where every party has access to a single Haar random unitary and its inverse. We construct strong pseudorandom unitaries in the quantum Haar random oracle model. This strictly improves upon prior works who either only prove the existence of pseudorandom unitaries in the inverseless quantum Haar random oracle model [Ananth, Bostanci, Gulati, Lin, EUROCRYPT 2025] or prove the existence of a weaker notion (implied by strong pseudorandom unitaries) in the quantum Haar random oracle model [Hhan, Yamada, 2024]. Our results also present a viable approach for building quantum pseudorandomness from random quantum circuits and analyzing pseudorandom objects in nature.

Title: Quantum Zeno Effect in the Spatial Evolution of a Single Atom

Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect (QZE) reveals that frequent measurements can suppress quantum evolution, but the detailed dynamics of the system under finite-duration measurements in experiments remain insufficiently explored. Here, we employ an optical dipole trap as a projective measurement to study the motion of a single cold atom in free space. By monitoring atomic loss, we directly observe the QZE in single-atom motion in free space and find that the effect of dipole measurements on the atom comprises a short-time collapse followed by subsequent periodic unitary evolution, thereby providing an intuitive physical picture of measurement backaction across different timescales. We further investigate the effects of measurement frequency, strength, and spatial position, demonstrating that measurements not only suppress the spreading of quantum states but also enable deterministic preparation of distinct motional states. Furthermore, by dynamically controlling the measurement position, we achieve measurement-induced directional transport of a single atom without imparting additional momentum. Our results provide a direct experimental demonstration of the QZE in real space and establish a versatile framework for measurement-based control of atomic motion, paving the way for motional-state engineering in cold-atom platforms.

Title: On the Limitations of Pseudorandom Unitaries
Authors: Prabhanjan Ananth, Aditya Gulati, Yao-Ting Lin
Abstract: Pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), one of the key quantum pseudorandom notions, are efficiently computable unitaries that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar random unitaries. While there is evidence to believe that PRUs are weaker than one-way functions, so far its relationship with other quantum cryptographic primitives (that are plausibly weaker than one-way functions) has not been fully established. In this work, we focus on quantum cryptographic primitives with classical communication, referred to as QCCC primitives. Our main result shows that QCCC bit commitments and QCCC key agreement, cannot be constructed from pseudorandom unitaries in a black-box manner. Our core technical contribution is to show (in a variety of settings) the difficulty of distinguishing identical versus independent Haar unitaries by separable channels. Our result strictly improves upon prior works which studied similar problems in the context of learning theory [Anshu, Landau, Liu, STOC 2022] and cryptography [Ananth, Gulati, Lin, TCC 2024].

Title: An operator-Weyl-symbol approach to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
Authors: Xiao Wang, Wen-ge Wang
Abstract: In this letter, by an approach that employs Weyl symbols for operators, a semiclassical theory is developed for the offdiagonal function in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which is for offdiagonal elements $\langle{E_i}\left|O\right|{E_j}\rangle$ of an observable $O$ on the energy basis. It is shown analytically that the matrix of $O$ has a banded structure, possessing a bandwidth $w_b$ that scales linearly with $\hbar$, a phase-space gradient of the classical Hamiltonian, $\langle\left|{\boldsymbol{\nabla }H_{\rm cl}}\right|\rangle$, and an $O$-dependent property. This predicts that the thermalization timescale of a quantum system may be inversely proportional to the phase-space gradient of the Hamiltonian, aligning with intuitions in classical thermalization. This approach also elucidates the origin of a $\rho_{\rm dos}^{-1/2}$-scaling of the offdiagonal function. The analytical predictions are checked numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.

Title: Generation of C-band entangled photon pairs by biexciton-exciton cascade from symmetric InAs/InP quantum dots
Authors: Anna Musiał, Maja Wasiluk, Katarzyna Roszak, Michał Gawełczyk, Wojciech Rudno-Rudziński, Paweł Wyborski, Johann P. Reithmaier, Mohamed Benyoucef, Grzegorz Sęk
Abstract: Hereby, we study the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons at telecom C-band by biexciton-exciton cascade from non-resonantly excited epitaxial InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). It is realized without external tuning of the fine structure splitting (FSS), which does not exceed 10 $\mu$eV in as-grown nanostructures, due to their high in-plane symmetry. Excitonic complexes are identified by means of excitation power-dependent and polarization-resolved magneto)microphotoluminescence. Their origin from different carrier configurations confined in the same QD is confirmed by time correlations of emitted photons. Experimental results are supported by 8-band kp calculations, followed by the configuration interaction method to include excitonic effects. This comparison reveals the structure of higher energy states, allowing for the reconstruction of the QD structural parameters. To verify and quantify the entanglement, we perform quantum state tomography and reconstruct the two-photon density matrix. Its diagonalization allows a detailed analysis of the entangled state and reveals an unfavourable interplay between phase accumulation and decoherence, pointing to a clear route for boosting entanglement by using a XX resonant, pulsed excitation scheme and shortening the radiative lifetimes.

Title: Measurement-induced phase transition in interacting bosons from most likely quantum trajectory
Authors: Anna Delmonte, Zejian Li, Rosario Fazio, Alessandro Romito
Abstract: We propose a new theoretical method to describe the monitored dynamics of bosonic many-body systems based on the concept of the most likely trajectory. We show how such trajectory can be identified from the probability distribution of quantum trajectories, i.e. measurement readouts, and how it successfully captures the monitored dynamics beyond the average state. We prove the method to be exact in the case of Gaussian theories and then extend it to the interacting Sine-Gordon model. Although no longer exact in this framework, the method captures the dynamics through a self-consistent time-dependent harmonic approximation and reveals an entanglement phase transition in the steady state from an area-law to a logarithmic-law scaling.

Title: Reducing Spatial and Temporal Dimensionality in the Multidimensional Caldeira-Leggett Model
Authors: Hongfei Zhan, Ernest W.Z. Pan, Zhenning Cai
Abstract: Focusing on the real-time dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the multidimensional Caldeira-Leggett model, several techniques are adopted in this paper to reduce the spatial and temporal dimensionality, combined into an efficient algorithm. From a spatial perspective, an equivalent formulation of the Dyson series is presented. With the aid of a low-rank approximation, the spatial dimensionality of open quantum system simulations is halved. From a temporal perspective, the frozen Gaussian approximation is used to approximate both the evolution operator and the interaction operator in the multidimensional Caldeira-Leggett model. This reduces the high-dimensional integrals to one- and two-dimensional integrals independent of the truncation level of the Dyson series. Through these techniques, we design an efficient algorithm whose validity is verified through several numerical experiments, including a two-dimensional double slit simulation.

Title: Broadband Magnetless Isolator using Adiabatic Flux Modulation
Authors: M. Demarets, A. M. Vadiraj, C. Caloz, K. De Greve
Abstract: Isolators are commonly found in the amplification chain of microwave setups to shield sensitive devices such as superconducting qubits from noise and back-scattered signals. Conventional ferrite-based isolators are bulky, lossy and rely on strong magnetic fields, which pose challenges for their co-integration in large-scale superconducting devices. Here, we present a magnetless isolator that overcomes these limitations with simulated performances on par with the state-of-the-art. Using a dispersion-engineered transmission line with a propagating adiabatic flux modulation, the simulated device achieves more than 20 dB isolation over a broad frequency band ranging from 4 to 8 GHz, which can be modified based on the device parameters. Moreover, we propose a compact, low-loss, on-chip superconducting device that shows promise against parameter variations and enables a scalable path for co-integration with large-scale superconducting systems of the future.

Title: Bandits roaming Hilbert space
Authors: Josep Lumbreras
Abstract: This thesis studies the exploration and exploitation trade-off in online learning of properties of quantum states using multi-armed bandits. Given streaming access to an unknown quantum state, in each round we select an observable from a set of actions to maximize its expectation value. Using past information, we refine actions to minimize regret; the cumulative gap between current reward and the maximum possible. We derive information-theoretic lower bounds and optimal strategies with matching upper bounds, showing regret typically scales as the square root of rounds. As an application, we reframe quantum state tomography to both learn the state efficiently and minimize measurement disturbance. For pure states and continuous actions, we achieve polylogarithmic regret using a sample-optimal algorithm based on a weighted online least squares estimator. The algorithm relies on the optimistic principle and controls the eigenvalues of the design matrix. We also apply our framework to quantum recommender systems and thermodynamic work extraction from unknown states. In this last setting, our results demonstrate an exponential advantage in work dissipation over tomography-based protocols.

Title: Non-positive measurements aren't beneficial in quantum metrology for unitary encoding, but can be for open schemes
Authors: Paranjoy Chaki, Debarupa Saha, Kornikar Sen, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: We investigate whether non-positive operator-valued measurements can be beneficial for quantum metrology. For unitary encoding, we show that non-positive measurements offer no advantage over positive ones. Going over to open encoding, we find, however, that non-positive measurements can be advantageous for certain cases, while it may mirror the unitary case - no advantage over positive measurements - for others. For arbitrary open-system encoding, we identify a sufficient condition under which positive measurements suffice to achieve the best precision, and more resource-intensive non-positive measurements offer no extra benefit.

Title: Information Loss and Cost in Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Javier Molina-Vilaplana, Germán Sierra, H.C. Zhang
Abstract: We develop an algebraic and information-theoretic framework to characterize symmetry breaking of generalized, non-invertible symmetries in two spatial dimensions. The reduction of symmetry is modeled within subfactor theory, where condensable Frobenius algebras play the role of subgroups in the categorical setting. This perspective naturally connects to the description of anyon condensation in topological phases of matter. Central to our approach are coarse-graining maps, or conditional expectations, which act as quantum channels projecting observables from a phase with higher symmetry onto one where the symmetry is partially or completely broken by condensation. By employing relative entropy as an entropic order parameter, we quantify the information loss induced by condensation and establish a universal bound governed by the Jones index, equal to the quantum dimension of the condensate. We illustrate the framework through explicit examples, including the toric code, abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the representation category Rep($S_3$), and show how dualities give rise to equivalence classes of condensation patterns. Our results forge new connections between operator algebras, tensor category theory, and quantum information in the study of generalized symmetries.

Title: Reconstructing Quantum States and Expectations via Dynamical Tomography
Authors: Marco Peruzzo, Tommaso Grigoletto, Francesco Ticozzi
Abstract: When the dynamics of a quantum system of interest is known, an informationally-complete set of observables is not needed for state reconstruction via tomographic techniques: letting the system evolve before performing the measurement allows one to effectively extend the available ways to probe the system. This idea leads to dynamical quantum tomography, whose feasibility we characterize for general quantum dynamics using Krylov-based methods. Specializing to Markovian ones, we also provide deterministic tests, and randomized ones to effectively assess parametric dynamics. The limits of the methods are explored comparing unitary and open dynamics when a single observable is available, and the set of observables whose expectation can be reconstructed from the available ones characterized. The framework is illustrated with applications to a spin chain (with or without dissipation) and an electron-nuclear system

Title: Dark-fringe interferometer with dynamic phase control for Mössbauer science
Authors: Miriam Gerharz, Dominik Lentrodt, Lars Bocklage, Kai Schulze, Christian Ott, René Steinbrügge, Olaf Leupold, Ilya Sergeev, Gerhard G. Paulus, Christoph H. Keitel, Ralf Röhlsberger, Thomas Pfeifer, Jörg Evers
Abstract: Interference is a powerful tool for measuring and control. In Mössbauer science, interference effects are essential to most applications, due to the coherent scattering nature. However, Mössbauer interferometry remains challenging, due to stability requirements imposed by the short x-ray wavelength. Here, we put forward a ``dark fringe'' interferometer with vanishing transmission in the empty state, thereby facilitating sensitive measurements. The relative interferometer phase can dynamically be tuned by displacing a Mössbauer target. We experimentally demonstrate the tuning capabilities of this interferometer by controlling the transmitted x-ray intensity on nanosecond time scales. Then, we demonstrate sensitive measurements by observing the propagation of impulsively launched sound waves in the target over $\sim 10\,\mu s$. The interferometer concept opens avenues towards polarization-sensitive phase measurements, the generation of coherent multi-pulse sequences for controlling nuclear dynamics, and the implementation of feedback loops to adaptively optimize the interferometer, thereby fueling the further development of nuclear quantum optics.

Title: Study of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra with the multi-model multi-level quantum complex exponential least squares algorithm
Authors: Antonio Marquez Romero, Josh J.M. Kirsopp, Giuseppe Buonaiuto, Michal Krompiec
Abstract: We present a novel application of the multi-modal, multi-level quantum complex exponential least squares (MM-QCELS) algorithm, a state-of-the-art, early fault-tolerant quantum phase estimation (QPE) technique, to the simulation and analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of spin systems. By leveraging the robustness and precision of MM-QCELS, we demonstrate enhanced phase resolution in quantum simulations of spin dynamics, also in systems with complex coupling topologies. Our approach enables accurate extraction of spectral features with up to an order of magnitude fewer evaluations of the time series signal in comparison with the conventional Fourier transform, making a significant step toward scalable quantum simulations of NMR Hamiltonians. This work bridges an advanced quantum algorithm design with a practical spectroscopic application, offering a promising new approach for a quantum-based chemical analysis.

Title: Automated Discovery of Gadgets in Quantum Circuits for Efficient Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Oleg M. Yevtushenko, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven itself as a powerful tool for the discovery of quantum circuits and quantum protocols. We have recently shown that including composite quantum gates -- referred to as ``gadgets'' -- in the action space of RL agents substantially enhances the RL performance in the context of quantum error correction. However, up to now the gadgets themselves had to be constructed manually. In this paper, we suggest an algorithm for the automated discovery of new gadgets and families of related gadgets. The algorithm is based on the representation of quantum circuits as directed graphs and an automated search for repeated subgraphs. The latter are identified as gadgets. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, which allows us to find two new gadget families suitable for RL. We compare the performance of 4-qubit gadgets taken from a previously known and a newly discovered family and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

Title: Nonrelativistic quantum dynamics in a twisted screw spacetime
Authors: Faizuddin Ahmed, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: We investigate the nonrelativistic quantum dynamics of a spinless particle in a screw-type spacetime endowed with two independent twist controls that interpolate between a pure screw dislocation and a homogeneous twist. From the induced spatial metric we build the covariant Schrödinger operator, separate variables to obtain a single radial eigenproblem, and include a uniform magnetic field and an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux by minimal coupling. Analytically, we identify a clean separation between a global, AB-like reindexing set by the screw parameter and a local, curvature-driven mixing generated by the distributed twist. We derive the continuity equation and closed expressions for the azimuthal and axial probability currents, establish practical parameter scalings, and recover limiting benchmarks (AB, Landau, and flat space). Numerically, a finite-difference Sturm-Liouville solver (with core excision near the axis and Langer transform) resolves spectra, wave functions, and currents. The results reveal AB periodicity and reindexing with the screw parameter, Landau-fan trends, twist-induced level tilts and avoided crossings, and a geometry-induced near-axis backflow of the axial current with negligible weight in cross-section integrals. The framework maps the geometry and fields directly onto measurable spectral shifts, interferometric phases, and persistent-current signals.

Abstract: We present a general framework to model spontaneous emission in integrated photonic structures by exploiting quantization of the electromagnetic field in terms of asymptotic in/out modes. This approach allows for an efficient and physically meaningful calculation of the emission rate into each radiative channel of an arbitrary structure, without relying on approximations such as Lorentzian lineshapes or point-like system-bath coupling. We show that with this approach one can recover well-known results for dipole emission in waveguides or ring resonators, and that such results can be easily extended to include the effect of backscattering. Finally, as an application, we design a tunable integrated single-photon source that enables full control over both the emission rate and output mode. This flexibility makes our method particularly well-suited for the design and analysis of integrated single-photon sources in various material platforms.

Title: Composite nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates with optimization on superconducting circuits
Authors: Cheng-Yun Ding, Wan-Fang Liu, Li-Hua Zhang, Jian Zhou, Zheng-Yuan Xue
Abstract: Due to its fast and robust characteristics, nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation with various optimized techniques has received much attention. However, these strategies either require precise pulse control or can only mitigate partial systematic errors, hindering their experimental development. Here, we propose a scheme for optimized composite nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (OCNGQGs), which can further enhance the gate performance of the composite nonadiabatic geometric scheme. Specifically, by optimizing the path parameter, our scheme effectively resists systematic errors in both directions, i.e., Rabi frequency and detuning errors, while preserving the flexibility of pulse shapes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our scheme offers superior gate robustness against these two types of errors compared to conventional schemes. Additionally, we propose to implement our scheme on superconducting transmon qubits, where the numerical results show the robustness of universal gates remaining evident within current technology. Therefore, our proposal provides a promising approach to achieve robust quantum gates for future scalable quantum computation.

Title: A Quantum Computer Based on Donor-Cluster Arrays in Silicon
Authors: Shihang Zhang, Chunhui Zhang, Guanyong Wang, Tao Xin, Guangchong Hu, Yu He, Peihao Huang
Abstract: Significant advances in silicon spin qubits highlight the potential of silicon quantum dots for scalable quantum computing, given their compatibility with industrial fabrication and long coherence times. In particular, phosphorus (P)-doped spin qubits possess excellent coherence and have demonstrated high-fidelity two-qubit gates exceeding 99.9%. However, scaling P-donor systems is challenging due to crosstalk caused by the uniformity of individual P donors and the low tolerance for imprecise atomic placement. Stochastic placement can lead to multiple donors located within a small region (diameter <3 nm), forming a so-called donor cluster. Notably, in cluster-based systems, high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum gates and all-to-all connectivity have recently been demonstrated experimentally on nuclear spin qubits. In this work, we propose a scalable cluster-array architecture for nuclear spin qubits and a corresponding control protocol. We analyze crosstalk-induced errors, a major error source, during primitive operations under various parameters, showing that they can be suppressed through device design and control optimization. We evaluate the fidelities of intra- and inter-cluster multi-qubit gates between nuclear spins, confirming the feasibility of our architecture and establishing design requirements and parameter targets. The local all-to-all connectivity within clusters provides unique flexibility for quantum error correction. Our scalable scheme provides a path toward large-scale spin-based quantum processors.

Title: Accelerating Regression Tasks with Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Chenghua Liu, Zhengfeng Ji
Abstract: Regression is a cornerstone of statistics and machine learning, with applications spanning science, engineering, and economics. While quantum algorithms for regression have attracted considerable attention, most existing work has focused on linear regression, leaving many more complex yet practically important variants unexplored. In this work, we present a unified quantum framework for accelerating a broad class of regression tasks -- including linear and multiple regression, Lasso, Ridge, Huber, $\ell_p$-, and $\delta_p$-type regressions -- achieving up to a quadratic improvement in the number of samples $m$ over the best classical algorithms. This speedup is achieved by extending the recent classical breakthrough of Jambulapati et al. (STOC'24) using several quantum techniques, including quantum leverage score approximation (Apers &Gribling, 2024) and the preparation of many copies of a quantum state (Hamoudi, 2022). For problems of dimension $n$, sparsity $r < n$, and error parameter $\epsilon$, our algorithm solves the problem in $\widetilde{O}(r\sqrt{mn}/\epsilon + \mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon))$ quantum time, demonstrating both the applicability and the efficiency of quantum computing in accelerating regression tasks.

Title: Demonstration of quantum error detection in a silicon quantum processor

Abstract: Quantum error detection is essential in realizing large-scale universal quantum computation, especially for quantum error correction (QEC). However, key elements for FTQC have yet to be realized in silicon qubits. Here, we demonstrate quantum error detection on a donor-based silicon quantum processor comprising four-nuclear spin qubits and one electron spin as an auxiliary qubit. The entanglement capability of this system is validated through the establishment of two-qubit Bell state entanglement between the nuclear spins and the generation of a four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, achieving a GHZ state fidelity of 88.5(2.3)%. Furthermore, by executing a four-qubit error detection circuit with the stabilizers, we successfully detect arbitrary single-qubit errors. The encoded Bell state entanglement information is recovered by performing the Pauli-frame update (PFU) via postprocessing. Based on the detected errors, we identify strongly biased noise in our system. Our results mark a significant advance toward FTQC in silicon spin qubits.

Title: The Quantum Decoding Problem : Tight Achievability Bounds and Application to Regev's Reduction
Authors: Agathe Blanvillain, André Chailloux, Jean-Pierre Tillich
Abstract: We consider the quantum decoding problem. It consists in recovering a codeword given a superposition of noisy versions of this codeword. By measuring the superposition, we get back to the classical decoding problem. It appears for the first time in Chen, Liu and Zhandry's work showing a quantum advantage for the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem for the $l_\infty$ norm. In a recent paper, Chailloux and Tillich proved that when we have a noise following a Bernoulli distribution, the quantum decoding problem can be solved in polynomial time and is therefore easier than classical decoding for which the best known algorithms have an exponential complexity. They also give an information theoretic limit for the code rate at which this problem can be solved which turns out to be above the Shannon limit. In this paper, we generalize the last result to all memoryless noise models. We also show similar results in the rank metric case which corresponds to a noise model which is not memoryless. We analyze the Pretty Good Measurement, from which we derive an information theoretic limit for this problem. By using the algorithm for the quantum decoding problem together with Regev's reduction, we derive a quantum algorithm sampling codewords from the dual code according to a probability distribution which is the dual of the original noise. It turns out that at the information theoretic limit, we get the most likely nonzero codeword of the dual code. When the distribution is a decreasing function of the weight, we find minimal nonzero codewords. Note that Regev's reduction used together with classical decoding is much less satisfying since it is not able to output those minimum weight codewords.

Title: Near-Optimal Simultaneous Estimation of Quantum State Moments
Authors: Xiao Shi, Jiyu Jiang, Xian Wu, Jingu Xie, Hongshun Yao, Xin Wang
Abstract: Estimating nonlinear properties such as Rényi entropies and observable-weighted moments serves as a central strategy for spectrum spectroscopy, which is fundamental to property prediction and analysis in quantum information science, statistical mechanics, and many-body physics. However, existing approaches are susceptible to noise and require significant resources, making them challenging for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we introduce a framework for resource-efficient simultaneous estimation of quantum state moments via qubit reuse. For an $m$-qubit quantum state $\rho$, our method achieves the simultaneous estimation of the full hierarchy of moments $\text{Tr}(\rho^2), \dots, \text{Tr}(\rho^k)$, as well as arbitrary polynomial functionals and their observable-weighted counterparts. By leveraging qubit reset operations, our core circuit for simultaneous moment estimation requires only $2m+1$ physical qubits and $\mathcal{O}(k)$ CSWAP gates, achieving a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(k \log k / \varepsilon^2)$. We demonstrate this protocol's utility by showing that the estimated moments yield tight bounds on a state's maximum eigenvalue and present applications in quantum virtual cooling to access low-energy states of the Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we show the protocol's viability on near-term quantum hardware by experimentally measuring higher-order Rényi entropy on a superconducting quantum processor. Our method provides a scalable and resource-efficient route to quantum system characterization and spectroscopy on near-term quantum hardware.

Authors: Alejandro Romero-Ros, Javier Rozalén Sarmiento, Arnau Rios
Abstract: We present proof-of-principle time-dependent neural quantum state (NQS) simulations to illustrate the ability of this approach to effectively capture key aspects of quantum dynamics in the continuum. NQS leverage the parameterization of the wave function with neural-network architectures. Here, we put NQS to the test by solving the quantum harmonic oscillator. We obtain the ground state and perform coherent state and breathing mode dynamics. Our results are benchmarked against analytical solutions, showcasing an excellent agreement.

Title: Cryogenic pressure sensing with an ultrafast Meissner-levitated microrotor
Authors: Joel K Jose, Andrea Marchese, Marion Cromb, Hendrik Ulbricht, Andrejs Cebers, Ping Koy Lam, Tao Wang, Andrea Vinante
Abstract: Magnetically levitated spinning rotors are key elements in important technologies such as navigation by gyroscopes, energy storage by flywheels, ultra-high vacuum generation by turbomolecular pumps, and pressure sensing for process control. However, mechanical rotors are typically macroscopic and limited to room temperature and low rotation frequencies. In particular, sensing pressure at low temperatures remains a technological challenge, while emerging quantum technologies demand a precise evaluation of pressure conditions at low temperatures to cope with quantum-spoiling decoherence. To close this gap, we demonstrate wide range pressure sensing by a spinning rotor based on a micromagnet levitated by the Meissner effect at 4.2 Kelvin. We achieve rotational speeds of up to 138 million rotations per minute, resulting in very high effective quality factors, outperforming current platforms. Beside sensing applications, we envision the use of levitated rotors for probing fundamental science including quantum mechanics and gravity, enabled by ultralow torque noise.

Title: Unified laboratory-frame analysis of atomic gravitational-wave sensors
Authors: Simon Schaffrath, Daniel Störk, Fabio Di Pumpo, Enno Giese
Abstract: Atomic sensors using light-matter interactions, in particular atomic clocks and atom interferometers, have the potential to complement optical gravitational-wave detectors in the mid-frequency regime. Although both rely on interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated, whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions, while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work, we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave. While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial optical clocks normally rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise suppression.

Title: Finite-Size Security Bounds in Semi-Quantum Key Distribution: Spectral, Operator-Theoretic, and Entropic Perspectives
Authors: Zahidur Rezwan Ratul
Abstract: We study Semi-Quantum Key Distribution (SQKD) with a focus on finite-size security bounds, developed through three complementary perspectives. (i) Spectral disturbance: wrong-basis Lüders updates produce closed-form spectra and purity loss, which serve as basis-independent indicators of disturbance. (ii) Operator-theoretic reduction: in Z/Z-sifted rounds, intercept-resend attacks can be represented as an effective depolarizing channel, characterized by a fidelity-QBER relation. (iii) Entropic trade-offs: Maassen-Uffink and memory-assisted uncertainty relations certify security through X tests and reflection rounds, even when the sifted QBER is low. The exposition provides step-by-step derivations supported by physically interpretable figures, and the framework concludes with finite-size estimates based on concentration inequalities that are suited for practical parameter estimation.

Title: Distributed Quantum Error Correction with Permutation-Invariant Approximate Codes
Authors: Connor Clayton, Bruno Avritzer
Abstract: Modular quantum computing architectures require error correction schemes that remain effective in the presense of noisy inter-processor operations. We introduce a distributed quantum error correction framework based on approximate codes to address this challenge. Our approach enables concatenation of distinct local codes across modules while allowing logical operations composed primarily of processor-local gates. We derive a lower bound and present corresponding simulations which indicate that this nontraditional approach can provide marked advantage over existing approaches in the highly non-uniform error landscape of a distributed quantum computer. As a concrete realization, we present encoding and decoding circuits for the permutation-invariant W- state code and propose efficient methods for its preparation. These results highlight the potential of approximate distributed error correction strategies for scalable, modular, fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Enhancing work-extraction in quantum batteries via correlated reservoirs
Authors: Sejal Ahuja, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Going beyond isolated system dynamics, we examine how local and spatially correlated reservoirs influence the work extraction in quantum batteries. By employing a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model coupled to baths via dephasing and amplitude-damping noise, we demonstrate that correlations in reservoirs can significantly enhance battery's performance compared to local noise. In the dephasing scenario, we prove that correlated reservoirs produce a finite amount of extractable work, or ergotropy, during the transient regime when a two-cell battery is initialized in a product state while local noise yields vanishing ergotropy at all times, despite nonvanishing stored energy in both cases. Numerical simulations confirm that this advantage persists across larger system sizes and for both entangled and product initial states. We also find that the dynamics of quantum coherence closely mirror those of ergotropy, highlighting coherence as a key resource underlying the enhanced performance of quantum batteries. Further, we observe that the fraction of stored energy extracted from quantum batteries displays a sharper contrast between the correlated and local reservoirs. Moreover, for dephasing noise, this fraction remains independent of system size, whereas in the amplitude damping case, it exhibits a clear system-size dependence within the transient regime, highlighting distinct operational behaviors under different noise models. In addition, we reveal that when the battery dynamics is governed by an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions, it yields higher ergotropy compared to short-range interactions, emphasizing the advantages of reservoir engineering for efficient device design.

Title: Quantitative quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled nonlocal games
Authors: Matilde Baroni, Igor Klep, Dominik Leichtle, Marc-Olivier Renou, Ivan Šupić, Lucas Tendick, Xiangling Xu
Abstract: Compiled nonlocal games transfer the power of Bell-type multi-prover tests into a single-device setting by replacing spatial separation with cryptography. Concretely, the KLVY compiler (STOC'23) maps any multi-prover game to an interactive single-prover protocol, using quantum homomorphic encryption. A crucial security property of such compilers is quantum soundness, which ensures that a dishonest quantum prover cannot exceed the original game's quantum value. For practical cryptographic implementations, this soundness must be quantitative, providing concrete bounds, rather than merely asymptotic. While quantitative quantum soundness has been established for the KLVY compiler in the bipartite case, it has only been shown asymptotically for multipartite games. This is a significant gap, as multipartite nonlocality exhibits phenomena with no bipartite analogue, and the difficulty of enforcing space-like separation makes single-device compilation especially compelling. This work closes this gap by showing the quantitative quantum soundness of the KLVY compiler for all multipartite nonlocal games. On the way, we introduce an NPA-like hierarchy for quantum instruments and prove its completeness, thereby characterizing correlations from operationally-non-signaling sequential strategies. We further develop novel geometric arguments for the decomposition of sequential strategies into their signaling and non-signaling parts, which might be of independent interest.

Title: Noise mitigation in quantum enhanced fiber optic gyroscopes
Authors: Stefan Evans, Joanna Ptasinski
Abstract: We analyze noise sources in a quantum-enhanced fiber optic gyroscope (FOG), aiming toward improving the feasibility of long (multiple km) fiber lengths and higher order $N>2$ polarization entangled N00N states. We focus on one of the leading sources of quantum FOG phase uncertainty, uncorrelated photon saturation. We characterize the optimal ranges of phase bias angles which minimize this uncertainty to allow for sub-shot noise precision. As an example, we apply the present-day leading quantum FOG experiment as part of our analysis. This opens up a path to sub-shot noise angular rotation sensitivity further beyond the earth's rotation rate.

Title: Entanglement and apparent thermality in simulated black holes
Authors: Iason A. Sofos, Andrew Hallam, Jiannis K. Pachos
Abstract: We investigate the apparent thermality of Hawking radiation in the semi-classical limit of quantum black holes using the mean-field limit of a chiral spin-chain simulator, which models fermions propagating on a black hole space-time in the continuum. In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.

Title: Ultralow-Temperature Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy Using a New Helium Flow Cryostat Stage
Authors: Young-Hoon Kim, Fehmi Sami Yasin, Na Yeon Kim, Max Birch, Xiuzhen Yu, Akiko Kikkawa, Yasujiro Taguchi, Jiaqiang Yan, Miaofang Chi
Abstract: Advances in cryogenic electron microscopy have opened new avenues for probing quantum phenomena in correlated materials. This study reports the installation and performance of a new side-entry condenZero cryogenic cooling system for JEOL (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopes (S/TEM), utilizing compressed liquid helium (LHe) and designed for imaging and spectroscopy at ultra-low temperatures. The system includes an external dewar mounted on a vibration-damping stage and a pressurized, low-noise helium transfer line with a remotely controllable needle valve, ensuring stable and efficient LHe flow with minimal thermal and mechanical noise. Performance evaluation demonstrates a stable base temperature of 6.58 K measured using a Cernox bare chip sensor on the holder with temperature fluctuations within 0.04 K. Complementary in-situ electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) via aluminum bulk plasmon analysis was used to measure the local specimen temperature and validate cryogenic operation during experiments. The integration of cryogenic cooling with other microscopy techniques, including electron diffraction and Lorentz TEM, was demonstrated by resolving charge density wave (CDW) transitions in NbSe2 using electron diffraction, and imaging nanometric magnetic skyrmions in MnSi via Lorentz TEM. This platform provides reliable cryogenic operation below 7 K, establishing a low-drift route for direct visualization of electronic and magnetic phase transformations in quantum materials.

Title: Delay in electronic vortex states created by multiphoton ionization with single elliptically polarized laser pulses
Authors: Edward McManus, Phi-Hung Tran, Michael Davino, Tobias Saule, Van-Hung Hoang, Thomas Weinacht, George Gibson, Anh-Thu Le, Carlos A. Trallero-Herrero
Abstract: We show experimentally and theoretically that vortex-shaped structures in the photoelectron momentum distribution can be observed for atoms interacting with a single intense elliptically polarized laser pulse. Our analysis reveals that these spiral structures are the result of destructive interference of two dominant photoelectron vortex states, which are released into the continuum by strong-field ionization. An electron born into one of those states is temporarily delayed near the atomic core by the combined atomic and laser potential, leading to fast changes in the phase delay with energy for photoelectrons in these vortex states. Our results open the door to studying electron dynamics of vortex states in strong-field ionization.

Title: Comparison of wave-mixing processes in rarefied gas and QED vacuum using numerical simulations
Authors: Marianna Lytova, François Fillion-Gourdeau, Simon Vallières, Sylvain Fourmaux, François Légaré, Steve MacLean
Abstract: We study the conditions required to distinguish laser-induced nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in vacuum from competing signals due to interactions of laser pulses with ionized residual gas. The latter is inevitably present in vacuum chambers where experiments are performed because the vacuum is never perfect and there is always some residual pressure. The rarefied gas contribution is modeled statistically using the 1D-1V Vlasov-Maxwell system, while vacuum nonlinearities are described within the weak-field expansion of the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. In both cases, photon spectra from wave-mixing processes are evaluated by solving numerically the resulting partial differential equations using a semi-Lagrangian scheme. We consider short pulses in co- and counter-propagating configurations, allowing us to identify the laser intensities and vacuum pressures for which the vacuum signal dominates. These results provide quantitative guidance for future all-optical experiments aiming to detect light-by-light scattering in vacuum.

Title: Superconvergence of High-order Magnus Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Di Fang, Jiaqi Zhang
Abstract: The Magnus expansion has long been a celebrated subject in numerical analysis, leading to the development of many useful classical integrators. More recently, it has been discovered to be a powerful tool for designing quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation in quantum computing. In particular, surprising superconvergence behavior has been observed for quantum Magnus algorithms applied to the simulation of the Schrödinger equation, with the first- and second-order methods exhibiting doubled convergence order. In this work, we provide a rigorous proof that such superconvergence extends to general high-order quantum Magnus algorithms. Specifically, we show that a quantum Magnus algorithm of order $p$ achieves the superconvergence of order $2p$ in time when applying to the Schrödinger equation simulation in the interaction picture. Our analysis combines techniques from semiclassical analysis and Weyl calculus, offering a new perspective on the mathematical foundations of quantum algorithms for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation.

Title: Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model in a Quantum Glassy Landscape
Authors: Surajit Bera, Jorge Kurchan, Marco Schiro
Abstract: We study a generalization of `Yukawa models' in which Majorana fermions, interacting via all-to-all random couplings as in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, are parametrically coupled to disordered bosonic degrees of freedom described by a quantum $p-$spin model. The latter has its own non-trivial dynamics leading to quantum paramagnetic (or liquid) and glassy phases. At low temperatures, this setup results in SYK behavior within each metastable state of a rugged bosonic free energy landscape, the effective fermionic couplings being different for each metastable state. We show that the boson-fermion coupling enhances the stability of the quantum spin-glass phase and strongly modifies the imaginary-time Green's functions of both sets of degrees of freedom. In particular, in the quantum spin glass phase, the imaginary-time dynamics is turned from a fast exponential decay characteristic of a gapped phase into a much slower dynamics. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, on the other hand, the fermions' imaginary-time dynamics get strongly modified and the critical SYK behavior is washed away.

Title: Entanglement signatures of gapless topological phases in a $p$-wave superconductor
Authors: S. Srinidhi, Shashi C. L. Srivastava, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: We explore the gapless topological phases of a $p$-wave superconductor, probing its rich topologically ordered phases and underlying quantum phenomena. The topological order of the system is characterized by studying its entanglement properties. This study confirms the bulk-boundary correspondence in the entanglement spectrum, even without a full bulk gap. For contractible bipartitions, the entanglement entropy varies non-monotonically with the chemical potential, displaying pronounced peaks at points where the bulk gap closes and reopens, signaling topological quantum phase transitions. This behavior remains robust in the thermodynamic limit. The entanglement entropy grows with system size for non-contractible bipartitions, indicating long-range entanglement in the gapless phase. These findings reveal the subtle interplay between symmetry, entanglement, and topology in gapless systems, and emphasize the role of entanglement-based diagnostics in identifying unconventional topological phases beyond the gapped paradigm.

Title: Non-local integrals of motion for deformed $W$-algebra $W_{q,t}(g)$ associated with $g=A_l^{(1)}, D_l^{(1)}, E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$
Authors: Michio Jimbo, Takeo Kojima
Abstract: We present an infinite set of non-local integrals of motion for the deformed $W$-algebra $W_{q,t}(g)$ associated with the affine Lie algebras $g=A_l^{(1)}, D_l^{(1)}$ and $E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$.They can be regarded as a two-parameter deformation of trace of the monodromy matrix of the $g$-KdV theory. Commutativity of the non-local integrals of motion is shown in the case of $g=A_l^{(1)}$ and $D_l^{(1)}$ by a direct calculation. In the case of $g=E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$ it is a conjecture.

Title: Haag Duality for 2D Quantum Spin Systems
Authors: Yoshiko Ogata, David Pérez-García, Alberto Ruiz-de-Alarcón
Abstract: Haag duality is a strong notion of locality for two-dimensional lattice quantum spin systems, requiring that the commutant of the algebra of observables supported in a cone-like region coincides with the algebra of observables in its complement. Originally introduced within algebraic quantum field theory, Haag duality has recently become pivotal in the operator-algebraic analysis of quantum many-body systems. In particular, it plays a key role in the description of anyonic excitations, which are widely believed to classify two-dimensional non-chiral gapped quantum phases of matter. Prior to this work, Haag duality had only been rigorously established for Kitaev's quantum double models with abelian input groups. In this paper, we establish that two-dimensional tensor network states based on biconnected $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras satisfy Haag duality. These states include as particular cases Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and we expect them to encompass representatives of all non-chiral phases. Our proof relies on deriving an operator-algebraic sufficient condition for Haag duality in finite systems, which we verify using tensor-network methods. As part of our analysis, we extend the tensor-network bulk-boundary correspondence, construct explicit commuting parent Hamiltonians for these models, and prove that in the biconnected case they satisfy the local topological quantum order condition.

Title: Noncommutative Landau problem in graphene: a gauge-invariant analysis with the Seiberg-Witten map
Authors: Aslam Halder
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic quantum dynamics of amassless electron in graphene in a two-dimensional noncommutative (NC) plane under a constant background magnetic field. To address the issue of gauge invariance, we employ an effective massless NC Dirac field theory, incorporating the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map alongside the Moyal star product. Using this framework, we derive a manifestly gauge-invariant Hamiltonian for a massless Dirac particle, which serves as the basis for studying the relativistic Landau problem in graphene in NC space. Specifically, we analyze the motion of a relativistic electron in monolayer graphene within this background field and compute the energy spectrum of the NC Landau system. The NC-modified energy levels are then used to explore the system's thermodynamic response. Notably, in the low-temperature limit, spatial noncommutativity leads to a spontaneous magnetization-a distinct signature of NC geometry in relativistic condensed matter systems like graphene.

Title: Quantum calculation of the collision-induced line-shape effects in antiprotonic helium and the new accurate ab initio $\bar{p}$He$^{+}$-He potential energy surface
Authors: Hubert J. Jóźwiak, Dimitar Bakalov, Michał Przybytek, Michail Stoilov, Piotr Wcisło
Abstract: We present the first fully ab initio calculations of collision-induced broadening and shift of spectral lines in antiprotonic helium ($\bar{p}$He$^{+}$) perturbed by atomic helium. To overcome critical limitations of previous studies, we construct a new highly accurate potential energy surface (PES) that spans a wide range of $\bar{p}$He$^{+}$-He geometries relevant to all metastable states of the exotic helium atom. Rigorous quantum scattering calculations performed using the new PES yield scattering $S$-matrices from which we extract pressure broadening and shift coefficients for 50 transitions in antiprotonic helium-4 ($\bar{p}^{4}$He$^{+}$). This dataset provides the first rigorous benchmark for earlier semiclassical calculations and establishes a robust theoretical reference for high-precision spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium, which is used to test the fundamental charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry. The results extend to temperatures relevant to non-gaseous phases of helium, supporting a new class of precision measurements. This study introduces a methodological framework for future investigations of other exotic systems, such as pionic or kaonic helium atoms, enabling the development of reference data for high-precision spectroscopy of these species - an essential component for improving the determination of the pion and kaon masses.

Title: T-duality and bosonization as examples of continuum gauging and disentangling
Authors: Gertian Roose, Erez Zohar
Abstract: Dualities and duality transformations form a well established methodology in various aspects of quantum many body physics and quantum field theories, allowing one to exploit equivalence between models which may naively seem completely different in order to gain access to further physical regimes, either analytically, numerically or experimentally. Recently, in the context of condensed matter physics and quantum information, it was shown that dualities can be understood very well through a gauging and disentangling procedure that can be represented by a finite depth quantum circuit. In this letter we expand these concepts to the continuum, suggesting them as a way to derive duality transformations in continuum field theories and particle physics, and benchmark the presented ideas through the re-derivation of T-duality and bosonization.

Title: Non-destructive optical read-out and manipulation of circular Rydberg atoms
Authors: Yohann Machu, Andrés Durán-Hernández, Gautier Creutzer, Aurore Alice Young, Jean-Michel Raimond, Michel Brune, Clément Sayrin
Abstract: Among the thriving quantum computation and quantum simulation platforms based on arrays of Rydberg atoms, those using circular Rydberg atoms are particularly promising. These atoms uniquely combine the strong dipole-dipole interactions typical of Rydberg states with long lifetimes. However, low-angular-momentum ($\ell$) laser-accessible Rydberg levels have been so far mostly used, because circular Rydberg atoms have no optical transitions, hindering their individual detection and manipulation. We remove this limitation with a hybrid platform, combining an array of logical laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium with an auxiliary array of Rb ancilla atoms transiently excited to a low-$\ell$ Rydberg level. We perform a quantum non-demolition detection of the logical qubit with the ancilla, through the blockade of the ancilla optical excitation induced by a Förster resonance. Conversely, we locally manipulate the logical qubit through the excitation of the ancilla. This dual-Rydberg platform is highly promising for quantum computation and simulation. It adds to the circular-atom toolbox the mid-circuit measurements, essential for error correction. More strikingly, it gives access to time correlations in long-term quantum simulations, uniquely accessible to circular Rydberg atoms.

Title: Agentic Exploration of Physics Models
Authors: Maximilian Nägele, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

Title: Momentum-resolved two-dimensional spectroscopy as a probe of nonlinear quantum field dynamics

Abstract: Emergent collective excitations constitute a hallmark of interacting quantum many-body systems, yet in solid-state platforms their study has been largely limited by the constraints of linear-response probes and by finite momentum resolution. We propose to overcome these limitations by combining the spatial resolution of ultracold atomic systems with the nonlinear probing capabilities of two-dimensional spectroscopy (2DS). As a concrete illustration, we analyze momentum-resolved 2DS of the quantum sine-Gordon model describing the low energy dynamics of two weakly coupled one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. This approach reveals distinctive many-body signatures, most notably asymmetric cross-peaks reflecting the interplay between isolated ($B_2$ breather) and continuum ($B_1$ pair) modes. The protocol further enables direct characterization of anharmonicity and disorder, establishing momentum-resolved 2DS as both a powerful diagnostic for quantum simulators and a versatile probe of correlated quantum matter.

Title: Complexity of Einstein-Maxwell-non-minimal coupling $R^2F^2$: the role of the penalty factor
Authors: Mojtaba Shahbazi, Mehdi Sadeghi
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the holographic complexity of a theory of Einstein-Maxwell with a non-minimal coupling $R^2 F_{\mu \nu }F^{\mu \nu} $ term via complexity=anything. We introduce a perturbative black brane solution in AdS spacetime up to the first order of the non-minimal coupling. Because the model exhibits the resistivity proportional to the temperature, it could describe strange metals. The complexity of the solution could be characterized by three quantities: the conserved charge, the non-minimal coupling and the generalized term in the complexity. The generalized term is chosen to be $C^2$, the Weyl squared tensor, $R^2F^2$ and $F^2$. The physical interpretation of the three quantities has been provided where the generalized term is interpreted as a bulk penalty factor, the non-minimal coupling and the conserved charge as an effective scrambling time of the dual theory which contains the choice of the generalization parameter.

Title: Complementarity relations for design-structured POVMs in terms of generalized entropies of order $α\in(0,2)$
Authors: Alexey E. Rastegin
Abstract: Information entropies give a genuine way to characterize quantitatively an incompatibility in quantum measurements. Together with the Shannon entropy, few families of parametrized entropies have found use in various questions. It is also known that a possibility to vary the parameter can often provide more restrictions on elements of probability distributions. In quantum information processing, one often deals with measurements having some special structure. Quantum designs are currently the subject of active research, whence the aim to formulate complementarity relations for related measurements occurs. Using generalized entropies of order $\alpha\in(0,2)$, we obtain uncertainty and certainty relations for POVMs assigned to a quantum design. The structure of quantum designs leads to several restrictions on generated probabilities. We show how to convert these restrictions into two-sided entropic estimates. One of the used ways is based on truncated expansions of the Taylor type. The recently found method to get two-sided entropic estimates uses polynomials with flexible coefficients. We illustrate the utility of this method with respect to both the Rényi and Tsallis entropies. Possible applications of the derived complementarity relations are briefly discussed.

Title: Quantum state-preparation control in noisy environment via most-likely paths
Authors: Wirawat Kokaew, Thiparat Chotibut, Areeya Chantasri
Abstract: Finding controls for open quantum systems needs to take into account effects from unwanted environmental noise. Since actual realizations or states of the noise are typically unknown, the usual treatment for the quantum system's decoherence dynamics is via the so-called Lindblad master equation, which in essence describes an average evolution (mean path) of the system's state affected by the unknown noise. We here consider an alternative view of a noise-affected open quantum system, where the average dynamics can be unravelled into hypothetical noisy quantum trajectories, and propose a control strategy for the state-preparation problem based on the likelihood of noise occurrence. We formulate a stochastic path integral for noise variables whose extremum yields control functions associated with a most-likely noise to achieve target states. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to a qubit-state preparation under dephasing noise and analytically solve for controlled Rabi drives for arbitrary target states. Since the method is constructed based on the probability of noise, we also introduce a fidelity success rate as a measure of the state preparation. We benchmark against the mean-path approaches, e.g., GRAPE and CRAB controls, using both average fidelity and a success-rate metric. While standard mean-path controls maximize average fidelity, most-likely controls achieve higher success rates, especially at strong dephasing.

Title: No-Signaling in Steepest Entropy Ascent: A Nonlinear Non-local Non-equilibrium Quantum Dynamics of Composite Systems
Authors: Rohit Kishan Ray, Gian Paolo Beretta
Abstract: The Lindbladian formalism models open quantum systems using a 'bottom-up' approach, deriving linear dynamics from system-environment interactions. We present a 'top-down' approach starting with phenomenological constraints, focusing on system's structure, subsystems' interactions, environmental effects, and often using a non-equilibrium variational principle designed to enforce strict thermodynamic consistency. However, incorporating the second law's requirement -- that Gibbs states are the sole stable equilibria -- necessitates nonlinear dynamics, challenging no-signaling principles in composite systems. We reintroduce 'local perception operators' and show that they allow to model signaling-free non-local effects. Using the steepest-entropy-ascent variational principle as an example, we demonstrate the validity of the 'top-down' approach for integrating quantum mechanics and thermodynamics in phenomenological models, with potential applications in quantum computing and resource theories.

Title: Solving Systems of Linear Equations: HHL from a Tensor Networks Perspective
Authors: Alejandro Mata Ali, Iñigo Perez Delgado, Marina Ristol Roura, Aitor Moreno Fdez. de Leceta, Sebastián V. Romero
Abstract: This work presents a new approach for simulating the HHL linear systems of equations solver algorithm with tensor networks. First, a novel HHL in the qudits formalism, the generalization of qubits, is developed, and then its operations are transformed into an equivalent classical HHL, taking advantage of the non-unitary operations that they can apply. The main novelty of this proposal is to perform a classical simulation of the HHL as efficiently as possible to benchmark the algorithm steps according to its input parameters and the input matrix. The algorithm is applied to three classical simple simulation problems, comparing it with an exact inversion algorithm, and its performance is compared against an implementation of the original HHL simulated in the Qiskit framework, providing both codes. It is also applied to study the sensitivity of the HHL algorithm with respect to its hyperparameter values, reporting the existence of saturation points and maximal performance values. The results show that this approach can achieve a promising performance in computational efficiency to simulate the HHL process without quantum noise, providing a higher bound for its performance.

Title: Searching Repulsive Casimir Forces Between Magneto-Electric Materials
Authors: Zixuan Dai, Qing-Dong Jiang
Abstract: The Casimir effect, arising from vacuum quantum fluctuations, plays a fundamental role in the development of modern quantum electrodynamics. In parallel, the field of condensed matter has flourished through the discovery of various materials exhibiting broken symmetries, often connected to topology and characterized by magneto-electric coupling. To enhance the comprehension of the role of parity symmetry and time-reversal symmetry in determining the sign of the Casimir force, we calculate the Casimir forces between magneto-electric materials and obtain a phase diagram governing the sign of symmetry-breaking-induced Casimir forces. We also investigate how the force phase diagram varies with the separation distances between the objects. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the sign of the Casimir force, a subject bearing both theoretical interest and practical significance.

Title: Certifying quantum enhancements in thermal machines beyond the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation
Authors: José A. Almanza-Marrero, Gonzalo Manzano
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.

Title: Imaging a chain of strongly correlated Rydberg excitations enabled by Förster-resonance-enhanced interaction
Authors: Jinjin Du, Thibault Vogt, Ningxuan Zheng, Wenhui Li
Abstract: Rydberg atoms are currently a very fast advancing quantum platform. For many interesting and demanding applications, including quantum computation, fast detection of a Rydberg excitation or a Rydberg qubit for information readout would be one of the most desirable developments. We demonstrate single-shot and \textit{in situ} absorption imaging of individual Rydberg excitations. This level of resolution is achieved using an electromagnetically induced transparency scheme involving a Rydberg energy level that is highly sensitive to the presence of Rydberg atoms due to Förster-resonance-enhanced dipole couplings. Spectroscopic measurements illustrate the existence of the Förster resonance and underscore the state-selectivity of the technique. With an imaging exposure time as short as 3 $\mu$s, we successfully resolve linear chains of Rydberg excitations in a one-dimensional configuration. The extracted second-order correlation shows strong anti-bunching due to excitation blockade, and a Fourier analysis reveals the long-range order in the chains of Rydberg excitations. This imaging technique, with minimal destruction, will be of great interest for leveraging ensemble-encoded qubits in quantum computation and quantum simulation applications.

Title: Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials
Authors: Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.

Title: Energy additivity as a requirement for universal quantum thermodynamical frameworks
Authors: Luis Rodrigo Neves, Frederico Brito
Abstract: The quest to develop a general framework for thermodynamics, suitable for the regime of strong coupling and correlations between subsystems of an autonomous quantum "universe," has entailed diverging definitions for basic quantities, including internal energy. While most approaches focus solely on the system of interest, we propose that a universal notion of internal energy should also account for the environment in order to keep consistency with the closed-system energy of the universe. We introduce an abstract framework to describe all effective Hamiltonian-based approaches and address a rigorous definition of energy additivity in this context, in both a weak and a strong forms, discussing the underlying subtleties. As an illustration, we study a particular two-qubit universe model, obtaining the exact master equations for both parties and calculating their effective Hamiltonians and internal energies as given by the recently devised minimal dissipation approach. In this case, we show that internal energies are neither additive nor conservative, which leads to unphysical features.

Title: Dynamic Josephson Junction Metasurfaces for Multiplexed Control of Superconducting Qubits
Authors: Mustafa Bakr
Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum processors to large qubit counts faces challenges in control signal delivery, thermal management, and hardware complexity, particularly in achieving microwave signal multiplexing and long-distance quantum information routing at millikelvin (mK) temperatures. We propose a space-time modulated Josephson Junction (JJ) metasurface architecture to generate and multiplex microwave control signals directly at mK temperatures. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the generation of multiple frequency tones with controlled parameters, enabling efficient and scalable qubit control while minimizing thermal loads and wiring overhead. We derive the nonlinear wave equation governing this system, simulate beam steering and frequency conversion, and discuss the feasibility of experimental implementation.

Title: All three-angle variants of Tsirelson's precession protocol, and improved bounds for wedge integrals of Wigner functions
Authors: Lin Htoo Zaw, Valerio Scarani
Abstract: Tsirelson's precession protocol is a nonclassicality witness that can be defined for both discrete and continuous variable systems. Its original version involves measuring a precessing observable, like the quadrature of a harmonic oscillator or a component of angular momentum, along three equally-spaced angles. In this work, we characterise all three-angle variants of this protocol. For continuous variables, we show that the maximum score $\mathbf{P}_3^\infty$ achievable by the quantum harmonic oscillator is the same for all such generalised protocols. We also derive markedly tighter bounds for $\mathbf{P}_3^\infty$, both rigorous and conjectured, which translate into improved bounds on the amount of negativity a Wigner function can have in certain wedge-shaped regions of phase space. For discrete variables, we show that changing the angles significantly improves the score for most spin systems. Like the original protocol, these generalised variants can detect non-Gaussian and genuine multipartite entanglement when applied on composite systems. Overall, this work broadens the scope of Tsirelson's original protocol, making it capable to detect the nonclassicality and entanglement of many more states.

Title: Generating entangled pairs of vortex photons via induced emission
Authors: D. V. Grosman, G. K. Sizykh, E. O. Lazarev, G. V. Voloshin, D. V. Karlovets
Abstract: Pairs of entangled vortex photons can promise new prospects of application in quantum computing and cryptography. We investigate the possibility of generating such states via two-level atom emission induced by a single photon wave packet with a definite total angular momentum (TAM). The entangled pair produced in this process possesses well-defined mean TAM with the TAM variation being much smaller than $\hbar$. On top of that, the variation exponentially decreases with the increase in TAM of the incident photon. Our model allows one to track the time evolution of the state of the entangled pair. An experimentally feasible scenario is assumed, in which the incident photon interacts with a spatially confined atomic target. We conclude that induced emission can be used as a source of entangled vortex photons with applications in atomic physics experiments, quantum optics, and quantum information sciences.

Title: Security of Device-independent Quantum Key Distribution under Sequential Attack
Authors: Pritam Roy, Souradeep Sasmal, Subhankar Bera, Shashank Gupta, Arup Roy, A. S. Majumdar
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) leverages nonlocal correlations to establish cryptographic keys between two honest parties while making minimal assumptions about the underlying systems. The security of DI-QKD is grounded in the validity of quantum theory, with Bell violations ensuring the intrinsic unpredictability of observed statistics, independent of the trustworthiness of the devices. While traditional collective QKD attacks involve an adversary preparing the shared system for the users, we analyse a scenario in which the adversary does not control the preparation devices yet can still extract information about the key using a strategy known as the sequential attack. In this approach, an eavesdropper (Eve) intercepts the transmitted quantum particle, performs an unsharp measurement to maintain the Bell violation between the honest parties, and disguises her interference as noise. This method enables Eve to acquire relevant information about the key without resorting to collective measurements. We show that by using sequential measurements with an ancilla stored in quantum memory, Eve can mimic a collective attack within certain parameter ranges, even without initial control of the source.

Title: Sample-based Hamiltonian and Lindbladian simulation: Non-asymptotic analysis of sample complexity
Authors: Byeongseon Go, Hyukjoon Kwon, Siheon Park, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. Wave matrix Lindbladization (WML) similarly processes multiple copies of a program state $\psi_L$ in order to realize a Lindbladian evolution. Both algorithms are prototypical sample-based quantum algorithms and can be used for various quantum information processing tasks, including quantum principal component analysis, Hamiltonian simulation, and Lindbladian simulation. In this work, we present detailed sample complexity analyses for DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, as well as for WML and sample-based Lindbladian simulation. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$ for evolution time $t$ and imprecision level $\varepsilon$ quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor. Additionally, we prove that the sample complexity of WML is no larger than $3t^2d^2/\varepsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space on which the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially, and we prove a lower bound of $10^{-4} t^2/\varepsilon$ on the sample complexity of sample-based Lindbladian simulation. These results prove that WML is optimal for sample-based Lindbladian simulation whenever the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially on a constant-sized system. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] and the WML sample complexity analysis in [Patel and Wilde, Open Systems \& Information Dynamics 30, 2350010 (2023)] appear to be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here.

Title: Digital-Analog Simulations of Schrödinger Cat States in the Dicke-Ising Model
Authors: Dmitriy S. Shapiro, Yannik Weber, Tim Bode, Frank K. Wilhelm, Dmitry Bagrets
Abstract: The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.

Title: Multi-user QKD using quotient graph states derived from continuous-variable dual-rail cluster states
Authors: Akash nag Oruganti
Abstract: Multipartite entangled states are fundamental resources for multi-user quantum cryptographic tasks. Despite significant advancements in generating large-scale continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, particularly the dual-rail cluster state because of its utility in measurement-based quantum computation, its application in quantum cryptography has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol for generating three user conference keys using a CV dual-rail cluster state. We develop the concept of a quotient graph state by applying a node coloring scheme to the infinite dual-rail graph, resulting in a six-mode pure graph state suitable for cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves performance close to that of GHZ-based protocols for quantum conference key agreement (QCKA), with GHZ states performing slightly better. However, a key advantage of our protocol lies in its ability to generate bipartite keys post-QCKA, a feature not achievable with GHZ states. Additionally, compared to a downstream access network using two-mode squeezed vacuum states, our protocol achieves superior performance in generating bipartite keys. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the finite-size regime and consider the impact of using impure squeezed states for generating the multipartite entangled states, reflecting experimental imperfections. Our findings indicate that even with finite resources and non-ideal state preparation, the proposed protocol maintains its advantages. We also introduce a more accurate method to estimate the capacity of a protocol to generate bipartite keys in a quantum network.

Title: The quantum super-Krylov method
Authors: Adam Byrne, William Kirby, Kirk M. Soodhalter, Sergiy Zhuk
Abstract: The problem of estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum system is ubiquitous in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Krylov quantum diagonalization (KQD) has emerged as a promising approach for this task. However, many KQD methods rely on subroutines, particularly the Hadamard test, that are challenging to implement on near-term quantum computers. We present a novel KQD method that uses only real-time evolutions and recovery probabilities, making it well adapted for existing quantum hardware. The method entails numerical differentiation in post-processing, and so we present a novel derivative estimation algorithm that is robust to noisy data. Under assumptions on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, we prove that our algorithm converges exponentially quickly to the ground-state energy and present a numerical demonstration using tensor network simulations.

Title: A Flux-Tunable cavity for Dark matter detection
Authors: Fang Zhao, Ziqian Li, Akash V. Dixit, Tanay Roy, Andrei Vrajitoarea, Riju Banerjee, Alexander Anferov, Kan-Heng Lee, David I. Schuster, Aaron Chou
Abstract: Developing a dark matter detector with wide mass tunability is an immensely desirable property, yet it is challenging due to maintaining strong sensitivity. Resonant cavities for dark matter detection have traditionally employed mechanical tuning, moving parts around to change electromagnetic boundary conditions. However, these cavities have proven challenging to operate in sub-Kelvin cryogenic environments due to differential thermal contraction, low heat capacities, and low thermal conductivities. Instead, we develop an electronically tunable cavity architecture by coupling a superconducting 3D microwave cavity with a DC flux tunable SQUID. With a flux delivery system engineered to maintain high coherence in the cavity, we perform a hidden-photon dark matter search below the quantum-limited threshold. A microwave photon counting technique is employed through repeated quantum non-demolition measurements using a transmon qubit. With this device, we perform a hidden-photon search and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to ${\varepsilon}< 8.2\times 10^{-15}$ in a tunable band from 5.672 GHz to 5.694 GHz. By coupling multimode tunable cavities to the transmon, wider hidden-photon searching ranges are possible.

Title: General detectability measure
Authors: Masahito Hayashi
Abstract: Distinguishing resource states from resource-free states is a fundamental task in quantum information. We have approached the state detection problem through a hypothesis testing framework, with the alternative hypothesis set comprising resource-free states in a general context. Consequently, we derived the optimal exponential decay rate of the failure probability for detecting a given $n$-tensor product state when the resource-free states are separable states, positive partial transpose (PPT) states, or the convex hull of the set of stabilizer states. This optimal exponential decay rate is determined by the minimum of the reverse relative entropy, indicating that this minimum value serves as the general detectability measure. The key technique of this paper is a quantum version of empirical distribution.

Title: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Activation During Open Evolution
Authors: Masaya Takahashi, Jarosław K. Korbicz
Abstract: The fact that in the course of an open evolution there is, in a vast majority of cases, the creation of system-environment entanglement out of the initial coherence, has been known for many years. However, how much entanglement can be created under general assumptions has not been analyzed yet. In this work, we investigate system-environment entanglement generation under a broad and important class of interactions known as pure dephasing interactions and for arbitrary initial conditions. Our main results are the following bounds on the relative entropy of entanglement $E_r(\sigma_{SE})$ after evolution: $ C_r(\rho_S) - H(\mathcal{I}|\mathcal{M}) \leq E_r(\sigma_{SE}) \leq C_r(\rho_S) - C_r(\sigma_S) + H(\mathcal{I})$, connecting it on one side to the initial relative entropy of coherence, $C_r(\rho_S)$, and information extractable from the environment, $H(\mathcal{I}|\mathcal{M})$, and on the other side to the decoherence strength, $ C_r(\rho_S) - C_r(\sigma_S)$, making quantitatively precise the statement that larger entanglement leads to more decoherence. As an illustration, we apply our results to the spin-boson model, where a qubit interacts with a bosonic bath, showing time evolution of the entanglement and the Markovian/non-Markovian crossover. Our results help better understand and quantify the complicated correlations, produced during an open evolution, which will hopefully lead to better and new decoherence mitigation techniques.

Title: Quantum Speed Limit and Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation under Feedback Control
Authors: Hayato Yunoki, Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Fundamental trade-off relations, such as quantum speed limit and quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, describe the performance limits of quantum systems by imposing that improvements in speed or precision necessitate a substantial thermodynamic cost. Quantum feedback control, which is a pivotal technique for manipulating quantum dynamics based on measurement outcomes, is widely employed to enhance system performance. Nevertheless, its impact on these fundamental bounds remains an open question. This work elucidates this influence by establishing a theoretical framework for quantum speed limit and quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation under a paradigmatic Markovian feedback protocol. We derive general inequalities incorporating the effects of feedback control on speed and precision. Through numerical simulations on a simple two-level system and quantum error correction, a key application of quantum feedback control, we validate our derived bounds and demonstrate that feedback control can indeed improve both speed and precision beyond those achievable limits in uncontrolled systems. Next, to elucidate the mechanism behind these improvements and the qualitative difference from uncontrolled dynamics, we analyze the governing thermodynamic costs, which are the fundamental quantities that constrain speed and precision, within a simple model. Our analysis reveals that feedback can improve the time scaling order of these costs. This modification of the dynamical scaling is the origin of the qualitative performance gain, signifying that the feedback-induced improvements of performance are not merely quantitative but represent a fundamental shift. Consequently, our work offers a comprehensive understanding of how feedback control impacts the fundamental limits on the speed and precision of quantum systems, providing crucial insights for designing high-performance quantum technologies.

Title: Measurement-Based Entanglement Distillation and Constant-Rate Quantum Repeaters over Arbitrary Distances
Authors: Yu Shi, Ashlesha Patil, Saikat Guha
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum repeaters employ entanglement distillation and swapping across links using locally prepared resource states of minimal size and local Bell measurements. In this Letter, we introduce a systematic protocol for measurement-based entanglement distillation and its application to repeaters that can leverage any stabilizer code. Given a code, we explicitly define the corresponding resource state and derive an error-recovery operation based on all Bell measurement outcomes. Our approach offers deeper insights into the impact of resource state noise on repeater performance while also providing strategies for efficient preparation and fault-tolerant preservation of resource states. As an application, we propose a measurement-based repeater protocol based on quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, enabling constant-yield Bell state distribution over arbitrary distances. Numerical simulations identify a fault-tolerant threshold on the total physical error per repeater segment -- including errors on resource states, remotely generated Bell states, and Bell measurements -- and confirm that increasing the QLDPC code size further suppresses the logical error while maintaining a fixed encoding rate. This work establishes a scalable backbone for future global-scale fault-tolerant quantum networks.

Title: Mitigating Barren Plateaus in Quantum Neural Networks via an AI-Driven Submartingale-Based Framework
Authors: Jun Zhuang, Chaowen Guan
Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for various applications, yet their training is often hindered by barren plateaus (BPs), where gradient variance vanishes exponentially in terms of the qubit size. Most existing initialization-based mitigation strategies rely heavily on pre-designed static parameter distributions, thereby lacking adaptability to diverse model sizes or data conditions. To address these limitations, we propose AdaInit, a foundational framework that leverages generative models with the submartingale property to iteratively synthesize initial parameters for QNNs that yield non-negligible gradient variance, thereby mitigating BPs. Unlike conventional one-shot initialization methods, AdaInit adaptively explores the parameter space by incorporating dataset characteristics and gradient feedback, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to finding a set of effective initial parameters for QNNs. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of the submartingale-based process and empirically validate that AdaInit consistently outperforms existing initialization methods in maintaining higher gradient variance across various QNN scales. We believe this work may initiate a new avenue to mitigate BPs.

Title: Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory
Authors: Vaibhav Sharma, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.

Title: Controlling Sloppiness in Two-Phase Estimation with a Tunable Weak Measurement
Authors: Gabriele Bizzarri, Miranda Parisi, Mylenne Manrique, Ilaria Gianani, Andrea Chiuri, Matteo Rosati, Vittorio Giovannetti, Matteo G.A. Paris, Marco Barbieri
Abstract: The description of complex systems requires a progressively larger number of parameters. However, in practice, it often happens that a small subset of parameters suffices to describe the dynamics of the system itself: these combinations are usually referred to as \textit{stiff} combinations. In turn, the remaining combinations, called \textit{sloppy}, only play a minor role in the dynamics of the system, hence provide little information on it. While this effect can reduce model complexity, it can also limit the estimation precision when the stiff and sloppy combinations are unknown to the experimenter, and one is forced to estimate the potentially sloppy model parameters. We explored how such a sloppy behavior can be controlled and counteracted via quantum weak measurements in the estimation of two sequential phases. We showed that the introduction of a weak measurement of variable strength in-between the two phases allows to switch from a fully sloppy setup to a fully determined one where both phases can be estimated with quantum-limited precision. Our work provides an important insight of sloppiness detection in quantum systems, with promising applications in quantum metrology and imaging, as well as to quantum security and quantum monitoring.

Title: Optical-pumping attack on a quantum key distribution laser source
Authors: Maxim Fadeev, Anastasiya Ponosova, Qingquan Peng, Anqi Huang, Roman Shakhovoy, Vadim Makarov
Abstract: We report a new type of vulnerability in practical implementations of quantum key distribution systems. We show that it is possible to increase the pulse energy of a source laser diode not only by injection-locking it by external light near its emission wavelength of 1550 nm, but also by optically pumping it at a much shorter wavelength. We demonstrate 10% increase in pulse energy when exposing the laser diode to 1310-nm, 1.6-mW cw laser light via its fiber pigtail. This may allow an eavesdropper to steal the secret key. A possible countermeasure is to install broadband optical filters and isolators at the source's output and characterise them during the security certification.

Title: Active Leakage Cancellation in Single Qubit Gates
Authors: Ben Chiaro, Yaxing Zhang
Abstract: The ability to perform fast and accurate rotations between the computational basis states of quantum bits is one of the most fundamental requirements for building a quantum computer. Because physical qubits generally contain more than two levels, faster gates often result in a higher leakage rate outside of the computational space. In this letter, we enhance the state-of-the-art single qubit gate by introducing active leakage cancellation. This is accomplished via a second drive tone near the leakage transition such that we cancel the leakage caused by the main drive. Furthermore, we describe a measurement sequence that can be used to calibrate the parameters of this leakage cancellation drive. Finally, we apply the technique to superconducting transmon qubits, suppressing the leakage below the $10^{-5}$ level, and achieving coherence-limited gate infidelity of $7.5\times 10^{-5}$, for a 10 ns $\pi/2$ gate and 196 MHz qubit anharmonicity.

Title: No Practical Quantum Broadcasting: Even Virtually
Authors: Yunlong Xiao, Xiangjing Liu, Zhenhuan Liu
Abstract: Quantum information cannot be broadcast -- an intrinsic limitation imposed by quantum mechanics. However, recent advances in virtual operations offer new insights into the no-broadcasting theorem. Here, we focus on the practical utility and introduce sample efficiency as a fundamental constraint, requiring any practical broadcasting protocol perform no worse than the naïve approach of direct preparation and distribution. We prove that no linear process -- whether quantum or beyond -- can simultaneously uphold sample efficiency, unitary covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency. This leads to a no-practical-broadcasting theorem, which places strict limits on the practical distribution of quantum information. By applying Schur-Weyl duality, we establish the uniqueness of the canonical 1-to-$N$ virtual broadcasting map that satisfies the latter three conditions, provide its construction, and determine its sample complexity through semidefinite programming. Finally, we explore the interplay between virtual broadcasting and a quantum spacetime framework, known as the pseudo-density operator, showing that their correspondence holds only in the 1-to-2 case, underscoring the fundamental asymmetry between spatial and temporal statistics in the quantum world.

Title: Dynamics and computation in linear open quantum walks
Authors: Pedro Linck Maciel, Nadja K. Bernardes
Abstract: Open Quantum Walks (OQW) are a type of quantum walk governed by the system's interaction with its environment. We explore the time evolution and the limit behavior of the OQW framework for Quantum Computation and show how we can represent random unitary quantum channels, such as the dephasing and depolarizing channels, in this model. We also develop a simulation protocol with circuit representation for this model, which is heavily inspired by the fact that graphs represent OQW and are, thereby, local (meaning that the state in a particular node interacts only with its neighborhood). We obtain asymptotic advantages in the system's dimension, circuit depth, and CNOT count compared to other simulation methods.

Title: Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum Lyapunov control
Authors: Oleksandr Povitchan, Denys I. Bondar, Andrii G. Sotnikov
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum Lyapunov control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.

Title: Dynamically near-stable two-mode squeezing in optomechanical systems
Authors: Shi-fan Qi
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme within a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, wherein a mechanical resonator is coupled to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the open-quantum-system framework. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unstable system dynamics. Moreover, the squeezing level can surpass the maximum achievable under stable system conditions. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.

Title: Bimodule Quantum Markov Semigroups
Authors: Jinsong Wu, Zishuo Zhao
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of bimodule quantum Markov semigroups within the framework of quantum Fourier analysis. Building on the structure of quantum symmetries, we introduce the concepts of bimodule equilibrium and bimodule detailed balance conditions, which not only generalize the classical notions of equilibrium and detailed balance but also expose interesting structures of quantum channels. We demonstrate that the evolution of densities governed by the bimodule quantum Markov semigroup is the bimodule gradient flow for the relative entropy with respect to quantum symmetries. Consequently, we obtain bimodule logarithmic Sobelov inequalities and bimodule Talagrand inequality with respect to a hidden density from higher dimensional structure. Furthermore, we establish a bimodule Poincaré inequality for irreducible inclusions and relative ergodic bimodule quantum semigroups.

Title: ScarFinder: a detector of optimal scar trajectories in quantum many-body dynamics
Authors: Jie Ren, Andrew Hallam, Lei Ying, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Information geometry and entanglement under phase-space deformation through nonsymplectic congruence transformation
Authors: Shilpa Nandi, Shatarupa Maity, Pinaki Patra
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao (FR) information matrix is a central object in multiparameter quantum estimation theory. The geometry of a quantum state can be envisaged through the Riemannian manifold generated by the FR-metric corresponding to the quantum state. Interestingly, any congruence transformation $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$ in phase-space leaves the FR-distance for Gaussian states invariant. In the present paper, we investigate whether this isometry affects the entanglement in the bipartite system. It turns out that, even a simple choice of a congruence transformation, induces the entanglement in a bipartite Gaussian system. To make our study relevant to physical systems, we choose Bopp's shift in phase-space as an example of $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$, so that the results can be interpreted in terms of noncommutative (NC) phase-space deformation. We explicitly provide a quantitative measure of the dependence of separability on NC parameters. General expressions for the metric structure are also provided. The crucial point in the present piece of study is the identification of the connection of phase-space deformation-induced entanglement through a general class of congruence transformation and the identification of a trade-off relationship between the initial correlations and deformation parameters.

Title: Distillation of multipartite entangled states for arbitrary subsets of parties in noisy quantum networks of increasing size
Authors: Aitor Balmaseda, Julio I. de Vicente
Abstract: Quantum network states are multipartite states built from distributing pairwise entanglement among parties and underpin the paradigm of quantum networks for quantum information processing. In this work we introduce the problem of partial distillability in noisy quantum networks. This corresponds to the possibility of distilling by local operations and classical communication an arbitrary pure state for an arbitrary subset of parties starting from a single copy of a quantum network state of an increasing number of parties that share noisy (i.e. mixed) bipartite entangled states. Here, distillation means that the target state is obtained with fidelity as close to 1 as desired as the size of the network increases when the pairwise entangled links support a constant amount of noise. While we prove an obstruction to multipartite distillation protocols after teleportation with channels with constant noise, we show that partial distillability is indeed possible if certain well-established graph-theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity in the network grow fast enough with its size. We give necessary as well as sufficient conditions for partial distillability in terms of these parameters and we moreover provide explicit constructions of networks with partial distillability and a relatively slow connectivity growth.

Title: Quantum Mpemba effect without global symmetries
Authors: Tanmay Bhore, Lei Su, Ivar Martin, Aashish A. Clerk, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation.

Title: Optimization Strategies for Variational Quantum Algorithms in Noisy Landscapes
Authors: Vojtěch Novák, Ivan Zelinka, Václav Snášel
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a leading approach for near-term quantum computing but face major optimization challenges from noise, barren plateaus, and complex energy landscapes. We benchmarked more than fifty metaheuristic algorithms for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) using a three-phase procedure: initial screening on the Ising model, scaling tests up to nine qubits, and convergence on a 192-parameter Hubbard model. Landscape visualizations revealed that smooth convex basins in noiseless settings become distorted and rugged under finite-shot sampling, explaining the failure of gradient-based local methods. Across models, CMA-ES and iL-SHADE consistently achieved the best performance, while Simulated Annealing (Cauchy), Harmony Search, and Symbiotic Organisms Search also showed robustness. In contrast, widely used optimizers such as PSO, GA, and standard DE variants degraded sharply with noise. These results identify a small set of resilient algorithms for noisy VQE and provide guidance for optimization strategies on near-term quantum devices.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Noisy Quantum Networks
Authors: Ferran Riera-Sàbat, Jorge Miguel-Ramiro, Wolfgang Dür
Abstract: Complex quantum networks are not only hard to establish, but also difficult to simulate due to the exponentially growing state space and noise-induced imperfections. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that leverage quantum computers and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices as simulators for quantum networks, including noisy quantum devices, channels, and protocols. Rather than considering noise as an undesired property that needs to be mitigated, we demonstrate how imperfections in quantum hardware can be utilized to simulate real-world communication devices under realistic conditions beyond classical simulation capabilities. Our approach allows NISQ devices with modest noise to simulate devices with more significant imperfections enabling large-scale, detailed simulations of quantum networks, where exact error models can be treated. It also improves over direct implementation and benchmarking of real networks, as waiting times for information transmission, locality, and memory restrictions do not apply. This framework can offer advantages in flexibility, scalability, and precision, demonstrating that NISQ devices can serve as natural testbeds for complex quantum networks, and paving the way for more efficient quantum network simulations.

Title: Strategies for generating separable photon triplets in waveguides and ring resonators
Authors: Gisell Lorena Osorio, Milica Banic, Nicolás Quesada
Abstract: Photon triplet sources exhibit non-Gaussian features, a key property for applications in quantum computing and quantum information. However, spectral correlations can limit the performance and detection efficiency of these systems. Motivated by this observation, we present a theoretical analysis of the spectral properties of photon triplets generated through spontaneous third-order parametric down-conversion in photonic devices, and discuss strategies to quantify and minimize such correlations. We propose two approaches: dispersion engineering in waveguides and pump engineering in resonators. We apply these strategies in two realistic source designs, namely a high-index-contrast optical fiber and a silicon nitride microring resonator. Finally, we discuss detection strategies for probing non-Gaussian features of the triplet state. We find that it is feasible to achieve few-mode generation of photon triplets using state-of-the-art experimental systems, a crucial step toward practical applications of photon triplet sources in quantum technologies.

Title: Experimental Extraction of Coherent Ergotropy and Its Energetic Cost in a Superconducting Qubit
Authors: Li Li, Silu Zhao, Yun-Hao Shi, Kai Xu, Heng Fan, Dongning Zheng, Zhongcheng Xiang
Abstract: Quantum coherence, encoded in the off-diagonal elements of a system's density matrix, is a key resource in quantum thermodynamics, fundamentally limiting the maximum extractable work known as ergotropy. While previous experiments have isolated coherence-related contributions to work extraction, it remains unclear how coherence can be harnessed in a controllable and energy-efficient manner. Here, we experimentally investigate the role of initial-state coherence in work extraction from a superconducting transmon qubit. By preparing a variety of pure states and implementing three complementary extraction protocols, we reveal how coherence governs the partitioning of ergotropy. We find that the choice of initial state depends on the dominant decoherence channel-energy relaxation or dephasing. By further accounting for thermodynamic costs, we identify optimal initial states that maximize the efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the initial-state design provides a scalable approach to coherence control and advances the development of efficient quantum thermodynamic devices.

Title: Learning quantum tomography from incomplete measurements
Authors: Mateusz Krawczyk, Pavel Baláž, Katarzyna Roszak, Jarosław Pawłowski
Abstract: We revisit quantum tomography in an informationally incomplete scenario and propose improved state reconstruction methods using deep neural networks. In the first approach, the trained network predicts an optimal linear or quadratic reconstructor with coefficients depending only on the collection of (already taken) measurement operators. This effectively refines the undercomplete tomographic reconstructor based on pseudoinverse operation. The second, based on an LSTM recurrent network performs state reconstruction sequentially, thus is scalable. It can also optimize the measurement sequence, which suggests a no-free-lunch theorem for tomography: by narrowing the state space, we gain the possibility of more efficient tomography by learning the optimal sequence of measurements. Numerical experiments for a 2-qubit system show that both methods outperform standard maximum likelihood estimation and also scale to larger 3-qubit systems. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively learn the underlying geometry of multi-qubit states using this for their reconstruction.

Title: Efficient implementation of quantum signal processing via the adiabatic-impulse model
Authors: D.O. Shendryk, O.V. Ivakhnenko, S.N. Shevchenko, Franco Nori
Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.

Title: Local unitary decomposition of tripartite arbitrary leveled qudit stabilizer states into $p$-level-qudit EPR and GHZ state
Authors: Yat Wong, Liang Jiang
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of tripartite stabilizer states on $N$ qudits of dimension $D$, distributed across parties $A$, $B$, and $C$, under arbitrary local unitaries. Prior work by Bravyi et al. and Looi et al. showed that qubit and squarefree qudit stabilizer states can be transformed via local Clifford unitaries into tensor products of GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits [arXiv:quant-ph/0504208, arXiv:1107.1761]. We generalize this to arbitrary integer $D$ by introducing local unitaries beyond the Clifford group, enabling decomposition of prime-power qudit stabilizer states into $p$-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits. Our algorithm leverages subsystem phase matrices to characterize entanglement and applies to quantum protocols requiring efficient entanglement distribution.

Title: BenchRL-QAS: Benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms for quantum architecture search
Authors: Azhar Ikhtiarudin, Aditi Das, Param Thakkar, Akash Kundu
Abstract: We present BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for reinforcement learning (RL) in quantum architecture search (QAS) across a spectrum of variational quantum algorithm tasks on 2- to 8-qubit systems. Our study systematically evaluates 9 different RL agents, including both value-based and policy-gradient methods, on quantum problems such as variational eigensolver, quantum state diagonalization, variational quantum classification (VQC), and state preparation, under both noiseless and noisy execution settings. To ensure fair comparison, we propose a weighted ranking metric that integrates accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and training time. Results demonstrate that no single RL method dominates universally, the performance dependents on task type, qubit count, and noise conditions providing strong evidence of no free lunch principle in RL-QAS. As a byproduct we observe that a carefully chosen RL algorithm in RL-based VQC outperforms baseline VQCs. BenchRL-QAS establishes the most extensive benchmark for RL-based QAS to date, codes and experimental made publicly available for reproducibility and future advances.

Title: Bipartite and tripartite entanglement in pure dephasing relativistic spin-boson model
Authors: Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura, Erickson Tjoa
Abstract: We study non-perturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model, equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) while it is possible to find regimes with genuine GHZ-like tripartite entanglement, it is difficult find regimes where tripartite entanglement can be easily shown to be significant or classified. Result (iii), in particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a relativistic quantum field non-perturbatively requires either different probe-based techniques or variants of the UDW model. Along the way, we provide the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground states in the Fock space.

Title: Fully quantum perturbative description of correlated Stokes--anti-Stokes scattering
Authors: Raul Corrêa, Marcelo F. Santos, Carlos H. Monken, Ado Jorio
Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes--anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that a four-wave mixing-like correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation and completely characterizes the non-resonant SaS photon pair production. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.

Title: Effective 2D Envelope Function Theory for Silicon Quantum Dots
Authors: Christian W. Binder, Guido Burkard, Andrew J. Fisher
Abstract: We present a rigorous method to reduce the three-dimensional (3D) description of a quantum dot in silicon to an effective two-dimensional (2D) envelope function theory for electron spin qubits. By systematically integrating out the strongly confined vertical dimension using a Born-Oppenheimer-inspired ansatz at the envelope-function level, we derive an effective in-plane potential that faithfully captures the essential electrostatics of the full 3D system. Considering the lowest two eigenstates of the out-of-plane direction, this reduction leads to the natural and explicit emergence of the valley degree of freedom within a 2D formalism, which is derived here from first principles. We validate the accuracy of the method through comparisons with full 3D simulations and demonstrate its superiority over naive 2D slicing, particularly in the presence of interface roughness. Crucially, the reduction in dimensionality leads to substantial computational savings, making our approach particularly well suited for simulating two-electron systems, e.g., for the extraction of parameters such as the exchange coupling. Beyond its practical utility, the rigorous 2D envelope function theory that is introduced in this study incorporates valley physics in a physically grounded manner, offering conceptual clarity on the role of valley states in qubit operation and measurement.

Title: Transfer-Based Strategies for Multi-Target Quantum Optimization
Authors: Vu Tuan Hai, Bui Cao Doanh, Le Vu Trung Duong, Pham Hoai Luan, Yasuhiko Nakashima
Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-target quantum optimization, where the objective is to simultaneously optimize multiple cost functions defined over the same quantum search space. To accelerate optimization and reduce quantum resource usage, we investigate a range of strategies that enable knowledge transfer between related tasks. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage framework consisting of a training phase where solutions are progressively shared across tasks and an inference phase, where unoptimized targets are initialized based on prior optimized ones. We propose and evaluate several methods, including warm-start initialization, parameter estimation via first-order Taylor expansion, hierarchical clustering with D-level trees, and deep learning-based transfer. Our experimental results, using parameterized quantum circuits implemented with PennyLane, demonstrate that transfer techniques significantly reduce the number of required iterations while maintaining an acceptable cost value. These findings highlight the promise of multi-target generalization in quantum optimization pipelines and provide a foundation for scalable multi-target quantum optimization.

Title: Dynamic syndrome decoder in volume-law phases of hybrid quantum circuits
Authors: Dawid Paszko, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.

Title: Do quantum linear solvers offer advantage for networks-based system of linear equations?
Authors: Disha Shetty, Supriyo Dutta, Palak Chawla, Akshaya Jayashankar, Jordi Riu, Jan Nogue, K. Sugisaki, V. S. Prasannaa
Abstract: In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally connected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and arrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with a QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the scaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with the graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size growth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential advantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at least polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm considered relative to an efficient classical linear solver. Within the scope of our analyses, we observe that only 4% of the 50 considered graph families offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20% of the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we observe and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only fare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm but also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial advantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given the limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical studies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families into one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. Lastly, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that one may face even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.

Title: All you need is controlled-V: universality of a standard two-qubit gate by catalytic embedding
Authors: Robin Kaarsgaard
Abstract: A central pursuit in quantum computing is to identify the minimal resources required to achieve universality. Within the quantum circuit model, this is studied by considering the gate sets that provide the fundamental instructions from which quantum algorithms are built. However, standard gate sets such as Clifford+$T$ contain some instructions that are disproportionately powerful, obscuring the precise source of quantum computational power. While single-gate universal sets are known, these rely on rotation angles that are irrational multiples of $2\pi$, requiring fine-tuned control that is difficult to achieve on quantum hardware today. Here, we show the surprising result that the controlled-$V$ (or controlled-$\sqrt{X}$) gate, a simple two-qubit interaction previously described as "semi-classical" and already widely used in reversible logic synthesis and directly realisable on leading hardware platforms, suffices on its own to perform universal quantum computation. Our construction, based on catalytic embedding and a procedure to generate the necessary resource states, simulates standard universal gate sets with constant overhead, highlighting how the full power of quantum computation can emerge from unexpectedly simple ingredients.

Title: Fault-tolerant transformations of spacetime codes
Authors: Arthur Pesah, Austin K. Daniel, Ilan Tzitrin, Michael Vasmer
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum error-correction (QEC) have shown that it is often beneficial to understand fault-tolerance as a dynamical process, a circuit with redundant measurements that help correct errors, rather than as a static code equipped with a syndrome extraction circuit. Spacetime codes have emerged as a natural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while leveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on chain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations between them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding problems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence of two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain complexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits, fault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this framework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer codes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be transformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant properties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the underlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex constructions. Our method enables the construction of cluster states from non-CSS, subsystem, and Floquet codes, as well as from logical Clifford operations on a given code.

Title: Quantum Algorithm of the GLMY Homology on Digraphs
Authors: Yunpeng Zi, Muchun Yang, D. L. Zhou
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for topological data analysis provide significant advantage over the best classical algorithm. Different from the previous simplical complex on points cloud, the GLMY homology introduced by Alexander Grigor'yan, Yong Lin, Yuri Muranov and Shing-Tung Yau, is defined on digraph and is a arising realm in Topological Data Analysis (TDA), which attracts more and more attention recently. We propose a quantum algorithm for the GLMY homology with significant advantage over the best classical algorithm. We design a universal encoding protocol for the quantum states and boundary operators of GLMY homology on digraphs. And a property of the GLMY homology is proved for the theoretical guarantee of the quantum algorithm. The quantum algorithm for GLMY homology provides a cubic speedup in general cases, and it can provide an exponential quantum advantage in the case of the input data is given as a specification of paths.

Title: Localized degenerate solutions to the massless Dirac and Weyl equations
Authors: Georgios N. Tsigaridas, Aristides I. Kechriniotis, Christos A. Tsonos, Konstantinos K. Delibasis
Abstract: In this article we present a general class of degenerate solutions to the massless Dirac and Weyl equations, which can describe localized particles at a single or many different positions along their direction of motion. They can also describe particles with varying energy and spin. Another interesting characteristic of these solutions is that they remain unaltered in a wide range of electromagnetic 4-potentials and fields, which are calculated analytically. In addition, we describe a method for spatially separating Weyl particles based on their helicity and direction of motion using appropriate magnetic fields, given in explicit form.

Authors: Sergei Bogdanov, Alexander Preimesberger, Harsh Mishra, Dominik Hornof, Thomas Spielauer, Florian Thajer, Max Maurer, Pia Falb, Leo Stöger, Thomas Schachinger, Friedrich Bleicher, Michael S. Seifner, Isobel C. Bicket, Philipp Haslinger
Abstract: Coincidence imaging, also known as ghost imaging, is a technique that exploits correlations between two particles to reconstruct information about a specimen. The particle that relays the spatial information about the object remains completely non-interacting, while the particle used to probe the object is not spatially resolved. While ghost imaging has been primarily implemented on photonic platforms, it becomes particularly intriguing when applied to particles with fundamentally different properties, such as massive, charged electrons and massless, neutral photons, especially considering the role of both particles as cornerstones of highly advanced microscopic platforms. In this work, we investigate coincidence imaging using electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission electron microscope. Utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence setup, we demonstrate ghost imaging of complex patterns. We are able to obtain a spatial resolution down to 2 $\mu$m, paving the way for adaptation of quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron microscopy.

Title: Quantum error correction beyond $SU(2)$: spin, bosonic, and permutation-invariant codes from convex geometry
Authors: Arda Aydin, Victor V. Albert, Alexander Barg
Abstract: We develop a framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes and logical gates for three types of spaces -- composite permutation-invariant spaces of many qubits or qudits, composite constant-excitation Fock-state spaces of many bosonic modes, and monolithic nuclear state spaces of atoms, ions, and molecules. By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces. We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\ell_1$ codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with the code length $N$ by constructing $\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance larger than the known constructions.

Title: A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus
Authors: Tobias Fischbach, Pierre Talbot, Pascal Bourvry
Abstract: Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.

Abstract: It is shown that generators of single-particle, translation-invariant Lindblad operators on the infinite line are unitarily equivalent to direct integrals of finite-range bi-infinite Laurent operator with finite-range perturbations. This representation enables rigorous calculation of spectra for local dissipation such as dephasing and incoherent hopping, and yields proofs of gaplessness, absence of residual spectrum and a condition for convergence of finite volume spectra to their infinite volume counterparts. The analysis relies on new results on the spectra of direct integrals of non-normal operators which may be of independent interest.

Title: Notes on the type classification of von Neumann algebras
Authors: Jonathan Sorce
Abstract: These notes provide an explanation of the type classification of von Neumann algebras, which has made many appearances in recent work on entanglement in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. The goal is to bridge a gap in the literature between resources that are too technical for the non-expert reader, and resources that seek to explain the broad intuition of the theory without giving precise definitions. Reading these notes will provide you with: (i) an argument for why "factors" are the fundamental von Neumann algebras that one needs to study; (ii) an intuitive explanation of the type classification of factors in terms of renormalization schemes that turn unnormalizable positive operators into "effective density matrices;" (iii) a mathematical explanation of the different types of renormalization schemes in terms of the allowed traces on a factor; (iv) an intuitive characterization of type I and II factors in terms of their "standard forms;" and (v) a list of some interesting connections between type classification and modular theory, including the argument for why type III$_1$ factors are believed to be the relevant ones in quantum field theory. None of the material is new, but the pedagogy is different from other sources I have read; it is most similar in spirit to the recent work on gravity and the crossed product by Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington, and Witten.

Title: Hilbert space representation for quasi-Hermitian position-deformed Heisenberg algebra and Path integral formulation
Authors: Thomas Katsekpor, Latévi M. Lawson, Prince K. Osei, Ibrahim Nonkané
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.

Title: The persistence of spin coherence in a crystalline environment
Authors: Gerald Curran III, Zachary Rex, Casper X. Wilson, Luke J. Weaver, Ivan Biaggio
Abstract: We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order of 150 ps in rubrene.

Title: Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion
Authors: Sebastian Paeckel
Abstract: The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.

Title: Casimir effect in magnetic dual chiral density waves
Authors: Daisuke Fujii, Katsumasa Nakayama, Kei Suzuki
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.

Title: Magnetic moments in the Poynting theorem, Maxwell equations, Dirac equation, and QED
Authors: Peter J Mohr
Abstract: The role of magnetic moments in classical and quantum electrodynamics is examined in this work. The effects are described by a classical extended Poynting theorem and extended Maxwell equations and by conventional quantum electrodynamics expressed in terms of electromagnetic fields. Both descriptions take into account energetics of the interaction of magnetic moments with inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We show how magnetic moment effects are included in either version of electrodynamics and that these apparently different formulations can give consistent results. In either case, we express the interactions in terms of electromagnetic fields only, avoiding use of a vector potential. The main focus is on magnetic dipole interactions, and magnetic monopole interactions are not considered.

Title: Eigenstate thermalization to non-monotonic distributions in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases
Authors: Vladimir A. Yurovsky (School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University), Amichay Vardi (Department of Chemistry, Ben-Gurion University and ITAMP, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.

Title: Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure
Authors: Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda, Kouichi Okunishi, Kenji Harada, Tomotoshi Nishino
Abstract: Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.

Title: Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect
Authors: Kamran Behnia
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.

Title: Error bounds on the universal Lindblad equation in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has the desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors from several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation remain small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Nonperturbative Formulation of Resonances in Quantum Mechanics Based on Exact WKB Method
Authors: Okuto Morikawa, Shoya Ogawa
Abstract: We study quasi-stationary states in quantum mechanics using the exact Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB) analysis as a nonperturbative framework. Whereas previous works focused mainly on stable systems, we explore unstable states such as resonances. As a concrete example, we analyze the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, which exhibits barrier resonance. This model allows exact solutions, enabling a direct comparison with exact WKB predictions. We provide a simple analytic picture of resonance and demonstrate consistency between exact and WKB-based results, extending the applicability of exact WKB analysis to nonpolynomial potentials.

Title: Symmetry resolved out-of-time-order correlators of Heisenberg spin chains using projected matrix product operators
Authors: Martina Gisti, David J. Luitz, Maxime Debertolis
Abstract: We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.

Title: Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality in $τ^+ τ^-$ at the LHC using Machine Learning for Neutrino Reconstruction
Authors: Yulei Zhang, Bai-Hong Zhou, Qi-Bin Liu, Tong Arthur Wu, Shu Li, Tao Han, Shih-Chieh Hsu, Matthew Low
Abstract: Experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have accumulated an unprecedented amount of data corresponding to a large variety of quantum states. Although searching for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics remains a high priority for the LHC program, precision measurements of the physical processes predicted in the Standard Model continue to lead us to a deeper understanding of nature at high energies. We carry out detailed simulations for the process $pp \to \tau^+\tau^- X$ to perform quantum tomography and to measure the quantum entanglement and the Bell nonlocality of the $\tau^+\tau^-$ two qubit state, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. By using advanced machine learning techniques for neutrino momentum reconstruction, we achieve precise measurements of the full spin density matrix, a critical advantage over previous studies limited by reconstruction challenges for missing momenta. Our analysis reveals a clear observation of Bell nonlocality with high statistical significance, surpassing 5$\sigma$, establishing $\tau^+ \tau^-$ as an ideal system for quantum information studies in high-energy collisions. Given its experimental feasibility and the high expected sensitivity for Bell nonlocality, we propose that $\tau^+ \tau^-$ should be regarded as the new benchmark system for quantum information studies at the LHC, complementing and extending the insights gained from the $t\bar{t}$ system.

Title: Observation of Self-Bound Droplets of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules
Authors: Siwei Zhang, Weijun Yuan, Niccolò Bigagli, Haneul Kwak, Tijs Karman, Ian Stevenson, Sebastian Will
Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.

Title: The Non-Abelian Casimir Effect for Plates, Symmetrical Tube and Box on the Lattice
Authors: B. A. Ngwenya, A. K. Rothkopf, W. A. Horowitz
Abstract: We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D in the confined and deconfined phase. For the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D are explored and we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical tube and symmetrical box is attractive. The Casimir potential for the tube differs from the massless non-interacting scalar field theory prediction, where a repulsive Casimir potential is expected. Unlike the parallel plate geometry where the plate-size is fixed, in the case of the tube and box, the sizes of the faces forming the walls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We propose various methods that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating the boundaries. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a deconfined phase does not alter the Casimir potential. This observation is consistent with prior work suggesting that the region inside the walls is a boundary induced deconfined phase.

Title: Quantum spacetime from constraints: wave equations and fields
Authors: Tommaso Favalli
Abstract: In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schrödinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.

Title: Effective delocalization in the one-dimensional Anderson model with stealthy disorder
Authors: Carlo Vanoni, Boris L. Altshuler, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length via the perturbation theory expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength $W$, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Unlike uncorrelated disorder, for which the localization length $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2}$ to leading order for small W, the leading order terms in the perturbation expansion of $\xi$ for stealthy disordered systems vanish identically for a progressively large number of terms as $\chi$ increases such that $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2n}$ with arbitrarily large $n$. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results may serve as a first step in investigating the role of stealthy disorder in quantum systems, which is of both theoretical and experimental relevance.

Title: Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Dimitrios Charamis, Manas Kulkarni, Jorge Kurchan, Laura Foini
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.

Title: A State-Specific Iterative Decoupling Scheme Based on Perturbation Theory for Low-Energy Electronic States
Authors: Oussama Bindech, Saad yalouz, Vincent Robert
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a selective and scalable extension of the multi-step Rayleigh-Schrodinger and Brillouin-Wigner perturbative scheme (see arXiv:2408.16505), designed to efficiently access the low-energy spectrum of molecular systems. The method proceeds by combining successive effective Hamiltonian diagonalizations inspired by second-order Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory, with a Brillouin-Wigner correction applied to individually optimized states using an updated partitioning of the Hamiltonian. At each step, a zeroth-order state is identified and progressively decoupled from the remaining higher-lying states, thereby enabling a well-conditioned Brillouin-Wigner expansion for the energy correction. In contrast to previous approaches, the method selectively targets a small number of low-lying states, significantly reducing the numerical overhead while maintaining spectroscopic accuracy. The robustness of the method is demonstrated on the LiH and H4 molecules, where accurate excitation energies are obtained for the lowest singlet states using compact model spaces, confirming its potential for realistic applications.

Title: VQEzy: An Open-Source Dataset for Parameter Initialization in Variational Quantum Eigensolvers
Authors: Chi Zhang, Mengxin Zheng, Qian Lou, Hui Min Leung, Fan Chen
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, whose performance is highly sensitive to parameter initialization. Although recent machine learning-based initialization methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are typically restricted to a single domain, contain only a few hundred instances, and lack complete coverage of Hamiltonians, ansatz circuits, and optimization trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VQEzy, the first large-scale dataset for VQE parameter initialization. VQEzy spans three major domains and seven representative tasks, comprising 12,110 instances with full VQE specifications and complete optimization trajectories. The dataset is available online, and will be continuously refined and expanded to support future research in VQE optimization.

Title: Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder
Authors: Kadir Çeven, Lukas Peinemann, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.

Title: Dimer-driven multiple reentrant localization with composite potential
Authors: Pei-Jie Chang, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed reentrant localization transitions in quasi-periodic one-dimensional lattices, where the competition between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder plays a central role. Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions.
