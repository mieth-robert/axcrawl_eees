Title: Simulated outperforms quantum reverse annealing in mean-field models
Authors: Christopher L. Baldwin
Abstract: Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) has been proposed as an improvement to conventional quantum annealing for solving optimization problems, in which one takes advantage of an initial guess at the solution to suppress problematic phase transitions. Here we interpret the performance of ARA through its effects on the free energy landscape, and use the intuition gained to introduce a classical analogue to ARA termed ``simulated reverse annealing'' (SRA). This makes it more difficult to claim that ARA provides a quantum advantage in solving a given problem, as not only must ARA succeed but the corresponding SRA must fail. As a solvable example, we analyze how both protocols behave in the infinite-range (non-disordered) $p$-spin model. Through both the thermodynamic phase diagrams and explicit dynamical behavior, we establish that the quantum algorithm has no advantage over its classical counterpart: SRA succeeds not only in every case where ARA does but even in a narrow range of parameters where ARA fails.

Title: Closed-loop calculations of electronic structure on a quantum processor and a classical supercomputer at full scale
Authors: Tomonori Shirakawa, Javier Robledo-Moreno, Toshinari Itoko, Vinay Tripathi, Kento Ueda, Yukio Kawashima, Lukas Broers, William Kirby, Himadri Pathak, Hanhee Paik, Miwako Tsuji, Yuetsu Kodama, Mitsuhisa Sato, Constantinos Evangelinos, Seetharami Seelam, Robert Walkup, Seiji Yunoki, Mario Motta, Petar Jurcevic, Hiroshi Horii, Antonio Mezzacapo
Abstract: Quantum computers must operate in concert with classical computers to deliver on the promise of quantum advantage for practical problems. To achieve that, it is important to understand how quantum and classical computing can interact together, and how one can characterize the scalability and efficiency of hybrid quantum-classical workflows. So far, early experiments with quantum-centric supercomputing workflows have been limited in scale and complexity. Here, we use a Heron quantum processor deployed on premises with the entire supercomputer Fugaku to perform the largest computation of electronic structure involving quantum and classical high-performance computing. We design a closed-loop workflow between the quantum processors and 152,064 classical nodes of Fugaku, to approximate the electronic structure of chemistry models beyond the reach of exact diagonalization, with accuracy comparable to some all-classical approximation methods. Our work pushes the limits of the integration of quantum and classical high-performance computing, showcasing computational resource orchestration at the largest scale possible for current classical supercomputers.

Title: Quantum-dot single photon source performance with off-resonant pulse preparation schemes
Authors: Gavin Crowder, Lora Ramunno, Stephen Hughes
Abstract: The preparation of photonic qubits in the excited state is an integral part of the performance of an on-demand single photon source (SPS). Conventional resonant excitation, an excellent approach to maximize the coherence and indistinguishability of the SPS, often requires polarization filtering to remove the pump signal and isolate the qubit emission, but this results in an inherent 50\% hit to the efficiency. Recent excitation schemes strategically try to exploit pulses that excite the qubit while avoiding spectral overlap to bypass this required filtering. In this work, we compare three such pumping schemes to quantify the important SPS figures-of-merit for off-resonant quantum dot schemes, using: (i) a symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulse, (ii) a notch-filtered adiabatic rapid passage (NARP) pulse, and (iii) a swing up of the quantum emitter population (SUPER) pulse. Due to large instantaneous pulse strengths, the dichromatic pulse suffers from phonon-induced dephasing which can lower the SPS performance by up to 50\%. In contrast, the NARP and SUPER pulses are shielded from phonon coupling to differing degrees but both maintain excellent SPS performance. The SUPER pulse can lose significant efficiency if there is variance in its constituent pulses' amplitude, pulse width, or frequency, while the NARP pulse, though potentially more difficult to realize in experiments, is robust against variance in the pulse preparation.

Title: Local perception operators and classicality: new tools for old tests
Authors: Rohit Kishan Ray
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality is often judged by violations of Bell-type inequalities for a given state. The computation of such violations is a global task, requiring evaluation of global correlations and subsequent testing against a Bell functional. We ask instead: when is a given state local (classical)? We formalize this question via local perception operators (LPOs) that compress global observables into locally accessible statistics, and we derive two complementary witnesses -- one implementable by a single party with classical side information, one intrinsically two-sided. These tools revisit familiar Bell scenarios from a new operational angle. We show how the witness leads to state-aware constraints that depend on local marginals and measurement geometry, with natural specializations to canonical scenarios. The resulting criteria are built from first moments and standard projective measurements and provide a way to certify compatibility with local hidden variable explanations for the LPO-processed data in regimes where conventional Bell violations may be inconclusive.

Title: Optimal transfer of entanglement in oscillator chains in non-Markovian open systems
Authors: Da-Wei Luo, Edward Yu, Ting Yu
Abstract: We considered the transfer of continuous-variable entangled states in coupled oscillator chains embedded in a generic environment. We demonstrate high-fidelity transfer via optimal control in two configurations - a linear chain and an X-shaped chain. More specifically, we use the Krotov optimization algorithm to design control fields that achieve the desired state transfer. Under the environmental memory effects, the Krotov algorithm needs to be modified, since the dissipative terms in non-Markovian dynamics are generally governed by the time-dependent system Hamiltonian. Remarkably, we can achieve high-fidelity transfer by simply tuning the frequencies of the oscillators while keeping the coupling strength constant, even in the presence of open-system effects. For the system under consideration, we find that quantum memory effects can aid in the transfer of entanglement and show improvement over the memoryless case. In addition, it is possible to target a range of entangled states, making it unnecessary to know the parameters of the initial state beforehand.

Title: Quantum Qomrades: Catalysts in Resource Theories and Memories in Dynamic Programming
Authors: Jeongrak Son
Abstract: Quantum information theory explores the limits of manipulating quantum states. While auxiliary systems often enhance information processing, a systematic explanation for their power has been lacking. This thesis addresses this gap by investigating the underlying sources of strength in using auxiliary systems. We then apply these insights to practical problems in quantum computing and devise an algorithmic paradigm leveraging auxiliary systems. The first part examines catalysts -- auxiliary systems that remain unaltered -- and identifies three advantages: a memory effect, the ability to fine-tune catalyst states, and their role as seed states for resource distribution. The second part presents a strategy for solving recursive problems in quantum algorithms by employing auxiliary states as memories, achieving an exponential reduction in circuit depth at the cost of increased width. The findings in this thesis would facilitate future research into fundamental problems like resource interconversion and practical ones like optimal quantum circuit synthesis.

Title: Free-space multi-user quantum network with high key rate
Authors: Ayan Kumar Nai, G. K. Samanta
Abstract: Emergent quantum networks are the essential ingredient for securely connecting multiple users worldwide, extensively deployed in both fibre and free-space. An essential element is the multiplexing of entanglement to multiple users, overcoming the peer-to-peer restriction of quantum key distribution (QKD), so far successfully shown in fibre-based architectures. Here, we demonstrate a free-space quantum space division multiplexing architecture using just one entanglement source to realise a fully connected twelve-channel quantum network for seamless QKD connections between six users. The network achieves record coincidence rates exceeding $3 \times 10^{4}$ s$^{-1}$ between any pair of nodes on the network, for sifted key rate of over 400 kbps. Our approach overcomes the active switching hurdle that has hindered the free-space deployment of quantum multiplexing, is fully passive, easily scalable to more nodes and compatible with fibre-based integration, thus opening a new path to scalable and resource-efficient quantum networks that utilise free-space links.

Title: Lost and found charge in quantum batteries
Authors: Debanjan Dey Sarkar, Mallika Mondal, Preeti Parashar, Tamal Guha
Abstract: Quantum batteries are prone to loosing their stored charge, when interacting with a thermal environment. However, getting a limited assistance from the thermal environment, is it possible to recover the charge back, in a reusable form? Here we answer this question affirmatively, leveraging a non-trivial usage of the seemingly useless thermal environment to recycle the quantum batteries. The framework involves two different kind of assistance from thermal environment - one by accessing only the thermal particle, actively participating in the interaction; and the other, involving assistance from an additional purifying subsystem for the thermal environment, bearing a passive role to the interaction. Interestingly, we report that the difference between the retrieved charge between these two degrees of assistance characterizes the amount of entanglement generated by the thermal operation between the quantum battery and the purifying subsystem for the thermal environment.

Title: Hierarchical Quantum Optimization for Large-Scale Vehicle Routing: A Multi-Angle QAOA Approach with Clustered Decomposition
Authors: Shreetam Dash, Shreya Banerjee, Prasanta K. Panigrahi
Abstract: We present a quantum optimization methodology for solving large-scale Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a combination of standard and Multi-Angle Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (MA-QAOA). The approach decomposes 13-locations based VRP problems through clustering into three balanced clusters of 4 nodes each, then applies standard QAOA for intra-cluster Open Loop Traveling Salesman Problem (OTSP) and MA-QAOA for inter-cluster VRP routing. Validation across 10 distinct datasets demonstrates that standard QAOA consistently identifies optimal solutions for intra-cluster routing, which is matching classical Gurobi optimizer results exactly. More significantly, MA-QAOA with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation(SPSA) optimizer demonstrates competitive performance against classical optimization methods, ultimately converging towards a solution that closely approximates the classical Gurobi optimizer this http URL clustered decomposition enables quantum optimization of problem sizes generally larger than previous quantum VRP implementations, advancing from 4-6 location limits to 13-location problems while maintaining solution quality.

Title: Quantum Field Theory and the Measurement Problem in Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Avi Levy, Meir Hemmo
Abstract: We propose a novel solution to the measurement problem based on quantum field theory and Haag's theorem. According to our proposal in elementary interactions where the particles content is changed, the temporal evolution is non unitary. These interactions which are almost instantaneous lead to a genuine stochastic selection of an outcome subspace that has a distinct particles content but can be a superposition of momentum states, spin states, etc.

Title: Quantum dynamics in lattices in presence of bulk dephasing and a localized source
Authors: Tamoghna Ray, Katha Ganguly, Dario Poletti, Manas Kulkarni, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of quantum systems subjected to a localized fermionic source in the presence of bulk dephasing. We consider two classes of one-dimensional lattice systems: (i) a non-interacting lattice with nearest-neighbor and beyond, i.e., long-ranged (power-law) hopping, and (ii) a lattice that is interacting via short-range interactions modeled by a fermionic quartic Hamiltonian. We study the evolution of the local density profile $n_i(t)$ within the system and the growth of the total particle number $N(t)$ in it. For case (i), we provide analytical insights into the dynamics of the nearest-neighbor model using an adiabatic approximation, which relies on assuming faster relaxation of coherences of the single particle density matrix. For case (ii), we perform numerical computations using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm and analyze the density profile and the growth exponent in $N(t)$. Our detailed study reveals an interesting interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and various environmentally induced mechanisms in open quantum systems, such as local source and bulk dephasing. It brings out rich dynamics, including universal dynamical scaling and anomalous behavior across various time scales and is of relevance to various quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Principle of Minimal Heating for Collapse and Hybrid Gravitational Models
Authors: Nicolò Piccione
Abstract: Energy nonconservation is a prominent, testable prediction of collapse and hybrid classical-quantum gravitational models. Without smearing of certain operators, the associated heating (or energy increase) rate diverges, yet the smearing distribution is arbitrary and, on scales much larger than the smearing length $r_C$, much of the phenomenology is expected to be independent of this choice. We propose to resolve this arbitrariness by a simple principle: for a fixed $r_C$, select the distribution that minimizes the heating rate. Conceptually, this should identify the minimal deviation from standard quantum mechanics and provide models that, once experimentally refuted, would strongly disfavor all variants with different distributions. We apply this approach to the most investigated collapse models: GRW, CSL, and DP. Notably, the Gaussian is optimal only for the GRW case. Finally, we apply it to the Tilloy-Diósi hybrid classical-quantum model of Newtonian gravity, leading to the minimally deviating variant of it. This version of the model is entirely determined by only one free parameter (the smearing length $r_C$) and, if experimentally refuted, would strongly disfavor any other version of it.

Title: Kostant relation in filtered randomized benchmarking for passive bosonic devices
Authors: David Amaro-Alcalá
Abstract: We reduce the cost of the current bosonic randomized benchmarking proposal. First, we introduce a filter function using immanants. With this filter, we avoid the need to compute Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Our filter uses the same data as the original, although we propose a distinct data collection process that requires a single type of measurement. Furthermore, we argue that weak coherent states and intensity measurements are sufficient to proceed with the characterization. Our work could then allow simpler platforms to be characterized and simplify the data analysis process.

Title: No, classical gravity does not entangle quantized matter fields
Authors: Lajos Diósi
Abstract: In their recent work [Nature,646,813(2025)], Aziz and Howl claim that classical (unquantized) gravity produces entanglement of quantized matter if matter is treated within quantum field theory which is, no doubt, our ultimate theory to use. However, an elementary quantum field re-calculation of the authors' example shows that there is no entangling effect.

Abstract: We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to 100 kHz and collective couplings exceeding 10 MHz. The resonators were made interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single microwire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process has been used to infer the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a 50 nm wide constriction fabricated at the center of its single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by side frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.

Title: Adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian quantum systems with non-degenerate real eigenvalues: A proof following Kato's approach
Authors: Minyi Huang, Ray-Kuang Lee
Abstract: The adiabatic theorem is one of the most interesting and significant theorem in quantum mechanics. In 1950, T. Kato gave an elegant proof of this result [1]. However, the validation of adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian quantum systems is unrevealed. In this paper, by following Kato' approach, we prove rigorously that the adiabatic theorem is still valid for non-Hermitian systems with non-degenerate real eigenvalues. Moreover, our proof utilizes the complex Berry phase, instead of the orthogonal projections used in Kato's work.

Title: Enhancing Kerr-Cat Qubit Coherence with Controlled Dissipation
Authors: Francesco Adinolfi, Daniel Z. Haxell, Alessandro Bruno, Laurent Michaud, Venus Hasanuzzaman Kamrul, Preeti Pandey, Alexander Grimm
Abstract: Quantum computing crucially relies on maintaining quantum coherence for the duration of a calculation. Bosonic quantum error correction protects this coherence by encoding qubits into superpositions of noise-resilient oscillator states. In the case of the Kerr-cat qubit (KCQ), these states derive their stability from being the quasi-degenerate ground states of an engineered Hamiltonian in a driven nonlinear oscillator. KCQs are experimentally compatible with on-chip architectures and high-fidelity operations, making them promising candidates for a scalable bosonic quantum processor. However, their bit-flip time must increase further to fully leverage these advantages. Here, we present direct evidence that the bit-flip time in a KCQ is limited by leakage out of the qubit manifold and experimentally mitigate this process. We coherently control the leakage population and measure it to be > 9%, twelve times higher than in the undriven system. We then cool this population back into the KCQ manifold with engineered dissipation, identify conditions under which this suppresses bit-flips, and demonstrate increased bit-flip times up to 3.6 milliseconds. By employing both Hamiltonian confinement and engineered dissipation, our experiment combines two paradigms for Schrödinger-cat qubit stabilization. Our results elucidate the interplay between these stabilization processes and indicate a path towards fully realizing the potential of these qubits for quantum error correction.

Title: Pseudo quantum advantages in perceptron storage capacity
Authors: Fabio Benatti, Masoud Gharahi, Giovanni Gramegna, Stefano Mancini, Vincenzo Parisi
Abstract: We investigate a generalized quantum perceptron architecture characterized by an oscillating activation function with a tunable frequency ranging from zero to infinity. Employing analytical techniques from statistical mechanics, we derive the optimal storage capacity and demonstrate that the classical result is recovered in the limit of vanishing frequency. As the frequency increases, however, the architecture exhibits enhanced quantum storage capabilities. Notably, this improvement stems solely from the specific form of the activation function and, in principle, could be emulated within a classical framework. Accordingly, we refer to this enhancement as a pseudo quantum advantage.

Title: ECCentric: An Empirical Analysis of Quantum Error Correction Codes
Authors: Aleksandra Świerkowska, Jannik Pflieger, Emmanouil Giortamis, Pramod Bhatotia
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for building scalable quantum computers, but a lack of systematic, end-to-end evaluation methods makes it difficult to assess how different QEC codes perform under realistic conditions. The vast diversity of codes, an expansive experimental search space, and the absence of a standardized framework prevent a thorough, holistic analysis. To address this, we introduce ECCentric, an end-to-end benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate QEC codes across the full quantum computing stack. ECCentric is designed to be modular, extensible, and general, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of QEC code families under varying hardware topologies, noise models, and compilation strategies. Using ECCentric, we conduct the first systematic benchmarking of major QEC code families against realistic, mid-term quantum device parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals that intra-QPU execution significantly outperforms distributed methods, that qubit connectivity is a far more critical factor for reducing logical errors than increasing code distance, and that compiler overhead remains a major source of error. Furthermore, our findings suggest that trapped-ion architectures with qubit shuttling are the most promising near-term platforms and that on noisy devices, a strategic and selective application of QEC is necessary to avoid introducing more errors than are corrected. This study provides crucial, actionable insights for both hardware designers and practitioners, guiding the development of fault-tolerant quantum systems.

Title: In situ calibration of unitary operations during quantum error correction
Authors: Jonathan Kunjummen, Jacob M. Taylor
Abstract: Quantum error correction uses the measurement of syndromes and classical decoding algorithms to estimate the location and type of errors while protecting the encoded quantum bits. Here we consider how prior information and Bayesian updates can play a critical role in improving the performance of QEC in the scenario of a particularly noisy qubit. This allows for leveraging even distance codes, which typically are less valued in QEC, to handle the noisy qubit, changing the power-law scaling of the logical error rate with the baseline physical error rate. A crucial component of this is updating the prior by real time feeding of decoder outputs into a approximate Kalman filter. Thus our approach provides a bootstrap to the actual error rates. We show this via simulation of the full closed-loop system: starting from uniform priors, the update procedure gradually learns site-specific error rates, enabling the decoder to outperform a fixed-prior baseline. In turn, we show that this enables in situ calibration of unitary operations via injection of gate set tomography operations with only moderate overhead in the more typical scenario of low noise qubits.

Title: Robust Quantum State Generation in Symmetric Spin Networks
Authors: Andre Luiz P. de Lima, Luke S. Baker, Anatoly Zlotnik, Andrew K. Harter, Michael J. Martin, Jr-Shin Li
Abstract: In this work, we consider a parameterized Ising model with long-range symmetric pairwise interactions on a network of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles. The system is designed with symmetric dynamics, allowing for the reduction of the state space to a subspace defined by the set of Dicke states. We propose a method for designing robust electromagnetic amplitude pulses based on a moment quantization approach. The introduced parameter accounts for uncertainties in the electromagnetic field, resulting in a family of distinct Hamiltonians. By employing a discretized moment-based quantization technique, we design a control pulse capable of simultaneously steering an infinite collection of dynamical systems to compensate for parameter variations. This approach benefits from the duality between the infinite-dimensional parameterized system and its finite-dimensional trucnated moment dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of this method in achieving states of significant interest in quantum sensing, including the GHZ and W states.

Title: Attosecond quantum optical interferometry
Authors: Javier Rivera-Dean, Lidija Petrovic, Maciej Lewenstein, Philipp Stammer
Abstract: In this work, we explore the scheme of attosecond quantum interferometry (AQI), the quantum optical version of classical attosecond interferometry, which allows to measure quantum optical properties on the attosecond time-scale. We develop how the scheme of AQI can be used for quantum state engineering of the emitted harmonics, by varying the relative phase of a two-color driving field, and further enables one to manipulate the field correlations as well as their entanglement characteristics. In addition, this scheme allows us to learn properties of the phase-space distribution of the harmonic quantum state, by means of measuring an attosecond quantum tomography trace. This serves as a new type of protocol for in situ attosecond measurements of quantum optical observables. With this, we achieve to further connect all-optical attosecond measurement schemes with quantum optics, allowing for a rich manifold of observations.

Title: Characterizing QUBO Reformulations of the Max-k-Cut Problem for Quantum Computing
Authors: Adrian Harkness, Hamidreza Validi, Ramin Fakhimi, Illya V. Hicks, Tamás Terlaky, Luis F. Zuluaga
Abstract: Quantum computing offers significant potential for solving NP-hard combinatorial (optimization) problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers. One way to tap into this potential is by reformulating combinatorial problems as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The solution of the QUBO reformulation can then be addressed using adiabatic quantum computing devices or appropriate quantum computing algorithms on gate-based quantum computing devices. In general, QUBO reformulations of combinatorial problems can be readily obtained by properly penalizing the violation of the problem's constraints in the original problem's objective. However, characterizing tight (i.e., minimal but sufficient) penalty coefficients for this purpose is critical for enabling the solution of the resulting QUBO in current and near-term quantum computing devices. Along these lines, we here focus on the (weighted) max $k$-cut problem, a fundamental combinatorial problem with wide-ranging applications that generalizes the well-known max cut problem. We present closed-form characterizations of tight penalty coefficients for two distinct QUBO reformulations of the max $k$-cut problem whose values depend on the (weighted) degree of the vertices of the graph defining the problem. These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to make quantum computing a viable tool for solving combinatorial problems at scale. We support our theoretical results with illustrative examples. Further, we benchmark the proposed QUBO reformulations to solve the max $k$-cut problem on a quantum computer simulator.

Title: Spatial Incompatibility Witnesses for Quantum Temporal Correlations
Authors: Xiangjing Liu, Harshit Verma, Yunlong Xiao, Oscar Dahlsten, Mile Gu
Abstract: We introduce a witness-based framework for certifying quantum temporal correlations via the pseudo-density matrix (PDM) formalism, which is a spatiotemporal generalization of the density matrix. We define spatial incompatibility (SI) as the minimum distance between a PDM and valid density matrices. For trace-norm distance, we show that this reduces to the PDM's negativity, enabling the construction of experimentally accessible SI witnesses. We derive a tight bound on SI for quantum channels and analyze the respective roles of state and channel coherence in witnessing SI. Crucially, SI witnesses certify temporal correlations across a strictly broader class of channels than Leggett-Garg (LG) tests. Our approach, unlike the LG framework, exploits incompatible measurements that generate coherence through state disturbance. We further show that channels satisfying the LG inequality for incoherent states can still exhibit detectable SI, demonstrating that measurement disturbance enhances the certification of temporal correlations.

Title: Open-Source Highly Parallel Electromagnetic Simulations for Superconducting Circuits
Authors: David Sommers, Prasanna Pakkiam, Zach Degnan, Chun-Ching Chiu, Divita Gautam, Yi-Hsun Chen, Arkady Fedorov
Abstract: Electromagnetic simulations form an indispensable part of the design and optimization process for superconducting quantum devices. Although several commercial platforms exist, open-source alternatives optimized for high-performance computing remain limited. To address this gap, we introduce SQDMetal, a Python-based API that integrates Qiskit Metal (IBM), Gmsh, Palace (AWS), and Paraview (Kitware) into an open-source, highly parallel simulation workflow for superconducting quantum circuits. SQDMetal enables accurate, efficient, and scalable simulations while remaining community-driven and free from commercial constraints. In this work, we validate SQDMetal through mesh convergence studies which benchmark SQDMetal against COMSOL Multiphysics and Ansys, demonstrating excellent agreement for both eigenmode and electrostatic (capacitance) simulations. Furthermore, we simulate superconducting resonators and transmon qubits, showing reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. SQDMetal also supports advanced capabilities, including Hamiltonian extraction via the energy participation ratio (EPR) method, incorporation of kinetic inductance effects, and full 3D modelling of device geometry for improved predictive accuracy. By unifying open-source tools into a single framework, SQDMetal lowers the barriers to entry for community members seeking to access high-performance simulations to assist in the design and optimization of their devices.

Abstract: To fulfill their promise, quantum networks must transform from isolated testbeds into scalable infrastructures for distributed quantum applications. In this paper, we present a prototype orchestrator for the Argonne Quantum Network (ArQNet) testbed that leverages design principles of software-defined networking (SDN) to automate typical quantum communication experiments across buildings in the Argonne campus connected over deployed, telecom fiber. Our implementation validates a scalable architecture supporting service-level abstraction of quantum networking tasks, distributed time synchronization, and entanglement verification across remote nodes. We present a prototype service of continuous, stable entanglement distribution between remote sites that ran for 12 hours, which defines a promising path towards scalable quantum networks.

Title: Quantum Deep Learning Still Needs a Quantum Leap
Authors: Hans Gundlach, Hrvoje Kukina, Jayson Lynch, Neil Thompson
Abstract: Quantum computing technology is advancing rapidly. Yet, even accounting for these trends, a quantum leap would be needed for quantum computers to mean- ingfully impact deep learning over the coming decade or two. We arrive at this conclusion based on a first-of-its-kind survey of quantum algorithms and how they match potential deep learning applications. This survey reveals three important areas where quantum computing could potentially accelerate deep learning, each of which faces a challenging roadblock to realizing its potential. First, quantum algorithms for matrix multiplication and other algorithms central to deep learning offer small theoretical improvements in the number of operations needed, but this advantage is overwhelmed on practical problem sizes by how slowly quantum computers do each operation. Second, some promising quantum algorithms depend on practical Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), which is underdeveloped. Finally, there are quantum algorithms that offer large theoretical advantages, but which are only applicable to special cases, limiting their practical benefits. In each of these areas, we support our arguments using quantitative forecasts of quantum advantage that build on the work by Choi et al. [2023] as well as new research on limitations and quantum hardware trends. Our analysis outlines the current scope of quantum deep learning and points to research directions that could lead to greater practical advances in the field.

Authors: Shotaro Shirai, Shinichi Inoue, Shuhei Tamate, Rui Li, Yasunobu Nakamura, Atsushi Noguchi
Abstract: Entangling gates between neighboring physical qubits are essential for quantum error correction. Implementing them in an all-microwave manner simplifies signal routing and control apparatus of superconducting quantum processors. We propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-microwave controlled-Z (CZ) gate that achieves high fidelity while suppressing residual ZZ interactions. Our approach utilizes a fixed-frequency transmon coupler and multi-path coupling, thereby sufficiently reducing the net transverse interaction between data transmons to suppress residual ZZ interactions. The controlled phase arises from the dispersive frequency shift of the $\fggetxt$ transition between the coupler and one of the data transmons conditioned on the state of the other data transmon. Driving the transitions at the midpoint of two dispersively shifted resonance frequencies induces state-dependent geometric phases to achieve the CZ gate. Crucially, with this scheme, we can maintain a small net transverse interaction between two data transmons while increasing the coupling between the data and coupler transmons to accelerate the CZ-gate speed. Additionally, we measure the coupler state after the gate to detect a subset of decoherence-induced failures that occur during the gate operation. These events constitute erasure errors with known locations, enabling erasure-aware quantum error-correcting codes to improve future logical qubit performance.

Title: Super-resolved reconstruction of single-photon emitter locations from $g^{(2)}(0)$ maps
Authors: Sonali Gupta, Amit Kumar, Vikas S Bhat, Sushil Mujumdar
Abstract: Single-photon sources are vital for emerging quantum technologies. In particular, Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising due to their room-temperature stability, long spin coherence, and compatibility with nanophotonic structures. A key challenge, however, is the reliable identification of isolated NV centers, since conventional confocal microscopy is diffraction-limited and cannot resolve emitter distributions within a focal spot. Besides, the associated intensity scanning is a time-expensive procedure. Here, we introduce a raster-scanned $g^{(2)}(0)$ mapping technique combined with an inversion-based reconstruction algorithm. By directly measuring local photon antibunching across the field of view, we extract the effective emitter number within each focal spot and reconstruct occupancy maps on a sub-focal-spot grid. This enables recovery of the number and spatial distribution of emitters within regions smaller than the confocal focal spot, thereby offering possibilities of going beyond the diffraction limit. Our simulations confirm robust reconstruction of NV-center distributions. The method provides a practical diagnostic tool for locating single-photon sources in an efficient and accurate manner, at much lesser time and effort compared to conventional intensity scanning. It offers valuable feedback for nanophotonic device fabrication, supporting more precise and scalable integration of NV-based quantum photonic technologies.

Title: Strongly coupled giant-atom waveguide quantum electrodynamics
Authors: Zong-Wei Wu, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: Describing systems of superconducting atoms coupled to a continuum of photonic modes at multiple separated locations in a waveguide, waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) with giant atoms has emerged as a promising platform for realizing quantum interconnect. Such systems have been reported to exhibit rich phenomena that differ from those of natural atoms. Going beyond the widely used Born-Markov and Wigner-Weisskopf approximations, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of one and two giant atoms interacting with a waveguide formed by an array of coupled resonators. We discover that the diverse dynamical behaviors of the giant atoms are intrinsically determined by the energy spectrum of the composite system consisting of the giant atoms and the photonic modes in the waveguide. As long as one and more bound states are present in the energy spectrum, their excited-state probabilities, respectively, tend to stable finite values and lossless Rabi-like oscillations with frequencies proportional to the differences of the bound-state eigenenergies. Our result provides an insightful guideline for suppressing the decoherence of giant atoms and facilitates the development of quantum interconnect devices using giant-atom waveguide QED.

Title: Multi-stage quantum walks for finding Ising ground states
Authors: Asa Hopkins, Viv Kendon
Abstract: One way to approximate a quantum annealing schedule is to use multiple quantum walks chained together, without intermediate measurements, to produce a multi-stage quantum walk (MSQW). Previous work has shown that MSQW is better than QAOA (quantum alternating operator ansatz) for solving optimization tasks using multiple stages [Gerblich et al, arXiv:2407.06663]. In this work, we develop an efficient heuristic for choosing the free parameters in MSQW, and use it to obtain improved scaling compared to single stage quantum walks. We show numerically that the heuristic works well for easy problems with a large minimum energy gap, giving a scaling polynomial in the number of stages, leading to an overall algorithm that scales polynomially in time. For harder problems, the scaling breaks down such that adding more stages decreases the success probability, leading to an overall scaling that is exponential in time, as expected. Our methods are general and can be applied to any optimization problem to obtain good annealing schedules.

Title: Light-induced Frequency Shift and Relaxation of Ground-State 3He via Metastability-Exchange Collisions
Authors: L. Y. Wu, H. Yan
Abstract: Metastability-exchange collisions (MECs) lie at the heart of metastability-exchange optical pumping (MEOP) in 3He, enabling the transfer of polarization from the metastable state to the ground state, as well as the optical detection of nuclear magnetic resonance. Leveraging MECs, optically pumped 3He nuclear magnetometers have been developed since the earliest demonstrations of MEOP. However, it also induces an additional frequency shift and relaxation of the nuclear spin precession, thereby limiting the sensitivity of the magnetometer. In this work, we identify a new source of frequency shift and relaxation in the 3He nuclear spin, arising from the light shift. This effect arises from an MEC-mediated interaction between light and the nucleon spin. We develop a theoretical model to describe this light-induced effect and highlight its significance in low magnetic fields. This effect is experimentally demonstrated, and its dependence on various parameters -- including magnetic field strength, light intensity, and wavelength -- is investigated. Our result provides a better understanding of the frequency shift and relaxation of 3He spin precession under MEOP conditions. Moreover, our experiment reveals an MEC-mediated coupling between the 3He nuclear spin and light, which may indicate the feasibility of MEC-assisted optical manipulation of 3He nuclear spins at the quantum level, as proposed in several theoretical schemes.

Title: Distinct Critical Scaling of Quantum Fisher Information in a Quantum Rabi Triangle System
Authors: Yuyang Tang, Yu Yang, Min An, Fuli Li
Abstract: Critical properties of a quantum system are recognized as valuable resources for quantum metrology. In this work, we investigate the criticality-enhanced sensing in a quantum Rabi triangle system, which exhibits multiple phases. Around the phase boundary, enhanced parameter estimation precision can be achieved by tuning either the scaled coupling strength or the hopping phase controlled by an artificial magnetic field. We observe that the quantum Fisher information shows divergent scaling near different quantum phase transition points, characterized by distinct critical exponents. When the resource consumption is taken into account, we find that the divergent quantum Fisher information can reach the Heisenberg limit. Furthermore, we propose a measurement scheme of the average photon number and the quantum Cramér-Rao bound can be saturated.

Title: Non-Markovian dynamics in nonstationary Gaussian baths
Authors: Vladisalv Sukharnikov, Stasis Chuchurka, Frank Schlawin
Abstract: Building on the standard hierarchy of pure states (HOPS) approach, we construct a generalized formulation suitable for open quantum systems interacting with nonstationary Gaussian baths, potentially extending its applicability to nonequilibrium baths. This is achieved by extending the conventional exponential decomposition of bath correlation functions (BCF) to allow explicitly time-dependent forms. We demonstrate the method's performance on two examples of nonstationary squeezed reservoirs generated via uniform squeezing and degenerate parametric amplification. Benchmarking against the associated hierarchy of master equations shows that HOPS achieves superior efficiency under hierarchy truncation. In cases where each contribution in the BCF expansion can be associated with an independent physical bath, the formalism can be simplified in a pseudomode representation which is more efficient in a strongly non-Markovian regime. Our results highlight HOPS as a versatile and powerful tool for simulating open quantum systems in nonstationary baths, with potential applications ranging from squeezed light-matter interactions to driven quantum materials and dissipative phase transitions.

Title: Entanglement estimation of Werner states with a quantum extreme learning machine
Authors: Hajar Assil, Abderrahim El Allati, Gian Luca Giorgi
Abstract: Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELMs) have emerged as a potent tool for various quantum information processing tasks. We present a QELM protocol for estimating the amount of entanglement in Werner states. The protocol requires the generation of a sequence of random Werner states, which are then combined with a reservoir state and evolved using an Ising Hamiltonian. A set of observables based on the Bloch basis is constructed and employed to train the system to recognize unseen features. To assess the protocol's robustness, noise is introduced into the input states, and the system's performance under these noisy conditions is analyzed. Additionally, the influence of the magnetic field parameter within the Ising Hamiltonian on the estimation accuracy is investigated.

Title: Fast and Robust Remote Two-Qubit Gates on Distributed Qubits
Authors: Yunan Li, Xi Zhang, Weixin Zhang, Ruonan Guo, Yu Zhang, Xinsheng Tan, Yang Yu
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing offers a potential solution to the complexity of superconducting chip hardware layouts and error correction algorithms. High-quality gates between distributed chips enable the simplification of existing error correction algorithms. This article proposes and demonstrates a remote quantum geometric gate scheme via parametric modulation. Our scheme inherits the intrinsic robustness of geometric phases. Meanwhile, by employing gradient-based optimization algorithms(Adaptive Moment Estimation) from deep learning, we design control waveforms that significantly suppress population leakage. We experimentally realize the rapid remote SWAP and $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gates with high fidelity, completing operation in about 30 ns. The gate error of SWAP ($\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$) is 1.16\% (0.91\%) after excluding the effect of energy relaxation. The simulation demonstrate that this scheme can be implemented in the distributed chips connected by cables extending several meters. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in enabling modular quantum processors, offering a promising path toward the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Quantum Blackwell's Ordering and Differential Privacy
Authors: Ayanava Dasgupta, Naqueeb Ahmad Warsi, Masahito Hayashi
Abstract: We develop a framework for quantum differential privacy (QDP) based on quantum hypothesis testing and Blackwell's ordering. This approach characterizes $(\eps,\delta)$-QDP via hypothesis testing divergences and identifies the most informative quantum state pairs under privacy constraints. We apply this to analyze the stability of quantum learning algorithms, generalizing classical results to the case $\delta>0$. Additionally, we study privatized quantum parameter estimation, deriving tight bounds on the quantum Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the hockey-stick divergence.

Title: Non-unitary Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions: Modelling, Simulation, and Evaluation under Open Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Mohammadreza Vali, Hossein Aghababa, Nasser Yazdani
Abstract: Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) provide hardware-level security by exploiting intrinsic randomness to produce device-unique responses. However, machine learning and side-channel attacks increasingly undermine their classical assumptions, calling for new approaches to ensure unforgeability. Quantum mechanics naturally supports this goal through intrinsic randomness and the no-cloning theorem, motivating the study of Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs). Yet, existing QPUF models often assume ideal unitary dynamics, neglecting non-unitary effects such as decoherence and dissipation that arise in real quantum devices. This work introduces a new class of non-unitary QPUFs that leverage open quantum system dynamics as a foundation for security. Three architectures are proposed: the Dissipative QPUF (D-QPUF), which uses amplitude damping as an entropy source; the Measurement-Feedback QPUF (MF-QPUF), which employs mid-circuit measurements and conditional unitaries; and the Lindbladian QPUF (L-QPUF), which models Markovian noise via the Lindblad master equation and Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. Simulation results show that these non-unitary designs achieve strong uniqueness, uniformity, and unforgeability, with controllable reliability trade-offs from stochastic noise. The L-QPUF, in particular, exhibits exponential modeling resistance under limited challenge-response access. By reframing environmental noise as a constructive resource, this work establishes a framework for noise-aware quantum hardware authentication and highlights non-unitary evolution as a viable foundation for post-quantum security.

Title: Quantum Energy Teleportation under Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Environments
Authors: Xiaokun Yan, Kun Zhang, Jin Wang
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET), implemented via local operations and classical communication, enables carrier-free energy transfer by exploiting quantum resources. While QET has been extensively studied theoretically and validated experimentally in various quantum platforms, enhancing energy output for mixed initial states, as the system inevitably interacts with environments, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we study QET performance in a two-qubit system coupled to equilibrium or nonequilibrium reservoirs. We derive an analytical expression for the energy output in terms of the system Hamiltonian eigenstates, enabling analysis of energy output for mixed states. Using the Redfield master equation, we systematically examine the effects of qubit detuning, nonequilibrium temperature difference, and nonequilibrium chemical potential difference on the energy output. We find that the energy output for mixed states often follows that of the eigenstate with the highest population, and that nonequilibrium environments can enhance the energy output in certain parameter regimes.

Title: Graph Structured Operator Inequalities and Tsirelson-Type Bounds
Authors: James Tian
Abstract: We establish operator norm bounds for bipartite tensor sums of self-adjoint contractions. The inequalities generalize the analytic structure underlying the Tsirelson and CHSH bounds, giving dimension-free estimates expressed through commutator and anticommutator norms. A graph based formulation captures sparse interaction patterns via constants depending only on graph connectivity. The results link analytic operator inequalities with quantum information settings such as Bell correlations and network nonlocality, offering closed-form estimates that complement semidefinite and numerical methods.

Title: Security in a prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution protocol when the receiver uses weak values to guess the sender's bits
Authors: Rajendra Singh Bhati
Abstract: The weak values and weak measurement formalism were initially limited to pure states, which were later extended to mixed states, leading to intriguing applications in quantum information processing tasks. Weak values are considered to be abstract properties of systems describing a complete picture between successive measurements in the two-state vector formalism (TSVF). The remarkable achievements of the weak value formalism in experimental quantum mechanics have persuaded most quantum physicists that it is impeccable. However, we explore a scenario where the formalism of weak values for mixed states is employed in a quantum communication protocol, but discover that it generates inaccurate outcomes. This reinforces our previous conclusion that the weak values may not be elements of the reality of weak measurements, contrary to what the proponents of weak values proposed.

Title: Operator-aware shadow importance sampling for accurate fidelity estimation
Authors: Hyunho Cha, Sangwoo Hong, Jungwoo Lee
Abstract: Estimating the fidelity between an unknown quantum state and a fixed target is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Direct fidelity estimation (DFE) enables this without full tomography by sampling observables according to a target-dependent distribution. However, existing approaches face notable trade-offs. Grouping-based DFE achieves strong accuracy for small systems but suffers from exponential scaling, and its applicability is restricted to Pauli measurements. In contrast, classical-shadow-based DFE offers scalability but yields lower accuracy on structured states. In this work, we address these limitations by developing two classes of operator-aware shadow importance sampling algorithms using informationally overcomplete positive operator-valued measures. Instantiated with local Pauli measurements, our algorithm improves upon the grouping-based algorithms for Haar-random states. For structured states such as the GHZ and W states, our algorithm also eliminates the exponential memory requirements of previous grouping-based methods. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across Haar-random, GHZ, and W targets.

Title: Measurement Strategies and Estimation Precision in Quantum Network Tomography
Authors: Athira Kalavampara Raghunadhan, Matheus Guedes De Andrade, Don Towsley, Indrakshi Dey, Daniel Kilper, Nicola Marchetti
Abstract: This work investigates measurement strategies for link parameter estimation in Quantum Network Tomography (QNT), where network links are modeled as depolarizing quantum channels distributing Werner states. Three distinct measurement schemes are analyzed: local Z-basis measurements (LZM), joint Bell-state measurements (JBM), and pre-shared entanglement-assisted measurements (PEM). For each scheme, we derive the probability distributions of measurement outcomes and examine how noise in the distributed states influences estimation precision. Closed-form expressions for the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) are obtained, and the estimation precision is evaluated through the Quantum Cramer-Rao Bound (QCRB). Numerical analysis reveals that the PEM scheme achieves the lowest QCRB, offering the highest estimation accuracy, while JBM provides a favorable balance between precision and implementation complexity. The LZM method, although experimentally simpler, exhibits higher estimation error relative to the other schemes; however, it outperforms JBM in high-noise regimes for single-link estimation. We further evaluate the estimation performance on a four-node star network by comparing a JBM-only configuration with a hybrid configuration that combines JBM and LZM. When two monitors are used, the JBM-only strategy outperforms the hybrid approach across all noise regimes. However, with three monitors, it achieves a lower QCRB only in low-noise regimes with heterogeneous links. The results establish a practical basis for selecting measurement strategies in experimental quantum networks, enabling more accurate and scalable link parameter estimation under realistic noise conditions.

Title: Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation
Authors: Ruicheng Bao
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.

Title: Non-Gaussianity and security of entanglement-based QKD
Authors: Mariia Gumberidze, Vladyslav C. Usenko
Abstract: We theoretically analyse the relation between non-Gaussianity and security of entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, namely device-independent (DI) and entanglement-based BB$84$. A similar analysis has already been made for prepare-and-measure (P\&M) protocols \cite{Lasota2017}. In addition, we consider imperfect detection with dark counts and limited efficiency. We assume a perfect source of entangled Bell states as produced by quantum-dot type sources, depolarisation in the channel and different noise statistics, namely thermal and Poissonian. We consider single-photon avalanche photodiodes (SPAD) and photon number resolving detectors (PNRD) and use their respective criteria for non-Gaussianity. The results show cross-regions for both security and non-Gaussianity, hence, the possibility to conclude about the suitability of a given channel for secret key distribution. Our results can be useful as a pre-check for the implementation of QKD protocols.

Title: Multi-objective optimization by quantum annealing
Authors: Andrew D. King
Abstract: An important task in multi-objective optimization is generating the Pareto front -- the set of all Pareto-optimal compromises among multiple objective functions applied to the same set of variables. Since this task can be computationally intensive even for small problems, it is a natural target for quantum optimization. Indeed, this problem was recently approached using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on an IBM gate-model processor. Here we compare these QAOA results with quantum annealing on the same two input problems, using the same methodology. We find that quantum annealing vastly outperforms not just QAOA run on the IBM processor, but all classical and quantum methods analyzed in the previous study. On the harder problem, quantum annealing improves upon the best known Pareto front. This small study reinforces the promise of quantum annealing in multi-objective optimization.

Title: The Born Ultimatum: Conditions for Classical Surrogation of Quantum Generative Models with Correlators
Authors: Mario Herrero-Gonzalez, Brian Coyle, Kieran McDowall, Ross Grassie, Sjoerd Beentjes, Ava Khamseh, Elham Kashefi
Abstract: Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs) are powerful quantum generative models that sample according to the Born rule, with complexity-theoretic evidence suggesting potential quantum advantages for generative tasks. Here, we identify QCBMs as a quantum Fourier model independently of the loss function. This allows us to apply known dequantization conditions when the optimal quantum distribution is available. However, realizing this distribution is hindered by trainability issues such as vanishing gradients on quantum hardware. Recent train-classical, deploy-quantum approaches propose training classical surrogates of QCBMs and using quantum devices only for inference. We analyze the limitations of these methods arising from deployment discrepancies between classically trained and quantumly deployed parameters. Using the Fourier decomposition of the Born rule in terms of correlators, we quantify this discrepancy analytically. Approximating the decomposition via distribution truncation and classical surrogation provides concrete examples of such discrepancies, which we demonstrate numerically. We study this effect using tensor-networks and Pauli-propagation-based classical surrogates. Our study examines the use of IQP circuits, matchcircuits, Heisenberg-chain circuits, and Haldane-chain circuits for the QCBM ansatz. In doing so, we derive closed-form expressions for Pauli propagation in IQP circuits and the dynamical Lie algebra of the Haldane chain, which may be of independent interest.

Title: Giant shot noise in superconductor/ferromagnet junctions with orbital-symmetry-controlled spin-orbit coupling
Authors: César González-Ruano, Chenghao Shen, Pablo Tuero, Coriolan Tiusan, Yuan Lu, Jong E. Han, Igor Žutić, Farkhad G. Aliev
Abstract: By measuring the shot noise, a consequence of charge quantization, in superconductor/insulator/ferromagnet (V/MgO/Fe) junctions, we discover a giant increase, orders of magnitude larger than expected. The origin of this giant noise is a peculiar realization of a superconducting proximity effect, where a simple superconductor influences its neighbors. Our measurements reveal largely unexplored implications of orbital-symmetry-controlled proximity effects. The importance of orbital symmetries and the accompanying spin-orbit coupling is manifested by an unexpected emergence of another superconducting region strikingly different from the parent superconductor. Unlike vanadium's common spin-singlet superconductivity, the broken inversion symmetry in V/MgO/Fe junctions and the resulting interfacial spin-orbit coupling leads to the formation of spin-triplet superconductivity across the ferromagnetic iron. Here we show that the enhanced shot noise, known from Josephson junctions with two superconductors, is measured even in a single superconductor, this discovery motivates revisiting how the spin-orbit coupling and superconducting proximity effects can transform many materials.

Title: QuantumBench: A Benchmark for Quantum Problem Solving
Authors: Shunya Minami, Tatsuya Ishigaki, Ikko Hamamura, Taku Mikuriya, Youmi Ma, Naoaki Okazaki, Hiroya Takamura, Yohichi Suzuki, Tadashi Kadowaki
Abstract: Large language models are now integrated into many scientific workflows, accelerating data analysis, hypothesis generation, and design space exploration. In parallel with this growth, there is a growing need to carefully evaluate whether models accurately capture domain-specific knowledge and notation, since general-purpose benchmarks rarely reflect these requirements. This gap is especially clear in quantum science, which features non-intuitive phenomena and requires advanced mathematics. In this study, we introduce QuantumBench, a benchmark for the quantum domain that systematically examine how well LLMs understand and can be applied to this non-intuitive field. Using publicly available materials, we compiled approximately 800 questions with their answers spanning nine areas related to quantum science and organized them into an eight-option multiple-choice dataset. With this benchmark, we evaluate several existing LLMs and analyze their performance in the quantum domain, including sensitivity to changes in question format. QuantumBench is the first LLM evaluation dataset built for the quantum domain, and it is intended to guide the effective use of LLMs in quantum research.

Title: Rydberg Single Photon Detection for Probing 0.1-10 meV Dark Matter with BREAD
Authors: Abhishek Banerjee, Reza Ebadi, Surjeet Rajendran
Abstract: We introduce a Rydberg-based single photon detector (SPD) for probing dark matter in the 0.1-10 meV mass range (20 GHz-2 THz). The Rydberg SPD absorbs photons produced and focused by the BREAD dish antenna and trades them for free, detectable electrons. At the lower end of the mass range, photons drive Rydberg-Rydberg transitions, which are read out via state-selective ionization. At higher masses, they directly ionize the Rydberg atoms.

Title: Chimeric states of matter: Meissner effect without superconductivity
Authors: Michael J Landry, Mingda Li
Abstract: Symmetry is central to how we classify phases of matter: solids break spatial translations, superfluids break particle-number conservation, and superconductors "break" gauge symmetry. Mixed anomalies involving higher-form symmetries, however, present a generalization of spontaneous symmetry breaking that admits a wider and more versatile set of possibilities. We introduce chimeric states of matter, in which aspects of broken and unbroken phases coexist. We find that the Meissner effect -- usually regarded as the defining hallmark of superconductivity -- can occur in media that are resistive or even insulating when probed by electric fields. We demonstrate this by constructing an effective field theory of "symmetry chimerization" and propose that Josephson junction networks could provide a laboratory realization. These results broaden the landscape of possible phases of matter, showing that physical media can mix features of symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken states in a single substrate.

Title: Hadronic scattering in (1+1)D SU(2) lattice gauge theory from tensor networks
Authors: João Barata, Juan Hormaza, Zhong-Bo Kang, Wenyang Qian
Abstract: We present a first real-time study of hadronic scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using tensor-network techniques. Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson--meson, meson--baryon, and baryon--baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.

Title: Magnetic field in vacuum of quantum spinor matter induced by a cosmic string in three-dimensional space
Authors: Yu.I. Pylypchuk, P.O. Nakaznyi, O.V. Barabash, A.O. Zaporozhchenko, V.M. Gorkavenko
Abstract: A linear magnetic topological defect (cosmic string) is modeled as a magnetic flux-carrying tube that is impenetrable to external spinor matter. The matter field is quantized in the background of this tube, with the most general set of boundary conditions ensuring both the tube's impenetrability and the self-adjointness of the Dirac Hamiltonian operator. We compute the induced vacuum magnetic flux along the tube in (3+1)-dimensional space-time. It was shown that the requirement for the total induced vacuum magnetic flux to be finite restricts the admissible boundary conditions to only one choice: the MIT quark bag boundary condition. The dependence of the effect on the transverse size of the tube and the flux inside the tube was also analyzed.

Title: Universality in Ionic Three-body Systems Near an Ion-atom Feshbach Resonance
Authors: Jacek Gȩbala, Michał Tomza, José P. D'Incao
Abstract: We calculate the recombination rates into quantum bound channels across a series of ion-atom scattering lengths. Our results confirms the breakdown of the theory of 'van-der-Waals universality' and the effective range theory, both of which fail to describe the recombination rates in ion-atom systems for large scattering lengths. We investigate this phenomenon further -- through calculations we observe the appearance of weakly bound ionic triatomic molecules. We compare the spectrum and lifetimes of these trimers to neutral system and present results indicating that such trimers could be stable with respect to modern experiments.

Title: Connected correlations in cold atom experiments
Authors: Thomas Chalopin, Igor Ferrier-Barbut, Thierry Lahaye, Antoine Browaeys, David Clément
Abstract: The recent development of single-atom-resolved probes has made full counting statistics measurements accessible in quantum gas experiments. This capability provides access to high-order moments of physical observables, from which cumulants, or equivalently connected correlations, can be precisely determined. Through a selection of recent cold atom experiments, this article illustrates the significance of connected correlations in characterizing ensembles of interacting quantum particles. First, non-zero connected correlations of order n > 2 unambiguously identify non-Gaussian quantum states. Second, connected correlations of order n identify clusters made of n elements whose statistical properties are irreducible to combinations of smaller clusters. The ability to identify such multi-particle clusters offers a an interesting perspective on strongly correlated quantum states of matter at the microscopic scale.

Title: Short-time dynamics in phase-ordering kinetics
Authors: Leila Moueddene, Malte Henkel
Abstract: Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and $\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent. These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.

Title: Quantum optical nonreciprocity on a magnetic-free photonic chip
Authors: Jierui Hu, Hao Yuan, Joshua Akin, Shanhui Fan, Kejie Fang
Abstract: Breaking reciprocity enables new regimes of light--matter interaction with broad implications for fundamental physics and emerging quantum technologies. Although various approaches have been explored to achieve optical nonreciprocity, realizing it at the single-photon level has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate magnetic-free optical nonreciprocity -- including both isolation and circulation -- in the quantum regime, enabled by efficient and noiseless all-optical frequency conversion on an integrated photonic chip. Our device preserves the quantum coherence and entanglement of the input photons while delivering exceptional performance parameters, meeting the stringent demands of classical and quantum information systems. This realization of quantum optical nonreciprocity in a scalable photonic platform opens a pathway toward directional quantum communication and noise-resilient quantum networks.

Title: Towards Quantum Algorithms for the Optimization of Spanning Trees: The Power Distribution Grids Use Case
Authors: Carsten Hartmann, Nil Rodellas-Gràcia, Christian Wallisch, Thiemo Pesch, Frank K. Wilhelm, Dirk Witthaut, Tobias Stollenwerk, Andrea Benigni
Abstract: Optimizing the topology of networks is an important challenge across engineering disciplines. In energy systems, network reconfiguration can substantially reduce losses and costs and thus support the energy transition. Unfortunately, many related optimization problems are NP hard, restricting practical applications. In this article, we address the problem of minimizing losses in radial networks, a problem that routinely arises in distribution grid operation. We show that even the computation of approximate solutions is computationally hard and propose quantum optimization as a promising alternative. We derive two quantum algorithmic primitives based on the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) that differ in the sampling of network topologies: a tailored sampling of radial topologies and simple sampling with penalty terms to suppress non-radial topologies. We show how to apply these algorithmic primitives to distribution grid reconfiguration and quantify the necessary quantum resources.

Title: Correspondence Between Ising Machines and Neural Networks
Authors: Andrew G. Moore
Abstract: Computation with the Ising model is central to future computing technologies like quantum annealing, adiabatic quantum computing, and thermodynamic classical computing. Traditionally, computed values have been equated with ground states. This paper generalizes computation with ground states to computation with spin averages, allowing computations to take place at high temperatures. It then introduces a systematic correspondence between Ising devices and neural networks and a simple method to run trained feed-forward neural networks on Ising-type hardware. Finally, a mathematical proof is offered that these implementations are always successful.

Abstract: Majorana zero modes are anyons obeying non-Abelian exchange statistics distinct from fermions or bosons. While significant progresses have been achieved in the past two decades in searching for these exotic excitations in solid-state systems, their non-Abelian nature remains unverified, as definitive proof requires braiding operations. Here, we report preliminarily experimental advances in creating, manipulating, and exchanging the presumed Majorana zero modes in an envelope-shaped Josephson device composed of multiple trijunctions on a topological insulator surface. We observed the signatures of in-gap states migration consistent with the expectations of the Fu-Kane model, supporting the realization of an exchange operation. This work would establish a critical pathway toward ultimately braiding Majorana zero modes in the Fu-Kane scheme of topological quantum computation.

Title: Hyperentanglement in Nanophotonic Systems with Discrete Rotational Symmetry
Authors: Lior Fridman, Amit Kam, Amir Sivan, Guy Sayer, Stav Lotan, Guy Bartal
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate hyperentanglement between photons carrying angular momen- tum in nanophotonic systems with discrete rotational symmetry. Coupling free-space photons into surface plasmon polaritons by a polygonal-shaped grating restricts the basis of the generated near-field modes to a finite set, thus creating a new mechanism for spatial mode entanglement. By encoding the incoming photons with spin and orbital angular momenta, we find that the system preserves the high-dimensional Hilbert space, in contrast to rotationally symmetric nanophotonic platforms, where the inseparability of spin and orbital degrees of freedom results in loss of information. We further show that by properly engineering the phase of the photons to conform to the polygonal boundary conditions, we achieve a new scheme for generating hyperentangled states, utilizing both the vector-field nature of the nanophotonic modes and the finite basis of states in polygonal bound- ary conditions. Our approach paves the way for on-chip quantum communication by expanding the Hilbert space used in computation.

Title: Symmetry-resolved genuine multi-entropy: Haar random and graph states
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka, Simon Lin
Abstract: We study the symmetry-resolved genuine multi-entropy, a measure that captures genuine multi-partite entanglement, in Haar random states and random graph states in the presence of a conserved quantity. For Haar random states, we derive explicit formulae for the genuine multi-entropy under a global $U(1)$ symmetry in the thermodynamic limit, and find that its dependence on subsystem sizes closely resembles that of fully Haar random states without a conserved charge. We also perform numerical analyses, focusing on spin systems for both Haar random and graph states. For random graph states, our numerical analyses reveal distinctive features of their multi-partite entanglement structure and we contrast them with the Haar random case.

Title: Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: Siyi Yang, Yi-Ming Ding, Zheng Yan
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.

Title: Quantum Network Tomography for General Topology with SPAM Errors
Authors: Xuchuang Wang, Matheus Guedes De Andrade, Guus Avis, Yu-zhen Janice Chen, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Don Towsley
Abstract: The goal of quantum network tomography (QNT) is the characterization of internal quantum channels in a quantum network from external peripheral operations. Prior research has primarily focused on star networks featuring bit-flip and depolarizing channels, leaving the broader problem -- such as QNT for networks with arbitrary topologies and general Pauli channels -- largely unexplored. Moreover, establishing channel identifiability remains a significant challenge even in simplified quantum star networks. In the first part of this paper, we introduce a novel network tomography method, termed Mergecast, in quantum networks. We demonstrate that Mergecast, together with a progressive etching procedure, enables the unique identification of all internal quantum channels in networks characterized by arbitrary topologies and Pauli channels. As a side contribution, we introduce a subclass of Pauli channels, termed bypassable Pauli channels, and propose a more efficient unicast-based tomography method, called BypassUnicast, for networks exclusively comprising these channels. In the second part, we extend our investigation to a more realistic QNT scenario that incorporates state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. We rigorously formulate SPAM errors in QNT, propose estimation protocols for such errors within QNT, and subsequently adapt our Mergecast approaches to handle networks affected by SPAM errors. Lastly, we conduct NetSquid-based simulations to corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed protocols in identifying internal quantum channels and estimating SPAM errors in quantum networks. In particular, we demonstrate that Mergecast maintains good performance under realistic conditions, such as photon loss and quantum memory decoherence.

Title: Multistate iterative qubit coupled cluster (MS-iQCC): a quantum-inspired, state-averaged approach to ground- and excited-state energies
Authors: Robert A. Lang, Shashank G. Mehendale, Ilya G. Ryabinkin, Artur F. Izmaylov
Abstract: We introduce the multistate iterative qubit coupled cluster (MS-iQCC) method, a quantum-inspired algorithm that runs efficiently on classical hardware and is designed to predict both ground and excited electronic states of molecules. Accurate excited-state energetics are essential for interpreting spectroscopy and chemical reactivity, but standard electronic structure methods are either too computationally expensive for larger systems or lose reliability in the presence of strong electron correlation. MS-iQCC addresses this challenge by simultaneously optimizing multiple electronic states in a single, state-averaged procedure that treats ground and excited states on equal footing. This removes the energetic bias that is introduced when excited states are computed one at a time and constrained to remain orthogonal to previously optimized states. The approach supports multireference electronic structure by allowing multideterminantal initial guesses and by adaptively building a compact exponential ansatz from a pool of qubit excitation generators. We apply MS-iQCC to H$_4$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and C$_2$, including strongly correlated geometries, and observe robust convergence of all targeted state energies to chemically meaningful accuracy across their potential energy surfaces.

Title: Screening in the Heitler-London Model: Revisiting the Bonding and Antibonding States of the Hydrogen Molecule
Authors: Washington P. da Silva, Daniel Vieira, Jonas Maziero, Edgard P. M. Amorim
Abstract: The present manuscript revisits one of the earliest approaches to treating molecular systems within the Schrödinger formalism of quantum mechanics: the Heitler-London (HL) model. Originally proposed in 1927 and based on a linear combination of atomic orbitals, the HL model provided a foundational description of covalent bonds and has served as the basis for numerous variational methods. Focusing on the hydrogen molecule, we begin by revisiting the analytical calculations of the original HL model, from which the qualitative physics of bonding and antibonding states can be obtained. Subsequently, we propose including electronic screening effects directly in the original HL wave function. We then compare our proposal with variational quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC) calculations, whose trial wave function allows us to optimize the electronic screening potential as a function of the inter-proton distance. We obtain the bond length, binding energy, and vibrational frequency of the H$_2$ molecule. Beyond revisiting this foundational approach in quantum mechanics, our proposal can serve as improved input for constructing new, but still analytically simple, variational wave functions to describe dissociation or bond formation.

Title: A nonequilibrium quantum Otto engine enhanced via multi-parameter control
Authors: Raymon S. Watson, Karen V. Kheruntsyan
Abstract: Advances in experimental control of interacting quantum many-body systems with multiple tunable parameters--such as ultracold atomic gases and trapped ions--are driving rapid progress in quantum thermodynamics and enabling the design of quantum thermal machines. In this work, we utilize a sudden quench approximation as a means to investigate the operation of a quantum thermodynamic Otto cycle in which multiple parameters are simultaneously controllable. The method applies universally to many-body systems where such control is available, and therefore provides general principles for investigating their operation as a working medium in quantum thermal machines. We investigate application of this multi-parameter quench protocol in an experimentally realistic one-dimensional Bose gas as the working fluid, with control over both the frequency of an external harmonic trap and the interparticle interaction strength. We derive a general inequality for the net work of this two-parameter Otto cycle, demonstrating that this protocol out-performs its constituent single-parameter Otto cycles when operating as an engine, and additionally implying an enhancement to the coefficient of performance when operating as a refrigerator. Further, we demonstrate that multi-parameter control can exhibit dramatically improved performance of the Otto engine when compared not only to single-parameter constituent quenches but also to the combined effect of its constituent engine cycles.

Title: Emergent Area Operators in the Boundary
Authors: Ronak M Soni
Abstract: In some cases in two and three bulk dimensions without bulk local degrees of freedom, I look for area operators in a fixed boundary theory. In each case, I define an exact quantum error-correcting code (QECC) and show that it admits a central decomposition. However, the area operator that arises from this central decomposition vanishes. A non-zero area operator, however, emerges after coarse-graining. The expectation value of this operator approximates the actual entanglement entropy for a class of states that do not form a linear subspace. These non-linear constraints can be interpreted as semiclassicality conditions. The coarse-grained area operator is ambiguous, and this ambiguity can be matched with that in defining fixed-area states.

Title: Broadly Tunable Quantum Enhanced Raman Microscopy for Advancing Bioimaging
Authors: Dmitrii Akatev, Yijian Meng, Jonathan Brewer, Maria Chekhova, Ulrik L. Andersen, Mikael Lassen
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy has emerged as a powerful technique for probing the spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular bonds with exceptional sensitivity, resolution, and speed. However, classically, its performance remains fundamentally constrained by optical shot noise, which imposes a strict limit on detection sensitivity and speed. Here, we demonstrate a quantum-enhanced SRS microscopy platform that circumvents this barrier by harnessing amplitude-squeezed light. Specifically, we generate a Stokes beam with $5.2~\mathrm{dB}$ of amplitude squeezing using traveling-wave optical parametric amplification in second-order nonlinear waveguides, and combine it with a tunable coherent pump to access vibrational modes spanning from $1000$ to $3100~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Applied to quantum imaging of metabolites in biological tissue (pork muscle), our quantum-enhanced Raman microscope achieves an average noise suppression of $3.6~\mathrm{dB}$ and a $51\%$ enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) -- to the best of our knowledge, the largest improvement reported to date in quantum-enhanced SRS microscopy of biological samples.

Title: High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$
Authors: Elnaz Rostampour, Badie Ghavami
Abstract: Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.

Title: Does the survival and sudden death of quadripartite steering in curved spacetime truly depend on multi-directionality?
Authors: Xiaobao Liu, Wentao Liu, Si-Han Shang, Shu-Min Wu
Abstract: We systematically investigate the directional dependence of Gaussian quadripartite quantum steering and its redistribution among different modes in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. For physically accessible sectors, we identify three distinct behaviors: (i) steering from non-gravitational to gravitational observers undergoes sudden death at maximal asymmetry with the Hawking temperature, marking the crossover from two-way to one-way steerability; (ii) steering in the opposite direction decays monotonically and vanishes only in the extreme black hole limit, highlighting its directional sensitivity to spacetime curvature; (iii) steering from hybrid gravitational-non-gravitational partitions to non-gravitational mode persists at a finite asymptotic value set by the initial squeezing parameter. Moreover, all inaccessible steerings generated by the Hawking effect exhibit an intrinsic asymmetry, with their specific behavior being strongly dependent on the steering direction.

Title: On the Fibonacci-Lucas Ground State Degeneracies of the One-Dimensional Antiferromagnetic Ising Model at Criticality
Authors: Bastian Castorene, Francisco J. Peña, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: This work examines the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model in a longitudinal magnetic field, comparing open-chain and closed-ring geometries. At the nontrivial quantum critical point (QCP) $B_{\mathrm{crit}} = B/J = 2$, we perform a microcanonical analysis of the ground-state manifold and explicitly count the number of degenerate configurations. The enumeration reveals that ground states follow the $N$th Fibonacci sequence for open chains and the $N$th Lucas sequence for periodic rings, establishing a clear correspondence between critical degeneracy, topology, and the golden ratio. This combinatorial duality exposes a number-theoretic structure underlying quantum criticality and highlights the role of topological constraints in shaping residual entropy. Beyond its conceptual relevance, the result provides a compact framework for analyzing degeneracy scaling in one-dimensional spin systems and may inform future studies of critical phenomena and quantum thermodynamic devices operating near critical regimes.

Title: Spontaneous Raman Scattering under Vibrational Strong Coupling: The Critical Role of Polariton Spatial Mode Coherence
Authors: Maxime Dherbécourt, Joël Bellessa, Clémentine Symonds, Guillaume Weick, David Hagenmüller
Abstract: Resonant coupling of a vibration to a cavity mode has been reported to dramatically modify spontaneous Raman scattering, but subsequent studies have produced conflicting results. In this Letter, we develop a microscopic quantum framework that captures the spatial structure of polaritonic modes. In a homogeneously filled cavity, spatial overlap between polaritons and cavity resonances enforces selection rules that suppress the initially reported polaritonic Raman peaks, consistent with most experiments. In contrast, for a quasi-two-dimensional (2d) molecular layer, these rules are lifted, yielding Raman peaks at the polariton energies. Our work clarifies that the Raman response under vibrational strong coupling is determined by cavity-vibration spatial mode overlap and offers a framework for Raman studies of strongly coupled quasi-2d systems.

Title: Cobble: Compiling Block Encodings for Quantum Computational Linear Algebra
Authors: Charles Yuan
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for computational linear algebra promise up to exponential speedups for applications such as simulation and regression, making them prime candidates for hardware realization. But these algorithms execute in a model that cannot efficiently store matrices in memory like a classical algorithm does, instead requiring developers to implement complex expressions for matrix arithmetic in terms of correct and efficient quantum circuits. Among the challenges for the developer is navigating a cost model in which conventional optimizations for linear algebra, such as subexpression reuse, can be inapplicable or unprofitable. In this work, we present Cobble, a language for programming with quantum computational linear algebra. Cobble enables developers to express and manipulate the quantum representations of matrices, known as block encodings, using high-level notation that automatically compiles to correct quantum circuits. Cobble features analyses that estimate leading factors in time and space usage of programs, as well as optimizations that reduce overhead and generate efficient circuits using leading techniques such as the quantum singular value transformation. We evaluate Cobble on benchmark kernels for simulation, regression, search, and other applications, showing 2.6x-25.4x speedups not achieved by existing circuit optimizers on these benchmarks.

Title: HyperNQ: A Hypergraph Neural Network Decoder for Quantum LDPC Codes
Authors: Ameya S. Bhave, Navnil Choudhury, Kanad Basu
Abstract: Quantum computing requires effective error correction strategies to mitigate noise and decoherence. Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising solution for scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) applications by supporting constant-rate encoding and a sparse parity-check structure. However, decoding QLDPC codes via traditional approaches such as Belief Propagation (BP) suffers from poor convergence in the presence of short cycles. Machine learning techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilize learned message passing over their node features; however, they are restricted to pairwise interactions on Tanner graphs, which limits their ability to capture higher-order correlations. In this work, we propose HyperNQ, the first Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN)- based QLDPC decoder that captures higher-order stabilizer constraints by utilizing hyperedges-thus enabling highly expressive and compact decoding. We use a two-stage message passing scheme and evaluate the decoder over the pseudo-threshold region. Below the pseudo-threshold mark, HyperNQ improves the Logical Error Rate (LER) up to 84% over BP and 50% over GNN-based strategies, demonstrating enhanced performance over the existing state-of-the-art decoders.

Title: Cost vector analysis & multi-path entanglement routing in quantum networks
Authors: Hudson Leone, Nathaniel R. Miller, Deepesh Singh, Nathan K. Langford, Peter P. Rohde
Abstract: We present a static framework for analysing quantum routing protocols that we call the \textit{cost-vector formalism}. Here, quantum networks are recast as multi-graphs where edges represent two-qubit entanglement resources that \textit{could} exist under some sequence of operations. Each edge is weighted with a \textit{transmission probability} that represents the likelihood of the pair existing and a \textit{coherence probability} which is the likelihood that the pair is suitable for teleportation. Routing operations such as entanglement swapping and purification are then interpreted as \textit{contractions on the multi-graph} with relatively simple rules for updating the edge-weights. Moreover, we extend our formalism to include routing scenarios over time by developing a compatible resource theory for quantum memories. We develop rudimentary greedy algorithms for routing in this framework and test them over a variety of toy networking scenarios. Our results indicate that congestion in quantum networks does not improve significantly when more nodes (computers) are added. Rather, we find that congestion is all but eliminated by waiting a small amount of time.

Title: Self-testing of semisymmetric informationally complete measurements in a qubit prepare-and-measure scenario
Authors: Gábor Drótos, Károly F. Pál, Tamás Vértesi
Abstract: Self-testing is a powerful method for certifying quantum systems. Initially proposed in the device-independent (DI) setting, self-testing has since been relaxed to the semi-device-independent (semi-DI) setting. In this study, we focus on the self-testing of a specific type of non-projective qubit measurements belonging to a one-parameter family, using the semi-DI prepare-and-measure (PM) scenario. Remarkably, we identify the simplest PM scenario discovered so far, involving only four preparations and four measurements, for self-testing the fourth measurement. This particular measurement is a four-outcome non-projective positive operator-valued measure (POVM) and falls in the class of semisymmetric informationally complete (semi-SIC) POVMs introduced by Geng et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 100401 (2021)]. To achieve this, we develop analytical techniques for semi-DI self-testing in the PM scenario. Our results shall pave the way towards self-testing any extremal qubit POVM within a potentially minimal PM scenario.

Title: Optimized nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation via reverse engineering
Authors: Yue Heng Liu
Abstract: The challenge in building high-fidelity quantum gates lies in overcoming control errors and deco- herence effects caused by the coupling between the quantum system and the external environment. Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation uses the topological protection of the cyclic evolution of the computational subspace to make holonomic gates highly robust to control errors. Therefore, our main goal is to accelerate this evolution. Here we propose a general reverse engineering approach to combine the unconventional geometric quantum computation with optimized holonomic quantum computation [Bao-Jie Liu et al. Phys.Rev.Lett.123,100501 (2019)]. Our approach allows us to select evolution paths that require less time. Consequently, the proposed scheme is highly flexible and promising for achieving robust quantum computation in the future.

Title: Shortcut-to-Adiabatic Controlled-Phase Gate in Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Luis S. Yagüe Bosch, Tim Ehret, Francesco Petiziol, Ennio Arimondo, Sandro Wimberger
Abstract: A shortcut-to-adiabatic protocol for the realization of a fast and high-fidelity controlled-phase gate in Rydberg atoms is developed. The adiabatic state transfer, driven in the high-blockade limit, is sped up by compensating nonadiabatic transitions via oscillating fields that mimic a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. High fidelities are obtained in wide parameter regions. The implementation of the bare effective counterdiabatic field, without original adiabatic pulses, enables to bypass gate errors produced by the accumulation of blockade-dependent dynamical phases, making the protocol efficient also at low blockade values. As an application toward quantum algorithms, how the fidelity of the gate impacts the efficiency of a minimal quantum-error correction circuit is analyzed.

Title: Unveiling the Quantum Toroidal Dipole
Authors: Alexandru-Lucian Nastasia, Mircea Dolineanu, Dragos-Victor Anghel
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of matter is governed by three fundamental multipole families: electric, magnetic, and toroidal. While the electric and magnetic are cornerstones of physics, the toroidal dipole (TD) has eluded direct, quantitative measurement for over 60 years. Its far-field signature is masked by the electric dipole, and its behavior in the quantum regime remains largely unexplored. We address this long-standing problem by presenting a complete quantum-mechanical formalism for the TD in a nanostructure and proposing the first spectroscopic method for its direct measurement. We analyze a particle confined to a toroidal manifold subjected to an external current. We demonstrate that the resulting Aharonov-Bohm-like energy shifts in the system's spectrum are directly proportional to the expectation value of the TD operator. The transition energies exhibit a linear dependence on this current, with a quantized slope that directly reveals the change in the TD quantum number between eigenstates. This provides a clear experimental blueprint to unveil, measure, and characterize this elusive third multipole moment and its quantum nature, opening new avenues in quantum metamaterials, nanoscience, and the study of fundamental symmetries.

Title: Convex Optimization Approaches to Optimal Teleportation Fidelity in Linear Three-Party Networks
Authors: Arkaprabha Ghosal, Jatin Ghai, Tanmay Saha, Mir Alimuddin, Sibasish Ghosh
Abstract: We study the maximum achievable quantum teleportation fidelity between two distant parties, Alice and Charlie, where each of them share a bipartite quantum state only with a common intermediary, Bob, and all parties are allowed to perform {\it Local Operations and Classical Communication} (LOCC). As the structure of LOCC is complicated, we relax the set of free operations to separable (SEP) operations and formulate a convex optimization problem that provides upper bounds on the LOCC achievable fidelity value. We observe that the complexity of such optimization problem reduces significantly if we restrict ourselves to a subclass of SEP operations, where the Kraus operators of either Alice or Charlie are proportional to unitary operators, leading to a simplified convex optimization that matches the general LOCC limit for certain two-qubit states. Through explicit examples, we show that protocols initiated by Bob by performing measurements in a maximally entangled basis are not necessarily optimal, and alternative strategies can outperform them. Finally, we extend our analysis to linear networks and demonstrate that different LOCC strategies can achieve the same optimal fidelity while consuming different amounts of entanglement content.

Title: Improving Quantum Approximate Optimization by Noise-Directed Adaptive Remapping
Authors: Filip B. Maciejewski, Jacob Biamonte, Stuart Hadfield, Davide Venturelli
Abstract: We present Noise-Directed Adaptive Remapping (NDAR), a heuristic algorithm for approximately solving binary optimization problems by leveraging certain types of noise. We consider access to a noisy quantum processor with dynamics that features a global attractor state. In a standard setting, such noise can be detrimental to the quantum optimization performance. Our algorithm bootstraps the noise attractor state by iteratively gauge-transforming the cost-function Hamiltonian in a way that transforms the noise attractor into higher-quality solutions. The transformation effectively changes the attractor into a higher-quality solution of the Hamiltonian based on the results of the previous step. The end result is that noise aids variational optimization, as opposed to hindering it. We present an improved Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) runs in experiments on Rigetti's quantum device. We report approximation ratios $0.9$-$0.96$ for random, fully connected graphs on $n=82$ qubits, using only depth $p=1$ QAOA with NDAR. This compares to $0.34$-$0.51$ for standard $p=1$ QAOA with the same number of function calls.

Title: Learning Symmetric Hamiltonian
Authors: Jing Zhou, D.L. Zhou
Abstract: Hamiltonian Learning is a process of recovering system Hamiltonian from measurements, which is a fundamental problem in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the problem of learning the symmetric Hamiltonian from its eigenstate. Inspired by the application of group theory in block diagonal secular determination, we have derived a method to determine the number of linearly independent equations about the Hamiltonian unknowns obtained from an eigenstate. This number corresponds to the degeneracy of the associated irreducible representation of the Hamiltonian symmetry group. To illustrate our approach, we examine the XXX Hamiltonian and the XXZ Hamiltonian. We first determine the Hamiltonian symmetry group, then work out the decomposition of irreducible representation, which serves as foundation for analyzing the uniqueness of recovered Hamiltonian. Our numerical findings consistently align with our theoretical analysis.

Title: Identifying Entanglement Phases with Bipartite Projected Ensembles
Authors: Zi-Yong Ge, Franco Nori
Abstract: We introduce bipartite projected ensembles (BPEs) for quantum many-body wave functions, which consist of pure states supported on two local subsystems, with each state associated with the outcome of a projective measurement of the complementary subsystem in a fixed local basis. We demonstrate that the corresponding ensemble-averaged entanglements (EAEs) between two subsystems can effectively identify entanglement phases. In volume-law entangled states, EAE converges to a nonzero value with increasing distance between subsystems. For critical systems, EAE exhibits power-law decay, and it decays exponentially for area-law systems. Thus, entanglement phase transitions can be viewed as a disordered-ordered phase transition. We also apply BPE and EAE to measured random Clifford circuits to probe measurement-induced phase transitions. We show that EAE serves not only as a witness to phase transitions, but also unveils additional critical phenomena properties, including dynamical scaling and surface critical exponents. Our findings provide an alternative approach to diagnosing entanglement laws, thus enhancing the understanding of entanglement phase transitions. Moreover, given the accessibility of measuring EAE in quantum simulators, our results hold promise for impacting quantum simulations.

Title: Strict area law entanglement versus chirality
Authors: Xiang Li, Ting-Chun Lin, John McGreevy, Bowen Shi
Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.

Title: Application of Langevin Dynamics to Advance the Quantum Natural Gradient Optimization Algorithm
Authors: Oleksandr Borysenko, Mykhailo Bratchenko, Ilya Lukin, Mykola Luhanko, Ihor Omelchenko, Andrii Sotnikov, Alessandro Lomi
Abstract: A Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) algorithm for optimization of variational quantum circuits has been proposed recently. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation with a QNG stochastic force to demonstrate that its discrete-time solution gives a generalized form of the above-specified algorithm, which we call Momentum-QNG. Similar to other optimization algorithms with the momentum term, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, RMSProp with momentum and Adam, Momentum-QNG is more effective to escape local minima and plateaus in the variational parameter space and, therefore, demonstrates an improved performance compared to the basic QNG. In this paper we benchmark Momentum-QNG together with the basic QNG, Adam and Momentum optimizers and explore its convergence behaviour. Among the benchmarking problems studied, the best result is obtained for the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the strong spin glass regime. Our open-source code is available at this https URL

Title: A Butterfly Effect in Encoding-Decoding Quantum Circuits
Authors: Emanuel Dallas, Faidon Andreadakis, Paolo Zanardi
Abstract: The study of information scrambling has profoundly deepened our understanding of many-body quantum systems. Much recent research has been devote to understanding the interplay between scrambling and decoherence in open systems. Continuing in this vein, we investigate scrambling in a noisy encoding-decoding circuit model. Specifically, we consider an $L$-qubit circuit consisting of a Haar-random unitary, followed by noise acting on a subset of qubits, and then by the inverse unitary. Scrambling is measured using the bipartite algebraic out-of-time-order correlator ($\mathcal{A}$-OTOC), which allows us to track information spread between extensively sized subsystems. We derive an analytic expression for the $\mathcal{A}$-OTOC that depends on system size and noise strength. In the thermodynamic limit, this system displays a \textit{butterfly effect} in which infinitesimal noise induces macroscopic information scrambling. We also perform numerical simulations while relaxing the condition of Haar-randomness, which preliminarily suggest that this effect may manifest in a larger set of circuits.

Title: Bounds on Multipartite Nonlocality via Reduction to Biased Nonlocality
Authors: Hafiza Rumlah Amer, Jibran Rashid
Abstract: Multipartite information principles are needed to understand nonlocal quantum correlations. Towards that end, we provide optimal bounds on genuine multipartite nonlocality for classes of THRESHOLD games using the LOCCG (Local Operations with Grouping) model. Our proof develops a reduction between multipartite nonlocal and biased bipartite nonlocal games. Generalizing this reduction to a larger class of games may build a bridge from multipartite to bipartite principles.

Title: Implementing Quantum Secret Sharing on Current Hardware
Authors: Jay Graves, Mike Nelson, Eric Chitambar
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing is a cryptographic scheme that enables a secure storage and reconstruction of quantum information. While the theory of secret sharing is mature in its development, relatively few studies have explored the performance of quantum secret sharing on actual devices. In this work, we provide a pedagogical description of encoding and decoding circuits for different secret sharing codes, and we test their performance on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane system. We evaluate the quality of implementation by performing a SWAP test between the decoded state and the ideal one, as well as by estimating how well the code preserves entanglement with a reference system. Results indicate that a ((3,5)) threshold secret sharing scheme performs slightly better overall than a ((5,7)) scheme based on the SWAP test, but is outperformed by the Steane Code scheme in regards to the entanglement fidelity. We also investigate one implementation of a ((2,3)) qutrit scheme and find that it performs the worst of all, which is expected due to the additional number of multi-qubit gate operations needed to encode and decode qutrits.

Title: Instability of steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking
Authors: Jeet Shah, Christopher Fechisin, Yu-Xin Wang, Joseph T. Iosue, James D. Watson, Yan-Qi Wang, Brayden Ware, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Cheng-Ju Lin
Abstract: Recent experimental progress in controlling open quantum systems enables the pursuit of mixed-state nonequilibrium quantum phases. We investigate whether open quantum systems hosting mixed-state symmetry-protected topological states as steady states retain this property under symmetric perturbations. Focusing on the decohered cluster state -- a mixed-state symmetry-protected topological state protected by a combined strong and weak symmetry -- we construct a parent Lindbladian that hosts it as a steady state. This Lindbladian can be mapped onto exactly solvable reaction-diffusion dynamics, even in the presence of certain perturbations, allowing us to solve the parent Lindbladian in detail and reveal previously-unknown steady states. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that typical symmetric perturbations cause strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily small perturbations, destabilize the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order. However, when perturbations introduce only weak symmetry defects, the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order remains stable. Additionally, we construct a quantum channel which replicates the essential physics of the Lindbladian and can be efficiently simulated using only Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and feedback.

Title: A Lieb-Robinson bound for open quantum systems with memory
Authors: Rahul Trivedi, Xiehang Yu, Mark Rudner
Abstract: We consider a general class of spatially local non-Markovian open quantum lattice models, with a bosonic environment that is approximated as Gaussian. Under the assumption of a finite environment memory time, formalized as a finite total variation of the memory kernel, we show that these models satisfy a Lieb-Robinson bound. Our work generalizes Lieb Robinson bounds for open quantum systems, which have previously only been established in the Markovian limit. Using these bounds, we then show that these non-Markovian models can be well approximated by a larger Markovian model, which contains the system spins together with only a finite number of environment modes. In particular, we establish that as a consequence of our Lieb-Robinson bounds, the number of environment modes per system site needed to accurately capture local observables is independent of the size of the system.

Title: Boundaries for quantum advantage with single photons and loop-based time-bin interferometers
Authors: Samo Novák, David D. Roberts, Alexander Makarovskiy, Raúl García-Patrón, William R. Clements
Abstract: Loop-based boson samplers interfere photons in the time degree of freedom using a sequence of delay lines. Since they require few hardware components while also allowing for long-range entanglement, they are strong candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage beyond the reach of classical emulation. We propose a method to exploit this loop-based structure to more efficiently classically sample from such systems. Our algorithm exploits a causal-cone argument to decompose the circuit into smaller effective components that can each be simulated sequentially by calling a state vector simulator as a subroutine. To quantify the complexity of our approach, we develop a new lattice path formalism that allows us to efficiently characterize the state space that must be tracked during the simulation. In addition, we develop a heuristic method that allows us to predict the expected average and worst-case memory requirements of running these simulations. We use these methods to compare the simulation complexity of different families of loop-based interferometers, allowing us to quantify the potential for quantum advantage of single-photon Boson Sampling in loop-based architectures.

Title: Hamiltonian characterisation of multi-time processes with classical memory
Authors: Kaumudibikash Goswami, Abhinash Kumar Roy, Varun Srivastava, Barr Perez, Christina Giarmatzi, Alexei Gilchrist, Fabio Costa
Abstract: A central problem in open quantum systems is the characterization of non-Markovian processes, where an environment retains the memory of its interaction with the system. A key distinction is whether or not this memory can be simulated classically, as this can lead to efficient modelling and noise mitigation. Powerful tools have been developed recently within the process matrix formalism, a framework that conveniently characterizes all multi-time correlations through a sequence of measurements. This leads to a detailed classification of classical and quantum-memory processes and provides operational procedures to distinguish between them. However, these results leave open the question of what type of system-environment interactions lead to classical memory. More generally, process-matrix methods lack a direct connection to joint system-environment evolution, a cornerstone of open-system modelling. In this work, we characterize Hamiltonian and circuit-based models of system-environment interactions leading to classical memory. We show that general time-dependent Hamiltonians with product eigenstates, and where the environment's eigenstates form a time-independent, orthonormal basis, always produce a particular type of classical memory: probabilistic mixtures of unitary processes. Equivalently, these Hamiltonians are characterized as commuting with a complete set of observables on the environment. Additionally, we show that the most general type of classical memory processes can be generated by a quantum circuit in which the system and environment interact through a specific class of controlled unitaries. Our results establish the first strong link between process-matrix methods and traditional Hamiltonian-based approaches to open quantum systems.

Title: Experimental distributed quantum sensing in a noisy environment
Authors: James Bate, Arne Hamann, Marco Canteri, Armin Winkler, Zhe Xian Koong, Victor Krutyanskiy, Wolfgang Dür, Benjamin Peter Lanyon
Abstract: The precision advantages offered by harnessing the quantum states of sensors can be readily compromised by noise. However, when the noise has a different spatial function than the signal of interest, recent theoretical work shows how the advantage can be maintained and even significantly improved. In this work we experimentally demonstrate the associated sensing protocol, using trapped-ion sensors. An entangled state of multi-dimensional sensors is created that isolates and optimally detects a signal, whilst being insensitive to otherwise overwhelming noise fields with different spatial profiles over the sensor locations. The quantum protocol is found to outperform a perfect implementation of the best comparable strategy without sensor entanglement. While our demonstration is carried out for magnetic and electromagnetic fields over a few microns, the technique is readily applicable over arbitrary distances and for arbitrary fields, thus present a promising application for emerging quantum sensor networks.

Title: Taming quantum systems: A tutorial for using shortcuts-to-adiabaticity, quantum optimal control, and reinforcement learning
Authors: Callum W. Duncan, Pablo M. Poggi, Marin Bukov, Nikolaj Thomas Zinner, Steve Campbell
Abstract: Precise manipulation of quantum effects at the atomic and nanoscale has become an essential task in ongoing scientific and technological endeavours. Quantum control methods are thus routinely exploited for research in areas such as quantum materials, quantum chemistry, and atomic and molecular physics, as well as in the development of quantum technologies like computing, simulation, and sensing. Here, we present a pedagogical introduction to the basics of quantum control methods in tutorial form, with the aim of providing newcomers to the field with the core concepts and practical tools to use these methods in their research. We focus on three areas: shortcuts to adiabaticity, quantum optimal control, and machine-learning-based control. We lay out the basic theoretical elements of each area in a pedagogical way and describe their application to a series of example cases. For these, we include detailed analytical derivations as well as extensive numerical results. As an outlook, we discuss quantum control methods in the broader context of quantum technologies development and complex quantum systems research, outlining potential connections and synergies between them.

Title: QNN-QRL: Quantum Neural Network Integrated with Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Bikash K. Behera, Saif Al-Kuwari, Ahmed Farouk
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a critical component of secure communication in the quantum era, ensuring information-theoretic security. Despite its potential, there are issues in optimizing key generation rates, enhancing security, and incorporating QKD into practical implementations. This research introduces a unique framework for incorporating quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms, notably quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) and quantum neural networks (QNN), into QKD protocols to improve key generation performance. Here, we present two novel QRL-based algorithms, QRL-V.1 and QRL-V.2, and propose the standard BB84 and B92 protocols by integrating QNN algorithms to form QNN-BB84 and QNN-B92. Furthermore, we combine QNN with the above QRL-based algorithms to produce QNN-QRL-V.1 and QNN-QRL-V.2. These unique algorithms and established protocols are compared using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. The results from the QNN-based proposed algorithms show considerable improvements in key generation quality. The existing and proposed models are investigated in the presence of different noisy channels to check their robustness. The proposed integration of QML algorithms into QKD protocols and their noisy analysis create a new paradigm for efficient key generation, which advances the practical implementation of QKD systems.

Title: Physical relevance of time-independent scattering calculations in non-Hermitian systems: The role of time-growing bound states
Authors: Chao Zheng
Abstract: Time-independent scattering methods are widely employed to analyze transport in non-Hermitian systems. Their application, however, rests on a critical yet often overlooked assumption: that an incident wave is a pure superposition of scattering states. In practice, any physically realistic, spatially localized wave packet will generally have a nonzero overlap with the system's bound states, thereby violating this premise. While this violation is inconsequential in Hermitian systems, it can invalidate the conventional scattering picture in their non-Hermitian counterparts. The underlying cause is the emergence of time-growing bound states, which manifest as poles of the scattering matrix ($S$ matrix) in the first quadrant of the complex wave-number plane. Any initial overlap with these states becomes exponentially amplified, eventually dominating the long-time dynamics. Consequently, the actual evolution of a wave packet diverges dramatically from the conventional scattering picture, rendering the transmission and reflection coefficients derived from time-independent scattering methods unphysical. Using tight-binding models with non-Hermiticity introduced via imaginary on-site potentials or asymmetric hopping, we demonstrate that parameter regimes supporting such growing states are common. We therefore conclude that an analysis of $S$-matrix poles is an indispensable step to confirm the physical relevance of time-independent scattering calculations in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Universal Counterdiabatic Driving
Authors: Stewart Morawetz, Anatoli Polkovnikov
Abstract: Local counterdiabatic (CD) driving provides a systematic way of constructing a control protocol to approximately suppress the excitations resulting from changing some parameter(s) of a quantum system at a finite rate. However, designing CD protocols typically requires knowledge of the original Hamiltonian a priori. In this work, we design local CD driving protocols in Krylov space using only the characteristic local time scales of the system set by e.g. phonon frequencies in materials or Rabi frequencies in superconducting qubit arrays. Surprisingly, we find that convergence of these universal protocols is controlled by the asymptotic high frequency tails of the response functions. This finding hints at a deep connection between the long-time, low frequency response of the system controlling non-adiabatic effects, and the high-frequency response determined by the short-time operator growth and the Krylov complexity, which has been elusive until now.

Title: Quantum Algorithms Without Coherent Quantum Access
Authors: Nhat A. Nghiem
Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage has been a pressing challenge in the field. Most claimed quantum speedups rely on a subroutine in which classical information can be accessed in a coherent quantum manner, which imposes a crucial constraint on the implementability of these quantum algorithms. It has even been shown that without such an access, the quantum computer cannot be stronger than the classical counterparts. Thus, whether a quantum computer can be useful for practical applications is still open. In this work, we develop several variants of quantum algorithms. Our key framework employs a classical preprocessing step and a quantum procedure to perform gradient descent. We then translate such algorithm into an algorithm for solving linear systems, performing least-square fitting, building a support vector machine, performing supervised cluster assignment, training neural network, and solving for ground-state/excited-state energy, performing principle component analysis, with end-to-end applications of quantum algorithms. The classical preprocessing and the quantum procedure of our framework are shown to have logarithmic complexity in the dimension of input data, and quantum coherent access to input data is not required. Thus, our framework suggests an alternatively efficient route for quantum computers to handle real-world problems.

Title: Quantum-enhanced quickest change detection of transmission loss
Authors: Saikat Guha, Tiju Cherian John, Zihao Gong, Prithwish Basu
Abstract: Augmenting a train of bright phase-modulated laser-light pulses of a coherent communications system with infinitesimally small quantum photons per pulse -- entangled across several time bins -- prepared by splitting squeezed light in a temporal-mode interferometer can dramatically enhance a homodyne receiver's ability to detect a sudden change in the channel loss, by up to a factor that is the inverse of the pre-change loss, without affecting the communications rate. We discuss the quantum limit of quickest change detection, and the problem of joint communications and change detection that our study opens up.

Title: Renormalization of Schrödinger equation for potentials with inverse-square singularities: Generalized Trigonometric Pöschl-Teller model
Authors: U. Camara da Silva
Abstract: We introduce a renormalization procedure necessary for the complete description of the energy spectra of a one-dimensional stationary Schrödinger equation with a potential that exhibits inverse-square singularities. We apply and extend the methods introduced in our recent paper on the hyperbolic Pöschl-Teller potential (with a single singularity) to its trigonometric version. This potential, defined between two singularities, is analyzed across the entire bidimensional coupling space. The fact that the trigonometric Pöschl-Teller potential is supersymmetric and shape-invariant simplifies the analysis and eliminates the need for self-adjoint extensions in certain coupling regions. However, if at least one coupling is strongly attractive, the renormalization is essential to construct a discrete energy spectrum family of one or two parameters. We also investigate the features of a singular symmetric double well obtained by extending the range of the trigonometric Pöschl-Teller potential. It has a non-degenerate energy spectrum and eigenstates with well-defined parity.

Title: Covert Entanglement Generation and Secrecy
Authors: Ohad Kimelfeld, Boulat A. Bash, Uzi Pereg
Abstract: We determine the covert capacity for entanglement generation over a noisy quantum channel. While secrecy guarantees that the transmitted information remains inaccessible to an adversary, covert communication ensures that the transmission itself remains undetectable. The entanglement dimension follows a square root law (SRL) in the covert setting, i.e., $O(\sqrt{n})$ EPR pairs can be distributed covertly and reliably over n channel uses. We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation. Consequently, we establish achievability of the same covert entanglement generation rate as the classical information rate without secrecy, albeit with a larger key.

Title: Multiparameter estimation with an array of entangled atomic sensors
Authors: Yifan Li, Lex Joosten, Youcef Baamara, Paolo Colciaghi, Alice Sinatra, Philipp Treutlein, Tilman Zibold
Abstract: In quantum metrology, entangled states of many-particle systems are investigated to enhance measurement precision of the most precise clocks and field sensors. While single-parameter quantum metrology is well established, many metrological tasks require joint multiparameter estimation, which poses new conceptual challenges that have so far only been explored theoretically. We experimentally demonstrate multiparameter quantum metrology with an array of entangled atomic ensembles. By splitting a spin-squeezed ensemble, we create an atomic sensor array featuring inter-sensor entanglement that can be flexibly configured to enhance measurement precision of multiple parameters jointly. Using an optimal estimation protocol, we achieve significant gains over the standard quantum limit in key multiparameter estimation tasks, thus grounding the concept of quantum enhancement of field sensor arrays and imaging devices.

Title: Comment on "Consequences of the single-pair measurement of the Bell parameter"
Authors: Justo Pastor Lambare
Abstract: In a recent article [Phys. Rev. A 111, 022204 (2025)], Genovese and Piacentini analyzed recent experiments measuring what they call "the entire Bell-CHSH parameter". They claimed those experiments may have implications for interpreting loophole-fee tests of the Bell-CHSH inequality. We explain that the Bell-CHSH inequality is not based on the entire Bell parameter, so these experiments are unrelated to their empirical tests and cannot close eventual loopholes that still might persist. We point out that the physical meaning of these new experiments measuring the entire Bell parameter could be interpreted differently.

Title: On Selecting Paths for End-to-End Entanglement Creation in Quantum Networks
Authors: Anoosha Fayyaz, Prashant Krishnamurthy, Kaushik P. Seshadreesan, David Tipper, Amy Babay
Abstract: Optimal routing is a fundamental challenge in quantum networking, with several approaches proposed to identify the most efficient path for end-to-end (e2e) entanglement generation between pairs of nodes. In this paper, we show that \textit{prior entanglements} -- entanglements generated in a previous network cycle but not yet utilized -- are an important consideration in optimal path selection due to the dynamic nature of quantum networks. Specifically, we investigate whether a longer path with pre-existing entanglements can outperform a shorter path that starts from scratch. We account for key quantum constraints, including noisy entanglement generation and swapping, fidelity decay, probabilistic operations, and link discarding upon swap failure. Simulations reveal that longer paths with prior entanglements can establish e2e entanglement faster than shorter paths under certain conditions. We further introduce the notion of \textit{entanglement diversity}, where multiple paths can be used to improve performance -- either by selecting the first successful path to minimize time or using both paths to enhance fidelity through distillation. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating prior entanglements into path selection strategies for optimizing quantum communication networks.

Title: Unlocking early fault-tolerant quantum computing with mitigated magic dilution
Authors: Surabhi Luthra, Alexandra E. Moylett, Dan E. Browne, Earl T. Campbell
Abstract: As quantum computing progresses towards the early fault-tolerant regime, quantum error correction will play a crucial role in protecting qubits and enabling logical Clifford operations. However, the number of logical qubits will initially remain limited, posing challenges for resource-intensive tasks like magic state distillation. It is therefore essential to develop efficient methods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle rotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these constraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an approach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error mitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded magic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model. We identify evolution time regimes where MMD outperforms the Ross-Selinger gate synthesis method [Quantum Inf.\ Comp.\ \textbf{16}, 901-953 (2016), arXiv:1403.2975] in the number of noisy encoded magic states required for square lattices up to size $8 \times 8$. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can provide a practical advantage which is quantified by a better-than-quadratic improvement in the resource requirements for small-angle rotations over classical simulators. This work paves the way for early fault-tolerant demonstrations on devices supporting millions of quantum operations, the so-called MegaQuOp regime.

Title: Complex and tunable heating in conformal field theories with structured drives via classical ergodicity breaking
Authors: Liang-Hong Mo, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao
Abstract: Emission and absorption of energy are fundamental aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics. The heating induced by driving a many-body system is perhaps the most straightforward diagnostic of the process of equilibration, or the lack thereof. Gapless systems are particularly susceptible to drive-induced heating, and the capacity to control such heating is of experimental importance. Our study addresses this challenge in the framework of conformal field theory (CFT), for which we study families of structured drives up to the aperiodic Thue-Morse sequence. Concretely, we consider a class of spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, where the operator evolution is governed by a non-linear classical dynamical system $\mathcal{K}$. The existence of invariant regions and fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$ leads to different levels of ergodicity breaking. Upon bridging the gap between this dynamical system and the driven CFT, we classify various dynamical phases of matter, including the heating and non-heating phases, as well as a prethermal phase with a controllably slow heating rate. We further generalize the discussion to $\eta-$random multipolar driving, characterized by $\eta-$th order multipolar correlation in time. A ``triply tunable'' parametric dependence of the prethermal lifetime arises as $K^{-2(\eta-\xi)}$, where $K$ quantifies the deviation from the preimages of the fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$, the multipolar order $\eta$, and the order of the preimages $\xi$. Upon sacrificing Hermiticity by considering SU(2) deformed CFTs, we find another non-heating phase with a non-zero measure, inaccessible via purely unitary CFTs. This is underpinned by an emergent compact subspace in the generic $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ group structure, which we also identify in the transfer matrix in non-Hermitian systems with binary disorder.

Title: Trotter transition in BCS pairing dynamics
Authors: Aniket Patra, Emil A. Yuzbashyan, Boris L. Altshuler, Sergej Flach
Abstract: We study universal aspects of thermalization induced by Trotterization, a procedure routinely used in gate-based quantum computation. We use the reduced-BCS model -- quantum integrable with a classically integrable mean-field limit -- where the effects of Trotter chaos are expected to be particularly stark. The resulting Trotterized chaotic dynamics is characterized by its Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large \(\tau\) limit agrees well with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description -- across the Trotter transition we uncover.

Title: Optimal quantum metrology under energy constraints
Authors: Longyun Chen, Yuxiang Yang
Abstract: The traditional framework of quantum metrology commonly assumes unlimited access to resources, overlooking resource constraints in realistic scenarios. As such, the optimal strategies therein can be infeasible in practice. Here, we investigate quantum metrology where the total energy consumption of the probe state preparation, intermediate control operations, and the final measurement is subject to a constraint. We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for characterizing energy-constrained multi-step quantum processes, based on which we develop a general optimization method for energy-constrained quantum metrology that determines both the optimal precision and the corresponding strategy. Using the method, we determine the ultimate precision limit of energy-constrained phase estimation and identify a novel advantage of quantum superpositions of causal orders in enhancing the energy efficiency of adaptive quantum estimation.

Title: Bipartite entanglement extracted from multimode squeezed light generated in lossy waveguides
Authors: Denis A. Kopylov, Torsten Meier, Polina R. Sharapova
Abstract: Entangled two-mode Gaussian states constitute an important building block for continuous variable quantum computing and communication protocols. In this work, we theoretically study two-mode bipartite states which are extracted from multimode light generated via type-II parametric down-conversion (PDC) in lossy waveguides. For these states, we demonstrate that the squeezing quantifies entanglement and we construct a measurement basis which results in the maximal bipartite entanglement. We illustrate our findings by numerically solving the spatial master equation for PDC in a Markovian environment. The optimal measurement modes are compared with two widely-used broadband bases: the Mercer-Wolf basis (the first-order coherence basis) and the Williamson-Euler basis.

Title: Topological Phase Transitions and Edge-State Transfer in Time-Multiplexed Quantum Walks
Authors: Huimin Wang, Zhihao Xu, Zhijian Li
Abstract: We investigate the topological phase transitions and edge-state properties of a time-multiplexed nonunitary quantum walk with sublattice symmetry. By constructing a Floquet operator incorporating tunable gain and loss, we systematically analyze both unitary and nonunitary regimes. In the unitary case, the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) is preserved, with edge modes localized at opposite boundaries as predicted by topological invariants. In contrast, the nonunitary regime exhibits non-Hermitian skin effects, leading to a breakdown of the conventional BBC. By applying non-Bloch band theory and generalized Brillouin zones, we restore a generalized BBC and reveal a transfer phenomenon, where edge modes with different sublattice symmetries can become localized at the same boundary. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the structure of the spectral loops in the complex quasienergy plane provides a clear signature for these transfer behaviors. Our findings deepen the understanding of nonunitary topological phases and offer valuable insights for the experimental realization and control of edge states in non-Hermitian quantum systems.

Title: Where Photons Have Been: Nowhere Without All Components of Their Wavefunctions

Abstract: A nested interferometer experiment by Danan et al (2013) is discussed and some claims evaluated concerning the whereabouts of the photon, primarily in the context of time-symmetric interpretations of quantum theory including the Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF) and the Transactional Interpretation (TI). It is pointed out that the TSVF account fails to predict the observed data based only on the first-order wavefunction component. It is shown that the Transactional Interpretation readily accounts for all the observed phenomena.

Title: Correspondence principle, dissipation, and Ginibre ensemble
Authors: David Villaseñor, Hua Yan, Matic Orel, Marko Robnik
Abstract: The correspondence between quantum and classical behavior has been essential since the advent of quantum mechanics. This principle serves as a cornerstone for understanding quantum chaos, which has garnered increased attention due to its strong impact in various theoretical and experimental fields. When dissipation is considered, quantum chaos takes concepts from isolated quantum chaos to link classical chaotic motion with spectral correlations of Ginibre ensembles. This correspondence was first identified in periodically kicked systems with damping, but it has been shown to break down in dissipative atom-photon systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. In this contribution, we revisit the original kicked model and perform a systematic exploration across a broad parameter space, reaching a genuine semiclassical limit. Our results demonstrate that the correspondence principle, as defined through this spectral connection, fails even in this prototypical system. These findings provide conclusive evidence that Ginibre spectral correlations are neither a robust nor a universal diagnostic of dissipative quantum chaos.

Title: Using Universal Frame Randomization and Randomized Compilation to Mitigate Errors in Quantum Optimization
Authors: Rachel E. Johnson, Joshua A. Job, Steve Adachi
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for near-term quantum devices, and two promising techniques are universal frame randomization and Randomized Compilation. These methods insert random twirling gates into a circuit to reduce errors while preserving unitarity and depth. We apply universal frame randomization and Randomized Compilation to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with $p=1$ on a superconducting quantum circuit system, demonstrating its potential to improve energy calculations. Specifically, we investigate the use of QAOA to calculate the lowest energy state of a frustrated Ising ring system and compare the results of randomized circuits generated using both techniques. Our results show that both methods can mitigate errors, with expected extremal energy values of $5.25\pm0.145$ and $4.08\pm0.36$, for Randomized Compilation and universal frame randomization respectively, compared to $2.63\pm0.068$ without randomization and $5.676\pm0.006$ with a noiseless simulator.

Title: Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach
Authors: Ian T. Abrahams
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical FP time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.

Title: Rethinking Quantum Repeaters: Balancing Scalability, Feasibility, and Interoperability
Authors: Javier Rey-Domínguez, Mohsen Razavi
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are enabling technologies for long-distance quantum communications. Despite the significant progress in the field, we still not only face implementation challenges but also need theoretical solutions that better meet all the desired design criteria. Preliminary solutions for quantum repeaters often do not scale well, while the most advanced solutions are so demanding that their implementation may take a long time and require substantial changes to current telecom infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a compromise solution that is not only scalable in the mid-to-long term but also adapts well to the realities of the backbone networks in the current Internet infrastructure. The key ideas behind our solution are twofold. First, we use a connectionless approach to entanglement swapping, allowing our solution to benefit from the same features as packet-switched networks. Second, we employ simple error detection, rather than more complicated error correction, techniques to make our solution sufficiently scalable in the face of errors. This is achieved without requiring overly demanding specifications for the physical devices needed in the network. We test this idea in a quantum key distribution (QKD) setting over a repeater chain and demonstrate how trust-free continental QKD can be achieved through several stages of development.

Title: An exploration of the noise sensitivity of the Shor's algorithm
Authors: Fusheng Yang, Zhipeng Liang, Zhengzhong Yi, Xuan Wang
Abstract: Quantum algorithms face significant challenges due to qubit susceptibility to environmental noise, and quantum error correction typically requires prohibitive resource overhead. This paper proposes that quantum algorithms may possess inherent noise resilience characteristics that could reduce implementation barriers. We investigate Shor's algorithm by applying circuit-level noise models directly to the original algorithm circuit. Our findings reveal that Shor's algorithm demonstrates superior fault tolerance under Z noise compared to X and Y noise. Focusing on the modular exponentiation circuit which is the core component of the algorithm, we conduct fault-tolerant position statistics on circuits with bit lengths from 4 to 9. The results show that under Z noise, fault-tolerant positions grow with the same quartic polynomial order as potential error positions as the problem scale increases. In contrast, fault tolerance under X and Y noise exhibits a strong dependence on the composite number N and the parameter a. Based on these findings, we develop an extrapolation method predicting that the minimum probability of a correct output of the modular exponentiation circuit to factor 2048 bit integers under biased noise is approximately 1.417*{10}^{-17}.

Title: Quantum algorithms for Uhlmann transformation
Authors: Takeru Utsumi, Yoshifumi Nakata, Qisheng Wang, Ryuji Takagi
Abstract: Uhlmann's theorem is a central result in quantum information theory, which associates the closeness of two quantum states with that of their purifications. The theorem also well characterizes a fundamental task: how close a pure quantum state can be transformed into another state via local operations acting only on its subsystem. The optimal transformation for this task is called the Uhlmann transformation, which has broad applications in various information-processing tasks. However, its quantum circuit implementation and computational cost have remained unclear, limiting the utility of the transformation. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing quantum algorithms that realize the Uhlmann transformation in query and sample access models. Notably, our Uhlmann transformation algorithms can be polynomial-time for low-rank states, exhibiting an exponential improvement over the previous approach and other naive approaches based on quantum state tomography. In addition, we derive a lower bound on the query and sample complexities of the Uhlmann transformation for a deeper understanding of its algorithmic features. We apply our Uhlmann transformation algorithms to fidelity estimation between two states, and substantially improve the previous best query and sample complexities. We further discuss other applications to several information-theoretic tasks, including entanglement transmission, quantum state merging, and the algorithmic implementation of the Petz recovery map, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their computational costs. These results, hence, contribute to the practical realization of such widely recognized and useful protocols.

Title: Reaffirming a Challenge to Bohmian Mechanics
Authors: Jan Klaers, Violetta Sharoglazova, Marius Puplauskis
Abstract: In our recent work (Sharoglazova et al., Nature 643, 67 (2025)), we reported the measurement of the speed of tunnelling particles using a coupled waveguide system. The measured speed was found to disagree with the standard guiding equation of Bohmian mechanics, which we regard as a challenge to that framework. In the present work, we provide a more detailed account of this issue. In particular, we argue that agreement or disagreement between standard quantum mechanics and Bohmian mechanics on quantities such as particle velocity, speed, tunnelling, and dwell times depends solely on the choice of guiding equation. If this choice is made based on observable spatio-temporal transformation behaviour of the particle density, the two theories in fact agree on these phenomena.

Title: Detection of isolated specular reflection for calibration of cloud thermodynamic phase estimation with quantum parametric mode sorting LIDAR
Authors: Richard J. Murchie, Dolf Huybrechts, Aaron Strangfeld, Mateusz P. Mrozowski
Abstract: Specular reflection can be problematic for the determination of the cloud thermodynamic phase for near-nadir-pointing space LIDARs. A LIDAR system biased towards the specular contribution for backscatter, if near-concurrent to a conventional LIDAR, could calibrate the measurements required for cloud phase determination. One such system which shows promise for this is quantum parametric mode sorting (QPMS) LIDAR. Through a non-linear interaction and time-frequency mode selectivity, this system demonstrates in-band noise-rejection beyond what linear noise filtering can provide. This level of noise-rejection means the signal strength can be minimised, therefore biasing the specular contribution to the return signal. Here we provide a theoretical model of QPMS LIDAR applied to this scenario to instruct its feasibility.

Abstract: Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on the microscopic interaction with a single atom, neglecting the crucial macroscopic aspect of light propagation through the media. This raises a key question: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media and how this affects the generation of non-linear optical signals? We address this question by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media. We find that atomic ionization caused by strong BSV fluctuations and the associated infrared photon losses introduce decoherence effects that can substantially limit the propagation length in the medium, reduce the harmonic yield, and decrease the number of emitted harmonics at high intensities. However, these effects are not detrimental. We identify conditions under which propagation-induced decoherence is minimized while the generated harmonics remain clearly detectable--an issue of particular importance for future studies exploring the connection between strong-field physics and quantum optics. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation through all states of matter in a fully quantized framework.

Title: Scrambling-Enhanced Quantum Battery Charging in Black Hole Analogues
Authors: Zhilong Liu, Ying Li, Zehua Tian, Jieci Wang
Abstract: Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, we explore how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches of preset scrambling parameters. Our analysis reveals that the intentionally engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters could significantly enhance both maximum stored energy $E_{\max}$ and peak charging power $P_{\max}$ in the quench charging protocol. The optimal charging time $\tau_*$ exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon parameter $x_{h0}$, while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench horizon parameter $x_{ht}$. This temporal compression confines high-power operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling $x_{ht} > x_{h0}$, demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling dynamics.

Title: Hybrid biphoton spectrometer for time-resolved quantum spectroscopy across visible and near-infrared regions
Authors: Ozora Iso, Koya Onoda, Nicola J. Fairbairn, Masahiro Yabuno, Hirotaka Terai, Shigehito Miki, Ryosuke Shimizu
Abstract: Joint spectral measurements are a powerful tool for characterising biphoton spectral correlation, which is crucial for quantum information and communication technologies. In these applications, highly pure biphoton states are essential in any time- and frequency-mode, often obviating the need for time-resolved measurements. Conversely, spectroscopy utilising entangled photon pairs is gaining significant attention for its ability to unveil molecular dynamics, a field that critically demands time-resolved capabilities. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for capturing a biphoton spectrum that comprises visible and near-infrared photons, resulting in a three-fold non-degenerate joint spectrum. Our system employs two non-scanning spectrographs: a fibre spectrograph for near-infrared photons and a delay-line-anode single-photon imager for visible photons. We successfully measure the joint spectral intensity by leveraging a time-tagging acquisition strategy. Furthermore, our approach uniquely enables time-resolved joint spectral measurements with a temporal resolution of approximately 150 ps. This methodology bridges the gap between the requirements for pure biphoton states and the need for dynamic insights in quantum spectroscopy.

Title: High-Fidelity Single-Shot Readout and Selective Nuclear Spin Control for a Spin-1/2 Quantum Register in Diamond
Authors: Prithvi Gundlapalli, Philipp J. Vetter, Genko Genov, Michael Olney-Fraser, Peng Wang, Matthias M. Müller, Katharina Senkalla, Fedor Jelezko
Abstract: Quantum networks offer a way to overcome the size and complexity limitations of single quantum devices by linking multiple nodes into a scalable architecture. Group-IV color centers in diamond, paired with long-lived nuclear spins, have emerged as promising building blocks demonstrating proof-of-concept experiments such as blind quantum computing and quantum-enhanced sensing. However, realizing a large-scale electro-nuclear register remains a major challenge. Here we establish the germanium-vacancy (GeV) center as a viable platform for such network nodes. Using correlation spectroscopy, we identify single nuclear spins within a convoluted spin environment, overcoming limitations imposed by the color center's spin-$1/2$ nature and thereby enabling indirect control of these nuclear spins. We further demonstrate high-fidelity single-shot readout of both the GeV center ($95.8\,\%$) and a neighboring ${}^{13}\text{C}$ nuclear spin ($93.7\,\%$), a key tool for feed-forward error correction. These critical advances position the GeV center as a compelling candidate for next-generation quantum network nodes.

Title: Realization of Trapped Ion Dynamics in the Strong-Field Regime and Non-Markovianity
Authors: Kamran Rehan, Hengchao Tu, Tadeu Tassis, Menglin Zou, Zihan Yin, Jing-Ning Zhang, Fernando L. Semiao, Kihwan Kim
Abstract: Probing quantum dynamics in the strong-field regime is critical for advancing our understanding of controlled quantum systems and developing robust quantum technologies. In this work, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of a trapped ion where the Rabi frequency (Omega) approaches the vibrational mode frequency (nu), pushing the system beyond the weak-field regime, where non-trivial quantum correlations emerge. We begin by setting the detuning (delta) - the frequency offset between the qubit transition and the driving field - to zero and varying Omega from low to high values, eventually reaching the vibrational frequency. Using quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the density matrix and track its evolution to assess non-Markovianity, revealing significant memory effects governed by the interplay between internal and motional degrees of freedom. Furthermore, by exploring the dynamics across various parameter pairs (Omega, delta), we find that non-Markovianity does not always increase monotonically with Omega for a fixed delta. Strikingly, when the condition delta squared plus Omega squared equals nu squared is met, the non-Markovianity exhibits a circular pattern of maxima. At this parameter combination, the system's Hamiltonian takes a form similar to the Jaynes-Cummings model, enabling the possibility of analytical insights into the observed dynamics. These results go beyond the conventional carrier and sideband regimes, uncovering novel features of strong-field quantum dynamics. Our findings establish a pathway for using trapped-ion platforms to investigate non-Markovianity, coherent control, and the fundamental behavior of open quantum systems in extreme regimes.

Miller, Yilun Xu, Gang Huang, Irfan Siddiqi, John Lange, Christopher Zimmer, Travis Humble
Abstract: We propose an architecture, called NVQLink, for connecting high-performance computing (HPC) resources to the control system of a quantum processing unit (QPU) to accelerate workloads necessary to the operation of the QPU. We aim to support every physical modality of QPU and every type of QPU system controller (QSC). The HPC resource is optimized for real-time (latency-bounded) processing on tasks with latency tolerances of tens of microseconds. The network connecting the HPC and QSC is implemented on commercially available Ethernet and can be adopted relatively easily by QPU and QSC builders, and we report a round-trip latency measurement of 3.96 microseconds (max) with prospects of further optimization. We describe an extension to the CUDA-Q programming model and runtime architecture to support real-time callbacks and data marshaling between the HPC and QSC. By doing so, NVQLink extends heterogeneous, kernel-based programming to the QSC, allowing the programmer to address CPU, GPU, and FPGA subsystems in the QSC, all in the same C++ program, avoiding the use of a performance-limiting HTTP interface. We provide a pattern for QSC builders to integrate with this architecture by making use of multi-level intermediate representation dialects and progressive lowering to encapsulate QSC code.

Title: Quantum Enhanced Dark-Matter Search with Entangled Fock States in High-Quality Cavities
Authors: Benjamin Freiman, Xinyuan You, Andy C. Y. Li, Raphael Cervantes, Taeyoon Kim, Anna Grasselino, Roni Harnik, Yao Lu
Abstract: We present a quantum-enhanced protocol for detecting wave-like dark matter using an array of $N$ entangled superconducting cavities initialized in an $m$-photon Fock state. By distributing and recollecting the quantum state with an entanglement-distribution operation, the scan rate scales as $N^2(m+1)$ while thermal excitation is the dominant background, significantly outperforming classical single-cavity methods under matched conditions. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme against additional noise sources, including decoherence and beamsplitter infidelity, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. In practice, the key requirements, namely high-Q superconducting radio-frequency cavities that support long integration times, high-fidelity microwave beamsplitters, and universal cavity control, are already available on current experimental platforms, making the protocol experimentally feasible.

Title: Area-Law Entanglement in Quantum Chaotic System
Authors: Chunyin Chen, Sizhe Yan, Biao Wu
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental diagnostic for quantum chaos, typically exhibiting volume-law scaling in highly excited eigenstates of chaotic many-body systems. In this work, we present a striking counterexample: a Floquet-driven quantum many-body system with Rydberg-like blockade that, despite being fully chaotic as indicated by its Wigner-Dyson level statistics and local thermalization, exhibits a strict area-law entanglement entropy. Specifically, the entanglement entropy of every Floquet eigenstate is bounded by $\ln2$, independent of system size. We trace this anomaly to the specific Hilbert space structure imposed by the blockades, which restricts the Schmidt rank across a bipartition. Furthermore, we generalize this discovery by establishing a duality between constrained many-body Hamiltonians and single-particle quantum walks on median graphs, and we outline a general procedure for constructing systems with an entanglement entropy bounded by a predetermined constant. Our results demonstrate that entanglement entropy alone is an insufficient diagnostic of many-body quantum chaos and highlight the profound impact of Hilbert space geometry on quantum dynamics and thermalization.

Title: Getting to the Bottom of Noether's Theorem
Authors: John C. Baez
Abstract: We examine the assumptions behind Noether's theorem connecting symmetries and conservation laws. To compare classical and quantum versions of this theorem, we take an algebraic approach. In both classical and quantum mechanics, observables are naturally elements of a Jordan algebra, while generators of one-parameter groups of transformations are naturally elements of a Lie algebra. Noether's theorem holds whenever we can map observables to generators in such a way that each observable generates a one-parameter group that preserves itself. In ordinary complex quantum mechanics this mapping is multiplication by $\sqrt{-1}$. In the more general framework of unital JB-algebras, Alfsen and Shultz call such a mapping a "dynamical correspondence", and show its presence allows us to identify the unital JB-algebra with the self-adjoint part of a complex C*-algebra. However, to prove their result, they impose a second, more obscure, condition on the dynamical correspondence. We show this expresses a relation between quantum and statistical mechanics, closely connected to the principle that "inverse temperature is imaginary time".

Title: Noninvertible Symmetry-Resolved Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy Formula and Entanglement Entropy from the Boundary Tube Algebra
Authors: Yichul Choi, Brandon C. Rayhaun, Yunqin Zheng
Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a noninvertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the noninvertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).

Title: Quantum Mechanics from General Relativity and the Quantum Friedmann Equation
Authors: Marco Matone, Nikolaos Dimakis
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recently introduced linear equation, reformulating the first Friedmann equation, is the first-order WKB expansion of a quantum cosmological equation. This result shows a deeper underlying connection between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, pointing towards a unified framework. Solutions of this equation are built in terms of a scale factor encapsulating quantum effects on a free-falling particle. The quantum scale factor reshapes cosmic dynamics, resolving singularities at its vanishing points in several cases of interest. As an explicit example, we consider the radiation-dominated era and show that the quantum equation is dual to the one in Seiberg-Witten formulation, recently applied to black holes, and incorporates resurgence phenomena and complex metrics, as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten. This links to the invariance of time parametrization under $\Gamma(2)$ transformations of the dual wave function.

Title: Quantum gravity corrections to the spontaneous excitation of an accelerated atom interacting with a quantum scalar field
Authors: Zhi Wang
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) extends the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) by suggesting a minimum observable scale that includes the effects of quantum gravity, which is supposed to potentially result in observable effects far below the Planck energy scale, providing us the opportunity to explore the theory of quantum gravity through physical processes at low energy scale. In present work, we study the corrections induced by the GUP to the spontaneous radiation properties of a two-level atom interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field based on the DDC formalism. The GUP alters the correlation function of the scalar field, consequently affecting the radiative properties of atoms. We calculate the rate of change in the mean atomic energy for an atom undergoing inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and uniform circular motion. We show that the GUP can modify the spontaneous emission rate of an excited-state atom in inertial motion; however, it does not alter the stability of the ground-state atom in vacuum. For an atom in uniformly accelerated and uniformly circular motions, the GUP can change both its spontaneous emission and excitation rates; moreover, the corrections caused by the GUP contains the terms proportional to $\beta a^2$ or $\beta a^3$, suggesting that the proper acceleration $a$ of an atom in non-inertial motions could significantly amplify the effect of the GUP on the spontaneous transition rates of the atom.

Title: Coordinate- and spacetime-independent quantum physics
Authors: V.A. Emelyanov, D. Robertz
Abstract: The concept of a particle is ambiguous in quantum field theory. It is generally agreed that particles depend not only on spacetime, but also on coordinates used to parametrise spacetime points. One of us has in contrast proposed a coordinate-frame-independent model of quantum particles within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The aim of this article is to present a scalar-field-equation solution that is not only a zero-rank tensor under general coordinate transformations, but also common for anti-de-Sitter, de-Sitter, closed and open Einstein static universes. Moreover, it locally reduces to a Minkowski plane-wave solution and is non-perturbative in curvature. The former property makes it suitable for the standard applications of quantum theory in particle physics, while the latter allows then to gain insights into quantum physics in the strong-gravity regime.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonian and orthogonal polynomials
Authors: Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Riccarda Bonsignori, Viktor Eisler, Gilles Parez, Luc Vinet
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for free-fermion chains with a particular form of inhomogeneity. The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. Due to the bispectral properties of these functions, one can construct an operator which commutes exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian and corresponds to a linear or parabolic deformation of the physical one. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of the entanglement spectrum and entropy.

Title: Quantum vortices leave a macroscopic signature in the normal fluid
Authors: Luca Galantucci, Giorgio Krstulovic, Carlo F Barenghi
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show numerically that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.

Title: Measurement of the g factor of ground-state 87Sr at the parts-per-million level using co-trapped ultracold atoms
Authors: Premjith Thekkeppatt, Digvijay, Alexander Urech, Florian Schreck, Klaasjan van Druten
Abstract: We demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance of optically trapped ground-state ultracold 87Sr atoms. Using a scheme in which a cloud of ultracold 87Rb is co-trapped nearby, we improve the determination of the nuclear g factor, gI , of atomic 87Sr by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching accuracy at the parts-per-million level. We achieve similar accuracy in the ratio of relevant g factors between Rb and Sr. This establishes ultracold 87Sr as an excellent linear in-vacuum magnetometer. These results are relevant for ongoing efforts towards quantum simulation, quantum computation and optical atomic clocks employing 87Sr, and these methods can also be applied to other alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms.

Title: Quantum Hall Effect without Chern Bands
Authors: Benjamin Michen, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect was originally observed in a two-dimensional electron gas forming Landau levels when exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field and was later generalized to Chern insulators without net magnetization. Here, further extending the realm of the quantum Hall effect, we report on the robust occurrence of an integer quantized transverse conductance at the onset of disorder in a microscopic lattice model, all bands of which are topologically trivial (zero Chern number). We attribute this phenomenon to the energetic separation of nonquantized Berry fluxes within those bands. Adding disorder then nudges the system into a quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window inside a trivial band. This natural integer-rounding mechanism manifests as the mobility-gap-induced quantization of a nonuniversal Hall conductance. Our results are corroborated by numerical transport simulations and the analysis of two complementary topological markers.

Title: Calibration-free single-frame super-resolution fluorescence microscopy
Authors: Anežka Dostálová, Dominik Vašinka, Robert Stárek, Miroslav Ježek
Abstract: Molecular fluorescence microscopy is a leading approach to super-resolution and nanoscale imaging in life and material sciences. However, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is often bottlenecked by system-specific calibrations and long acquisitions of sparsely blinking molecules. We present a deep-learning approach that reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single diffraction-limited camera frame. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic data encompassing a wide range of optical and sample parameters, enabling robust generalization across microscopes and experimental conditions. Applied to dense terrylene samples with 150 ms acquisition time, our method significantly reduces reconstruction error compared to Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and ThunderSTORM multi-emitter fitting. The results confirm the ability to resolve emitters separated by 35 nm at 580 nm wavelength, corresponding to sevenfold resolution improvement beyond the Rayleigh criterion. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization ability of the developed model and its resilience across a broad range of noise levels, numerical apertures, and optical aberrations. By delivering unprecedented details from a single short camera exposure without prior information and calibration, our approach enables plug-and-play super-resolution imaging of fast, dense, or light-sensitive samples on standard wide-field setups.

Title: Strong Hilbert space fragmentation and fractons from subsystem and higher-form symmetries
Authors: Charles Stahl, Oliver Hart, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Rahul Nandkishore
Abstract: We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.

Title: Learning the non-Markovian features of subsystem dynamics
Authors: Michele Coppola, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Zala Lenarčič
Abstract: The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.

Title: Third harmonic-mediated amplification in TWPA
Authors: E. Rizvanov, S. Kern, P. Neilinger, M. Grajcar
Abstract: In Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers, higher-order harmonics of the pump tone and its sidebands are commonly present and typically regarded as parasitic. Consequently, most design efforts have focused on suppressing these harmonics. In spite of that, motivated by transient simulations, we extend the coupled-mode theory and demonstrate that, contrary to conventional belief, the third harmonic can enhance amplifier performance, improving both gain and bandwidth. We show that the recently developed plasma oscillation-based amplifier is particularly well-suited for exploiting this effect. Their dispersion relation enables us to observe the phenomenon in transient numerical simulations using JoSIM and WRspice. These simulations reveal improvement of the amplifier's performance, specifically the doubling of the bandwidth and an increase in the gain.

Title: Horizon brightened acceleration radiation entropy in causal diamond geometry: A near-horizon perspective
Authors: Nada Eissa, Carlos R. Ordóñez, Gustavo Valdivia-Mera
Abstract: In this article, we extend the horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) framework, originally introduced by Marlan Scully et al. in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 115, 8131 (2018), to the causal diamond (CD) spacetime. We study a cloud of two-level atoms, injected at random times in the asymptotic past of the CD, freely falling toward its causal horizon and emitting scalar radiation via a weak dipole coupling to a quantum field. In the near-horizon region, an emergent conformal symmetry-captured by conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)-governs the field dynamics and allows analytic control of the emission process. We find that the radiation spectrum is thermal, with temperature $T_D = 1/(\pi\alpha)$, and that the associated von Neumann entropy flux reproduces the entropy production of the radiation field. These results demonstrate that the causal horizons of the CD spacetime effectively act as a topological thermal reservoir, with thermal properties arising entirely from the global causal structure rather than from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, highlighting that the validity of the HBAR framework is fundamentally tied to the existence of causal horizons, independent of the presence of a black hole.

Title: Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers
Authors: Leonard Werner Pingen, Jiaqi Wu, Bo Peng
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.

Title: Spinning into Quantum Geometry: Dirac and Wheeler-DeWitt Dynamics from Stochastic Helicity
Authors: Partha Nandi, Partha Ghose, Francesco Petruccione
Abstract: Spin networks in loop quantum gravity provide a kinematical picture of quantum geometry but lack a natural mechanism for dynamical Dirac-type evolution, while the Wheeler--DeWitt equation typically enters only as an imposed constraint. We propose a stochastic framework in which each spin-network edge carries helicity-resolved amplitudes -- two-state internal labels that undergo Poisson-driven flips. The resulting coupled master equations, after analytic continuation and the introduction of a fundamental length scale, generate Dirac-type dynamics on discrete geometry. At long times, the same process relaxes to helicity-symmetric equilibrium states, which are shown to satisfy a Wheeler--DeWitt-type condition. In this way, both quantum evolution and the gravitational constraint emerge within a single probabilistic framework. Our approach thus provides a background-independent and stochastic route to quantum geometry, offering an alternative to canonical quantization and a fresh perspective on the problem of time.

Title: On Krylov Complexity as a Probe of the Quantum Mpemba Effect
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli
Abstract: We investigate Krylov state complexity as a probe of the quantum Mpemba effect in quantum spin chains. For models without global $U(1)$ symmetry, Krylov complexity exhibits clear Mpemba-like crossings, consistent with conventional diagnostics such as the trace distance, while offering a complementary interpretation in terms of Hilbert-space exploration and dynamical delocalization. In $U(1)$-symmetric systems, we confirm that the recently proposed symmetric component of Krylov complexity serves as a robust and reliable indicator of the QME, capturing anomalous relaxation even in cases where the total complexity fails to do so.

Authors: Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn
Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.

Title: Single Sr Atoms in Optical Tweezer Arrays for Quantum Simulation
Authors: Veronica Giardini, Luca Guariento, Andrea Fantini, Shawn Storm, Massimo Inguscio, Jacopo Catani, Giacomo Cappellini, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani
Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue shielded magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 6.8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\mu$K and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.

Title: A complex Gaussian representation of continuum wavefunctions respectful of their asymptotic behaviour
Authors: Stéphanie Laure Egome Nana, Arnaud Leclerc, Lorenzo Ugo Ancarani
Abstract: Complex Gaussian basis sets are optimized to accurately represent continuum radial wavefunctions over the whole space. First, attention is put on the technical ability of the optimization method to get more flexible series of Gaussian exponents, in order to improve the accuracy of the fitting approach. Second, an indirect fitting method is proposed, allowing for the oscillatory behaviour of continuum functions to be conserved up to infinity as a factorized asymptotic function, while the Gaussian representation is applied to some appropriately defined distortion factor with limited spatial extension. As an illustration, the method is applied to radial Coulomb functions with realistic energy parameters. We also show that the indirect fitting approach keeps the advantageous analytical structure of typical one-electron transition integrals occurring in molecular ionization applications.

Title: QCoder Benchmark: Bridging Language Generation and Quantum Hardware through Simulator-Based Feedback

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic. However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3 reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation API to support further research. (Codes and datasets are available at this https URL )

Title: Perfect Particle Transmission through Duality Defects
Authors: Atsushi Ueda, Vic Vander Linden, Laurens Lootens, Jutho Haegeman, Paul Fendley, Frank Verstraete
Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.
