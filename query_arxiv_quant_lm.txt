Title: Quantum Coherence as a Thermodynamic Resource Beyond the Classical Uncertainty Bound
Authors: Shanhe Su, Cong Fu, Ousi Pan, Shihao Xia, Fei Liu, Jincan Chen
Abstract: The precision of nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems is fundamentally limited, yet how quantum coherence shapes these limits remains largely unexplored. A general theoretical framework is introduced that explicitly links quantum coherence to thermodynamic uncertainty relations. By defining a coherence-sensitive measure, it is shown that quantum effects can relax the classical trade-off between the entropy production and the current fluctuations, enabling the precision beyond classical bounds. Application to a three-level quantum maser illustrates the framework in a concrete setting. These results establish quantum coherence as a genuine thermodynamic resource and provide a unified perspective connecting classical and quantum approaches to nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

Title: Picosecond Wireless Synchronization with Entangled Photons via Grid-Based Quantum Coverage in Indoor Optical Systems
Authors: Hossein Safi, Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna, Iman Tavakkolnia, Harald Haas
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement-assisted synchronization framework for indoor optical wireless systems based on grid-based beam steering. A central transmitter equipped with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source emits time-energy entangled photon pairs, directing user photons toward spatially defined grids based on estimated user positions, while retaining reference photons for timestamping. The room is partitioned into multiple beam-aligned regions, and photon reception probability is analytically modeled using local coordinate transformations and Gaussian beam optics. To address the inherent sparsity and randomness of photon detection, we develop a robust two-stage synchronization algorithm that performs sparse bit-pattern matching and timestamp averaging to estimate timing offsets. Monte Carlo simulations are then performed to evaluate the impact of synchronization duration, grid resolution, and photon-pair generation rate on synchronization accuracy. Results show that finer grid configurations and optimal photon-pair rates significantly reduce synchronization error, achieving sub-10 ps timing accuracy within 1 ms of synchronization time. The proposed approach enables scalable, high-precision quantum synchronization in wireless indoor environments, laying the groundwork for future joint quantum communication, sensing, and positioning systems.

Title: Hybrid Lattice Surgery: Non-Clifford Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes
Authors: Sheng-Jie Huang, Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Yanzhu Chen
Abstract: In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.

Title: Local-to-Global Entanglement Dynamics by Periodically Driving Impurities
Authors: Zhi-Xing Lin, Abhinav Prem, Shinsei Ryu, Bastien Lapierre
Abstract: We study the entanglement dynamics of a one-dimensional spin chain subject to a local Floquet drive of a two-site impurity. We uncover a sharp transition in the entanglement dynamics as a function of the driving frequency. For large drive periods $T$, we observe a linear growth in entanglement entropy (EE), indicating a heating phase with volume law entanglement. Surprisingly, for driving periods below a critical value $T_\ast$, the EE grows subextensively with time, characteristic of a local quantum quench. In the non-interacting limit, we analytically trace the origin of this phenomenon to a transition in the single-particle Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. We also find that for $T>T_*$, the so-called ``average energy" operator develops non-local, rainbow-like couplings that are responsible for the rapid entanglement growth in the heating phase, but remains local for $T<T_*$. Using extensive matrix-product-state simulations, we show that the non-heating phase and the subextensive entanglement growth persist in the presence of weak interactions for numerically accessible timescales. Our results establish that local Floquet engineering can generate emergent bulk phenomena, shedding new light on energy localization and thermalization in driven many-body systems.

Title: Fragmentation of Virtual Orbitals for Quantum Computing: Reducing Qubit Requirements through Many-Body Expansion
Authors: Federico Zahariev, Mark S. Gordon
Abstract: The development of quantum computing for molecular simulations is constrained by the limited number of qubits available on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The present work introduces the Virtual Orbital Fragmentation (FVO) method, a systematic approach that reduces qubit requirements by 40--66\% while maintaining chemical accuracy. The method partitions the virtual orbital space into chemically intuitive fragments and employs many-body expansion techniques analogous to spatial fragmentation methods. Applications to six molecular systems demonstrate that the 2-body FVO expansion achieves errors below 3 kcal/mol, while the 3-body expansion provides sub-kcal/mol accuracy. When integrated with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and combined with the Effective Fragment Molecular Orbital (EFMO) method for multi-molecular systems, the hierarchical Q-EFMO-FVO approach achieves 96--100\% accuracy relative to full calculations. The method provides a practical pathway for quantum chemical calculations on current 50--100 qubit processors and establishes virtual orbital fragmentation as a complementary strategy to spatial fragmentation for managing quantum computational complexity.

Title: Thermodynamic decoupling in the deep-strong coupling regime
Authors: S. Palafox, M. Salado-Mejía, M. Santiago-García, R. Román-Ancheyta
Abstract: In the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime, the interaction between light and matter exceeds their bare frequencies, leading to an effective decoupling. Theoretical and experimental evidence for this behavior has relied solely on measurements of local observables at equilibrium. However, such a local approach is insufficient to accurately describe energy fluxes in critical and nonequilibrium phenomena. Here, we use a two-terminal quantum junction to derive a thermodynamically consistent global master equation. We demonstrate that the associated heat current, a key nonlocal observable in any quantum thermal machine, also approaches zero in this extreme coupling scenario, underscoring the role of virtual photons in the vacuum ground state. Our results indicate that the decoupling is a more general feature of the DSC regime, with implications for quantum thermotronics.

Title: No-broadcasting of non-Gaussian states
Authors: Kaustav Chatterjee, Ulrik Lund Andersen
Abstract: Gaussian states are of fundamental importance in the physics of continuous-variable quantum systems. They are appealing for the experimental ease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and an elegant mathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies require us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian elements. In terms of quantum resource theory, we can then recognize non-Gaussian states as resources and Gaussian operations and states as free, which can be used and prepared easily. Given such a structure of resource theory, the task of broadcasting the resource is to determine if the resource content of a state can be cloned in a meaningful way, which, if possible, provides a strong operation for manipulation of the resource. In this work, we prove that broadcasting of non-Gaussian states via Gaussian operations is not possible. For this, we first show that the relative entropy of non- Gaussianity is not super-additive, which rules it out as a prime candidate in the analysis of such no-go results. Our proof is then based on understanding fixed points of Gaussian operations and relates to the theory of control systems. The no-go theorem also states that if two initially uncorrelated systems interact by Gaussian dynamics and non-Gaussianity is created at one subsystem, then the non-Gaussianity of the other subsystem must be reduced. Further, keeping the set of free operations fixed to Gaussian operations, we can also comment on the broadcasting of Wigner negativity and genuine quantum non-Gaussianity.

Title: Absence of gravitationally induced entanglement in certain semi-classical theories of gravity
Authors: Ward Struyve
Abstract: Bose et al. and Marletto and Vedral proposed an experiment to test whether gravity can induce entanglement between massive systems, arguing that the capacity to do so would imply the quantum nature of gravity. In this work, a class of semi-classical models is examined that treat gravity classically, through some potential in the Schrödinger equation, and it is shown that these models do not generate entanglement. This class includes the Newton-Schrödinger model, where gravity is sourced by the wave function, the Bohmian analogue, where gravity is sourced by actual point-particles, and an interpolating model proposed by Döner and Grossardt. These models are analyzed in the context of the proposed experiment and contrasted with the standard Newtonian potential, which does generate entanglement.

Title: Certifying Randomness or its Lack Thereof for General Network Scenarios
Authors: Maria Ciudad Alañón, Daniel Centeno, Andrew Watford, Elie Wolfe
Abstract: The certification of intrinsic randomness is foundational to quantum information theory and central in many practical applications thereof, such as in the generation of unquestionably random numbers and in cryptographic protocols. Device-independent randomness certification based on violations of Bell inequalities has been thoroughly investigated within the standard Bell scenario. In this work, we aim to extend this line of research by exploring randomness certification in more general causal structures, namely, network scenarios. To address this task, we demonstrate how the computational tool known as the inflation technique can be adapted. As proof of concept, we use inflation to certify randomness relative to a beyond-quantum adversary for sample probability distributions obtained in the bilocality and triangle scenarios. Complementarily, we also provide computational methods for the problem of certifying an absence of randomness, which should not be conflated with certifying the classicality of a given probability distribution. We conclude with a discussion of conceptual subtleties regarding randomness certification in networks, highlighting important open problems in this nascent research field.

Title: Quantum Interference and the Limits of Separability
Authors: Sebastian Horvat
Abstract: Quantum theory implies, and empirical evidence confirms, that while particles $\textit{can}$ exhibit wave-like behavior in interferometric experiments, this behavior is so limited as $\textit{not}$ to allow for third- and higher-order interference. The article at hand shows that this possibility-impossibility structure suggests the universal validity of a principle that regulates statistical correlations between spatiotemporally localized events, $\textit{independently}$ of the nature of the objects that may or may not partake in these events. Roughly, the said principle mandates that $\textit{any}$ joint influence of $m$ mutually spacelike separated events on $\textit{another}$ event, be such, that it can be separated by $\textit{at least}$ $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ mediating events, and in some cases, by $\textit{no more}$ than $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ mediating events. The structure of quantum interference thus teaches us that events can influence each other in a non-separable fashion, but that this non-separability has a certain exactly quantifiable limit.

Title: Harnessing Intrinsic Noise for Quantum Simulation of Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Sameer Dambal, Akira Sone, Yu Zhang
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems on quantum computers presents a fundamental challenge: open quantum dynamics are intrinsically nonunitary, whereas quantum computers operate through unitary evolution. Conventional approaches overcome this mismatch by encoding nonunitary processes into unitary circuits, but such methods incur substantial overhead in both qubits and gates. Here, we propose an alternative perspective. Quantum processors are themselves open systems, inherently subject to noise. Instead of correcting all errors and then encoding nonunitary dynamics with unitary logical qubits and gates, we show how noise can be harnessed as a computational resource. We develop a noise-assisted quantum algorithm that selectively preserves physical noise to emulate nonunitary channels, enabling efficient simulation of open quantum dynamics with minimal qubit requirements. Our approach applies both to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant architectures. By leveraging intrinsic noise, this method circumvents the need to encode nonunitary dynamics into unitary gates and relaxes fidelity requirements on physical qubits, thereby reducing the overhead of quantum error correction. This framework reframes noise from a limitation into a resource, opening new directions for practical quantum simulation of open systems

Title: A broadband single microwave-photon detector insensitive to the thermal noise
Authors: Y. Q. Chai, M. Y. Wang, S. N. Wang, P. H. Ouyang, L. F. Wei
Abstract: Thermal noise is one of the physical obstacles that constrain the achievable detection sensitivities of various detectors. Indeed, as we showed in a recent paper (PRB 111, 024501 (2025)), the usual Josephson threshold detector (JTD) operated in an equilibrium state can be utilized to implement a weak microwave signal, just approaching (but not arriving at) its energy quantum limit, even though its physical parameters have been optimized. In this letter, we further demonstrate numerically that the phase dynamics of a current-biased Josephson junction (CBJJ) can be insensitive to the always-on thermal noise if the sweep rate of the biased current is significantly high. As a consequence, the JTD can be operated alternatively in a non-equilibrium state. Based on the statistical binary detection criterion, we demonstrate how such a non-equilibrium JTD (NEJTD) can be utilized to implement the weak microwave signal, arriving at its energy quantum limit level. The dynamic range and photon-number resolvability of the proposed NEJTD are also discussed when it serves as a broadband single microwave-photon detector.

Title: Stability of Maximum-Entropy Inference in Finite Dimensions
Authors: James Tian
Abstract: We study maximum-entropy inference for finite-dimensional quantum states under linear moment constraints. Given expectation values of finitely many observables, the feasible set of states is convex but typically non-unique. The maximum-entropy principle selects the Gibbs state that agrees with the data while remaining maximally unbiased. We prove that convergence of moments and entropy implies convergence of states in trace norm, derive explicit quantitative bounds linking data and entropy deviations to state distance, and show that these results are stable under unital completely positive maps. The analysis is self-contained and relies on convex duality, relative entropy, and Pinsker-type inequalities, providing a rigorous and unified foundation for finite-dimensional maximum-entropy inference.

Title: Tunable Asymmetric Delay Attack in Quantum Clock Synchronization
Authors: Hui Han, Haotian Teng, Hailong Xu, Jinquan Huang, Yuanmei Xie, Yichen Zhang, Bo Liu, Wanrong Yu, Baokang Zhao, Shuhui Chen
Abstract: Quantum clock synchronization underpins modern secure communications and critical infrastructure, yet its fundamental dependence on channel reciprocity introduces an exploitable vulnerability to asymmetric delay attacks. Current attack strategies rely on static delays, limiting their ability to target application-specific stability requirements. Here, we propose a tunable asymmetric delay attack (T-ADA) that dynamically controls delay parameters to induce manipulate synchronization accuracy. Through experimental implementation, we demonstrate how tailored attack trajectories can selectively compromise system stability across different scenarios. This work uncovers key vulnerabilities in synchronization protocols under customizable attacks and provide a foundation for developing secure and resilient quantum clock synchronization systems.

Title: Myopic Entropy Scheduling for Ramsey Magnetometry
Authors: Julian Greentree, William Moran, Rob Evans, Andrew Melatos, Neel Kanth Kundu, Peter M. Farrell
Abstract: This paper presents an entropy based adaptive measurement sequence strategy for quantum sensing of magnetic fields. To physically ground our ideas we consider a sensor employing a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, however our approach is applicable to other quantum sensor arrangements. The sensitivity and accuracy of these sensors typically rely on long sequences of rapidly occurring measurements. We introduce a new technique for designing these measurement sequences aimed at reducing the number of measurements required for a specified accuracy as measured by entropy, by selecting measurement parameters that optimally reduce entropy at each measurement. We compare, via simulation, the efficiency and sensitivity of our new method with several existing measurement sequence design strategies. Our results show quantifiable improvements in sensing performance. We also show analytically that our entropy reduction approach, reduces, under certain simplified conditions, to a well-known and widely used measurement strategy.

Title: Scalable protocol to coherence estimation from scarce data: Theory and experiment
Authors: Qi-Ming Ding, Ting Zhang, Hui Li, Da-Jian Zhang
Abstract: Key quantum features like coherence are the fundamental resources enabling quantum advantages and ascertaining their presence in quantum systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This task, however, faces severe challenges in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. On one hand, experimental data are typically scarce, rendering full state reconstruction infeasible. On the other hand, these features are usually quantified by highly nonlinear functionals that elude efficient estimations via existing methods. In this work, we propose a scalable protocol for estimating coherence from scarce data and further experimentally demonstrate its practical utility. The key innovation here is to relax the potentially NP-hard coherence estimation problem into a computationally efficient optimization. This renders the computational cost in our protocol insensitive to the system size, in sharp contrast to the exponential growth in traditional methods. This work opens a novel route toward estimating coherence of large-scale quantum systems under data-scarce conditions.

Title: Runtime reduction in lattice surgery utilizing time-like soft information
Authors: Yutaro Akahoshi, Riki Toshio, Jun Fujisaki, Hirotaka Oshima, Shintaro Sato, Keisuke Fujii
Abstract: Runtime optimization of the quantum computing within a given computational resource is important to achieve practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we propose a runtime reduction protocol for the lattice surgery, which utilizes the soft information corresponding to the logical measurement error. Our proposal is a simple two-step protocol: operating the lattice surgery with the small number of syndrome measurement cycles, and reexecuting it with full syndrome measurement cycles in cases where the time-like soft information catches logical error symptoms. We firstly discuss basic features of the time-like complementary gap as the concrete example of the time-like soft information based on numerical results. Then, we show that our protocol surpasses the existing runtime reduction protocol called temporally encoded lattice surgery (TELS) for the most cases. In addition, we confirm that the combination of our protocol and the TELS protocol can reduce the runtime further, over 50% in comparison to the naive serial execution of the lattice surgery. The proposed protocol in this paper can be applied to any quantum computing architecture based on the lattice surgery, and we expect that this will be one of the fundamental building blocks of runtime optimization to achieve practical scale quantum computing.

Title: Access to Klein Tunneling via Space-Time Modulation
Authors: Furkan Ok, Amir Bahrami, Christophe Caloz
Abstract: We show that space-time modulation of electromagnetic potentials enables Klein tunneling far below the static threshold. The derived kinematics reveal oblique transitions that can connect opposite-energy continua without requiring their overlap, yielding a velocity-tunable Klein gap where transmission vanishes within a finite velocity window and reemerges beyond. The associated reduction in energy thresholds -- by up to four orders of magnitude -- suggests unprecedented experimental feasibility using flying-focus fronts and relativistic electron beams.

Title: Role of inefficient measurement in realizing post-selection-based non-Hermitian qubits
Authors: Roson Nongthombam, Aman Verma, Amarendra K. Sarma
Abstract: Post-selecting against quantum jumps into the ground state confines the evolution of the three-level system to the excited states manifold, effectively realizing a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian qubit. In this work, by introducing post-selection efficiencies for both decay channels, the second-excited to first-excited and the first-excited to ground-state transitions, we formulate a hybrid-Liouvillian framework that captures the unmonitored dynamics of the non-Hermitian qubit. We find that the decoherence effects arising from quantum jumps within the second-excited and first-excited manifold also manifest under inefficient post-selection of the second-excited to first-excited transitions, thereby modifying the spectral properties of the Liouvillian and leading to a splitting of the exceptional points. A comparative analysis shows that the trajectory-based approach, obtained by ensemble-averaging stochastic measurement trajectories generated via the Bayesian state update rule, and the Lindblad evolution remain consistent. Our results highlight the fundamental role of measurement inefficiency in realizing post-selection-based non-Hermitian qubits and in shaping the structure of Liouvillian exceptional points. These findings provide new insights into how inefficient measurement processes influence non-Hermitian behavior in open quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Neural Network Architectures for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting
Authors: Sandra Ranilla-Cortina, Diego A. Aranda, Jorge Ballesteros, Jesus Bonilla, Nerea Monrio, Elías F. Combarro, Jose Ranilla
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of multivariate time-series forecasting using quantum machine learning techniques. We introduce adaptation strategies that extend variational quantum circuit models, traditionally limited to univariate data, toward the multivariate setting, exploring both purely quantum and hybrid quantum-classical formulations. First, we extend and benchmark several VQC-based and hybrid architectures to systematically evaluate their capacity to model cross-variable dependencies. Second, building upon these foundations, we introduce the iQTransformer, a novel quantum transformer architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism within the iTransformer framework, enabling a quantum-native representation of inter-variable relationships. Third, we provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that quantum-based models may achieve competitive or superior forecasting accuracy with fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence than state-of-the-art classical and quantum baselines in some cases. These contributions highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced architectures as efficient and scalable tools for advancing multivariate time-series forecasting.

Title: Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems
Authors: Ali Mollabashi, Mohammad-Javad Vasli
Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.

Title: Obtaining Accurate Ground-State Properties on Near-term Quantum Devices
Authors: Qi-Ming Ding, Jiawei Peng, Junxiang Huang, Yukun Zhang, Huiyuan Wang, Xiaosi Xu, Jiajun Ren, Yingjin Ma, Xiao Yuan
Abstract: Accurate ground-state calculations on noisy quantum computers are fundamentally limited by restricted ansatz expressivity and unavoidable hardware errors. We introduce a hybrid-quantum classical framework that simultaneously addresses these challenges. Our method systematically purifies noisy two electron reduced density matrices from quantum devices by enforcing N-representability conditions through efficient semidefinite programming, guided by a norm-based distance constraint to the experimental data. To implement this constraint, we develop a hardware efficient calibration protocol based on Clifford circuits. We demonstrate near full configuration interaction accuracy for ground-state energies of H2, LiH, and H4, and compute precise scattering intensities for C6H8 on noisy hardware. This approach surpasses conventional methods by simultaneously overcoming both ansatz limitations and hardware noise, establishing a scalable route to quantum advantage and marking a critical step toward reliable simulations of complex molecularnsystems on noisy devices.

Title: 3D micro-printing: An enabling technique for arbitrary potential landscapes for photonic quantum-gases
Authors: Julian Schulz, Kirankumar Karkihalli Umesh, Sven Enns, Frank Vewinger, Georg von Freymann
Abstract: Photonic quantum gases explore the physics of open driven-dissipative quantum systems under ambient conditions and thus open access to thermodynamics and transport phenomena in quantum gases in the weakly interacting regime. Here we introduce the technology of 3D micro-printing to create potential landscapes for photonic quantum gases in dye-filled micro cavities, which surpass the current state of the art in terms of potential size and definition, potential depth, coupling strength, and number of coupled potentials by at least an order of magnitude. We realize as demonstration of the capabilities box potentials with rectangular side walls, anisotropic harmonic potentials, double-well potentials with dimensions on the scale of the wavelength of light as well as potential lattices with topological non-trivial properties. This approach paves the way for experimentally studying the physics of open quantum systems on lattices and might find applications in solving complex ground-state problems like the XY-model.

Title: From Discrete to Continuous-Variable Systems via Jordan-Schwinger Tomographic Transformation
Authors: Vladimir A. Orlov, Liubov A. Markovich, Alexey N. Rubtsov, Vladimir I. Man'ko
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems that combine discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) architectures represent a promising direction in quantum information science. However, transferring concepts and methods between such fundamentally different platforms entails both practical and theoretical challenges. The formalisms of these two "universes" differ significantly, and many notions, although sharing the same names, possess distinct properties and physical interpretations. In this work, we construct a bridge between DV and CV systems by means of the tomographic probability representation of quantum states complemented by the Jordan-Schwinger map. We connect observable random variables such as spin projections, photon numbers, or quadratures arising in DV and CV architectures through their probabilistic representations, namely spin, photon-number, and symplectic tomograms, as well as the Wigner function. This makes it possible to directly obtain the tomogram in one architecture from measurement data in another, thereby reconstructing the corresponding state across representations realizing similar statistics. The proposed formalism enables a unified framework for comparing and transferring quantum information across different hardware platforms. This facilitates the design of hybrid protocols where, for example, spin-based quantum memories interface with photonic communication channels or CV bosonic codes. It also provides a practical tool for benchmarking quantum devices, validating algorithms across heterogeneous architectures, and exploring error correction schemes that rely on mappings between finite- and infinite-dimensional systems.

Title: Trajectories in coupled waveguides: an application to a recent experiment and Hiley's lessons on the falsification of the Bohmian model
Authors: F. Daem, T. Durt, A. Matzkin
Abstract: From "surreal" trajectories to which-way measurements, Basil Hiley had a lesson: claims of falsifying the Bohmian model do not withstand scrutiny provided the model is applied correctly. In this work we compute de Broglie-Bohm trajectories for particles tunneling in coupled waveguides relevant to a recent experiment having claimed to challenge the Bohmian model. We show that the Bohmian model - correctly applied - gives results identical to the standard quantum approach, first by working out a simple one-dimensional model, and then by computing Bohmian trajectories for the full two-dimensional problem representing a quantum particle propagating inside coupled waveguides. We further recall the contextual nature of the Bohmian trajectories whereby the trajectories of a closed system differ from the ones observed when an interaction with a measurement apparatus takes places.

Title: Quantum Similarity-Driven QUBO Framework for Multi-Period Supply Chain Allocation using Time-Multiplexed Coherent Ising Machines and Simulated Quantum Annealing
Authors: Rushikesh Ubale, Yasar Mulani, Abhay Suresh, Gregory Byrd, Sangram Deshpande, B.R.Nikilesh, Sanya Nanda
Abstract: Multi-period stock-keeping unit (SKU) allocation in supply chains is a combinatorial optimization problem that is both NP-hard and operationally critical, requiring simultaneous attention to profitability, feasibility, and diversity. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) provides a principled framework for such tasks, yet prior studies often rely on simplified assumptions or omit real operational constraints. This work proposes a hybrid QUBO framework integrating three advances: (i) a quantum-derived similarity kernel, obtained from a variational RX embedding, to discourage redundant SKU selections; (ii) exact per-period capacity enforcement via slack-bit encoding to maintain feasibility; and (iii) execution on a time-multiplexed Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) benchmarked against simulated quantum annealing (SQA) and classical optimization algorithms. The resulting model, with over one million quadratic terms and about 4,100 variables, captures profit, risk, and capacity interactions within a unified formulation. On a dataset of 500 SKUs across eight planning periods, Quanfluence's CIM achieved an energy of minus 2.95 times 10 to the power of 16, producing robust solutions with 288 distinct SKUs (approximately 60 percent of the catalog), 226,813 allocated units, and 12.75 million dollars profit, all with zero capacity violations. These results demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical QUBO methods can deliver feasible and profitable supply-chain allocations at an industrial scale.

Title: Probing Sensitivity near a Quantum Exceptional Point using Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Aziza Almanakly, Reouven Assouly, Harry Hanlim Kang, Michael Gingras, Bethany M. Niedzielski, Hannah Stickler, Mollie E. Schwartz, Kyle Serniak, Max Hays, Jeffrey A. Grover, William D. Oliver
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with complex eigenenergies are useful tools for describing the dynamics of open quantum systems. In particular, parity and time (\PT) symmetric Hamiltonians have generated interest due to the emergence of exceptional-point degeneracies, where both eigenenergies and eigenvectors coalesce as the energy spectrum transitions from real- to complex-valued. Because of the abrupt spectral response near exceptional points, such systems have been proposed as candidates for precision quantum sensing. In this work, we emulate a passive \PT~dimer using a two-mode, non-Hermitian system of superconducting qubits comprising one high-coherence qubit coupled to an intentionally lossy qubit via a tunable coupler. The loss is introduced by strongly coupling the qubit to a continuum of photonic modes in an open waveguide environment. Using both pulsed and continuous-wave measurements, we characterize the system dynamics near the exceptional point. We observe a behavior broadly consistent with an ideal passive \PT~dimer with some corrections due to the tunable coupler element. We extract the complex eigenenergies associated with the two modes and calculate the sensitivity as a function of the coupling strength. Confirming theoretical predictions, we observe no sensitivity enhancement near the quantum exceptional point. This study elucidates the limitations of exceptional-point systems as candidates for quantum-enhanced sensing.

Title: On the Schrödinger and Carroll Schrödinger Equations: Dualities and Applications
Authors: José Rojas, Enrique Casanova, Melvin Arias
Abstract: We investigate precise structural relations between the standard Schrödinger equation and its Carrollian analogue-the Carroll-Schrödinger equation-in 1+1 dimensions, with emphasis on dualities, potential maps, and solution behavior. Our contributions proceed in the order of the paper: (i) we encode both dynamics with operators $H$ and $F$ under external potentials and explore conditions for obtaining the same type of solutions within both formalisms; (ii) we construct a potential-dependent reparametrization $x = \delta(t)$ mapping the space-independent Carroll equation to the time-independent Schrödinger equation, and derive a Schwarzian relation that specifies the map $\delta$ for any static $V_{sch}$ (with harmonic, Coulomb-like, and free examples); (iii) we relate conserved densities and currents by removing $V_{car}$ through a gauge transform followed by a coordinate inversion, establishing equivalence of the continuity equations; (iv) we obtain a Carrollian dispersion relation from an ultra-boost of the energy-momentum two-vector and also derive the classical limit of the Carroll wave equation via the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism; (v) we place Carroll dynamics on an equal-$x$ Hilbert space $L^2(R_t)$, prove unitary $x$-evolution, and illustrate dynamics with an exactly solvable Gaussian packet and finite-time quantization for time-localized perturbations; and (vi) for general $V(x; t)$ we perform a gauge reduction to an interaction momentum and set up a controlled Dyson expansion about solvable time profiles.

Title: Real-time decoding of the gross code memory with FPGAs
Authors: Thilo Maurer, Markus Bühler, Michael Kröner, Frank Haverkamp, Tristan Müller, Drew Vandeth, Blake R. Johnson
Abstract: We introduce a prototype FPGA decoder implementing the recently discovered Relay-BP algorithm and targeting memory experiments on the $[[144,12,12]]$ bivariate bicycle quantum low-density parity check code. The decoder is both fast and accurate, achieving a belief propagation iteration time of 24ns. It matches the logical error performance of a floating-point implementation despite using reduced precision arithmetic. This speed is sufficient for an average per cycle decoding time under $1\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ assuming circuit model error probabilities are less than $3 \times 10^{-3}$. This prototype decoder offers useful insights on the path toward decoding solutions for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Title: A truncated photon
Authors: Isak Cecil Onsager Rukan, Jan Gulla, Johannes Skaar
Abstract: An elementary particle such as a photon cannot be cut in two pieces. Still it must be possible to truncate a photon with an optical shutter. The result is not another photon or a mix of a photon and a vacuum. Instead it is a superposition and mix of photon numbers up to infinity. This state is rather complicated, but nevertheless locally equivalent to a single photon or vacuum in disjoint regions. Finally we demonstrate how the truncated photon may be illuminating and useful for the understanding of locality and equivalence in quantum field theory.

Title: Analytical determination of multi-time correlation functions in quantum chaotic systems
Authors: Yoana R. Chorbadzhiyska, Peter A. Ivanov, Charlie Nation
Abstract: The time-dependence of multi-point observable correlation functions are essential quantities in analysis and simulation of quantum dynamics. Open quantum systems approaches utilize two-point correlations to describe the influence of an environment on a system of interest, and in studies of chaotic quantum system, the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is used to probe chaoticity of dynamics. In this work we analytically derive the time dependence of multi-point observable correlation functions in quantum systems from a random matrix theoretic approach, with the highest order function of interest being the OTOC. We find in each case that dynamical contributions are related to a simple function, related to the Fourier transform of coarse-grained wave-functions. We compare the predicted dynamics to exact numerical experiments in a spin chain for various physical observables. We comment on implications towards the emergence of Markovianity and quantum regression in closed quantum systems, as well as relate our results to known bounds on chaotic dynamics.

Title: Energy storage in a continuous-variable quantum battery with nonlinear coupling
Authors: C. A. Downing, M. S. Ukhtary
Abstract: In the quantum world, the process of energy storage can be enhanced thanks to various nonclassical phenomena. This inspiring fact suggests quantum batteries as plausible sources of power for future quantum devices, at least in principle. However, thermodynamically not all of the energy stored in a quantum battery is useful for doing work. By considering a class of models based upon quantum continuous variables, here we show how the maximum extractable energy from a bosonic quantum battery can be intimately related to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We found that realizing minimum uncertainty essentially guarantees that all of the energy stored in a Gaussian quantum battery can be withdrawn and used to do work. For a standard system where the charger and battery are coupled linearly, this criterion is satisfied rather trivially. However, our theoretical results demonstrate that - for a quantum battery with nonlinear coupling - a state of minimum uncertainty can also be achieved nontrivially via the generation of quantum squeezing. We characterize the charging performance of our proposed continuous variable quantum batteries in detail, and we hope that our theory may be useful in the design of a new generation of efficient quantum batteries harnessing bosonic excitations, such as those built with photonic architectures.

Title: Can Bose-Einstein condensates enhance radioactive decay?
Authors: Hanzhen Lin, Yukun Lu, Wolfgang Ketterle
Abstract: This paper lays out the principles of how Bose-Einstein condensates can modify radioactive decay. We highlight the challenges of many modes and short coherence times due to the $\approx$ MeV energies of the emitted radiation. Recent proposals for gamma ray and neutrino lasers claim that using a Bose-Einstein condensate as a source would solve these issues. We show that this is not the case, and the proposed experiments would have a gain of only $10^{-20}$ or smaller. We also analyze proposals for gamma ray lasers based on stimulated annihilation of positronium Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title: Fundamental impossibility of a superradiant neutrino laser
Authors: Yu-Kun Lu, Hanzhen Lin, Wolfgang Ketterle
Abstract: Here we address the fundamental question whether an idealized system of $N$ atoms will show collective behavior and superradiance when it emits fermions instead of photons. We show that the maximum emission is $\propto N$ and not $\propto N^2$ which proves the absence of superradiance and shows that the recent proposal to realize a superradiant neutrino laser is impossible. This can be understood as either destructive interference of fermionic transition amplitudes, or Pauli blockade by collective excitations with fermionic nature. On the other hand, states with low excitation can show collective behavior. We derive the exact solution of the fermionic Dicke problem and analyze the decay dynamics in various regimes.

Title: Interpolative separable density fitting on adaptive real space grids
Authors: Hai Zhu, Chia-Nan Yeh, Miguel A. Morales, Leslie Greengard, Shidong Jiang, Jason Kaye
Abstract: We generalize the interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) method, used for compressing the four-index electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor, to incorporate adaptive real space grids for potentially highly localized single-particle basis functions. To do so, we employ a fast adaptive algorithm, the recently-introduced dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting method, to solve the Poisson equation for the ISDF auxiliary basis functions. The adaptive grids are generated using a high-order accurate, black-box procedure that satisfies a user-specified error tolerance. Our algorithm relies on the observation, which we prove, that an adaptive grid resolving the pair densities appearing in the ERI tensor can be straightforwardly constructed from one that resolves the single-particle basis functions, with the number of required grid points differing only by a constant factor. We find that the ISDF compression efficiency for the ERI tensor with highly localized basis sets is comparable to that for smoother basis sets compatible with uniform grids. To demonstrate the performance of our procedure, we consider several molecular systems with all-electron basis sets which are intractable using uniform grid-based methods. Our work establishes a pathway for scalable many-body electronic structure simulations with arbitrary smooth basis functions, making simulations of phenomena like core-level excitations feasible on a large scale.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories: fermionic gauging, transmutation, and Kramers-Wannier dualities
Authors: Lei Su
Abstract: We generalize the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries by inserting Majorana fermions, establishing parallel duality correspondences for bosonic and fermionic lattice systems. Using this fermionic gauging, we construct fermionic analogs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories dual to the transverse-field Ising model, interpretable as Majorana stabilizer codes. We demonstrate a unitary equivalence between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory obtained by gauging the fermion parity of a free fermionic system and the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with potentially nonlocal terms on the square lattice with toroidal geometry. This equivalence is implemented by a linear-depth local unitary circuit, connecting the bosonic and fermionic toric codes through a direction-dependent anyonic transmutation. The gauge theory obtained by gauging fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction between the recently proposed Kramers--Wannier dualities and those obtained by gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry along a space-covering path. Our results extend naturally to higher-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, providing a unified framework for bosonic and fermionic dualities and offering new insights for quantum computation and simulation.

Title: Electrical-control of third-order nonlinearity via Fano interference
Authors: Deniz Eren Mol, İbrahim Asrın Üzgüç, Ulaş Eyüpoğlu, Kübra Atar, Sena Taşkıran, Taner Tarik Aytas, Rasim Volga Ovali, Ramazan Sahin, Mehmet Emre Tasgin
Abstract: Programmable photonic computers necessitate the integration of electrically-tunable compact components into the photonic devices. In the state-of-the-art photonic quantum computers~(PQCs), phase-shift and displacement gates can be implemented in an electrically-programmable way. An efficient PQC, however, necessitates also the tuning of third or higher order nonlinearity for implementing continuous-variable~(CV) gates at a shorter sequence. Here, we demonstrate that such an optical component can be designed using Fano interference and Stark effect in a nonlinear nano-plasmonic system. We study the coupling of a broadband bright plasmon mode to a narrow linewidth quantum object(s), QO(s). We show that by shifting the level-spacing of the QO via Stark effect, one can continuously tune the third-order nonlinearity gate within a picosecond response time. We also present finite-difference time domain~(FDTD) simulations that take the retardation effects into account. In addition, we also show that enhancement due to Fano interference degrades if the QOs are positioned randomly as each QO introduces different phases. This reveals the importance of the spatial extent of the QO-ensemble to be employed in the experiments.

Title: The generalized adiabatic theorem for extended lattice systems
Authors: Lennart Becker, Stefan Teufel, Marius Wesle
Abstract: We prove an adiabatic theorem for infinitely extended lattice fermion systems with gapped ground states, allowing perturbations that may close the gap. The Heisenberg dynamics on the CAR-algebra is generated by a time dependent two-parameter family of Hamiltonians $H^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t=\eta^{-1}(H_t+\varepsilon(H^1_t+V_t))$, where $H_t$ is assumed to have a gapped ground state $\omega_t$, $\eta \in (0,1]$ is the adiabatic parameter and $ \varepsilon \in [0,1]$ controls the strength of the perturbation. We construct a quasi-local dressing transformation $\beta^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t=\exp(i \mathcal{L}_{S^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t})$ that yields super-adiabatic states $\omega^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t =\omega_t \circ \beta^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t$ which, when tested against local observables, solve the corresponding time-dependent Schrödinger equation up to errors asymptotically smaller than any power of $\eta$ and $\varepsilon$. The construction is local in space and time, does not assume uniqueness of the ground state, and works under super-polynomial decay of the interactions $H_t$ and $H_t^1$ rather than exponential decay. If the Hamiltonian is time-independent on an interval, the dressed state is $\eta$-independent and forms a non-equilibrium almost-stationary state with lifetime of order $\varepsilon^{-\infty}$. The result provides a rigorous basis for linear response to macroscopic changes in gapped systems, including a proof of Ohm's law for macroscopic Hall currents.

Title: Landau Polarons as Generators of Quantum-Coherent States
Authors: Arnab Ghosh, Patrick Brosseau, Dmitry N. Dirin, Rui Tao, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Patanjali Kambhampati
Abstract: Since Landau's theory, polarons have been understood as quasiparticles in which charges are dressed by the lattice field, yet decades of transport and spectroscopic studies have yielded only static indirect renormalizations. Whether such dressing can dynamically reorganize electronic spectra to generate new quantum-coherent states has remained unresolved. Here we use femtosecond coherent multidimensional spectroscopy on size and composition controlled perovskite quantum dots to track polaronic field-induced dynamics in real time, revealing their consequences. We observe a delayed condensation into a confined spectrum of coherent states on 50-150 fs timescales, with couplings between these states evolving dynamically on the same timescale. The splittings are robust, exhibit anomalous linear size dependence, exceed single-particle splittings and manifest at 300 K. A Raman-constrained spin-boson Hamiltonian captures both the anomalous scaling and dynamical onset, establishing polarons as generators of coherent manifolds that enable collective quantum phenomena including superradiance, superfluorescence and superabsorption.

Title: Characterizing Neon Thin Film Growth with an NbTiN Superconducting Resonator Array
Authors: Kyle Matkovic, Patrick Russell, Andrew Palmer, Eric Helgamo, Lukas Delventhal, Kun Zuo, Kundan Surse, Rajib Rahman, Maja C. Cassidy
Abstract: Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators. By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$ across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12 K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.

Title: Overlapped-repetition Shor codes achieving fourfold asymptotic rate
Authors: En-Jui Chang
Abstract: The standard Shor code employs two repetition codes as inner and outer codes, yielding a simple structure but a relatively low code rate. By overlapping a small number of repetition codes, we enhance the asymptotic code rate fourfold. In the minimal-distance case $d = 3$, this construction reduces the overhead from $[[9,1,3]]$ to the more efficient $[[7,1,3]]$ configuration.

Title: The spinterface mechanism for the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect: A Critical Perspective
Authors: Subhajit Sarkar, Amos Sharoni, Oliver L. A. Monti, Yonatan Dubi
Abstract: The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, whereby chiral molecules preferentially transmit electrons of one spin orientation, remains one of the most intriguing and debated phenomena at the interface of spintronics, molecular electronics, and quantum materials. Despite extensive experimental observations across diverse platforms - including transport junctions, photoemission, and enantioselective chemistry - a comprehensive theoretical framework is still lacking. In this perspective, we critically examine the spinterface mechanism as a unifying explanation for the CISS effect. The spinterface model, which hypothesizes a feedback interaction between electron motion in chiral molecules and fluctuating surface magnetic moments, is shown to quantitatively reproduce experimental data across various systems and conditions. We contrast it with some existing theoretical models, highlighting key experimental features. Importantly, we also address open questions and criticisms of this model, including the nature of surface magnetism, the role of dissipation, and the applicability of the mechanism to non-helical or electrode-free systems. By offering falsifiable predictions and reconciling theory with experimental raw data, this work aims to sharpen the dialogue surrounding the microscopic origin of CISS and stimulate further experimental and theoretical progress.

Title: Enhancement of femtosecond photon echo signals from an inhomogeneously broadened InAs quantum dot ensemble using chirped pulses
Authors: Yuta Kochi, Yutaro Kinoshita, Masanari Watanabe, Ryutaro Ide, Junko Ishi-Hayase
Abstract: Photon echo (PE) techniques offer a promising approach to optical quantum memory, yet their implementation in conventional platforms, such as rare-earth-ion-doped crystals, is hindered by limited bandwidths. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) ensembles, featuring THz-scale inhomogeneous broadening and sub-picosecond dynamics, provide an attractive alternative for ultrafast applications. However, achieving coherent control across such broad spectral ranges remains challenging due to detuning and spatial field inhomogeneities, which reduce PE efficiency. In this work, we experimentally demonstrated adiabatic rapid passage (ARP)-enhanced PE in dense, self-assembled InAs QD ensembles exhibiting THz-scale inhomogeneous broadening and operating at telecom wavelengths, achieving a 3.2-fold increase in echo efficiency. Chirped control pulses designed to satisfy adiabatic conditions across the ensemble enable broadband rephasing. Numerical simulations based on a two-level model reproduce the key experimental observations, including the ARP-induced enhancement, thereby validating the underlying physical picture. These results establish ARP as a robust and scalable approach for coherent control in InAs QD ensembles, with potential applications for ultrafast and broadband optical communication in the THz spectral region.

Title: Unveiling the BEC-droplet transition with Rayleigh superradiant scattering
Authors: Mithilesh K. Parit, Mingchen Huang, Ziting Chen, Yifei He, Haoting Zhen, Gyu-Boong Jo
Abstract: Light scattering plays an essential role in uncovering the properties of quantum states through light-matter interactions. Here, we explore the transition from Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to droplets in a dipolar $^{166}$Er gas by employing superradiant light scattering as both a probing and controlling tool. We observe that the efficiency of superradiant scattering exhibits a non-monotonic behavior akin to the rate of sample expansion during the transition, signaling its sensitivity to the initial quantum state, and in turn, revealing the BEC-droplet transition. Through controlled atom depletion via superradiance, we analyze the sample's expansion dynamics and aspect ratio to identify the BEC-droplet phases distinctly, supported by Gaussian variational ansatz calculations. Finally, using these two approaches, we track how the BEC-droplet transition points shift under varying magnetic field orientations. Our work opens new avenues for studying quantum states through superradiance, advancing our understanding of both the BEC-droplet crossover and its coherence properties.

Title: Fast adaptive discontinuous basis sets for electronic structure
Authors: Yulong Pan, Michael Lindsey
Abstract: We develop a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework for automatically constructing adaptive basis sets for electronic structure calculations. By allowing basis functions to be discontinuous across element interfaces, our approach supports flexible combinations of atom-centered and polynomial basis sets, maintains favorable numerical conditioning, and induces structured sparsity of the one- and two-electron integrals, which we compute using specialised numerical integration strategies. We also introduce multigrid-preconditioned Poisson solvers that enable fast algorithms for both Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations within our DG basis sets. Moreover, these basis sets naturally support adaptive multigrid preconditioning for the linear eigensolvers employed within the self-consistent field iteration for HF and DFT. Numerical experiments for HF and DFT demonstrate that our approach achieves chemical accuracy with modest basis sizes that compare favorably to the sizes of ordinary GTO basis sets achieving similar accuracy, while offering additional structured sparsity and improved computational scalability in the size-extensive limit. The framework thus provides a flexible route toward the construction of systematically improvable and structured adaptive basis sets for electronic structure theory.

Title: A complex Gaussian representation of continuum wavefunctions respectful of their asymptotic behaviour
Authors: Arnaud Leclerc, Stéphanie Laure Egome Nana, Lorenzo Ugo Ancarani
Abstract: Complex Gaussian basis sets are optimized to accurately represent continuum radial wavefunctions over the whole space. First, attention is put on the technical ability of the optimization method to get more flexible series of Gaussian exponents, in order to improve the accuracy of the fitting approach. Second, an indirect fitting method is proposed, allowing for the oscillatory behaviour of continuum functions to be conserved up to infinity as a factorized asymptotic function, while the Gaussian representation is applied to some appropriately defined distortion factor with limited spatial extension. As an illustration, the method is applied to radial Coulomb functions with realistic energy parameters. We also show that the indirect fitting approach keeps the advantageous analytical structure of typical one-electron transition integrals occurring in molecular ionization applications.

Title: SCORENF: Score-based Normalizing Flows for Sampling Unnormalized distributions
Authors: Vikas Kanaujia, Vipul Arora
Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation. In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF, a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF) architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module, enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic 2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Title: Suppressing excitations using quantum-Brachistochrone and nearest-neighbour interactions
Authors: S John Sharon Sandeep, Dibyajyoti Sahu, Suhas Gangadharaiah
Abstract: We examine excitation suppression in the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where finite-time drive across a quantum critical point is assisted by the presence of a time-dependent coupling parameter. While conventional counterdiabatic protocols are designed to eliminate excitations, they often require complex many-body terms that are difficult to realize experimentally. In contrast, our approach employs a local, time-dependent modulation of an existing coupling term in the Hamiltonian. Within the framework of quantum optimal control, we find that under a linear ramp of the transverse field, the optimal evolution of the second parameter follows a non-monotonic trajectory. For the TFIM, this protocol yields higher fidelity and improved robustness against noise compared to several orders of approximate counterdiabatic driving. Furthermore, we provide an analytical demonstration of anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the presence of noise acting on either the transverse field or the longitudinal coupling. These results highlight the potential of this approach for developing simple, noise-resilient protocols for finite-time quantum state preparation.

Title: Exciton and biexciton preparation via coherent swing-up excitation in a GaAs quantum dot embedded in micropillar cavity
Authors: Claudia Piccinini, Aleksander Rodek, Abdulmalik A. Madigawa, Ailton Garcia Jr., Saimon F. Covre da Silva, Vikas Remesh, Luca Vannucci, Gregor Weihs, Armando Rastelli, Niels Gregersen, Battulga Munkhbat
Abstract: Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter (SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant, red-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation. We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation conditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and two-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\sim$95 %) and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a shortened exciton decay time ($\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient exciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both excitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in a highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by a factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized exciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and biexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of biexciton preparation under SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a proposed four-level theoretical model including the biexciton. We also report that, strikingly, a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton state without altering the nominal excitation polarization. These findings establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and biexciton control, with strong potential for quantum photonic applications.

Title: SHAP Meets Tensor Networks: Provably Tractable Explanations with Parallelism
Authors: Reda Marzouk, Shahaf Bassan, Guy Katz
Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic* time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs, this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models. Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become *efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Title: RydIQule Version 2: Enhancing graph-based modeling of Rydberg atoms
Authors: Benjamin N. Miller, David H. Meyer, Carter A. Montag, Omar Nagib, Teemu Virtanen, Peter K. Elgee, Kevin C. Cox
Abstract: Rydberg atomic radio-frequency (rf) sensors are an emerging technology platform that relies on vaporous atoms, interrogated with laser beams and nearly ionized, to receive rf signals. Rydberg rf sensors have a number of interesting fundamental distinctions from traditional receiver technologies, such as those based on metallic antennas, since they are governed by the quantum physics of atom-light interactions. As Rydberg sensors quickly advance from laboratory experiments into fieldable devices, there is a need for a general software modeling tool that fully encompasses the internal physics of the sensor. The Rydberg Interactive Quantum Module (RydIQule) is a Python package designed to fill this need. The initial public release of RydIQule in late 2023 built the core functionality described above. Here we outline RydIQule's version 2 release which expands on its capabilities to more accurately model real-world atoms.

Title: Quantum Lower Bounds by Sample-to-Query Lifting
Authors: Qisheng Wang, Zhicheng Zhang
Abstract: The polynomial method by Beals, Buhrman, Cleve, Mosca, and de Wolf (FOCS 1998, J. ACM 2001), the adversary method by Ambainis (STOC 2000, J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 2002), and the compressed oracle method by Zhandry (CRYPTO 2019) have been shown to be powerful in proving quantum query lower bounds for a wide variety of problems. In this paper, we propose a new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results: 1. A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination. Here, the sample complexity is measured given sample access to the quantum state to be tested, while the query complexity is measured given query access to an oracle that block-encodes the quantum state. 2. A matching lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\beta)$ for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature $\beta$, showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by Gilyén, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019) is optimal. 3. A new lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for the entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, which was recently studied by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023). 4. A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015, Comm. Math. Phys. 2021). In addition, we also provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.

Title: Comparing quantum and classical Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating Betti numbers of clique complexes
Authors: Ismail Yunus Akhalwaya, Ahmed Bhayat, Adam Connolly, Steven Herbert, Lior Horesh, Julien Sorci, Shashanka Ubaru
Abstract: Several quantum and classical Monte Carlo algorithms for Betti Number Estimation (BNE) on clique complexes have recently been proposed, though it is unclear how their performances compare. We review these algorithms, emphasising their common Monte Carlo structure within a new modular framework. We derive upper bounds for the number of samples needed to reach a given level of precision, and use them to compare these algorithms. By recombining the different modules, we create a new quantum algorithm with an exponentially-improved dependence in the sample complexity. We run classical simulations to verify convergence within the theoretical bounds and observe the predicted exponential separation, even though empirical convergence occurs substantially earlier than the conservative theoretical bounds.

Title: Closing the detection loophole in the triangle network with high-dimensional photonic states
Authors: Tamás Kriváchy, Martin Kerschbaumer
Abstract: Bell nonlocality without input settings, e.g. in the triangle network, has been perceived to be particularly fragile, with low robustness to noise in physical implementations. Here we show to the contrary that nonlocality based on N00N states already for $N=2$ has an exceptionally high robustness to photon loss. For the dominant noise factor, single photon loss in the transmission channels, we can certify noise robustness up to $10\%$ loss, while for a realistic noise model we use neural network-based heuristics to observe $\sim 50\%$ robustness. Moreover we show that the robustness holds even for imperfect sources based on SPDC sources, where the heralding information of the sources can be used to avoid any global post-processing of the outcomes, such as discarding rounds when photons fail to arrive, and thus demonstrate how the detection loophole in the triangle network can be closed.

Title: Hong-Ou-Mandel effect with two frequency-entangled photons of vastly different color
Authors: Felix Mann, Helen M. Chrzanowski, Marlon Placke, Felipe Gewers, Sven Ramelow
Abstract: In the original formulation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment, when two otherwise indistinguishable photons are incident upon the two input ports of a balanced beam splitter, they coalesce, always leaving via the same output port. It is often interpreted that this interference arises due to the indistinguishability of the single photons at the beam splitter; the situation, however, is often more nuanced. Here, we demonstrate an analog of HOM interference between two photons of completely different color. To do so, we utilize a quantum frequency converter based on sum- and difference-frequency generation as an `active' beam splitter -- coupling frequency-entangled red and telecom single photons with an octave-spanning energy difference of 282 THz. We achieve an uncorrected two-photon interference visibility beyond 90%. This work presents the first demonstration of HOM interference between two single photons of distinctly different color, deepening our understanding of what underlies quantum interference. It also suggests a novel approach to interfacing photonic qubits in heterogeneous quantum systems where frequency conversion and quantum interference are unified.

Title: Field emission tunnelling as a window onto fundamental issues in quantum mechanics
Authors: Richard G. Forbes
Abstract: Field electron emission (FE) and electrostatic field ionization (ESFI) are quantum-mechanical tunnelling processes that provide basic theory for important technologies. However, the basic theories of FE and ESF1 are not yet completely understood. This paper attempts to identify related fundamental quantum mechanical issues, problems and relevances. The following topics have been identified as deserving closer investigation or discussion. (a) The implication that if a "real electron" cannot have negative kinetic energy, then this necessarily implies that a "real electron" is a distributed object rather than a point object. (b) The implication that the language we use to discuss quantum mechanics needs to be changed in order to avoid referring to the "position of a (point) electron". (c) The idea that "quantum mathematics" (i.e., the mathematics of quantum mechanics) has different utilisations, namely the "matter distribution" and "pathway choice" utilisations, with "measurement" being observed pathway choice. (d) Difficulties with the present formulations of the uncertainty principle and wave-particle duality. (e) Fundamental difficulties in the exact calculation of exchange-and-correlation effects in both FE and ESFI theory. (f) Conceptual problems associated with "seeing electrons" in the field electron (emission) microscope. (g) Field emission tunnelling and the arrow of time. (h) The choice between tunnelling-integral and overlap-integral formulations of tunnelling theory, and the apparent incompleteness of both types of formulation.

Title: Detecting $k$-nonseparability and $k$-partite Entanglement with Generalized Skew Information and Mutually Unbiased Measurements
Authors: Xiaofei Qi, Yuyang Pang, Jinchuan Hou
Abstract: Multipartite quantum entanglement, as a core quantum resource, is fundamental to the advancement of quantum science and technology. In multipartite quantum systems, there are two kinds of quantum entanglement: $k$-nonseparability and $k$-partite entanglement. In this paper, we propose sufficient criteria for detecting $k$-nonseparability and $k$-partite entanglement by using the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information and mutually unbiased measurements. Examples are given to demonstrate the detection capability and advantages of these criteria. As an application, an example of recognizing the networks by detecting the depth of quantum networks is given.

Title: Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation
Authors: Zhongda Zeng, Giuliano Giudici, Aruku Senoo, Alexander Baumgärtner, Adam M. Kaufman, Hannes Pichler
Abstract: Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.

Title: Anatomy of Non-Hermitian Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Yongxu Fu, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: We establish a unified framework for dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in non-Hermitian systems that encompasses both biorthogonal and self-norm non-biorthogonal formulations for pure and mixed states under quantum quench protocols. Our framework provides explicit expressions for the Loschmidt amplitude, Loschmidt echo, and rate function, revealing a universal geometric signature of DQPTs in the two-band model: orthogonality of two related vectors in two-dimensional real space. Strikingly, we demonstrate that non-biorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry exhibit emergent topological characteristics of DQPTs, unveiling their fundamental features beyond conventional Hermitian regimes. This work establishes fundamental geometric and topological principles governing quantum criticality in open systems, with implications for quantum sensing and many-body physics in dissipative environments.

Authors: Mrinal Kanti Giri, Pochung Chen
Abstract: Flat-band systems offer a uniquely powerful tool for quantum control in dynamics due to their characteristic feature of having a dispersionless energy band. Simulating such highly sensitive systems on current digital quantum computers is a challenging task, due to the intrinsic limitations of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Here we present high-fidelity digital quantum simulations of flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (ABF) lattices, using an advanced tensor-network-based circuit compression method. With the compressed quantum circuits, we first explore single-particle dynamics and observe two distinct behaviours: strong localization in ABF lattices and delocalization in FB lattices. By integrating FB and ABF lattices into a one-dimensional hybrid structure, we achieve controllable quantum transport, where the ABF lattice acts as a quantum switch. Extending to two-particle dynamics, we show that transport remains controllable by tuning the hopping amplitude alone, even in the presence of interactions. These results establish flat-band engineered systems as a promising pathway for scalable control of quantum transport in emerging quantum technologies, with potential applications in qubit isolation, particle trapping, and state transfer.

Title: Scattering and induced false vacuum decay in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model
Authors: Luka Pavešić, Marco Di Liberto, Simone Montangero
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.

Title: Entanglement and Classical Simulability in Quantum Extreme Learning Machines
Authors: A. De Lorenzis, M. P. Casado, N. Lo Gullo, T. Lux, F. Plastina, A. Riera
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a promising framework to exploit quantum mechanics for computational advantage. Here we investigate Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELMs), a quantum analogue of classical Extreme Learning Machines in which training is restricted to the output layer. Our architecture combines dimensionality reduction (via PCA or Autoencoders), quantum state encoding, evolution under an XX Hamiltonian, and projective measurement to produce features for a classical single-layer classifier. By analyzing the classification accuracy as a function of evolution time, we identify a sharp transition between low- and high-accuracy regimes, followed by saturation. Remarkably, the saturation value coincides with that obtained using random unitaries that generate maximally complex dynamics, even though the XX model is integrable and local. We show that this performance enhancement correlates with the onset of entanglement, which improves the embedding of classical data in Hilbert space and leads to more separable clusters in measurement probability space. Thus, entanglement contributes positively to the structure of the data embedding, improving learnability without necessarily implying computational advantage. For the image classification tasks studied in this work (namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10) the required evolution time corresponds to information exchange among nearest neighbors and is independent of the system size. This implies that QELMs rely on limited entanglement and remain classically simulable for a broad class of learning problems. Our results clarify how moderate quantum correlations bridge the gap between quantum dynamics and classical feature learning.

Title: Decoding Multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Codes with Noisy Auxiliary States
Authors: Marc-Antoine Roy, Thomas Pousset, Baptiste Royer
Abstract: In order to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing, we make use of quantum error correction schemes designed to protect the logical information of the system from decoherence. A promising way to preserve such information is to use the multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding, which encodes logical qubits into several harmonic oscillators. In this work, we focus on decoding the measurements obtained from Steane-type quantum error correction protocols for multimode GKP codes. We propose a decoder that considers the noise present on the auxiliary states, more specifically by tracking the correlations between errors on different modes spreading throughout the error-correction circuit. We show that leveraging the correlations between measurement results and the actual error affecting the multimode GKP state can decrease the logical error probability by at least an order of magnitude, yielding more robust quantum computation.

Title: Homodyne Measurement of a Non-Hermitian Qubit Undergoing Fluorescence
Authors: Roson Nongthombam, Amarendra K. Sarma
Abstract: Implementation of a two-level non-Hermitian qubit via post-selection of a three-level system has been demonstrated. The post-selection procedure, which discards quantum jump to the ground-state manifold while retaining excitations in the first and second excited-state manifolds, effectively generates a non-Hermitian qubit exhibiting PT symmetry. In this work, we perform continuous homodyne measurement of this non-Hermitian qubit and analyze the interplay between decay introduced by post-selection and measurement backaction. We compare the ensemble-averaged dynamics obtained from measurement trajectories with the the Liouvillian average. We formulate the no-jump stochastic differential equation describing the post-selected non-Hermitian qubit and show that its ensemble-averaged dynamics agree with those of the jump-updated post-selected evolution at drive strengths far from the Liouvillian exceptional point (EP). The degree of deviation near the EP depends sensitively on the nature of the drive. This discrepancy is attributed to the interplay between measurement backaction and the non-Hermitian decay introduced by post-selection. Furthermore, we determine the optimal path of the non-Hermitian qubit by extremizing the action within the path-integral formulation of the quantum trajectory framework Our results provide insights into how measurement backaction and non-Hermitian dynamics together shape the transient behavior of open quantum systems and enable controlled manipulation of qubits near exceptional points.

Title: Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating Multicomponent Superfluids
Authors: Roy Rabaglia, Ryan Barnett, Ari M. Turner
Abstract: By examining rotating ferromagnetic spinor condensates through the perspective of large spin, we identify a novel type of topological point defects in the magnetization texture. These defects are not predicted by conventional homotopy analysis but rather by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The magnetization texture in the system is described by an equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice contains doubly-quantized (winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral configuration. The fluid found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point defects, where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure describes an unconventional "unvortex" lattice, which contrasts with the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity is concentrated exclusively within defect points. Numerical results are presented, confirming these predictions and demonstrating their persistence in smaller-spin condensates.

Title: Quantum Complexity Fluctuations from Nuclear and Hypernuclear Forces
Authors: Caroline E. P. Robin, Martin J. Savage
Abstract: Toward an improved understanding of the role of quantum information in nuclei and exotic matter, we examine the quantum magic (non-stabilizerness) in low-energy strong interaction processes. As stabilizer states can be prepared efficiently using classical computers, and include classes of entangled states, it is quantum magic and fluctuations in quantum magic, together with entanglement, that determine computational resource requirements. As a measure of fluctuations in quantum magic, and hence the severity of the exponentially-scaling classical computing resource requirements, induced by scattering, the "magic power" of the S-matrix is introduced. This provides indirect experimental constraints on quantum resources required to model nuclei and dense matter using fault-tolerant quantum computers. Using experimentally-determined scattering phase shifts and mixing parameters, the magic power in nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon scattering, along with the magic in the deuteron, are found to exhibit interesting and distinct features. The $\Sigma^-$-baryon is identified as a potential candidate catalyst for enhanced spreading of magic and entanglement in dense matter, depending on in-medium decoherence.

Title: Determining Absolute Neutrino Mass using Quantum Technologies

Abstract: Next generation tritium decay experiments to determine the absolute neutrino mass require high-precision measurements of $\beta$-decay electron energies close to the kinematic end point. To achieve this, the development of high phase-space density sources of atomic tritium is required, along with the implementation of methods to control the motion of these atoms to allow extended observation times. A promising approach to efficiently and accurately measure the kinetic energies of individual $\beta$-decay electrons generated in these dilute atomic gases, is to determine the frequency of the cyclotron radiation they emit in a precisely characterised magnetic field. This cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy technique can benefit from recent developments in quantum technologies. Absolute static-field magnetometry and electrometry, which is essential for the precise determination of the electron kinetic energies from the frequency of their emitted cyclotron radiation, can be performed using atoms in superpositions of circular Rydberg states. Quantum-limited microwave amplifiers will allow precise cyclotron frequency measurements to be made with maximal signal-to-noise ratios and minimal observation times. Exploiting the opportunities offered by quantum technologies in these key areas, represents the core activity of the Quantum Technologies for Neutrino Mass project. Its goal is to develop a new experimental apparatus that can enable a determination of the absolute neutrino mass with a sensitivity on the order of 10~meV/$c^2$.

Title: A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation
Authors: Paul-Louis Etienney, Rémi Robin, Pierre Rouchon
Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution. In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitly computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach can significantly reduce computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.

Title: Quantum group deformation of the Kittel--Shore model
Authors: A. Ballesteros, I. Gutiérrez-Sagredo, V. Mariscal, J.J. Relancio
Abstract: The Kittel--Shore (KS) Hamiltonian describes $N$ spins with long-range interactions that are identically coupled; therefore, this (mean-field) model is also known as the Heisenberg XXX model on the complete graph. In this paper, the underlying $U(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ coalgebra symmetry of the KS model is demonstrated for arbitrary spins, and the quantum deformation of the KS Hamiltonian ($q$-KS model) is obtained using the corresponding $U_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ quantum group. By construction, the existence of such a symmetry guarantees that all integrability properties of the KS model are preserved under $q$-deformation. In particular, the $q$-KS model for spin-$1/2$ particles is analysed, the cases with $N=2$ and $3$ spins are studied in detail, and higher-spin $q$-KS models are sketched. As a first excursion into the thermodynamic properties of the spin-$1/2$ $q$-KS model, the dependence of the Curie temperature on the deformation parameter is studied through numerical analysis.

Title: Multimode NOON-state generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic counterdiabatic driving
Authors: Simon Dengis, Sandro Wimberger, Peter Schlagheck
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.

Title: From Confinement to Chaos in AdS/CFT Correspondence via Non-equilibrium Local States
Authors: Dmitry S. Ageev, Vladimir A. Bykov
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to local operator quenches in a free bulk scalar theory. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual CFT states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff (hard-wall), creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators, the spacing-ratio statistics of peaks in temporal dynamics are closest to those of the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE). Finally, we extend the analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and to its hard-wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar trends.

Title: Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer
Authors: Krishnakanta Barik, Goutam Paul
Abstract: The \textit{Temporal Fusion Transformer} (TFT), proposed by Lim \textit{et al.}, published in \textit{International Journal of Forecasting} (2021), is a state-of-the-art attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical TFT framework. The core idea of this work is inspired by the foundation studies, \textit{The Power of Quantum Neural Networks} by Amira Abbas \textit{et al.} and \textit{Quantum Vision Transformers} by El Amine Cherrat \textit{et al.}, published in \textit{ Nature Computational Science} (2021) and \textit{Quantum} (2024), respectively. A key advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit depth. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In particular, our experimental results on two different datasets display that the model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test loss. These results indicate the prospect of using quantum computing to boost deep learning architectures in complex machine learning tasks.

Title: Driven inhomogeneous CFT as a theory in curved space-time
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger, Jani Kastikainen, Tim Schuhmann
Abstract: For two-dimensional conformal field theories driven by evolving background space-time metrics in a closed universe, we present an operator formulation as a driven inhomogeneous CFT. The Hamiltonian of this theory is given by a background space-time dependent smearing of the stress tensor over the spatial slice. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of the curved-space Weyl anomaly, which we show is realized by the difference between Schrödinger and Heisenberg picture Hamiltonians once an appropriate renormalization scheme, the chirally split scheme, is chosen. As a result, the unitary evolution generated by the background metric coincides with that of a Virasoro quantum circuit. To showcase our formalism, we consider the stress tensor one-point function and the entanglement entropy of an interval in both operator and curved-space formulations. We find that these curved-space observables admit a state interpretation only in the chirally split scheme. Finally, we derive the holographic dual of the driven CFT in three-dimensional gravity, extending previous works to arbitrary driving. The holographic dictionary reproduces the stress tensor one-point function and the entanglement entropy in a diffeomorphism invariant scheme.

Title: Breaking of scale invariance in a strongly dipolar 2D Bose gas
Authors: Haoting Zhen, Yifei He, Sampriti Saha, Mithilesh K. Parit, Mingchen Huang, Nicolò Defenu, Gyu-Boong Jo
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70°, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.

Title: Ab Initio Free Energy Surfaces for Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer
Authors: Ethan Abraham, Martin Z. Bazant, Troy Van Voorhis
Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as electrochemical interfaces or biomolecular structures, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.
