Title: Quantum reservoir computing maps data onto the Krylov space
Authors: Saud Čindrak, Kathy Lüdge, Lina Jaurigue
Abstract: We demonstrate that time-evolved operators can construct a Krylov space to compute Operator complexity and introduce Krylov observability as a measure of phase space dimension in quantum systems. We test Krylov observability in the framework of quantum reservoir computing and show that it closely mirrors information processing capacity, a data-driven expressivity metric, while achieving computation times that are orders of magnitude faster. Our results validate Operator complexity and give the interpretation that data in a quantum reservoir is mapped onto the Krylov space.

Title: Increasing the distance of topological codes with time vortex defects
Authors: Gilad Kishony, Erez Berg
Abstract: We propose modifying topological quantum error correcting codes by incorporating space-time defects, termed ``time vortices,'' to reduce the number of physical qubits required to achieve a desired logical error rate. A time vortex is inserted by adding a spatially varying delay to the periodic measurement sequence defining the code such that the delay accumulated on a homologically non-trivial cycle is an integer multiple of the period. We analyze this construction within the framework of the Floquet color code and optimize the embedding of the code on a torus along with the choice of the number of time vortices inserted in each direction. Asymptotically, the vortexed code requires less than half the number of qubits as the vortex-free code to reach a given code distance. We benchmark the performance of the vortexed Floquet color code by Monte Carlo simulations with a circuit-level noise model and demonstrate that the smallest vortexed code (with $30$ qubits) outperforms the vortex-free code with $42$ qubits.

Title: Observable and computable entanglement in time
Authors: Alexey Milekhin, Zofia Adamska, John Preskill
Abstract: We propose a novel family of entanglement measures for time-separated subsystems. Our definitions are applicable to any quantum system, continuous or discrete. To illustrate their utility, we derive upper and lower bounds on time-separated correlation functions, akin to the bound on spatially separated correlators in terms of the mutual information. In certain cases our bounds are tight. For relativistic quantum field theories our definition agrees with the analytic continuation from spacelike to timelike separated regions. We provide relevant measurement protocols and execute them on the IBM quantum device ibm_sherbrooke for a simple qubit system. Also we perform explicit computations for an Ising spin chain, free fermions, (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories and holographic theories. Finally we explain how the proposed entanglement in time provides a microscopic definition for the recently introduced timelike pseudoentropy.

Title: Certification of quantum correlations and DIQKD at arbitrary distances through routed Bell tests
Authors: Pavel Sekatski, Jef Pauwels, Edwin Peter Lobo, Stefano Pironio, Nicolas Brunner
Abstract: Transmission loss represents a major obstacle for the demonstration of quantum Bell nonlocality over long distances and applications that rely on it, such as Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution. In this work, we investigate the recently proposed concept of routed Bell experiments, in which one party can perform measurements either near or far from the source. We prove that routed Bell tests can certify quantum correlations for arbitrary loss on the channel to the distant device, using only entangled qubits. This is achieved by applying the concepts of self-testing and quantum steering to routed Bell tests. Finally, we present a DIQKD protocol for the routed Bell scenario that can operate over arbitrary distances.

Abstract: We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.

Title: Extracting the topological spins from bulk multipartite entanglement
Authors: Yarden Sheffer, Ady Stern, Erez Berg
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying a 2+1d topologically ordered phase using measurements on the ground-state wavefunction. For non-chiral topological order, we describe a series of bulk multipartite entanglement measures that extract the invariants $\sum_a d_a^2 \theta_a^r$ for any $r \geq 2$, where $d_a$ and $\theta_a$ are the quantum dimension and topological spin of an anyon $a$, respectively. These invariants are obtained as expectation values of permutation operators between $2r$ replicas of the wavefunction, applying different permutations on four distinct regions of the plane. Our proposed measures provide a refined tool for distinguishing topological phases, capturing information beyond conventional entanglement measures such as the topological entanglement entropy. We argue that any operator capable of extracting the above invariants must act on at least $2r$ replicas, making our procedure optimal in terms of the required number of replicas. We discuss the generalization of our results to chiral states.

Title: Energy spectrum of the long-range Lennard-Jones potential
Authors: Shahar Hod
Abstract: The discrete energy spectra of composite inverse power-law binding potentials of the form $V(r;\alpha,\beta,n)=-\alpha/r^2+\beta/r^n$ with $n>2$ are studied {\it analytically}. In particular, using a functional matching procedure for the eigenfunctions of the radial Schrödinger equation, we derive a remarkably compact analytical formula for the discrete spectra of binding energies $\{E(\alpha,\beta,n;k)\}^{k=\infty}_{k=1}$ which characterize the highly-excited bound-state resonances of these long-range binding potentials. Our results are of practical importance for the physics of polarized molecules, the physics of composite polymers, and also for physical models describing the quantum interactions of bosonic particles.

Title: Entanglement theory with limited computational resources
Authors: Lorenzo Leone, Jacopo Rizzo, Jens Eisert, Sofiene Jerbi
Abstract: The precise quantification of the ultimate efficiency in manipulating quantum resources lies at the core of quantum information theory. However, purely information-theoretic measures fail to capture the actual computational complexity involved in performing certain tasks. In this work, we rigorously address this issue within the realm of entanglement theory, a cornerstone of quantum information science. We consider two key figures of merit: the computational distillable entanglement and the computational entanglement cost, quantifying the optimal rate of entangled bits (ebits) that can be extracted from or used to dilute many identical copies of $n$-qubit bipartite pure states, using computationally efficient local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We demonstrate that computational entanglement measures diverge significantly from their information-theoretic counterparts. While the von Neumann entropy captures information-theoretic rates for pure-state transformations, we show that under computational constraints, the min-entropy instead governs optimal entanglement distillation. Meanwhile, efficient entanglement dilution incurs in a major cost, requiring maximal $(\tilde{\Omega}(n))$ ebits even for nearly unentangled states. Surprisingly, in the worst-case scenario, even if an efficient description of the state exists and is fully known, one gains no advantage over state-agnostic protocols. Our results establish a stark, maximal separation of $\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ vs. $o(1)$ between computational and information-theoretic entanglement measures. Finally, our findings yield new sample-complexity bounds for measuring and testing the von Neumann entropy, fundamental limits on efficient state compression, and efficient LOCC tomography protocols.

Title: Temporal Coarse Graining for Classical Stochastic Noise in Quantum Systems
Authors: Tameem Albash, Steve Young, N. Tobias Jacobson
Abstract: Simulations of quantum systems with Hamiltonian classical stochastic noise can be challenging when the noise exhibits temporal correlations over a multitude of time scales, such as for $1/f$ noise in solid-state quantum information processors. Here we present an approach for simulating Hamiltonian classical stochastic noise that performs temporal coarse-graining by effectively integrating out the high-frequency components of the noise. We focus on the case where the stochastic noise can be expressed as a sum of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Temporal coarse-graining is then achieved by conditioning the stochastic process on a coarse realization of the noise, expressing the conditioned stochastic process in terms of a sum of smooth, deterministic functions and bridge processes with boundaries fixed at zero, and performing the ensemble average over the bridge processes. For Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, the deterministic components capture all dependence on the coarse realization, and the stochastic bridge processes are not only independent but taken from the same distribution with correlators that can be expressed analytically, allowing the associated noise propagators to be precomputed once for all simulations. This combination of noise trajectories on a coarse time grid and ensemble averaging over bridge processes has practical advantages, such as a simple concatenation rule, that we highlight with numerical examples.

Title: Stochastic Schrödinger equation for homodyne measurements of strongly correlated systems
Authors: Aniket Patra, Felix Motzoi, Klaus Mølmer
Abstract: We derive a stochastic Schrödinger equation that describes the homodyne measurement record of a strongly interacting atomic system. We derive this equation for a general system, where we use the rotating wave approximation in the linear atom-light interaction part, and the resulting equation is expressed in terms of the atomic operators only. Weak measurements are theoretically described in terms of positive operator-valued measures. Among different weak measurement schemes, several earlier references studied the Gaussian quantum continuous measurement in detail. Here we consider a homodyne measurement setup. We then demonstrate that the derived equation for this setup in the appropriate limit is the same as the one obtained while performing a Gaussian quantum continuous measurement.

Title: Controlling complex dynamics with synthetic magnetism in optomechanical systems: A route to enhanced sensor performance
Authors: Deivasundari Muthukumar, Stella Rolande Mbokop Tchounda, Sifeu Takougang Kingni, Karthikeyan Rajagopal, Serge Guy Nana Engo
Abstract: This paper explores the intricate dynamical behavior of an optomechanical system consisting of an optical resonator that drives two mechanically coupled resonators via phase-dependent phonon hopping. Addressing previous limitations in comprehending the dynamics of such systems, we derive the system's semiclassical dynamical equations from the optomechanical Hamiltonian, resulting in a set of six first-order ordinary differential equations. We subsequently illustrate the emergence of novel dynamic behaviors and demonstrate their pertinence for the development of new devices. The system exhibits either two or no steady states, contingent upon the incident radiation, mechanical coupling rate, and frequency detuning. Our stability analysis indicates that the stability of these states is determined by the same factors. We identify complex dynamical behaviors, including monostable and bistable self-excited quasi-periodic characteristics, the coexistence of hidden oscillations, and chaotic dynamics, and we propose a method for their control. These findings bear significant implications for applications in ultra-sensitive sensing, chaos-based communication, and tunable phononic circuits. This study enhances the broader understanding of complex dynamical systems in optomechanics, paving the way for the development of advanced optomechanical devices with controlled dynamics for stable and reliable operation.

Title: Wavefront shaping enhanced nano-optomechanics down to the quantum precision limit
Authors: Alexandros G. Tavernarakis, Rodrigo Gutiérrez-Cuevas, Loïc Rondin, Thomas Antoni, Sébastien M. Popoff, Pierre Verlot
Abstract: We introduce wavefront shaping as a tool for optimizing the sensitivity in nano-optomechanical measurement schemes. We perform multimode output analysis of an optomechanical system consisting of a focused laser beam coupled to the transverse motion of a tapered cantilever, and demonstrate that wavefront shaping enables a 350-fold enhancement of the measurement signal-to-noise (+25.5 dB) compared to standard split-detection, close to the quantum precision limit. Our results open new perspectives in terms of sensitivity and control of the optomechanical interaction.

Title: A Compact One-Way Fault-Tolerant Optical Quantum Computation
Authors: Peilin Du, Jing Zhang, Rongguo Yang
Abstract: One-way quantum computation is a promising approach to achieving universal, scalable, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, a main challenge lies in the creation of universal, scalable three-dimensional cluster states. Here, an experimental scheme is proposed for building large-scale canonical three-dimensional cubic cluster states, which are compatible with the majority of qubit error-correcting codes, using the spatiospectral modes of an optical parametric oscillator. Combining with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, one-way fault-tolerant optical quantum computation can be achieved with a lower fault-tolerant squeezing threshold. Our scheme drastically simplify experimental configurations, paving the way for compact realizations of one-way fault-tolerant optical quantum computation.

Title: Impurity-induced non-unitary criticality
Authors: Heng-Hsi Li, Kuang-Hung Chou, Xueda Wen, Po-Yao Chang
Abstract: Quantum impurities give rise to rich physical phenomena, with some exhibiting critical behavior described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the low-energy limit. In parallel, party-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric non-Hermitian systems host exceptional points (EPs) at criticality, leading to exotic features governed by non-unitary CFTs. Here, we establish a connection between non-Hermitian impurities and CFTs by demonstrating that the critical properties of a (1+1)-dimensional free-fermion chain with central charge $c=1$ can be drastically altered by the presence of a local non-Hermitian impurity. Through a systematic analysis of entanglement/Rényi entropy, the finite-size scaling of the many-body spectrum, and fidelity susceptibility, we identify that this impurity-induced non-Hermitian criticality is characterized by a non-unitary CFT with central charge $c=-2$. Furthermore, we find that these non-unitary critical properties exhibit strong sensitivity to boundary conditions.

Title: Parameter scanning in a quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) experiment with electromagnetic screening
Authors: Martine Schut, Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: Witnessing the quantum nature of spacetime is an exceptionally challenging task. However, the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of matter (QGEM) protocol proposes such a test by testing entanglement between adjacent matter-wave interferometers. One key obstacle to experimentally realising this protocol is the creation of a spatial quantum superposition with heavy masses. Initially, it was envisaged that the superposition size would have to be of order 200 micron for a mass $10^{-14}$ kg (to obtain the entanglement phase of order unity when the centre of mass of the two interferometers are at a separation of 450 microns). The experimental design has since improved, e.g. by assuming that the two interferometers are separated by an electromagnetic screen, which helps bring the separation distance close to 35 micron. Here, we do parameter scans taking into account the electromagnetic screening, and we consider different geometrical setups; we show superpositions of at least a micron-size for mass $10^{-14}$ kg with a decoherence rate of order $10^{-3}$ Hz are required.

Title: Low-loss polarization-maintaining router for single and entangled photons at a telecom wavelength
Authors: Pengfei Wang, Soyoung Baek, Masahiro Yabuno, Shigehito Miki, Hirotaka Terai, Fumihiro Kaneda
Abstract: Photon polarization serves as an essential quantum information carrier in quantum information and measurement applications. Routing of arbitrarily polarized single photons and polarization-entangled photons is a crucial technology for scaling up quantum information applications. Here, we demonstrate a low-loss, noiseless, polarization-maintaining routing of single and entangled photons at the telecom L-band. Our interferometer-based router is constructed by optics with a low angle of incidence and cross-aligned electro-optic crystals, achieving the polarization-maintaining operation without additional polarization-compensation optics. We demonstrate the routing of arbitrary-polarized heralded single photons with a 1.3% loss, a $>$ 22 dB switching extinction ratio, and $>$ 99% polarization process fidelity to ideal identity operation. Moreover, the high-quality router achieves the routing of two-photon N00N-type entangled states with a highly maintained interference visibility of $\sim$ 97%. The demonstrated router scheme paves the way toward polarization-encoded photonic quantum network as well as multi-photon entanglement synthesis via spatial- and time-multiplexing techniques.

Title: NRQNN: The Role of Observable Selection in Noise-Resilient Quantum Neural Networks
Authors: Muhammad Kashif, Muhammad Kashif
Abstract: This paper explores the complexities associated with training Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) under noisy conditions, a critical consideration for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We first demonstrate that Barren Plateaus (BPs), characterized by exponetially vanishing gradients, emerge more readily in noisy quantum environments than in ideal conditions. We then propose that careful selection of qubit measurement observable can make QNNs resilient against noise. To this end, we explore the effectiveness of various qubit measurement observables, including PauliX, PauliY, PauliZ, and a custom designed Hermitian observable, against three types of quantum noise: Phase Damping, Phase Flip, and Amplitude Damping. Our findings reveal that QNNs employing Pauli observables are prone to an earlier emergence of BPs, notably in noisy environments, even with a smaller qubit count of four qubits. Conversely, the custom designed Hermitian measurement observable exhibits significant resilience against all types of quantum noise, facilitating consistent trainability for QNNs up to 10 qubits. This study highlights the crucial role of observable selection and quantum noise consideration in enhancing QNN training, offering a strategic approach to improve QNN performance in NISQ era.

Title: Matrix Product States as Observations of Entangled Hidden Markov Models
Authors: Abdessatar Souissi
Abstract: This paper reveals the intrinsic structure of Matrix Product States (MPS) by establishing their deep connection to entangled hidden Markov models (EHMMs). It is demonstrated that a significant class of MPS can be derived as the outcomes of EHMMs, showcasing their underlying quantum correlations. Additionally, a lower bound is derived for the relative entropy between the EHMM-observation process and the corresponding MPS, providing a quantitative measure of their informational divergence. Conversely, it is shown that every MPS is naturally associated with an EHMM, further highlighting the interplay between these frameworks. These results are supported by illustrative examples from quantum information, emphasizing their importance in understanding entanglement, quantum correlations, and tensor network representations.

Title: Fully passive quantum key distribution with parametric down-conversion source
Authors: Jia-Wei Ying, Qi Zhang, Shi-Pu Gu, Xing-Fu Wang, Lan Zhou, Yu-Bo Sheng
Abstract: The fully passive source is capable of passively generating decoy states and performing passive encoding simultaneously, avoiding the side-channel risks caused by active modulation operations at the source end, thus effectively enhance the security in quantum key distribution (QKD). Existing fully passive QKD protocol and experiments exploit phase-randomized coherent pulses. In this paper, we propose a fully passive QKD protocol using parametric down-conversion source. The decoy state generation and encoding operation can be carried out passively by parameter down-conversion progress. This protocol has several advantages. First, it can also eliminate all side channels in active modulators. Second, compared with fully passive QKD protocol with phase-randomized coherent pulses, our protocol can significantly increase the key rate and extend the communication distance. Meanwhile, in terms of the transmission rate, our protocol is also closer to that of actively modulated QKD and can achieve fully passive modulation with fewer resources. Moreover, combined with measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD, this protocol can even potentially achieve robustness against side channels in both detectors and modulators.

Title: Fully passive quantum secure direct communication
Authors: Jia-Wei Ying, Qi Zhang, Shi-Pu Gu, Xing-Fu Wang, Lan Zhou, Yu-Bo Sheng
Abstract: In practical quantum communication, imperfect devices may introduce side channels, creating opportunities for eavesdroppers. Especially on the source side, the side channels created by active modulation are vulnerable to trojan horse attacks. Utilizing passive sources presents an effective solution to this issue. This paper proposes a fully passive quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocol. By passively modulating both the quantum state and the intensity of the decoy state, we can effectively eliminate the side-channel risks associated with the source modulators, thereby enhancing the security of practical QSDC. We optimize the intensities of the fully passive QSDC protocol to identify the optimal pulse performance of different post-selection intervals under various channel attenuation conditions. The numerical simulation results indicate that the secrecy message capacity of fully passive QSDC can reach $1.34 * 10^{-3} $ ($3.10 * 10^{-4} $) bit/pulse at 5 (10) km, approximately $78.0\%$ ($75.7\%$) of that of actively modulated QSDC. In additional, we consider the resource consumption and detection efficiency, optimizing the size of the post-selection intervals to obtain the optimal secrecy message transmission rate corresponding to each channel attenuation. Its maximum communication range is about 17.75 km. At communication distances of 5 (10) km, the maximum secrecy message transmission rate of a source with a pulse frequency of $10^{6}$ Hz is 10.268 (1.351) bit/sec. Our work significantly contributes to enhancing the security of practical QSDC systems.

Title: Scalable Structure For Chiral Quantum Routing
Authors: Giovanni Ragazzi, Simone Cavazzoni, Claudia Benedetti, Paolo Bordone, Matteo G. A. Paris
Abstract: We address the problem of routing quantum and classical information from one sender to many possible receivers in a network. By employing the formalism of quantum walks, we describe the dynamics on a discrete structure based on a complete graph, where the sites naturally provide a basis for encoding the quantum state to be transmitted. Upon tuning a single phase or weight in the Hamiltonian, we achieve near-unitary routing fidelity, enabling the selective delivery of information to designated receivers for both classical and quantum data. The structure is inherently scalable, accommodating an arbitrary number of receivers. The routing time is largely independent of the network dimension and input state, and the routing performance is robust under static and dynamic noise, at least for short time.

Title: Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems with Initial System-Environment Correlations via Stochastic Unravelings
Authors: Federico Settimo, Kimmo Luoma, Dariusz Chruściński, Andrea Smirne, Bassano Vacchini, Jyrki Piilo
Abstract: In standard treatments of open quantum systems, the reduced dynamics is described starting from the assumption that the system and the environment are initially uncorrelated. This assumption, however, is not always guaranteed in realistic scenarios and several theoretical approaches to characterize initially correlated dynamics have been introduced. For the uncorrelated scenario, stochastic unravelings are a powerful tool to simulate the dynamics, but so far they have not been used in the most general case in which correlations are initially present. In our work, we employ the bath positive (B+) or one-sided positive decomposition (OPD) formalism as a starting point to generalize stochastic unraveling in the presence of initial correlations. Noticeably, our approach doesn't depend on the particular unraveling technique, but holds for both piecewise deterministic and diffusive unravelings. This generalization allows not only for more powerful simulations for the reduced dynamics, but also for a deeper theoretical understanding of open system dynamics.

Title: Reservoir-assisted quantum battery charging at finite temperatures
Authors: Y. Yao, X. Q. Shao
Abstract: Quantum batteries, as highly efficient energy storage devices, have garnered significant research interest. A key challenge in their development is maximizing the extractable energy (ergotropy) when operating within a finite-temperature reservoir. To address this, we applied quantum feedback control to the charger and investigated the effects of fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs on the performance of quantum batteries, including stored energy, ergotropy, and charging efficiency, in an open environment. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the type of thermal reservoir, the system exhibits optimal charging parameters. Notably, in a fermionic thermal reservoir, increasing the environmental temperature enhances battery performance, enabling stable and efficient charging. In contrast, within a bosonic thermal reservoir, higher temperatures hinder energy storage and extraction, significantly reducing charging efficiency. Additionally, we explored the impact of battery size and found that, under a fermionic reservoir, increasing the battery size appropriately can further improve performance.

Title: Quantum Communication Multiplexing in LP-modes Enabled by Photonic Lanterns
Authors: I. Beraza, M. Zahidy, R. Mueller, N. M. Mathew, L. Grüner-Nielsen, L. S. Rishøj, L. K. Oxenløwe, M. Galili
Abstract: The non-cloning theorem of quantum states provides security, but also limits the Secret Key Rate (SKR) for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) implementations. Multiplexing is a widely used technique to enhance data rates in classical communication systems and can also increase the SKR in QKD systems. Using linearly polarized (LP) modes is an attractive solution as it is compatible with simple fiber designs. This work demonstrates a fiber-based QKD system employing LP mode multiplexing with a photonic lantern to convert the fundamental mode ($LP_{01}$) in separate fibers into higher-order modes ($LP_{11}$) in a single few-mode fiber. The performance of the system is sensitive to polarization dependence, mode alignment, and environmental crosstalk, which requires precise polarization control to minimize Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER). We report a SKR of 2.34 Mbps over a 24 km 5dB loss fiber link.

Title: Efficient classical algorithms for linear optical circuits
Authors: Youngrong Lim, Changhun Oh
Abstract: We present efficient classical algorithms to approximate expectation values and probability amplitudes in linear optical circuits. Specifically, our classical algorithm efficiently approximates the expectation values of observables in linear optical circuits for arbitrary product input states within an additive error under a mild condition. This result suggests that certain applications of linear optical circuits relying on expectation value estimation, such as photonic variational algorithms, may face challenges in achieving quantum advantage. In addition, the (marginal) output probabilities of boson sampling with arbitrary product input states can be efficiently approximated using our algorithm, implying that boson sampling can be efficiently simulated if its output probability distribution is polynomially sparse. Moreover, our method generalizes Gurvits's algorithm, originally designed to approximate the permanent, to also approximate the hafnian of complex symmetric matrices with an additive error. The algorithm also solves a molecular vibronic spectra problem for arbitrary product input states as precisely as boson samplers. Finally, our method extends to near-Clifford circuits, enabling the classical approximation of their expectation values of any observables and (marginal) output probabilities.

Title: Fundamental constraints on quantum fluctuations: Conservation laws, reality, and no-signaling
Authors: Thales Augusto Barbosa Pinto Silva, David Gelbwaser-Klimovsky
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations and noise are fundamental in quantum technologies, affecting computing, sensing, cryptography, and thermodynamics. These include fluctuations in the variation of energy, charge, and other observables driven by interactions with lasers, amplifiers, and baths. Despite the precise rules quantum mechanics provides for measuring observables at single points in time, no standard framework exists for characterizing the fluctuations of their variations over time. This gap not only makes physical conclusions dependent on the chosen measurement protocol but also leads to inconsistencies in fluctuation predictions, impacting quantum technologies. We propose four basic criteria that any consistent measurement of these variations must satisfy, grounded in conservation laws, the no-signaling principle, and expected constraints on physical realism. We demonstrate that only one protocol fulfills all these criteria: the two-times quantum observables. This result enables the extension of key quantum information concepts, such as entanglement, steering, and Bell's inequalities, to processes rather than instantaneous observables. Beyond resolving ambiguities in quantum fluctuation measurements, our framework offers a foundation for improved fluctuation control in quantum devices, with potential applications in quantum computing, metrology, and thermodynamics.

Title: On the role of true and false chirality in producing parity violating energy differences
Authors: Daniel Martínez-Gil, Pedro Bargueño, Salvador Miret-Artés
Abstract: In this work we tackle the problem of showing which type of influences can lift the degeneracy between truly and falsely chiral systems, showing that only when both systems and influences are both truly (falsely) chiral, a parity violating energy difference between left- and right-handed systems can be produced. In particular, after considering the enantiomers of a chiral molecule as paradigmatic truly chiral systems, we rigorously show, under a quantum field theoretically approach, that only a truly chiral influence such as the $Z^{0}$-mediated electroweak interaction can lift the degeneracy between enantiomers. On the contrary, we explicitly show that a falsely chiral influence, such as an axion-mediated interaction in chiral molecules, can not lift the aforementioned degeneracy. These results extend Barron's seminal ideas [L. D. Barron, True and false chirality and parity violation, Chem. Phys. Lett {\bf 123}, 423 (1986)] to a quantum field theory-based approach.

Title: Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Multilayered Materials
Authors: Saeed Rahmanian Koshkaki, Arshath Manjalingal, Logan Blackham, Arkajit Mandal
Abstract: Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a single layer placed in the middle of the optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation in the cavity quantization direction. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multilayered materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a {\it bright layer} description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayer material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.

Title: Probing curved spacetime with a distributed atomic processor clock
Authors: Jacob P. Covey, Igor Pikovski, Johannes Borregaard
Abstract: Quantum dynamics on curved spacetime has never been directly probed beyond the Newtonian limit. Although we can describe such dynamics theoretically, experiments would provide empirical evidence that quantum theory holds even in this extreme limit. The practical challenge is the minute spacetime curvature difference over the length scale of the typical extent of quantum effects. Here we propose a quantum network of alkaline earth(-like) atomic processors for constructing a distributed quantum state that is sensitive to the differential proper time between its constituent atomic processor nodes, implementing a quantum observable that is affected by post-Newtonian curved spacetime. Conceptually, we delocalize one clock between three locations by encoding the presence or absence of a clock into the state of the local atoms. By separating three atomic nodes over $\sim$km-scale elevation differences and distributing one clock between them via a W-state, we demonstrate that the curvature of spacetime is manifest in the interference of the three different proper times that give rise to three distinct beat notes in our non-local observable. We further demonstrate that $N$-atom entanglement within each node enhances the interrogation bandwidth by a factor of $N$. We discuss how our system can probe new facets of fundamental physics, such as the linearity, unitarity and probabilistic nature of quantum theory on curved spacetime. Our protocol combines several recent advances with neutral atom and trapped ions to realize a novel quantum probe of curved spacetime uniquely enabled by quantum networks.

Title: Polarization agnostic continuous variable quantum key distribution
Authors: Brian P. Williams, Nicholas A. Peters
Abstract: We introduce a polarization agnostic method for Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GCMS) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). Due to the random and continuous nature of the GCMS protocol, Alice, the transmitter, can encode two distinct quadratures in each of two orthogonal polarization modes, such that Bob, the receiver, measures valid GCMS quadratures in a single polarization mode even when polarization changes occur during transmission. This method does not require polarization correction in the optical domain, does not require monitoring both polarization modes, reduces loss by eliminating optical components, and avoids the noise injected by polarization correction algorithms.

Title: On the Alleged Locality in the Schrödinger Picture
Authors: Charles Alexandre Bédard
Abstract: Vedral claims that the Schrödinger picture can describe quantum systems as locally as the Heisenberg picture, relying on a product notation for the density matrix. This reply refutes that claim. I show that the so-called `local factors' in the product notation do not correspond to individual systems and therefore fail to satisfy Einsteinian locality. Furthermore, the product notation does not track where local gates are applied. Finally, I expose internal inconsistencies in the argument: if, as is also stated, Schrödinger-picture locality ultimately depends on explicit bookkeeping of all operations, then the explanatory power of the product notation is de facto undermined.

Title: Benchmarking MedMNIST dataset on real quantum hardware
Authors: Gurinder Singh, Hongni Jin, Kenneth M. Merz Jr
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising domain to leverage the computational capabilities of quantum systems to solve complex classification tasks. In this work, we present first comprehensive QML study by benchmarking the MedMNIST-a diverse collection of medical imaging datasets on a 127-qubit real IBM quantum hardware, to evaluate the feasibility and performance of quantum models (without any classical neural networks) in practical applications. This study explore recent advancements in quantum computing such as device-aware quantum circuits, error suppression and mitigation for medical image classification. Our methodology comprised of three stages: preprocessing, generation of noise-resilient and hardware-efficient quantum circuits, optimizing/training of quantum circuits on classical hardware, and inference on real IBM quantum hardware. Firstly, we process all input images in the preprocessing stage to reduce the spatial dimension due to the quantum hardware limitations. We generate hardware-efficient quantum circuits using backend properties expressible to learn complex patterns for medical image classification. After classical optimization of QML models, we perform the inference on real quantum hardware. We also incorporates advanced error suppression and mitigation techniques in our QML workflow including dynamical decoupling (DD), gate twirling, and matrix-free measurement mitigation (M3) to mitigate the effects of noise and improve classification performance. The experimental results showcase the potential of quantum computing for medical imaging and establishes a benchmark for future advancements in QML applied to healthcare.

Title: Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation -- a Combined STEM, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach
Authors: Oscar W. Kennedy, Kevin G. Crawford, Kowsar Shahbazi, Connor D. Shelly
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20 % of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance, highlighting the importance of weak spots in junction parameters such as resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.

Authors: Bartlomiej Czech, Sirui Shuai, Yixu Wang
Abstract: We interpret holographic entropy inequalities in terms of erasure correction. The non-saturation of an inequality is a necessary condition for certain schemes of holographic erasure correction, manifested in the bulk as non-empty overlaps of corresponding entanglement wedges.

Title: Many-body theory and Gaussian-basis implementation of positron annihilation $γ$-ray spectra on polyatomic molecules
Authors: S. K. Gregg, J. P. Cassidy, A. R. Swann, J. Hofierka, B. Cunningham, D. G. Green
Abstract: Doppler-broadened $\gamma$-ray spectra for positron annihilation on molecules are calculated using many-body theory. By employing Gaussian bases for the electron and positron wavefunctions, a computable expression that involves a four-centre integral over the two-annihilation-photon momenta is derived for the $\gamma$ spectra in the independent particle model approximation to the annihilation vertex, and implemented in the open-source {\tt EXCITON+} code. The influence of electron-positron correlations on the $\gamma$ spectra is examined through \textit{ab initio} treatment of the positron wavefunction, whilst corrections to the annihilation vertex are treated approximately via enhancement factors previously calculated [D. G. Green and G. F. Gribakin, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 114}, 093201 (2015)] exactly for atoms. Calculated $\gamma$ spectra for furan and acetonitrile are presented for annihilation from the positron bound state with electrons of individual molecular orbitals. For such annihilation from the positron-molecule bound state, it is found that the magnitude of the partial contribution to the $\gamma$ spectra from individual molecular orbitals depends not just on the orbital energies, but also on the molecular symmetry, more precisely the relative localisation of the positron and electron densities.

Title: Programmable photonic waveguide arrays: opportunities and challenges
Authors: Yang Yang, Akram Youssry, Alberto Peruzzo
Abstract: The field of programmable photonics has advanced significantly in recent decades, driven by the rising demand for complex applications, such as optical quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, as the complexity of these applications increases, there is an increasing need for novel designs that enhance circuit transmission and enable further miniaturization. Photonic waveguide arrays (WAs) hold a unique position in integrated photonics, as they implement ``always-on'' Hamiltonians and have no direct analogs in free-space optics. They find applications in various fields, including light propagation studies, quantum walks, and topological photonics. Despite their versatility, the lack of reconfigurability has limited their utility and hindered further advancements for a long time. Recently, programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs) have emerged as a promising solution for overcoming the limitations of static WAs and PWA-based architectures have been proven to be universal. This perspective proposes a vision for photonic circuits based on PWAs as a new, interdisciplinary field. We review the history of the development of PWAs and outline their potential in areas such as simulation, communication, sensing, and classical and quantum information processing. This technology is expected to become increasingly feasible with advancements in programmable photonics, nanofabrication, and quantum control.

Title: Bell correlations between momentum-entangled pairs of $^4\text{He}^*$ atoms
Authors: Y. S. Athreya, S. Kannan, X. T. Yan, R. J. Lewis-Swan, K. V. Kheruntsyan, A. G. Truscott, S. S. Hodgman
Abstract: Nonlocal entanglement between pair-correlated particles is a highly counter-intuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, where measurement on one particle can instantly affect the other, regardless of distance. While the rigorous Bell's inequality framework has enabled the demonstration of such entanglement in photons and atomic internal states, no experiment has yet involved motional states of massive particles. Here we report the experimental observation of Bell correlations in motional states of momentum-entangled ultracold helium atoms. Momentum-entangled pairs are generated via $s$-wave collisions. Using a Rarity-Tapster interferometer and a Bell-test framework, we observe atom-atom correlations required for violation of a Bell inequality. This result shows the potential of ultracold atoms for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and opens new avenues to studying gravitational effects in quantum states.

Title: Stability of Floquet sidebands and quantum coherence in 1D strongly interacting spinless fermions
Authors: Karun Gadge, Salvatore R. Manmana
Abstract: For strongly correlated quantum systems, fundamental questions about the formation and stability of Floquet-Bloch sidebands (FBs) upon periodic driving remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly addressing these questions in time-dependent single-particle spectral functions. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS), we find for a chain of interacting spinless fermions that high-frequency driving leads to long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum, accompanied by in-gap modes related to mobile domain walls. Conversely, in the low-frequency regime and in the presence of noise, heating dominates, resulting in a significant loss of quantum coherence. This is further elucidated by the behaviour of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.

Title: Cavity-enhanced spectroscopy in the deep cryogenic regime -- new hydrogen technologies for quantum sensing

Abstract: Spectrometers based on high-finesse optical cavities have proven to be powerful tools for applied and fundamental studies. Extending this technology to the deep cryogenic regime is beneficial in many ways: Doppler broadening is reduced, peak absorption is enhanced, the Boltzmann distribution of rotational states is narrowed, all unwanted molecular species disturbing the spectra are frozen out, and dense spectra of complex polyatomic molecules become easier to assign. We demonstrate a cavity-enhanced spectrometer fully operating in the deep cryogenic regime down to 4 K. We solved several technological challenges that allowed us to uniformly cool not only the sample but also the entire cavity, including the mirrors and cavity length actuator, which ensures the thermodynamic equilibrium of a gas sample. Our technology well isolates the cavity from external noise and cryocooler vibrations. This instrument enables a variety of fundamental and practical applications. We demonstrate a few examples based on accurate spectroscopy of cryogenic hydrogen molecules: accurate test of the quantum electrodynamics for molecules; realization of the primary SI standards for temperature, concentration and pressure in the deep cryogenic regime; measurement of the H$_{2}$ phase diagram; and determination of the ortho-para spin isomer conversion rate.

Abstract: We describe how the annihilation of antiprotons can be utilized to generate highly charged synthetic qubits in an ion-trap setup. We identify the qubit transitions in the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen-like atoms composed of an isomer and a single electron in the ground state. We identify promising candidates in the isomers of Y, Nb, Rh, In, and Sb, for which the hyperfine transition lies in the infrared and whose excited state level lifetime is in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is suitable for metrology applications.

Title: Universality and emergent effective fluid from jets and string breaking in the massive Schwinger model using tensor networks
Authors: Romuald A. Janik, Maciej A. Nowak, Marek M. Rams, Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We analyze the correlation between the energy, momentum and spatial entanglement produced by two luminal jets in the massive Schwinger model. Using tensor network methods, we show that for m/g > 1/{\pi}, in the vicinity of the strong to weak coupling transition, a nearly perfect and chargeless effective fluid behavior appears around the mid-rapidity region with a universal energy-pressure relationship. The evolution of energy and pressure is strongly correlated with the rise of the spatial entanglement entropy, indicating a key role of quantum dynamics. Some of these observations may be used to analyze high multiplicity jet fragmentation events, energy-energy and energy-charge correlators at current collider energies.

Title: The Canonical Forms of Matrix Product States in Infinite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Authors: Niilo Heikkinen
Abstract: In this work, we prove that any element in the tensor product of separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be expressed as a matrix product state (MPS) of possibly infinite bond dimension. The proof is based on the singular value decomposition of compact operators and the connection between tensor products and Hilbert-Schmidt operators via the Schmidt decomposition in infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces. The construction of infinite-dimensional MPS (idMPS) is analogous to the well-known finite-dimensional construction in terms of singular value decompositions of matrices. The infinite matrices in idMPS give rise to operators acting on (possibly infinite-dimensional) auxiliary Hilbert spaces. As an example we explicitly construct an MPS representation for certain eigenstates of a chain of three coupled harmonic oscillators.

Title: Predictive simulations of the dynamical response of mesoscopic devices
Authors: Samuel Boutin, Torsten Karzig, Tareq El Dandachi, Ryan V. Mishmash, Jan Gukelberger, Roman M. Lutchyn, Bela Bauer
Abstract: As the complexity of mesoscopic quantum devices increases, simulations are becoming an invaluable tool for understanding their behavior. This is especially true for the superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures used to build Majorana-based topological qubits, where quantitatively understanding the interplay of topological superconductivity, disorder, semiconductor quantum dots, Coulomb blockade and noise has been essential for progress on device design and interpretation of measurements. In this paper, we describe a general framework to simulate the low-energy quantum dynamics of such complex systems. We illustrate our approach by computing the dispersive gate sensing (DGS) response of quantum dots coupled to topological superconductors. We start by formulating the DGS response as an open-system quantum dynamics problem, which allows a consistent treatment of drive backaction as well as quantum and classical noise. For microscopic quantum problems subject to Coulomb-blockade, where a direct solution in the exponentially large many-body Hilbert space would be prohibitive, we introduce a series of controlled approximations that incorporate ideas from tensor network theory and quantum chemistry to reduce this Hilbert space to a few low-energy degrees of freedom that accurately capture the low-energy quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the methods introduced in this paper on the example of a single quantum dot coupled to a topological superconductor and a microscopic realization of the fermion parity readout setup of Aghaee et al. arXiv:2401.09549 (2024).

Title: Geometric and General Relativistic Techniques for Non-relativistic Quantum Systems
Authors: Aonghus Hunter-McCabe, Brian P. Dolan, Peter Coles
Abstract: This thesis explores the application of differential geometric and general relativistic techniques to deepen our understanding of quantum mechanical systems. We focus on three systems, employing these mathematical frameworks to uncover subtle features within each. First, we examine Unruh radiation in the context of an accelerated two-state atom, determining transition frequencies for a variety of accelerated trajectories via first-order perturbation theory. For harmonic motion of the atom in a vacuum, we derive transition rates with potential experimental realizations. Next, we investigate the quantum Hall effect in a spherical geometry using the Dirac operator for non-interacting fermions in a background magnetic field generated by a Wu-Yang monopole. The Atiyah-Singer index theorem constrains the degeneracy of the ground state, and the fractional quantum Hall effect is studied using the composite fermion model, where Dirac strings associated with the monopole field supply the statistical gauge field vortices. A unique, gapped ground state emerges, yielding fractions of the form $\nu = \frac{1}{2k+1}$ for large particle numbers. Finally, we examine the AdS/CMT correspondence through a bulk fermionic field in an RN-AdS$_4$ background (with a U(1) gauge field), dual to a boundary fermionic operator. Spherical and planar event horizon geometries are discussed, with the temperature of the RN black hole identified with that of the dual system on the boundary. By numerically solving for the spectral functions of the dual theory, for a spherical event horizon at zero temperature, we identify a shift in the Fermi surface from that which arises in the planar case. Preliminary evidence of a phase transition emerges upon examining these spectral functions, again for the spherical horizon, at non-zero temperature.

Title: Artificially creating emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism and its manipulation in a magnetic van-der-Waals heterostructure
Authors: Xiangqi Wang, Cong Wang, Yupeng Wang, Chunhui Ye, Azizur Rahman, Min Zhang, Suhan Son, Jun Tan, Zengming Zhang, Wei Ji, Je-Geun Park, Kai-Xuan Zhang
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets, with their two-dimensional (2D) atomic structures, provide a unique platform for exploring magnetism at the nanoscale. Although there have been numerous reports on their diverse quantum properties, the emergent interfacial magnetism--artificially created at the interface between two layered magnets--remains largely unexplored. This work presents observations of such emergent interfacial magnetism at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface in a vdW heterostructure. We report the discovery of an intermediate Hall resistance plateau in the anomalous Hall loop, indicative of emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism fostered by the heterointerface. This plateau can be stabilized and further manipulated under varying pressures but collapses under high pressures over 10 GPa. Our theoretical calculations reveal that charge transfer at the interface is pivotal in establishing the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. This work illuminates the previously unexplored emergent interfacial magnetism at a vdW interface comprised of a ferromagnetic metal and an antiferromagnetic insulator, and highlights its gradual evolution under increasing pressure. These findings enrich the portfolio of emergent interfacial magnetism and support further investigations on vdW magnetic interfaces and the development of next-generation spintronic devices.

Title: Rotational quenching of monofluorides in a cryogenic helium bath
Authors: Mateo Londoño, Jesús Péres-Ríos
Abstract: Buffer gas cooling, one of the most relevant direct cooling techniques for cooling molecules, relies on dissipating the energy of the molecule via collisions with a buffer gas. The cooling efficiency hinges on the molecule-atom scattering properties, concretely, on the transport properties. This work presents a global study on the interactions, collision dynamics, and transport properties of monofluoride molecules (X-F), being X a metal, in the presence of a cold He buffer gas. The interactions are calculated using ab initio quantum chemistry methods, and the dynamics is treated fully quantal, assuming the monofluoride molecule is a rigid rotor. The resulting thermalization and rotational quenching rates are analyzed in light of the Born Distorted Wave Approximation (BDWA), yielding an explanation based on the elemental physical properties of the molecule under consideration. Therefore, the analysis of our results reveals the physics behind the rotational quenching of molecules in the presence of a cold buffer gas.

Abstract: Tensor Networks have emerged as a prominent alternative to neural networks for addressing Machine Learning challenges in foundational sciences, paving the way for their applications to real-life problems. This paper introduces tn4ml, a novel library designed to seamlessly integrate Tensor Networks into optimization pipelines for Machine Learning tasks. Inspired by existing Machine Learning frameworks, the library offers a user-friendly structure with modules for data embedding, objective function definition, and model training using diverse optimization strategies. We demonstrate its versatility through two examples: supervised learning on tabular data and unsupervised learning on an image dataset. Additionally, we analyze how customizing the parts of the Machine Learning pipeline for Tensor Networks influences performance metrics.

Title: The Effect of Non-Gaussian Noise on Auto-correlative Weak-value Amplification
Authors: Xiang-Yun Hu, Jing-Hui Huang, Fei-Fan He, Guang-Jun Wang, Adetunmise C. Dada
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the spectral features of noise and their influence on open quantum systems is fundamental for quantitative understanding and prediction of the dynamics in a realistic environment. For the weak measurements of two-level systems, the weak value obtained from experiments will inevitably be affected by the noise of the environment. Following our earlier work on the technique of the auto-correlative weak-value amplification (AWVA) approach under a Gaussian noise environment, here we study the effect of non-Gaussian noise on the AWVA this http URL particular, two types of noise with a negative-dB signal-to-noise ratio, frequency-stationary noises and frequency-nonstationary noises are studied. The various frequency-stationary noises, including low-frequency (1/f) noises, medium-frequency noises, and high-frequency noises, are generated in Simulink by translating the Gaussian white noise with different band-pass filters. While impulsive noise is studied as an example of frequency-non stationary noises. Our simulated results demonstrate that 1/f noises and impulsive noises have greater disturbance on the AWVA measurements. In addition, adding one kind of frequency-stationary noise, clamping the detected signals, and dominating the measurement range may have the potential to improve the precision of the AWVA technique with both a smaller deviation of the mean value and a smaller error bar in the presence of many hostile non-Gaussian noises.

Title: Elfs, trees and quantum walks
Authors: Simon Apers, Stephen Piddock
Abstract: We study an elementary Markov process on graphs based on electric flow sampling (elfs). The elfs process repeatedly samples from an electric flow on a graph. While the sinks of the flow are fixed, the source is updated using the electric flow sample, and the process ends when it hits a sink vertex. We argue that this process naturally connects to many key quantities of interest. E.g., we describe a random walk coupling which implies that the elfs process has the same arrival distribution as a random walk. We also analyze the electric hitting time, which is the expected time before the process hits a sink vertex. As our main technical contribution, we show that the electric hitting time on trees is logarithmic in the graph size and weights. The initial motivation behind the elfs process is that quantum walks can sample from electric flows, and they can hence implement this process very naturally. This yields a quantum walk algorithm for sampling from the random walk arrival distribution, which has widespread applications. It complements the existing line of quantum walk search algorithms which only return an element from the sink, but yield no insight in the distribution of the returned element. By our bound on the electric hitting time on trees, the quantum walk algorithm on trees requires quadratically fewer steps than the random walk hitting time, up to polylog factors.

Title: Compression of Entanglement Improves Quantum Communication
Authors: Yu Guo, Hao Tang, Jef Pauwels, Emmanuel Zambrini Cruzeiro, Xiao-Min Hu, Bi-Heng Liu, Yu-Feng Huang, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo, Armin Tavakoli
Abstract: Shared entanglement can significantly amplify classical correlations between systems interacting over a limited quantum channel. A natural avenue is to use entanglement of the same dimension as the channel because this allows for unitary encodings, which preserve global coherence until a measurement is performed. Contrasting this, we here demonstrate a distributed task based on a qubit channel, for which irreversible encoding operations can outperform any possible coherence-preserving protocol. This corresponds to using high-dimensional entanglement and encoding information by compressing one of the subsystems into a qubit. Demonstrating this phenomenon requires the preparation of a four-dimensional maximally entangled state, the compression of two qubits into one and joint qubit-ququart entangled measurements, with all modules executed at near-optimal fidelity. We report on a proof-of-principle experiment that achieves the advantage by realizing separate systems in distinct and independently controlled paths of a single photon. Our result demonstrates the relevance of high-dimensional entanglement and non-unitary operations for enhancing the communication capabilities of standard qubit transmissions.

Title: Quantum Vision Clustering
Authors: Xuan Bac Nguyen, Hugh Churchill, Khoa Luu, Samee U. Khan
Abstract: Unsupervised visual clustering has garnered significant attention in recent times, aiming to characterize distributions of unlabeled visual images through clustering based on a parameterized appearance approach. Alternatively, clustering algorithms can be viewed as assignment problems, often characterized as NP-hard, yet precisely solvable for small instances on contemporary hardware. Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) emerges as a promising solution, poised to deliver substantial speedups for a range of NP-hard optimization problems. However, existing clustering formulations face challenges in quantum computing adoption due to scalability issues. In this study, we present the first clustering formulation tailored for resolution using Adiabatic quantum computing. An Ising model is introduced to represent the quantum mechanical system implemented on AQC. The proposed approach demonstrates high competitiveness compared to state-of-the-art optimization-based methods, even when utilizing off-the-shelf integer programming solvers. Lastly, this work showcases the solvability of the proposed clustering problem on current-generation real quantum computers for small examples and analyzes the properties of the obtained solutions

Title: Quantum Speedups for Multiproposal MCMC
Authors: Chin-Yi Lin, Kuo-Chin Chen, Philippe Lemey, Marc A. Suchard, Andrew J. Holbrook, Min-Hsiu Hsieh
Abstract: Multiproposal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms choose from multiple proposals to generate their next chain step in order to sample from challenging target distributions more efficiently. However, on classical machines, these algorithms require $\mathcal{O}(P)$ target evaluations for each Markov chain step when choosing from $P$ proposals. Recent work demonstrates the possibility of quadratic quantum speedups for one such multiproposal MCMC algorithm. After generating $P$ proposals, this quantum parallel MCMC (QPMCMC) algorithm requires only $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{P})$ target evaluations at each step, outperforming its classical counterpart. However, generating $P$ proposals using classical computers still requires $\mathcal{O}(P)$ time complexity, resulting in the overall complexity of QPMCMC remaining $\mathcal{O}(P)$. Here, we present a new, faster quantum multiproposal MCMC strategy, QPMCMC2. With a specially designed Tjelmeland distribution that generates proposals close to the input state, QPMCMC2 requires only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ target evaluations and $\mathcal{O}(\log P)$ qubits when computing over a large number of proposals $P$. Unlike its slower predecessor, the QPMCMC2 Markov kernel (1) maintains detailed balance exactly and (2) is fully explicit for a large class of graphical models. We demonstrate this flexibility by applying QPMCMC2 to novel Ising-type models built on bacterial evolutionary networks and obtain significant speedups for Bayesian ancestral trait reconstruction for 248 observed salmonella bacteria.

Title: Simple and general bounds on quantum random access codes
Authors: Máté Farkas, Nikolai Miklin, Armin Tavakoli
Abstract: Random access codes are a type of communication task that is widely used in quantum information science. The optimal average success probability that can be achieved through classical strategies is known for any random access code. However, only a few cases are solved exactly for quantum random access codes. In this paper, we provide bounds for the fully general setting of n independent variables, each selected from a d-dimensional classical alphabet and encoded in a D-dimensional quantum system subject to an arbitrary quantum measurement. The bound recovers the exactly known special cases, and we demonstrate numerically that even though the bound is not tight overall, it can still yield a good approximation.

Title: Engineering Hierarchical Symmetries
Authors: Zhanpeng Fu, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao, Marin Bukov
Abstract: The capacity to custom tailor the properties of quantum matter and materials is a central requirement for enlarging their range of possible functionalities. A particularly promising route is the use of driving protocols to engineer specific desired properties with a high degree of control and flexibility. Here, we present such a program for the tunable generation of sequences of symmetries on controllable timescales. Concretely, our general driving protocol for many-body systems generates a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries, which imprints emergent quasiconservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$. Our results have direct applications in experiments with quantum simulators.

Title: Characterizing randomness in parameterized quantum circuits through expressibility and average entanglement
Authors: Guilherme Ilário Correr, Ivan Medina, Pedro C. Azado, Alexandre Drinko, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto
Abstract: While scalable error correction schemes and fault tolerant quantum computing seem not to be universally accessible in the near sight, the efforts of many researchers have been directed to the exploration of the contemporary available quantum hardware. Due to these limitations, the depth and dimension of the possible quantum circuits are restricted. This motivates the study of circuits with parameterized operations that can be classically optimized in hybrid methods as variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), enabling the reduction of circuit depth and size. The characteristics of these Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) are still not fully understood outside the scope of their principal application, motivating the study of their intrinsic properties. In this work, we analyse the generation of random states in PQCs under restrictions on the qubits connectivities, justified by different quantum computer architectures. We apply the expressibility quantifier and the average entanglement as diagnostics for the characteristics of the generated states and classify the circuits depending on the topology of the quantum computer where they can be implemented. As a function of the number of layers and qubits, circuits following a Ring topology will have the highest entanglement and expressibility values, followed by Linear/All-to-all almost together and the Star topology. In addition to the characterization of the differences between the entanglement and expressibility of these circuits, we also place a connection between how steep is the increase on the uniformity of the distribution of the generated states and the generation of entanglement. Circuits generating average and standard deviation for entanglement closer to values obtained with the truly uniformly random ensemble of unitaries present a steeper evolution when compared to others.

Title: Chebyshev approximation and composition of functions in matrix product states for quantum-inspired numerical analysis
Authors: Juan José Rodríguez-Aldavero, Paula García-Molina, Luca Tagliacozzo, Juan José García-Ripoll
Abstract: This work explores the representation of univariate and multivariate functions as matrix product states (MPS), also known as quantized tensor-trains (QTT). It proposes an algorithm that employs iterative Chebyshev expansions and Clenshaw evaluations to represent analytic and highly differentiable functions as MPS Chebyshev interpolants. It demonstrates rapid convergence for highly-differentiable functions, aligning with theoretical predictions, and generalizes efficiently to multidimensional scenarios. The performance of the algorithm is compared with that of tensor cross-interpolation (TCI) and multiscale interpolative constructions through a comprehensive comparative study. When function evaluation is inexpensive or when the function is not analytical, TCI is generally more efficient for function loading. However, the proposed method shows competitive performance, outperforming TCI in certain multivariate scenarios. Moreover, it shows advantageous scaling rates and generalizes to a wider range of tasks by providing a framework for function composition in MPS, which is useful for non-linear problems and many-body statistical physics.

Title: Resource-efficient algorithm for estimating the trace of quantum state powers
Authors: Myeongjin Shin, Junseo Lee, Seungwoo Lee, Kabgyun Jeong
Abstract: Estimating the trace of quantum state powers, $\text{Tr}(\rho^k)$, for $k$ identical quantum states is a fundamental task with numerous applications in quantum information processing, including nonlinear function estimation of quantum states and entanglement detection. On near-term quantum devices, reducing the required quantum circuit depth, the number of multi-qubit quantum operations, and the copies of the quantum state needed for such computations is crucial. In this work, inspired by the Newton-Girard method, we significantly improve upon existing results by introducing an algorithm that requires only $\mathcal{O}(\tilde{r})$ qubits and $\mathcal{O}(\tilde{r})$ multi-qubit gates, where $\tilde{r} = \min\left\{\text{rank}(\rho), \left\lfloor\ln\left({2k}/{\epsilon}\right)\right\rfloor\right\}$. Furthermore, we prove that estimating $\{\text{Tr}(\rho^i)\}_{i=1}^{\tilde{r}}$ is sufficient to approximate $\text{Tr}(\rho^k)$ even for large integers $k > \tilde{r}$. This leads to a rank-dependent complexity for solving the problem, providing an efficient algorithm for low-rank quantum states while also improving existing methods when the rank is unknown or when the state is not low-rank. Building upon these advantages, we extend our algorithm to the estimation of $\text{Tr}(M\rho^k)$ for arbitrary observables and $\text{Tr}(\rho^k \sigma^l)$ for multiple quantum states.

Title: Efficient Strategies for Reducing Sampling Error in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization
Authors: Gwonhak Lee, Seonghoon Choi, Joonsuk Huh, Artur F. Izmaylov
Abstract: Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization via projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the algorithm often requires solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) involving erroneous matrix pairs, which can significantly distort the solution. Since EFTQC assumes limited-scale error correction, finite sampling error becomes a dominant source of error in these matrices. This work focuses on quantifying sampling errors during the measurement of matrix element in the projected Hamiltonian examining two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: the linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. To reduce sampling error within a fixed budget of quantum circuit repetitions, we propose two measurement strategies: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique eliminates redundant Hamiltonian components that annihilate either the bra or ket states, while coefficient splitting optimizes the measurement of common terms across different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, reducing sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.

Title: Quantum trajectories and output field properties for two-photon input field
Authors: Anita Dabrowska, Gniewomir Sarbicki
Abstract: The excitation of atomic and molecular systems by propagating light in a two-photon state within the Wigner-Weisskopf approximation has been described using stochastic tools. The problem of a stochastic evolution of the quantum system, depending on the results of the measurement of the output field, was formulated and solved making use of the model of repeated interactions and measurement. We defined the discrete in-time interaction between the quantum system and its environment being the electromagnetic field approximated by a chain or chains of harmonic oscillators. We determined analytical formulae for quantum trajectories associated with one-dimensional and two-dimensional counting processes, corresponding respectively to unidirectional or bidirectional input field prepared in the two-photon states. We derived the formulae for the exclusive probability densities of photon counts that allow us to completely characterize the photon statistics of the output field. Finally, we showed how to apply the quantum trajectories to obtain the formula for the probability of the two-photon absorption for a three-level atom in a ladder configuration. The paper also includes a discussion on the optimal two-photon state that maximizes the two-photon absorption probability.

Title: Speeding up Quantum Annealing with Engineered Dephasing
Authors: Mykolas Sveistrys, Josias Langbehn, Raphaël Menu, Steve Campbell, Giovanna Morigi, Christiane P. Koch
Abstract: Building on the insight that engineered noise, specifically, engineered dephasing can enhance the adiabaticity of controlled quantum dynamics, we investigate how a dephasing-generating coupling to an auxiliary quantum system affects quantum annealing protocols. By calculating the exact reduced system dynamics, we show how this coupling enhances the system's adiabaticity solely through a coherent mechanism - an effective energy rescaling. We show that it can lead to an annealing speedup linearly proportional to the strength of the coupling. We discuss the experimental feasibility of the protocols, and investigate the trade-off between fidelity and implementability by examining two modified versions with fewer types of required physical couplings.

Title: Absorbing State Phase Transitions and Stability of Long-Range Coherence in Dissipative Quantum State Preparation
Authors: Matthew Wampler, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: We investigate the absorbing state phase transition in a purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model where the absorbing state itself has long range phase coherence. The model may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W-state with errors. The 'error' Lindblad jump operators preserve the W-state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates, and show that remnants of the coherence persist even after the phase transition to the decohering phase. Furthermore, we argue that the long range coherence of the absorbing state leads to critical behavior distinct from Directed Percolation, the typical universality class for reaction-diffusion models.

Title: A Simple Framework for Secure Key Leasing
Authors: Fuyuki Kitagawa, Tomoyuki Morimae, Takashi Yamakawa
Abstract: Secure key leasing (a.k.a. key-revocable cryptography) enables us to lease a cryptographic key as a quantum state in such a way that the key can be later revoked in a verifiable manner. We propose a simple framework for constructing cryptographic primitives with secure key leasing via the certified deletion property of BB84 states. Based on our framework, we obtain the following schemes. - A public key encryption scheme with secure key leasing that has classical revocation based on any IND-CPA secure public key encryption scheme. Prior works rely on either quantum revocation or stronger assumptions such as the quantum hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem. - A pseudorandom function with secure key leasing that has classical revocation based on one-way functions. Prior works rely on stronger assumptions such as the quantum hardness of the LWE problem. - A digital signature scheme with secure key leasing that has classical revocation based on the quantum hardness of the short integer solution (SIS) problem. Our construction has static signing keys, i.e., the state of a signing key almost does not change before and after signing. Prior constructions either rely on non-static signing keys or indistinguishability obfuscation to achieve a stronger goal of copy-protection. In addition, all of our schemes remain secure even if a verification key for revocation is leaked after the adversary submits a valid certificate of deletion. To our knowledge, all prior constructions are totally broken in this setting. Moreover, in our view, our security proofs are much simpler than those for existing schemes.

Title: On estimating the trace of quantum state powers
Authors: Yupan Liu, Qisheng Wang
Abstract: We investigate the computational complexity of estimating the trace of quantum state powers $\text{tr}(\rho^q)$ for an $n$-qubit mixed quantum state $\rho$, given its state-preparation circuit of size $\text{poly}(n)$. This quantity is closely related to and often interchangeable with the Tsallis entropy $\text{S}_q(\rho) = \frac{1-\text{tr}(\rho^q)}{q-1}$, where $q = 1$ corresponds to the von Neumann entropy. For any non-integer $q \geq 1 + \Omega(1)$, we provide a quantum estimator for $\text{S}_q(\rho)$ with time complexity $\text{poly}(n)$, exponentially improving the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (ISIT 2019), Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024), and Wang, Zhang, and Li (TIT 2024), and Wang and Zhang (ESA 2024). Our speedup is achieved by introducing efficiently computable uniform approximations of positive power functions into quantum singular value transformation. Our quantum algorithm reveals a sharp phase transition between the case of $q=1$ and constant $q>1$ in the computational complexity of the Quantum $q$-Tsallis Entropy Difference Problem (TsallisQED$_q$), particularly deciding whether the difference $\text{S}_q(\rho_0) - \text{S}_q(\rho_1)$ is at least $0.001$ or at most $-0.001$: - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq q \leq 2$, TsallisQED$_q$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete, which implies that Purity Estimation is also $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. - For any $1 \leq q \leq 1 + \frac{1}{n-1}$, TsallisQED$_q$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-hard, leading to hardness of approximating the von Neumann entropy because $\text{S}_q(\rho) \leq \text{S}(\rho)$, as long as $\mathsf{BQP} \subsetneq \mathsf{QSZK}$. The hardness results are derived from reductions based on new inequalities for the quantum $q$-Jensen-(Shannon-)Tsallis divergence with $1\leq q \leq 2$, which are of independent interest.

Title: On the practicality of quantum sieving algorithms for the shortest vector problem
Authors: Joao F. Doriguello, George Giapitzakis, Alessandro Luongo, Aditya Morolia
Abstract: One of the main candidates of post-quantum cryptography is lattice-based cryptography. Its cryptographic security against quantum attackers is based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems like the shortest vector problem (SVP), which asks to find the shortest non-zero vector in an integer lattice. Asymptotic quantum speedups for solving SVP are known and rely on Grover's search. However, to assess the security of lattice-based cryptography against these Grover-like quantum speedups, it is necessary to carry out a precise resource estimation beyond asymptotic scalings. In this work, we perform a careful analysis on the resources required to implement several sieving algorithms aided by Grover's search for dimensions of cryptographic interests. For such, we take into account fixed-point quantum arithmetic operations, non-asymptotic Grover's search, the cost of using quantum random access memory (QRAM), different physical architectures, and quantum error correction. We find that even under very optimistic assumptions like circuit-level noise of $10^{-5}$, code cycles of 100 ns, reaction time of 1 $\mu$s, and using state-of-the-art arithmetic circuits and quantum error-correction protocols, the best sieving algorithms require $\approx 10^{13}$ physical qubits and $\approx 10^{31}$ years to solve SVP on a lattice of dimension 400, which is roughly the dimension for minimally secure post-quantum cryptographic standards currently being proposed by NIST. We estimate that a 6-GHz-clock-rate single-core classical computer would take roughly the same amount of time to solve the same problem. We conclude that there is currently little to no quantum speedup in the dimensions of cryptographic interest and the possibility of realising a considerable quantum speedup using quantum sieving algorithms would require significant breakthroughs in theoretical protocols and hardware development.

Title: Quantum Mpemba effect of localization in the dissipative mosaic model
Authors: J. W. Dong, H. F. Mu, M. Qin, H. T. Cui
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect in open quantum systems has been extensively studied, but a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon remains elusive. In this paper, we conduct an analytical investigation of the dissipative dynamics of single excitations in the The mosaic model. Surprisingly, we discover that the presence of an asymptotic mobility edge, denoted as $E_c^{\infty}$, can lead to unique dissipation behavior, serving as a hallmark of the quantum Mpemba effect. Especially, it is found that the energy level $E_c^{\infty}$ exhibits a global periodicity in the real configuration, which acts to inhibit dissipation in the system. Conversely, when the system deviates from $E_c^{\infty}$, the quasidisorder sets in, leading to increased dissipative effects due to the broken of periodicity. Furthermore, we find that the rate of dissipation is closely linked to the localization of the initial state. As a result, the quantum Mpemba effect can be observed clearly by a measure of localization.

Title: Processing and Decoding Rydberg Leakage Error with MBQC
Authors: Cheng-Cheng Yu, Zi-Han Chen, Yu-Hao Deng, Ming-Cheng Chen, Chao-Yang Lu, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: Neutral atom array has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computation due to its high-fidelity two-qubit gate, arbitrary connectivity and remarkable scalability. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atom necessitates careful consideration of the errors inherent to these systems. One typical error is the leakage from Rydberg states during the implementation of multi-qubit gates, which induces two-qubit error chain and degrades the error distance. To address this, researchers have proposed an erasure conversion protocol that employs fast leakage detection and continuous atomic replacement to convert leakage errors into benign erasure errors. While this method achieves a favorable error distance de = d, its applicability is restricted to certain atom species. In this work, we present a novel approach to manage Rydberg leakage errors in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). From a hardware perspective, we utilize practical experimental techniques along with an adaptation of the Pauli twirling approximation (PTA) to mitigate the impacts of leakage errors, which propagate similarly to Pauli errors without degrading the error distance. From a decoding perspective, we leverage the inherent structure of topological cluster states and final leakage detection information to locate propagated errors from Rydberg leakage. This approach eliminates the need for mid-circuit leakage detection, while maintaining an error distance de = d and achieving a high threshold of 3.4% per CZ gate for pure leakage errors under perfect final leakage detection. Furthermore, in the presence of additional Pauli errors, our protocol demonstrates comparable logical error rates to the erasure conversion method within a reasonable range of physical errors.

Title: Bloch Oscillation and Landau-Zener Tunneling of a Periodically Kicked Dirac Particle
Authors: Bin Sun, Shaowen Lan, Yi Cao, Jie Liu
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a relativistic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle governed by a one-dimensional time-periodic kicking Dirac equation. We observe distinct oscillatory behavior in the momentum space and quantum tunneling in the vicinity of zero momentum, which is found to be equivalent to the Bloch oscillations and Landau-Zener tunneling, i.e., Bloch-Landau-Zener (BLZ) dynamics in tilted bipartite lattices. Using the Floquet formalism, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that can accurately predict the oscillation period and amplitude. The tunneling probability has also been determined analytically. Our analysis extends to the influence of various parameters on dynamic behavior. We also discuss how relativistic effects and spin degrees of freedom impact quantum systems' transport properties and localization phenomena.

Title: Fundamental bounds on precision and response for quantum trajectory observables
Authors: Tan Van Vu
Abstract: The precision and response of trajectory observables offer valuable insights into the behavior of nonequilibrium systems. For classical systems, trade-offs between these characteristics and thermodynamic costs, such as entropy production and dynamical activity, have been established through uncertainty relations. Quantum systems, however, present unique challenges, where quantum coherence can enhance precision and violate classical uncertainty relations. In this study, we derive trade-off relations for stochastic observables in Markovian open quantum systems. Specifically, we present three key results: (i) a quantum generalization of the thermo-kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the relative fluctuations of currents in terms of entropy production and dynamical activity; (ii) a quantum inverse uncertainty relation, which constrains the relative fluctuations of arbitrary counting observables based on their instantaneous fluctuations and the spectral gap of the symmetrized Liouvillian; and (iii) a quantum response kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the response of general observables to kinetic perturbations in terms of dynamical activity. These fundamental bounds, validated numerically using a three-level maser and a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between precision, response, and thermodynamic costs in quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Computing in Corrosion Modeling: Bridging Research and Industry
Authors: Juan Manuel Aguiar Hualde, Marek Kowalik, Lian Remme, Franziska Elisabeth Wolff, Julian van Velzen, Walden Killick, Rene Bottcher, Christian Weimer, Jasper Krauser, Emanuele Marsili
Abstract: Corrosion presents a major challenge to the longevity and reliability of products across various industries, particularly in the aerospace sector. Corrosion arises from chemical processes occurring on an atomistic scale, which lead to macroscopic degradation. Addressing this issue requires multi-scale modeling approaches, which rely on microscopic parameters that are challenging to measure experimentally or model with conventional quantum chemistry techniques. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a hybrid quantum-classical workflow tailored for atomistic simulations of corrosion processes, with a specific focus on the initial step of the oxygen reduction reaction -- a critical trigger for the corrosion of aluminum alloys widely used in modern aircraft. Using a combination of classical quantum chemistry methods and quantum computing frameworks, we identify reaction geometries characterized by multi-configurational electronic structures that are ideal for exploring with quantum algorithms. For the first time in this context, we explore both noisy intermediate-scale quantum and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for these multi-configurational system, integrating them within a workflow designed to bridge atomistic simulations with macroscopic modeling approaches, such as finite element methods. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed quantum resource estimation to assess when and how quantum computers may play a meaningful role in tackling these problems. Our results demonstrate that significant advancements in quantum hardware but also in algorithms and error correction techniques are needed to make quantum computation practically viable for this class of problems. Nevertheless, this work establishes a critical foundation for applying quantum computation to corrosion modeling and highlights its potential to address complex, business-relevant challenges in materials science.

Title: A simple algorithm to reflect through eigenspaces of unitaries
Authors: Baptiste Claudon
Abstract: Reflections are omnipresent tools in quantum algorithms. We consider the task of reflecting through the eigenspace of an implementable unitary. Such reflections are generally designed using phase estimation or linear combination of unitaries. These methods have size and depth that scale favorably with the desired precision and the spectral gap of the unitary. However, they require a number of ancilla qubits that grows with both parameters. Here, we present a simple algorithm with the same size and depth scaling but requiring only 3 ancilla qubits for all problem instances. As such, this algorithm is expected to become the reference method to reflect through eigenspaces of unitaries.

Title: Quantum thermometry for ultralow temperatures using probe and ancilla qubit chains
Authors: Asghar Ullah, Vipul Upadhyay, Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu
Abstract: We propose a scheme to enhance the range and precision of ultralow temperature measurements by employing a probe qubit coupled to a chain of ancilla qubits. Specifically, we analyze a qubit chain governed by Heisenberg $XX$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. The precision limits of temperature measurements are characterized through the evaluation of quantum Fisher information (QFI). Our findings demonstrate that the achievable precision bounds, as well as the number of peaks in the QFI as a function of temperature, can be controlled by adjusting the number of ancilla qubits and the system's model parameters. These results are interpreted in terms of the influence of energy transitions on the range and the number of QFI peaks as a function of temperature. This study highlights the potential of the probe qubit-ancilla chain system as a powerful and precise tool for quantum thermometry in the ultralow temperature regime.

Title: Measurement of the work statistics of an open quantum system using a quantum computer
Authors: Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Michele Campisi
Abstract: We report on the experimental measurement of the work statistics of a genuinely open quantum system using a quantum computer. Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by extending the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transitions frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.

Title: Evaluating many-body stabilizer Rényi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic
Authors: Yi-Ming Ding, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. Physically, we first separate the free energy contribution in $2$-SRE. At quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the characteristic function contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, by analyzing the volume-law correction of magic, which represents nonlocal magic residing in correlations, we find that its discontinuity is bound to critical properties and would be more useful than the full-state magic. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.

Title: Transient Dynamics and Homogenization in Incoherent Collision Models
Authors: Göktuğ Karpat, Barış Çakmak
Abstract: Collision models have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their versatility to simulate open quantum systems in different dynamical regimes. They have been used to study various interesting phenomena such as the dynamical emergence of non-Markovian memory effects and the spontaneous establishment of synchronization in open quantum systems. In such models, the repeated pairwise interactions between the system and the environment and also the possible coupling between different environmental units are typically modeled using the coherent partial-swap (PSWAP) operation as it is known to be a universal homogenizer. In this study, we investigate the dynamical behavior of incoherent collision models, where the interactions between different units are modeled by the incoherent controlled-swap (CSWAP) operation, which is also a universal homogenizer. Even though the asymptotic dynamics of the open system in case of both coherent and incoherent swap interactions appear to be identical, its transient dynamics turns out to be significantly different. Here we present a comparative analysis of the consequences of having coherent or incoherent couplings in collision models, namely, PSWAP or CSWAP interactions respectively, for the emergence of memory effects for a single qubit system and for the onset synchronization between a pair of qubits, both of which are strictly determined by the transient dynamics of the open system.

Title: Noise-resilient solid host for electron qubits above 100 mK
Authors: Xinhao Li, Christopher S. Wang, Brennan Dizdar, Yizhong Huang, Yutian Wen, Wei Guo, Xufeng Zhang, Xu Han, Xianjing Zhou, Dafei Jin
Abstract: Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid host for single electron qubits. At ~10 mK temperatures, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have exhibited exceptionally long coherence times and high operation fidelities. To advance this platform towards a scalable quantum information architecture, systematic characterization of its noise feature is imperative. Here, we show the remarkable resilience of solid neon against charge and thermal noises when eNe qubits are operated away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimizing neon growth, the measured charge (voltage) noise on solid neon is already orders of magnitude lower than that in most stringently grown semiconductors, rivaling the best records to date. Up to 400 mK, the eNe charge qubits operated at ~5 GHz can maintain their echo coherence times over 1 microsecond. These observations highlight solid neon as an ideal host for quantum information processing at higher temperatures and larger scales.

Title: Rapid-stable Collective Charging and Reverse Suppressing in Many-Body Quantum Batteries
Authors: Shun-Cai Zhao, Yi-Fan Yang, Zi-Ran Zhao
Abstract: Two major challenges in the process of practical development of quantum batteries (QBs) are: how to achieve rapid-stable charging, i.e., the maximum extractable work quantified via ergotropy, and how to identify the reverse mechanism of rapid-stable charging and propose contrary control strategies in many-body quantum systems. This work proposes a strongly coupled many-body collective charging QB scheme interacting with the surrounding environment, analyzes its physical operating mechanisms as a battery system, explores the mechanisms for achieving fast and stable collective charging under strong environmental coupling, and provides a detailed analysis of various physical methods for suppressing the reverse mechanism. This work highlights the novel properties of many-body QB systems and advances the physical research needed to accelerate the practical application of QBs.

Title: Towards identifying possible fault-tolerant advantage of quantum linear system algorithms in terms of space, time and energy
Authors: Yue Tu, Mark Dubynskyi, Mohammadhossein Mohammadisiahroudi, Ekaterina Riashchentceva, Jinglei Cheng, Dmitry Ryashchentsev, Tamás Terlaky, Junyu Liu
Abstract: Quantum computing, a prominent non-Von Neumann paradigm beyond Moore's law, can offer superpolynomial speedups for certain problems. Yet its advantages in efficiency for tasks like machine learning remain under investigation, and quantum noise complicates resource estimations and classical comparisons. We provide a detailed estimation of space, time, and energy resources for fault-tolerant superconducting devices running the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, a quantum linear system solver relevant to linear algebra and machine learning. Excluding memory and data transfer, possible quantum advantages over the classical conjugate gradient method could emerge at $N \approx 2^{33} \sim 2^{48}$ or even lower, requiring ${O}(10^5)$ physical qubits, ${O}(10^{12}\sim10^{13})$ Joules, and ${O}(10^6)$ seconds under surface code fault-tolerance with three types of magic state distillation (15-1, 116-12, 225-1). Key parameters include condition number, sparsity, and precision $\kappa, s\approx{O}(10\sim100)$, $\epsilon\sim0.01$, and physical error $10^{-5}$. Our resource estimator adjusts $N, \kappa, s, \epsilon$, providing a map of quantum-classical boundaries and revealing where a practical quantum advantage may arise. Our work quantitatively determine how advanced a fault-tolerant quantum computer should be to achieve possible, significant benefits on problems related to real-world.

Title: Machine Learning for Detecting Steering in Qutrit-Pair States
Authors: Pu Wang, Zhongyan Li, Huixian Meng
Abstract: Only a few states in high-dimensional systems can be identified as (un)steerable using existing theoretical or experimental methods. We utilize semidefinite programming (SDP) to construct a dataset for steerability detection in qutrit-qutrit systems. For the full-information feature $F_1$, artificial neural networks achieve high classification accuracy and generalization, and preform better than the support vector machine. As feature engineering playing a pivotal role, we introduce a steering ellipsoid-like feature $F_2$, which significantly enhances the performance of each of our models. Given the SDP method provides only a sufficient condition for steerability detection, we establish the first rigorously constructed, accurately labeled dataset based on theoretical foundations. This dataset enables models to exhibit outstanding accuracy and generalization capabilities, independent of the choice of features. As applications, we investigate the steerability boundaries of isotropic states and partially entangled states, and find new steerable states. This work not only advances the application of machine learning for probing quantum steerability in high-dimensional systems but also deepens the theoretical understanding of quantum steerability itself.

Title: Noncontextual ontological models of operational probabilistic theories
Authors: Sina Soltani, Marco Erba, David Schmid, John H. Selby
Abstract: An experiment or theory is classically explainable if it can be reproduced by some noncontextual ontological model. In this work, we adapt the notion of ontological models and generalized noncontextuality so it applies to the framework of operational probabilistic theories (OPTs). A defining feature of quotiented OPTs, which sets them apart from the closely related framework of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), is their explicit specification of the structure of instruments, these being generalizations of $\textit{quantum instruments}$ (including nondestructive measurements); in particular, one needs to explicitly declare which collections of transformations constitute a valid instrument. We are particularly interested in strongly causal OPTs, in which the choice of a future instrument can be conditioned on a past measurement outcome. This instrument structure might seem to permit the possibility of a contextual kind of ontological representation, where the representation of a given transformation depends on which instrument it is considered a part of. However, we prove that this is not possible by showing that for strongly causal quotiented OPTs the structure of instruments does $\textit{not}$ allow for such a contextual ontological representation. It follows that ontological representations of strongly causal quotiented OPTs are entirely determined by their action on individual transformations, with no dependence on the structure of instruments.

Title: Aharonov-Bohm magnetism and Landau diamagnetism in semimetals
Authors: Eugene B. Kolomeisky, Joseph P. Straley
Abstract: We compute the magnetic response of hollow semimetal cylinders and rings to the presence of an axial Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux, in the absence of interactions. We predict nullification of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for a class of dispersion laws that includes "non-relativistic" dispersion and demonstrate that at zero flux the ground-state of a very short "armchair" graphene tube will exhibit a ferromagnetic broken symmetry. We also compute the diamagnetic response of bulk semimetals to the presence of a uniform magnetic field, specifically predicting that the susceptibility has a logarithmic dependence on the size of the sample.

Title: Information Theoretical Approach to Detecting Quantum Gravitational Corrections
Authors: Behnam Pourhassan, Xiaoping Shi, Salman Sajad Wani, Saif-Al-Khawari, Farideh Kazemian, İzzet Sakallı, Naveed Ahmad Shah, Mir Faizal
Abstract: One way to test quantum gravitational corrections is through black hole physics. In this paper, We investigate the scales at which quantum gravitational corrections can be detected in a black hole using information theory. This is done by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence for the probability distributions obtained from the Parikh-Wilczek formalism. We observe that the quantum gravitational corrections increase the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the mass of the black hole decreases, which is expected as quantum gravitational corrections can be neglected for larger black holes. However, we further observe that after a certain critical value, quantum gravitational corrections tend to decrease again as the mass of the black hole decreases. To understand the reason behind this behavior, we explicitly obtain Fisher information about such quantum gravitational corrections and find that it also increases as the mass decreases, but again, after a critical value, it decreases. This is because at such a scale, quantum fluctuations dominate the system and we lose information about the system. We obtain these results for higher-dimensional black holes and observe this behavior for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information depending on the dimensions of the black hole. These results can quantify the scale dependence and dimension dependence of the difficulty in detecting quantum gravitational corrections.

Title: $ϕ^n$ trajectory bootstrap
Authors: Wenliang Li
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.

Title: Anatomy of Higher-Order Non-Hermitian Skin and Boundary Modes
Authors: Fan Yang, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that Amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for the surface gaps of boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.

Title: Quantum control of ion-atom collisions beyond the ultracold regime
Authors: Maks Z. Walewski, Matthew D. Frye, Or Katz, Meirav Pinkas, Roee Ozeri, Michał Tomza
Abstract: Tunable scattering resonances are crucial for controlling atomic and molecular systems. However, their use has so far been limited to ultracold temperatures. These conditions remain hard to achieve for most hybrid trapped ion-atom systems -- a prospective platform for quantum technologies and fundamental research. Here we measure inelastic collision probabilities for ${\text{Sr}^++\text{Rb}}$ and use them to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. Our theoretical results, compared with experimental observations, confirm that quantum interference effects persist to the multiple-partial-wave regime, leading to the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates. Using our model, we go beyond interference and identify a rich spectrum of Feshbach resonances at moderate magnetic fields with the Rb atom in its lower ($f=1$) hyperfine state, which persist at temperatures as high as 1 mK. Future observation of these predicted resonances should allow precise control of the short-range dynamics in ${\text{Sr}^+}+{\text{Rb}}$ collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.

Title: DanceQ: High-performance library for number-conserving bases
Authors: Robin Schäfer, David J. Luitz
Abstract: The complexity of quantum many-body problems scales exponentially with the size of the system, rendering any finite size scaling analysis a formidable challenge. This is particularly true for methods based on the full representation of the wave function, where one simply accepts the enormous Hilbert space dimensions and performs linear algebra operations, e.g., for finding the ground state of the Hamiltonian. If the system satisfies an underlying symmetry where an operator with degenerate spectrum commutes with the Hamiltonian, it can be block-diagonalized, thus reducing the complexity at the expense of additional bookkeeping. At the most basic level, required for Krylov space techniques (like the Lanczos algorithm) it is necessary to implement a matrix-vector product of a block of the Hamiltonian with arbitrary block-wavefunctions, potentially without holding the Hamiltonian block in memory. An efficient implementation of this operation requires the calculation of the position of an arbitrary basis vector in the canonical ordering of the basis of the block. We present here an elegant and powerful, multi-dimensional approach to this problem for the $U(1)$ symmetry appearing in problems with particle number conservation. Our divide-and-conquer algorithm uses multiple subsystems and hence generalizes previous approaches to make them scalable. In addition to the theoretical presentation of our algorithm, we provide DanceQ, a flexible and modern - header only - C++20 implementation to manipulate, enumerate, and map to its index any basis state in a given particle number sector as open source software under this https URL.

Title: Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic clustering through interaction-induced caging
Authors: Mengjie Yang, Luqi Yuan, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and opens new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.

Authors: Valla Fatemi, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Anton R. Akhmerov, Bernard van Heck
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.

Title: Quenched large deviations of Birkhoff sums along random quantum measurements
Authors: Renaud Raquépas, Jeffrey Schenker
Abstract: We prove a quenched version of the large deviation principle for Birkhoff-like sums along a sequence of random quantum measurements driven by an ergodic process. We apply the result to the study of entropy production in the two-time measurement framework.

Title: Quantum tomography from the evolution of a single expectation
Authors: Hjalmar Rall, Michael M. Wolf
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of performing full quantum tomography based on the homogeneous time evolution of a single expectation value. Remarkably, every non-trivial binary measurement evolved by any quantum channel, except for a null set, in principle enables full quantum state tomography. We show that this remains true when restricted to Lindblad semigroups, although unitary evolution -- even with added simply depolarizing noise -- is insufficient beyond the qubit case, highlighting the necessity of non-trivial noise. We establish an analog of Takens' embedding theorem for quantum channels, which incorporates prior information into the framework. We also provide estimation bounds for finite statistics and analyze the feasibility of recovering an infinite time series of expectation values from a finite one using only spectral properties of the evolution.

Title: Effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation on relativistic neutral scalar bosons: Scattering and bound states
Authors: Luis B. Castro, Antonio S. de Castro
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on a relativistic neutral scalar boson within the framework of the Klein-Gordon formalism. We consider a tensor $(K_F)_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ out of the Standard Model Extension, which describes the field configuration consisting of a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}=B\hat{z}$ and a cylindrical electric field $\vec{E}=\frac{\lambda}{r}\hat{r}$. We analyze and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the equation of motion and show that the presence of a specific Lorentz symmetry violation parameter is essential to obtain analytical solutions for scattering and bound states. Employing the partial wave approach in cylindrical coordinates, we calculate the relativistic phase shift, scattering amplitude and $S$-matrix, and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the phase shift. Furthermore, we obtain bound-state solutions by examining the poles of the $S$-matrix and compare our findings with those reported in the literature. Our results reveal that bound-state solutions are only feasible for a restrict range of Lorentz symmetry violation parameters, which contradict previous studies.

Title: Singularity and universality from von Neumann to Rényi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains
Authors: Jianyu Wang, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan, Congjun Wu
Abstract: The Rényi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as the Rényi index $n \to 1$ is often believed to yield the von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, earlier findings indicate that this process exhibits a singularity for the colored Motzkin spin chain problem, leading to different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and Rényi entropies, respectively. Our analytical and numerical calculations confirm this transition, which can be explained by the exponentially increasing density of states in the entanglement spectrum that we extract numerically. Disorder operators are further employed under various symmetries to study such a system. Both analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the scaling of the disorder operators also follows $\log{l}$ as the leading behavior, matching that of the Rényi entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant shared by both the Rényi entropies and disorder operators. This universal constant could potentially help capture the underlying constraint physics of Motzkin walks.
