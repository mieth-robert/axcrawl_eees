Title: Spin squeezing in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
Authors: Weijie Wu, Emily J. Davis, Lillian B. Hughes, Bingtian Ye, Zilin Wang, Dominik Kufel, Tasuku Ono, Simon A. Meynell, Maxwell Block, Che Liu, Haopu Yang, Ania C. Bleszynski Jayich, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: Spin squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement. Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.

Title: Optimal and efficient qubit routing for quantum simulation
Authors: Joris Kattem√∂lle, Guido Burkard
Abstract: Quantum simulation promises new discoveries in physics, yet on most platforms its progress is limited by device connectivity constraints. Although SWAP gates can be inserted, their use increases circuit depth, which cannot be tolerated on current quantum computers and increases computational cost on fault-tolerant devices. Therefore, minimizing SWAP overhead is crucial, which, however, leads to a computational problem that is itself intractable. We establish a framework for analyzing spatiotemporally periodic circuits, which naturally occur in the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems and lattice gauge theories. We introduce and implement a method that leverages this framework to efficiently minimize SWAP overhead. It has a significant scaling advantage, outperforming leading general-purpose approaches by several orders of magnitude even for moderate system sizes. Remarkably, we find solutions with no SWAP overhead, opening the door for current quantum computers to explore geometrically frustrated magnetism.

Title: Interacting non-Hermitian edge and cluster bursts on a digital quantum processor
Authors: Jin Ming Koh, Wen-Tan Xue, Tommy Tai, Dax Enshan Koh, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: A lossy quantum system harboring the non-Hermitian skin effect can in certain conditions exhibit anomalously high loss at the boundaries of the system compared to the bulk, a phenomenon termed the non-Hermitian edge burst. We uncover interacting many-body extensions of the edge burst that are spatially extended and patterned, as well as cluster bursts that occur away from boundaries. Owing to the methodological difficulty and overhead of accurately realizing non-Hermitian dynamical evolution, much less tunable interactions, few experimental avenues in studying the single-particle edge burst have been reported to date and none for many-body variants. We overcome these roadblocks in this study, and present a realization of edge and cluster bursts in an interacting quantum ladder model on a superconducting quantum processor. We utilize a time-stepping algorithm, which implements time-evolution by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians by composing a linear combination of unitaries scheme and product formulae, to assess long-time behavior of the system. We observe signatures of the non-Hermitian edge burst on up to 64 unit cells, and detect the closing of the dissipative gap, a necessary condition for the edge burst, by probing the imaginary spectrum of the system. In suitable interacting regimes, we identify the emergence of spatial patterning and cluster bursts. Beyond establishing these generalized forms of edge burst phenomena, our study paves the way for digital quantum processors to be harnessed as a versatile platform for non-Hermitian condensed-matter physics.

Title: Signal amplification in a solid-state quantum sensor via asymmetric time-reversal of many-body dynamics
Authors: Haoyang Gao, Leigh S. Martin, Lillian B. Hughes, Nathaniel T. Leitao, Piotr Put, Hengyun Zhou, Nazli U. Koyluoglu, Simon A. Meynell, Ania C. Bleszynski Jayich, Hongkun Park, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: Electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond constitute a promising system for micro- and nano-scale magnetic sensing, due to their operation under ambient conditions, ease of placement in close proximity to sensing targets, and biological compatibility. At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits but can also potentially enhance sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room temperature quantum sensor. Our approach utilizes time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering in a two-dimensional ensemble of NV centers. Strikingly, we observe that the optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opening the door towards entanglement-enhanced practical quantum sensing.

Title: Discrete-to-Continuum Approach for the Analytic Continuation of One-Particle Propagator on the Circle
Authors: Andrea Stampiggi
Abstract: Despite the simplicity of one-particle dynamics, explicit expressions for the one-dimensional propagator on a circle suitable to numerical evaluation are surprisingly lacking -- not only in the presence of potentials but even in the free case. Using a lattice regularization of the circle, we derive finite expressions for the free discrete propagator through an algebraic approach, aiming to provide physical insight into the readout of a digital quantum simulation. Moreover, these expressions allow for the reconstruction of the propagator in the continuous circle limit, which exhibits in the free case a peculiar non-analytic behavior in its transition between irrational and rational times. The latter propagator yields a finite analytic continuation of the corresponding elliptic theta function at the locus of essential singularities for real times, achieved through the introduction of a $\sigma$ distribution -- the ``square-root'' of the Dirac delta. We also show that the well-known infinite line limit is consistently recovered within this approach. In addition, we apply these results by studying numerically the dynamics of wave packets in cosine and random potentials. At early simulation times, we observe evidence of the semi-classical limit, where the probability density maximum follows the minimum of the propagator phase.

Title: Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities
Authors: Yahui Li, Pablo Sala, Frank Pollmann, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei Motrunich
Abstract: Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.

Title: Optimal control over the full counting statistics in a non-adiabatic pump
Authors: Fran√ßois Impens (IF/UFRJ), Felippo M. D'Angelis (IF/UFRJ), David Gu√©ry-Odelin (LCAR/UPS), Felipe A. Pinheiro (IF/UFRJ), Caio Lewenkopf (IF/UFRJ)
Abstract: We introduce a systematic procedure based on optimal control theory to address the full counting statistics of particle transport in a stochastic system. Our approach enhances the performance of a Thouless pump in the non-adiabatic regime by simultaneously optimizing the average pumping rate while minimizing noise. We demonstrate our optimization procedure on a paradigmatic model for the electronic transport through a quantum dot, both in the limit of vanishing Coulomb interaction and in the interacting regime. Our method enables independent control of the moments associated with charge and spin transfer, allowing for the enhancement of spin current with minimal charge current or the independent tuning of spin and charge fluctuations. These results underscore the versatility of our approach, which can be applied to a broad class of stochastic systems.

Title: Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures
Authors: D. Bafia, B. Abdisatarov, R. Pilipenko, Y. Lu, G. Eremeev, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10~mK and at 6~GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6~GHz niobium cavity at 10~mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $>$100~mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$~10~mG limits $Q_0\sim$~10\textsuperscript{10}, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1>$~1~s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Scaling our findings to typical transmon qubit dimensions suggests that these 2-D structures could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds~mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.

Title: Protected phase gate for the $0$-$œÄ$ qubit using its internal modes
Authors: Xanda C Kolesnikow, Thomas B Smith, Felix Thomsen, Abhijeet A Alase, Andrew C Doherty
Abstract: Protected superconducting qubits such as the $0$-$\pi$ qubit promise to substantially reduce physical error rates through a multi-mode encoding. This protection comes at the cost of controllability, as standard techniques for quantum gates are ineffective. We propose a protected phase gate for the $0$-$\pi$ qubit that utilises an internal mode of the circuit as an ancilla. The gate is achieved by varying the qubit-ancilla coupling via a tunable Josephson element. Our scheme is a modified version of a protected gate proposed by Brooks, Kitaev and Preskill that uses an external oscillator as an ancilla. We find that our scheme is compatible with the protected regime of the $0$-$\pi$ qubit, and does not suffer from spurious coupling to additional modes of the $0$-$\pi$ circuit. Through numerical simulations, we study how the gate error scales with the circuit parameters of the $0$-$\pi$ qubit and the tunable Josephson element that enacts the gate.

Title: State preparation with parallel-sequential circuits
Authors: Zhi-Yuan Wei, Daniel Malz
Abstract: We introduce parallel-sequential (PS) circuits, a family of quantum circuit layouts that interpolate between brickwall and sequential circuits, which introduces control parameters governing the ratio of over the amount of entanglement and the maximum correlation distance they can express. We provide numerical evidence that PS circuits can efficiently prepare many-body ground states in one dimension. On noisy devices, characterized through both idling errors and two-qubit gate errors, we show that in a wide parameter regime, PS circuits outperform brickwall, sequential, and log-depth circuits from [Malz, Styliaris, Wei, Cirac, PRL 132, 040404 (2024)]. Additionally, we demonstrate that properly chosen noisy random PS circuits suppress error proliferation and, when employed as a variational ansatz, exhibit superior trainability.

Title: Heuristic and Optimal Synthesis of CNOT and Clifford Circuits
Authors: Mark Webster, Stergios Koutsioumpas, Dan E Browne
Abstract: Efficiently implementing Clifford circuits is crucial for quantum error correction and quantum algorithms. Linear reversible circuits, equivalent to circuits composed of CNOT gates, have important applications in classical computing. In this work we present methods for CNOT and general Clifford circuit synthesis which can be used to minimise either the entangling two-qubit gate count or the circuit depth. We present three families of algorithms - optimal synthesis which works on small circuits, A* synthesis for intermediate-size circuits and greedy synthesis for large circuits. We benchmark against existing methods in the literature and show that our approach results in circuits with lower two-qubit gate count than previous methods. The algorithms have been implemented in a GitHub repository for use by the classical and quantum computing community.

Title: Energy-time and time-bin entanglement: past, present and future
Authors: Guilherme B. Xavier, Jan-√Öke Larsson, Paolo Villoresi, Giuseppe Vallone, Ad√°n Cabello
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a fundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical discussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was proposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the generation time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum entanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise to the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many real-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have radically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were proposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after device-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of ultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of energy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our understanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the way down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will then point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time and time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel protocols based on nonlocality.

Title: Scalability Challenges in Variational Quantum Optimization under Stochastic Noise
Authors: Adelina B√§rligea, Benedikt Poggel, Jeanette Miriam Lorenz
Abstract: With rapid advances in quantum hardware, a key question is whether quantum devices without full error correction can outperform classical computers on practically relevant problems. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained significant attention as promising candidates in this pursuit, particularly for combinatorial optimization problems. While reports of their challenges and limitations continue to accumulate, many studies still convey optimism based on small-scale toy problems and idealized testing setups. However, doubts remain about the scalability of VQAs and hence their viability for real-world problems. We systematically investigate this scaling behavior by analyzing how state-of-the-art classical optimizers minimize well-behaved quantum loss functions for random QUBO problem instances. Special emphasis is placed on how these algorithms handle uncertainties, modeled as effective Gaussian noise. Our findings reveal that the critical noise threshold, beyond which classical optimizers fail to find optimal or near-optimal solutions, decreases rapidly with system size. This effect exceeds what can be attributed to barren plateaus, indicating more fundamental limitations inherent to the hybrid paradigm of VQAs. When translating this threshold to the finite sampling error permissible in a fault-tolerant scenario, the required number of measurement shots becomes prohibitively high, even for medium-sized problems. These results raise serious doubts about the feasibility of achieving a practical quantum advantage in optimization using VQAs. Instead, they highlight the urgent need to explore fundamentally different algorithms and problem domains that can overcome the reported scalability challenges.

Title: Scalable low loss cryogenic packaging of quantum memories in CMOS-foundry processed photonic chips
Authors: Robert Bernson, Alex Witte, Genevieve Clark, Kamil Gradkowski, Jeffrey Yang, Matt Saha, Matthew Zimmermann, Andrew Leenheer, Kevin Chen, Gerald Gilbert, Matt Eichenfield, Dirk Englund, Peter O'Brien
Abstract: Optically linked solid-state quantum memories such as color centers in diamond are a promising platform for distributed quantum information processing and networking. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have emerged as a crucial enabling technology for these systems, integrating quantum memories with efficient electrical and optical interfaces in a compact and scalable platform. Packaging these hybrid chips into deployable modules while maintaining low optical loss and resiliency to temperature cycling is a central challenge to their practical use. We demonstrate a packaging method for PICs using surface grating couplers and angle-polished fiber arrays that is robust to temperature cycling, offers scalable channel count, applies to a wide variety of PIC platforms and wavelengths, and offers pathways to automated high-throughput packaging. Using this method, we show optically and electrically packaged quantum memory modules integrating all required qubit controls on chip, operating at millikelvin temperatures with < 3dB losses achievable from fiber to quantum memory.

Title: Distribution and Purification of Entanglement States in Quantum Networks
Authors: Xiaojie Fan, Yukun Yang, Himanshu Gupta, C.R. Ramakrishnan
Abstract: We consider problems of distributing high-fidelity entangled states across nodes of a quantum network. We consider a repeater-based network architecture with entanglement swapping (fusion) operations for generating long-distance entanglements, and purification operations that produce high-fidelity states from several lower-fidelity states. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, while there have been several works on fidelity-aware routing and incorporating purification into routing for generating EPs, this paper presents the first algorithms for optimal solutions to the high-fidelity EP distribution problem. We provide a dynamic programming algorithm for generating the optimal tree of operations to produce a high-fidelity EP, and an LP-based algorithm for generating an optimal collection of trees. Second, following the EP algorithms, this paper presents the first algorithms for the high-fidelity GHZ-state distribution problem and characterizes its optimality. We evaluate our techniques via simulations over NetSquid, a quantum network simulator.

Title: Active Leakage Cancellation in Single Qubit Gates
Authors: Ben Chiaro, Yaxing Zhang
Abstract: The ability to perform fast and accurate rotations between the computational basis states of quantum bits is one of the most fundamental requirements for building a quantum computer. Because physical qubits generally contain more than two levels, faster gates often result in a higher leakage rate outside of the computational space. In this letter, we enhance the state-of-the-art single qubit gate by introducing active leakage cancellation. This is accomplished via a second drive tone near the leakage transition such that we cancel the leakage caused by the main drive. Furthermore, we describe a measurement sequence that can be used to calibrate the parameters of this leakage cancellation drive. Finally, we apply the technique to superconducting transmon qubits, suppressing the leakage below the $10^{-5}$ level, and achieving coherence-limited gate infidelity of $7.5\times 10^{-5}$, for a 10 ns $\pi/2$ gate and 196 MHz qubit anharmonicity.

Title: Polarization-dependent topology in quantum emitter chains
Authors: Jonathan Sturm, Adriana P√°lffy
Abstract: The role of polarization in the topology of quantum emitter chains is investigated theoretically, whereby "polarization" refers to the transition dipole moments of the emitters. We show that, if the chain is zigzag-shaped, different topological phases can be realized by adjusting the polarization direction. It turns out that long-range dipole-dipole couplings weaken the bulk-boundary correspondence, but on the other hand give rise to higher-order topological phases with four observable edge modes. We also demonstrate how the polarization orientation can be used to define an additional dimension and simulate a synthetic Chern insulator. Our findings open up a way to actively switch between various topological phases within a single arrangement of quantum emitters.

Title: Solovay Kitaev and Randomized Compilation

Abstract: We analyze the use of the Solovay Kitaev (SK) algorithm to generate an ensemble of one qubit rotations over which to perform randomized compilation. We perform simulations to compare the trace distance between the quantum state resulting from an ideal one qubit RZ rotation and discrete SK decompositions. We find that this simple randomized gate synthesis algorithm can reduce the approximation error of these rotations in the absence of quantum noise by at least a factor of two. We test the technique under the effects of a simple coherent noise model and find that it can mitigate coherent noise. We also run our algorithm on Sandia National Laboratories' QSCOUT trapped-ion device and find that randomization is able to help in the presence of realistic noise sources.

Title: Consensus About Classical Reality in a Quantum Universe
Authors: Akram Touil, Bin Yan, Wojciech H. Zurek
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism recognizes that decoherence imprints redundant records of preferred quasi-classical pointer states on the environment. These redundant records are then accessed by observers. We show how redundancy enables and even implies consensus between observers who use fragments of that decohering environment to acquire information about systems of interest. We quantify consensus using information-theoretic measures that employ mutual information to assess the correlation between the records available to observers from distinct -- hence, independently accessible -- fragments of the environment. We prove that when these fragments have enough information about a system, observers that access them will attribute the same pointer state to that system. Thus, those who know enough about the system agree about what they know. We then test proposed measures of consensus in a solvable model of decoherence as well as in numerical simulations of a many-body system. These results provide detailed understanding of how our classical everyday world arises from within the fundamentally quantum Universe we inhabit.

Title: Tracking time-varying signals with quantum-enhanced atomic magnetometers
Authors: Julia Amoros-Binefa, Morgan W. Mitchell, Jan Kolodynski
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic instruments to static or slowly-varying quantities. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis methods, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically-important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry (SPM). Here we adapt estimation control techniques introduced in arXiv:2403.14764(2024) to the experimental setting of SPM and analogous techniques. We demonstrate that real-time tracking of fluctuating fields benefits from measurement-induced spin-squeezing and that quantum limits dictated by decoherence are within reach of today's experiments. We illustrate this quantum advantage by single-shot tracking, within the coherence time of a spin-precession magnetometer, of a magnetocardiography signal overlain with broadband noise.

Title: 2D transmons with lifetimes and coherence times exceeding 1 millisecond
Authors: Matthew P. Bland, Faranak Bahrami, Jeronimo G. C. Martinez, Paal H. Prestegaard, Basil M. Smitham, Atharv Joshi, Elizabeth Hedrick, Alex Pakpour-Tabrizi, Shashwat Kumar, Apoorv Jindal, Ray D. Chang, Ambrose Yang, Guangming Cheng, Nan Yao, Robert J. Cava, Nathalie P. de Leon, Andrew A. Houck
Abstract: Materials improvements are a powerful approach to reducing loss and decoherence in superconducting qubits because such improvements can be readily translated to large scale processors. Recent work improved transmon coherence by utilizing tantalum (Ta) as a base layer and sapphire as a substrate. The losses in these devices are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) with comparable contributions from both the surface and bulk dielectrics, indicating that both must be tackled to achieve major improvements in the state of the art. Here we show that replacing the substrate with high-resistivity silicon (Si) dramatically decreases the bulk substrate loss, enabling 2D transmons with time-averaged quality factors (Q) exceeding 1.5 x 10^7, reaching a maximum Q of 2.5 x 10^7, corresponding to a lifetime (T_1) of up to 1.68 ms. This low loss allows us to observe decoherence effects related to the Josephson junction, and we use improved, low-contamination junction deposition to achieve Hahn echo coherence times (T_2E) exceeding T_1. We achieve these material improvements without any modifications to the qubit architecture, allowing us to readily incorporate standard quantum control gates. We demonstrate single qubit gates with 99.994% fidelity. The Ta-on-Si platform comprises a simple material stack that can potentially be fabricated at wafer scale, and therefore can be readily translated to large-scale quantum processors.

Title: High-rate continuous-variable quantum key distribution over 100 km fiber with composable security
Authors: Heng Wang, Yang Li, Ting Ye, Li Ma, Yan Pan, Mingze Wu, Junhui Li, Yiming Bian, Yaodi Pi, Yun Shao, Jie Yang, Jinlu Liu, Ao Sun, Wei Huang, Stefano Pirandola, Yichen Zhang, Bingjie Xu
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD), providing a way to generate secret keys with information-theoretic security,is arguably one of the most significant achievements in quantum information. The continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) offers the potential advantage of achieving a higher secret key rate (SKR) within a metro area, as well as being compatible with the mature telecom industry. However, the SKR and transmission distance of state-of-the-art CV-QKD systems are currently limited. Here, based on the novelly proposed orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) CV-QKD protocol, we demonstrate for the first time a high-rate multi-carrier (MC) CV-QKD with a 10 GHz symbol rate that chieves Gbps SKR within 10km and Mbps SKR over 100 km in the finite-size regime under composable security against collective attacks. The record-breaking results are achieved by suitable optimization of subcarrier number and modulation variance, well-controlled excess noise induced by both OFDM mechanism and efficient DSP scheme, and high-performance post-processing capacity realized by heterogeneous computing scheme. The composable finite-size SKR reaches 1779.45 Mbps@5km, 1025.49 Mbps@10km, 370.50 Mbps@25km, 99.93 Mbps@50km, 25.70 Mbps@75km,and 2.25 Mbps@100km, which improves the SKR by two orders of magnitude and quintuples the maximal transmission distance compared to most recently reported CV-QKD results [Nature Communications, 13, 4740 (2022)]. Interestingly, it is experimentally verified that the SKR of the proposed MC CV-QKD can approach five times larger than that of the single-carrier CV-QKD with the same symbol rate without additional hardware costs. Our work constitutes a critical step towards future high-speed quantum metropolitan and access networks.

Title: High-rate discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution with composable security
Authors: Mingze Wu, Yan Pan, Junhui Li, Heng Wang, Lu Fan, Yun Shao, Yang Li, Wei Huang, Song Yu, Bingjie Xu, Yichen Zhang
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution holds the potential to generate high secret key rates, making it a prime candidate for high-rate metropolitan quantum network applications. However, despite these promising opportunities, the realization of high-rate continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems with composable security remains an elusive goal. Here, we report a discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system with a composable secret key rate of 18.93 Mbps against collective attacks over a 25 km fiber channel. This record breaking rate is achieved through the probability shaped 16QAM-modulated protocol, which employs semidefinite programming to ensure its composable security. Furthermore, we have employed a fully digital and precise quantum signal processing technique to reduce excess noise to extremely low levels, thereby facilitating efficient broadband system operation. While ensuring low complexity and cost,our system achieves a performance advantage of over an order of magnitude compared to previous continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems, providing a promising solution for future deployment of quantum key distribution.

Title: Design of Quantum Stream Cipher: Part-I -Lifting the Shannon Impossibility Theorem-
Authors: Osamu Hirota
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the late Professor H.P. Yuen in commemoration to our 50-year friendship. He invented the concept of quantum stream cipher. It is designed based on a completely different concept from conventional ciphers. The purpose of this cipher is to provide information-theoretic security of long data and secret key with short key length. It is based on hiding the ciphertext of mathematical cipher with quantum noise, achieving unprecedented information-theoretic security in any cipher. The protocol corresponds to randomizing the ciphertext by means of differentiating the receiving performance of Bob with key and Eve without key according to the principle of quantum communication theory. In this paper, we introduce some progress on the specific method to develop from the standard type to generalized quantum stream cipher (Quantum Enigma Cipher). There are two methods for generalization. One is the additional randomization method by the product cipher form and the other is the M-th order extended quantum coding method. Here we discuss the former. The results proved that it has sufficient information-theoretic security against known plaintext attack on key in comparison with quantum data locking. The latter method will be reported in Part II.

Title: Waveguide QED with dissipative light-matter couplings
Authors: Xing-Liang Dong, Peng-Bo Li, Zongping Gong, Franco Nori
Abstract: Dissipative light-matter coupling plays a vital role in non-Hermitian physics, but it remains largely unexplored in waveguide QED systems. In this work, we find that by employing pseudo-Hermitian symmetry rather than anti-PT symmetry, the concept of dissipative coupling could be generalized and applied to the field of waveguide QED. This leads to a series of intriguing results, such as spontaneous breaking of pseudo-Hermitian symmetry across the exceptional points (EPs), level attraction between the bound states, and critical transition across the EPs for the population of quantum emitters in the bound state. Thanks to the tunability of photonic bands in crystal waveguides, we also demonstrate that dissipative light-matter coupling leads to the emergence of nonstandard third-order exceptional points with chiral spatial profiles in a topological waveguide QED system. This work provides a promising paradigm for studying non-Hermitian quantum phenomena in waveguide QED systems.

Title: Skyrmionic SU(6) structured light
Authors: Shinichi Saito
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological quasi-particles characterised by local spin textures, which are considered to be robust against structural deformation. N√©el and Bloch states are famous examples of skyrmions, which exhibit radical and chiral spin profiles, respectively. Here, we show a skyrmion can be continuously transformed to an antiskyrmion or various other forms of skymions through underlying symmetry of special unitary group of degree six, SU(6), for photons with spin and orbital angular momentum. We employ a Lie group theory for coherent photons to describe the SU(6) transformation and establish a relationship between the generator of rotation and its expectation values on a hypersphere of $\mathbb{S}^{35}$. We propose a simple experimental setup to control the SU(6) states in combinations with wave-plates and vortex lenses to realise the generalised Euler's formula physically in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We show skyrmionic states are described on higher-order Poincar'e spheres together with a recently proposed skyrmionic torus.

Title: Logical entanglement distribution between distant 2D array qubits
Authors: Yuya Maeda, Yasunari Suzuki, Toshiki Kobayashi, Takashi Yamamoto, Yuuki Tokunaga, Keisuke Fujii
Abstract: Sharing logical entangled pairs between distant quantum nodes is a key process to achieve fault tolerant quantum computation and communication. However, there is a gap between current experimental specifications and theoretical requirements for sharing logical entangled states while improving experimental techniques. Here, we propose an efficient logical entanglement distribution protocol based on surface codes for two distant 2D qubit array with nearest-neighbor interaction. A notable feature of our protocol is that it allows post-selection according to error estimations, which provides the tunability between the infidelity of logical entanglements and the success probability of the protocol. With this feature, the fidelity of encoded logical entangled states can be improved by sacrificing success rates. We numerically evaluated the performance of our protocol and the trade-off relationship, and found that our protocol enables us to prepare logical entangled states while improving fidelity in feasible experimental parameters. We also discuss a possible physical implementation using neutral atom arrays to show the feasibility of our protocol.

Title: A heralded single-photon source implemented with second-order nonlinear photonic crystals
Authors: Hiroo Azuma
Abstract: We study implementing a heralded single-photon source with second-order nonlinear photonic crystals. Injecting pump and signal light beams into a one-dimensional photonic crystal composed of a material with a large second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$, we can transform the coherent incident signal light into squeezed light. Preparing two squeezed light beams by this method and input them into two ports of a 50-50 beam splitter independently, we can transform them into a two-mode squeezed state. Because those two modes of photons share entanglement, a single photon of the one mode is emitted with a high probability on the condition of the single-photon detection of the other mode as a heralding signal. We evaluate the efficiency and the second-order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ for this heralded single-photon source. Moreover, we examine changes in the efficiency and $g^{(2)}(0)$ when we assume that the single-photon detector for the heralding signal is imperfect. For a specific concrete example, we consider a case where the nonlinear medium is lithium niobate $\mbox{LiNbO}_{3}$ and the frequency of the incident signal light is on the order of $10^{14}$ Hz.

Title: QEA: An Accelerator for Quantum Circuit Simulation with Resources Efficiency and Flexibility
Authors: Van Duy Tran, Tuan Hai Vu, Vu Trung Duong Le, Hoai Luan Pham, Yasuhiko Nakashima
Abstract: The area of quantum circuit simulation has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, due to the exponentially increasing computational costs, assessing and validating these models on large datasets poses significant obstacles. Despite plenty of research in quantum simulation, issues such as memory management, system adaptability, and execution efficiency remain unresolved. In this study, we introduce QEA, a state vector-based hardware accelerator that overcomes these difficulties with four key improvements: optimized memory allocation management, open PE, flexible ALU, and simplified CX swapper. To evaluate QEA's capabilities, we implemented and evaluated it on the AMD Alveo U280 board, which uses only 0.534 W of power. Experimental results show that QEA is extremely flexible, supporting a wide range of quantum circuits, has excellent fidelity, making it appropriate for standard quantum emulators, and outperforms powerful CPUs and related works up to 153.16x better in terms of normalized gate speed. This study has considerable potential as a useful approach for quantum emulators in future works.

Authors: Jonathan E. Moussa
Abstract: I generalize the well-known classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm into a quantum algorithm that can equilibrate, measure, and mix a quantum thermal state on a quantum computer. It performs non-symmetric transitions on labels of state preparation and measurement operations and rejects transitions using imprecise energies extracted by Gaussian-filtered quantum phase estimation.

Title: Fault-Tolerant Optical Quantum Computation using 3D Hybrid Cluster States
Authors: Peilin Du
Abstract: Hybridizing different physical systems or degrees of freedom offers significant advantages for realizing practical, universal, scalable, and fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Here, we propose optical FTQC schemes with low squeezing thresholds by leveraging the strengths of both discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) systems while utilizing frequency, time, and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom. First, we design an optical entanglement generator (OEG) capable of producing various types of entangled pairs, including cluster pairs, hybrid entangled pairs, and GKP Bell pairs, which can be flexibly chosen by adjusting the measurement basis. Additionally, the OEG features extra ports for directly inputting (outputting) data (result) states via quantum teleportation, eliminating the need for optical switches. Secondly, large-scale one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional (3D) hybrid cluster states, composed of DV Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits and CV squeezed states, are deterministically generated using the entangled pairs passed through a time-delay system. Moreover, we optimize the surface-GKP code to further reduce logical errors during the stabilizer measurements in the surface code. By combining the 3D cubic hybrid cluster state with the modified surface-GKP code and accounting for full circuit-level noise, FTQC is achieved with a squeezing threshold of 10 dB. Moreover, our method can also generate a 3D macronode Raussendorf-Harrington-Goyal (RHG) cluster state, facilitating an alternative FTQC scheme via the RHG-GKP code. Our work provides a viable pathway toward future optical FTQC architectures.

Title: Laser Mpemba effect
Authors: Stefano Longhi
Abstract: This work explores the emergence of Mpemba-like effects within the quantum theory of lasers. By examining the temporal dynamics of photon number statistics in a single-mode laser above threshold, we reveal the curious and counterintuitive possibility that a laser system, starting with photon statistics far from equilibrium, may reach its stationary nearly-Poissonian distribution faster than a system initially closer to equilibrium. Drawing parallels to both classical and quantum Mpemba effects, we suggest that this behavior results from the unique relaxation dynamics of photon states, which is described by a non-integrable birth-death process. Our findings offer new insights into the foundational aspects of quantum laser light and contribute to the expanding body of research on non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum systems.

Title: Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains
Authors: Alex Bols, Wojciech De Roeck, Michiel De Wilde, Bruno de O. Carvalho
Abstract: We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.

Title: SparQ: Simulating Scalable Quantum Algorithms via Sparse Quantum State Representations
Authors: Tai-Ping Sun, Zhao-Yun Chen, Yun-Jie Wang, Cheng Xue, Huan-Yu Liu, Xi-Ning Zhuang, Xiao-Fan Xu, Yu-Chun Wu, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: Efficient simulation of large-scale quantum algorithms is pivotal yet challenging due to the exponential growth of the state space inherent in both Sch√∂dinger-based and Feynman-based methods. While Feynman-based simulators can be highly efficient when the quantum state is sparse, these simulators often do not fully support the simulation of large-scale, complex quantum algorithms which rely on QRAM and other oracle-based operations. In this work, we present SparQ, a quantum simulator implemented in C++ and inspired by the Feynman-based method. SparQ operates at the register level by storing only the nonzero components of the quantum state, enabling flexible and resource-efficient simulation of basic quantum operations and integrated QRAM for advanced applications such as quantum linear system solvers. In particular, numerical experiments on benchmarks from QASMBench and MQTBench demonstrate that SparQ outperforms conventional Schr√∂dinger-based simulators in both execution time and memory usage for circuits with high sparsity. Moreover, full-process simulations of quantum linear system solvers based on a discrete adiabatic method yield results that are consistent with theoretical predictions. This work establishes SparQ as a promising platform for the efficient simulation of scalable quantum algorithms.

Title: Thermodynamics and Protection of Discrete-Time Crystals
Authors: Gabriele Cenedese, Mauro Antezza, Giuliano Benenti, Gabriele De Chiara
Abstract: Discrete-Time Crystals (DTC) are a non-equilibrium phase of matter characterized by the breaking of time-translation symmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. In this work, we present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of a DTC in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain coupled to a thermal bath. We derive a master equation from the microscopic model, and we explore key thermodynamic quantities, such as work, heat, and entropy production. Our results reveal that the DTC signature inevitably decays in the presence of environmental noise, but we show that a periodic measurement scheme can mitigate the effects of decoherence, stabilizing the subharmonic oscillations of the DTC for extended periods. These findings provide insights into the robustness of time-crystalline phases and potential strategies for protecting them in experimental settings.

Title: Cooling strongly self-organized particles using adiabatic demagnetization
Authors: Simon B. J√§ger
Abstract: We study the dynamics of polarizable particles coupled to a lossy cavity mode that are transversally driven by a laser. Our analysis is performed in the regime where the cavity linewidth exceeds the recoil frequency by several orders of magnitude. Using a two-stage cooling protocol we show that the particles' kinetic energy can be reduced down to the recoil energy. This cooling protocol relies in its first stage on a high laser power such that the particles cool into a strongly self-organized pattern. This can be seen as a strongly magnetized state. In a second stage we adiabatically ramp down the laser intensity such that the particles' kinetic energy is transferred to their potential energy and the particles are ``demagnetized''. In this second stage we optimize the ramping speed which needs to be fast enough to avoid unwanted heating and slow enough such that the dynamics remains to good approximation adiabatic.

Title: Single photon isolation and nonreciprocal frequency conversion in atom-waveguide systems
Authors: Jun-Cong Zheng, Xiao-Wei Zheng, Xin-Lei Hei, Yi-Fan Qiao, Xiao-Yu Yao, Xue-Feng Pan, Yu-Meng Ren, Xiao-Wen Huo, Peng-Bo Li
Abstract: In this work, we utilize a two-level atom and a ${\Lambda}$-type atom to link two identical waveguides, subsequently extending the model to a giant-atom configuration. Our analytical solutions and numerical simulations demonstrate that this setup can achieve single-photon isolation and nonreciprocal frequency conversion by tuning the atom-waveguide coupling strengths $g_i$, respectively. We also examine single-photon scattering in the giant-atom model within both the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The results reveal that ultranarrow scattering windows are induced by the phases ${\phi}_1$ and ${\phi}_2$ under specific conditions, making them well-suited for precise frequency conversion and sensing. Additionally, in the non-Markovian regime, the spectra exhibit irregular polygonal shapes, offering enhanced opportunities for exploring nonreciprocal frequency conversion in the off-resonant regime. Our work provides a new perspective on achieving optical nonreciprocity at the single-photon level in atom-waveguide systems.

Title: Non-Markovian dynamics with $Œõ$-type atomic systems in a single end photonic waveguide
Authors: Jun-Cong Zheng, Xiao-Wei Zheng, Xin-Lei Hei, Yi-Fan Qiao, Xiao-Yu Yao, Xue-Feng Pan, Yu-Meng Ren, Xiao-Wen Huo, Peng-Bo Li
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamical evolution of a ${\Lambda}$-type atom interacting with a semi-infinite one-dimensional photonic waveguide via two atomic transitions. The waveguide terminates at a perfect mirror, which reflects the light and introduces boundary effects. We derive exact analytical expressions and show that, under suitable conditions, the instantaneous and retarded decay rates reach equilibrium, leading to the formation of an atom-photon bound state that suppresses dissipation. Consequently, the atom retains a long-lived population in the asymptotic time limit. Furthermore, we analyze the output field intensity and demonstrate that blocking one of the coupling channels forces the atomic system to emit photons of a single frequency. Finally, we extend the model to a two-atom system and examine the disentanglement dynamics of the two spatially separated atoms. These findings elucidate the dynamic process of spontaneous emission involving multi-frequency photons from multi-level atoms and provide insights into the complex interference between different decay pathways.

Title: Optical nonreciprocity induced by quantum squeezing in temperature sensitive optomechanical systems
Authors: Jun-Cong Zheng, Xiao-Wei Zheng, Xin-Lei Hei, Yi-Fan Qiao, Xiao-Yu Yao, Xue-Feng Pan, Yu-Meng Ren, Xiao-Wen Huo, Peng-Bo Li
Abstract: We investigate single photon transmission and the statistical properties of photon correlations in $\chi^{(2)}$ microring optomechanical systems, where optical nonreciprocity is induced by directional quantum squeezing. Due to the presence of thermal phonons in the mechanical resonator, the system is highly sensitive to temperature changes. Our numerical simulations show that as the thermal phonons vary from 0 to 10, the isolation ratio of single-photon transmission decreases from 22.2 dB to 1.1 dB (or from -23 dB to -3.3 dB). Additionally, the statistical properties of photon correlations transition from exhibiting a strong bunching effect to a weak bunching effect. Moreover, the parametric amplification component enhances the device's temperature response, distinguishing it from other similar nonreciprocal devices. Our protocol suggests a potential application for nonreciprocal setups in precise temperature measurement at ultralow temperatures, thereby enriching quantum networks and quantum information processing.

Title: The localization problem: an antinomy between measurability and causal dynamics
Authors: Evan P. G. Gale
Abstract: The localization problem in relativistic quantum theory has persisted for more than seven decades, yet it is largely unknown and continues to perplex even those well-versed in the subject. At the heart of this problem lies a fundamental conflict between localizability and relativistic causality, which can also be construed as part of the broader dichotomy between measurement and unitary dynamics. This article provides a historical review of the localization problem in one-particle relativistic quantum mechanics, clarifying some persistent misconceptions in the literature, and underscoring the antinomy between causal dynamics and localized observables.

Title: Multi-photon enhanced resolution for Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detector-based Time-of-Flight lidar systems
Authors: Adrian S. Abazi, Roland Jaha, Connor A. Graham-Scott, Wolfram H. P. Pernice, Carsten Schuck
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) emerged in the last decade as a disruptive technology that features performance characteristics, such as high sensitivity, dynamic range and temporal accuracy, which are ideally suited for light detection and ranging (lidar) applications. Here, we report a time-of-flight (TOF) lidar system based on waveguide-integrated SNSPDs that excels in temporal accuracy, which translates into high range resolution. For single-shot measurements, we find resolution in the millimeter regime, resulting from the jitter of the time-of-flight signal of 21$\,$ps for low photon numbers. We further decrease this signal jitter to 11$\,$ps by driving the SNSPD into a multiphoton detection regime, utilizing laser pulses of higher intensity, thus improving range resolution. For multi-shot measurements we find sub-millimeter range-accuracy of 0.75$\,$mm and reveal additional surface information of scanned objects by visualizing the number of reflected photons and their temporal spread with the acquired range data in a combined representation. Our realization of a lidar receiver exploits favorable timing accuracy of waveguide-integrated SNSPDs and extends their operation to the multiphoton regime, which benefits a wide range of remote sensing applications.

Title: On three-body effects and nuclear fusion
Authors: R. Vilela Mendes
Abstract: Confined to small regions, quantum systems exhibit electronic and structural properties different from their free space behavior. In Coulomb 3-body problems, configurations of close proximity of identically charged particles are classically unstable. They however exist as excited quantum states in confined systems. Quantum control of such states might be useful to induce nuclear fusion. The difficult nature of the quantum control of these {\it % quantum collision states} is discussed here, as well as a possible solution using a two-step nonunitary evolution process.

Title: Measurement-based Simulation of Geometric Gates in Topological Qubits on NISQ Devices
Authors: Matthew Brooks, Foster Sabatino, Charles Tahan, Silas Hoffman
Abstract: While the adiabatic exchange of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) enables a non-universal set of geometrically protected gates, realising an experimental implementation of MZM braiding remains challenging. In an alternative proposal, charge-parity measurement of two neighboring MZMs supports braiding by teleportation. Moreover, owing to the lack of definitive evidence of MZMs in semiconducting systems, there have been several simulations of MZMs on NISQ devices which more naturally lend themselves to braiding. In this work, measurement-based braiding about MZM Y-junctions are simulated by multi-qubit Pauli-parity measurements of a logical qubit. Logical single-qubit geometric $S^{(\dagger)}$-gates and entangling two-qubit gates is shown using two-physical-qubit joint measurements alone, whilst partial phase rotations such as a $T^{(\dagger)}$-gates require at least one three-qubit joint measurement. These relatively small scale circuits offer both novel measurement-based geometric gates as well as a measurement-based demonstration of quantum Hamiltonian simulation.

Title: Simulated Non-Abelian Statistics of Majorana Zero Modes from a Kitaev Lattice
Authors: Foster Sabatino, Matthew Brooks, Charles Tahan, Silas Hoffman
Abstract: We simulate the non-Abelian exchange of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) on a quantum computer. Rather than utilizing MZMs at the boundaries of quantum Ising chains, which are typically represented as nonlocal operators on a quantum computer, using a Kitaev lattice allows us to exploit a local representation of MZMs. We detail the protocol for braiding two and four MZMs in terms of a spin Hamiltonian, i.e. physical qubit Hamiltonian. Projecting this onto a subspace of states, we extract an effective Hamiltonian which drives a non-Abelian Berry's phase. Using several approximations, we construct a set of gates which mimics this accumulation of non-Abelian phase and process this construction on a quantum computer. For two and four MZMs, we realize braiding fidelities of approximately 85\% and 47\%, respectively

Title: Loophole-free argument for physicality of electromagnetic potential from causal structure of flux quantization
Authors: Konrad Schlichtholz, Marcin Markiewicz
Abstract: Recent work by Vaidman [Phys. Rev. A 86,040101 (2012)] showed that Aharonov-Bohm effect can be explained in terms of local fields, thus effectively restating an old problem of physicality of potentials. In this work, we propose an argument demonstrating the physicality of electromagnetic potential (upon the assumption of locality) based on the causal structure in flux quantization setup. Crucially, we discuss the fundamental difference between the considered setup and the Aharonov-Bohm experiment that allows for avoiding Vaidman's loophole in our scenario.

Title: Direct comparison of stochastic driven nonlinear dynamical systems for combinatorial optimizations
Authors: Junpeng Hou, Amin Barzegar, Helmut G. Katzgraber
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.

Title: Two-qubit logic and teleportation with mobile spin qubits in silicon
Authors: Yuta Matsumoto, Maxim De Smet, Larysa Tryputen, Sander L. de Snoo, Sergey V. Amitonov, Amir Sammak, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Giordano Scappucci, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen
Abstract: The scalability and power of quantum computing architectures depend critically on high-fidelity operations and robust and flexible qubit connectivity. In this respect, mobile qubits are particularly attractive as they enable dynamic and reconfigurable qubit arrays. This approach allows quantum processors to adapt their connectivity patterns during operation, implement different quantum error correction codes on the same hardware, and optimize resource utilization through dedicated functional zones for specific operations like measurement or entanglement generation. Such flexibility also relieves architectural constraints, as recently demonstrated in atomic systems based on trapped ions and neutral atoms manipulated with optical tweezers. In solid-state platforms, highly coherent shuttling of electron spins was recently reported. A key outstanding question is whether it may be possible to perform quantum gates directly on the mobile spins. In this work, we demonstrate two-qubit operations between two electron spins carried towards each other in separate traveling potential minima in a semiconductor device. We find that the interaction strength is highly tunable by their spatial separation, achieving an average two-qubit gate fidelity of about 99\%. Additionally, we implement conditional post-selected quantum state teleportation between spatially separated qubits with an average gate fidelity of 87\%, showcasing the potential of mobile spin qubits for non-local quantum information processing. We expect that operations on mobile qubits will become a universal feature of future large-scale semiconductor quantum processors.

Title: LuGo: an Enhanced Quantum Phase Estimation Implementation
Authors: Chao Lu, Muralikrishnan Gopalakrishanan Meena, Kalyana Chakravarthi Gottiparthi
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cardinal algorithm in quantum computing that plays a crucial role in various applications, including cryptography, molecular simulation, and solving systems of linear equations. However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing redundant circuit duplication, as well as parallelization techniques to achieve faster circuit generation and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements while maintaining high accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to solve a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.

Title: Provably optimal exact gate synthesis from a discrete gate set
Authors: √âlie Gouzien, Nicolas Sangouard
Abstract: We propose a method for exact circuit synthesis using a discrete gate set, as required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Our approach translates the problem of synthesizing a gate specified by its unitary matrix into a boolean satisfiability (SAT) instance. It leverages the algebraic properties of the coefficients of the matrices that constitute the gate set, enabling the transformation of the constraint of equality between complex matrices into a boolean expression to satisfy. For a specified number of gates, the SAT solver finds a circuit implementing the target or proves that none exist. Optimality of the number of gates is proven by iterating on the number of gates. We also propose some extensions of the method, for example, handling ancillary qubits, post-selection, or classical feedback. The time-to-solution scales double-exponentially with the number of qubits, making it impractical for large circuits. However, since many quantum algorithms rely on small, frequently used subcircuits, and because of the intrinsic value of having a provably optimal circuit synthesis, we believe that our tool are valuable for quantum circuit design.

Title: pyTTN: An Open Source Toolbox for Open and Closed System Quantum Dynamics Simulations Using Tree Tensor Networks
Authors: Lachlan P Lindoy, Daniel Rodrigo-Albert, Yannic Rath, Ivan Rungger
Abstract: We present the Python Tree Tensor Network package (pyTTN) for the evaluation of dynamical properties of closed and open quantum systems that makes use of Tree Tensor Network (TTN), or equivalently the multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), based representations of wavefunctions. This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ans√§tze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.

Title: Variational Quantum Annealing for Quantum Chemistry
Authors: Ka-Wa Yip, K√ºbra Yeter-Aydeniz, Sijia S. Dong
Abstract: We introduce a variational quantum annealing (VarQA) algorithm for electronic structure theory, in which we use the quantum annealer as a sampler and prepare an ansatz state through its statistics. We also introduce a strategy called the "digitizer" for searching the space of variational parameters efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VarQA by evaluating the ground-state potential energy surface for molecules with up to $20$ spin orbitals as well as an excited-state potential energy surface. This approach resembles the workings of the quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs), but is generalized to handle distributions beyond the Boltzmann distribution. In VarQA, with the number of required logical qubits equal to the number of spin orbitals, a fully connected Ising Hamiltonian can be readily implemented in a large-scale quantum annealer as a scalable ansatz for electronic structure calculations.

Title: Natural Quantization of Neural Networks
Authors: Richard Barney, Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We propose a natural quantization of a standard neural network, where the neurons correspond to qubits and the activation functions are implemented via quantum gates and measurements. The simplest quantized neural network corresponds to applying single-qubit rotations, with the rotation angles being dependent on the weights and measurement outcomes of the previous layer. This realization has the advantage of being smoothly tunable from the purely classical limit with no quantum uncertainty (thereby reproducing the classical neural network exactly) to a quantum case, where superpositions introduce an intrinsic uncertainty in the network. We benchmark this architecture on a subset of the standard MNIST dataset and find a regime of "quantum advantage," where the validation error rate in the quantum realization is smaller than that in the classical model. We also consider another approach where quantumness is introduced via weak measurements of ancilla qubits entangled with the neuron qubits. This quantum neural network also allows for smooth tuning of the degree of quantumness by controlling an entanglement angle, $g$, with $g=\frac\pi 2$ replicating the classical regime. We find that validation error is also minimized within the quantum regime in this approach. We also observe a quantum transition, with sharp loss of the quantum network's ability to learn at a critical point $g_c$. The proposed quantum neural networks are readily realizable in present-day quantum computers on commercial datasets.

Title: Emergent coding phases and hardware-tailored quantum codes
Authors: Gaurav Gyawali, Henry Shackleton, Zhu-Xi Luo, Michael Lawler
Abstract: Finding good quantum codes for a particular hardware application and determining their error thresholds is central to quantum error correction. The threshold defines the noise level where a quantum code switches between a coding and a no-coding \emph{phase}. Provided sufficiently frequent error correction, the quantum capacity theorem guarantees the existence of an optimal code that provides a maximum communication rate. By viewing a system experiencing repeated error correction as a novel form of matter, this optimal code, in analogy to Jaynes's maximum entropy principle of quantum statistical mechanics, \emph{defines a phase}. We explore coding phases from this perspective using the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), which is a quantum circuit with depolarizing and dephasing channels. Using numerical optimization, we find this model hosts three phases: a maximally mixed phase, a ``$Z_2$ code'' that breaks its U(1) gauge symmetry down to $Z_2$, and a no-coding phase with first-order transitions between them and a novel \emph{zero capacity multi-critical point} where all three phases meet. For the $Z_2$ code, we provide two practical error correction procedures that fall short of the optimal codes and qualitatively alter the phase diagram, splitting the multi-critical point into two second-order coding no-coding phase transitions. Carrying out our approach on current noisy devices could provide a systematic way to construct quantum codes for robust computation and communication.

Title: Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering
Authors: Chun-Ping Su, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.

Title: Floquet non-Abelian topological charges and edge states
Authors: Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.

Title: Robust strong-field theory model for ultrafast electron transport through metal-insulator-metal tunneling nanojunctions
Authors: Boyang Ma, Michael Kr√ºger
Abstract: Ultrafast science studies the dynamics of electrons in matter with extreme temporal precision, typically in the attosecond and femtosecond time domain. Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [Boyang Ma and Michael Kr√ºger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236901 (2024)], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter $\zeta$ that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for $\zeta > 1$ photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. $\zeta < 1$ is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.

Title: Quantum contextuality of spin-1 massive particles
Authors: M. Fabbrichesi, R. Floreanini, E. Gabrielli, L. Marzola
Abstract: Contextuality is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics. Contrary to entanglement, which can only exist in composite systems, contextuality is also present for single entities. The case of a three-level system is of particular interest because--in agreement with the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem--it is the simplest in which quantum contextuality is necessarily present. We verify that the polarizations of spin-1 massive particles produced at collider experiments indeed exhibit contextuality. To this purpose we consider $W$ gauge bosons produced in top-quark decays, $J/\psi$ and $K^{*}(892)^0$ mesons created in $B$-meson decays and $\phi$ mesons resulting from $\chi^0_c$ charmonium decays, making use of the data collected and analyzed by the ATLAS, LHCb and BESIII collaborations, respectively. The polarizations of all these four particles show contextuality with a significance of more than $5\sigma$.

Title: Degenerate mirrorless lasing in thermal alkali vapors
Authors: Aneesh Ramaswamy, Svetlana A. Malinovskaya
Abstract: For a degenerate two-level alkali atom system driven by a linearly polarized continuous-wave pump field, the steady-state gain for an orthogonally polarized probe field was theoretically predicted (Ramaswamy et al., Mirrorless Lasing: A Theoretical Perspective. Opt. Memory and Neural Networks 32, S443-S466 (2023)). Using linear response theory, we calculated the probe absorption spectrum when the pump was detuned from resonance. A sub-natural linewidth dispersive structure was observed near the pump resonance, exhibiting both gain and absorption. Additionally, a distinct pure gain peak appeared at a sideband corresponding to a dressed-state transition. These effects typically do not persist outside the ultracold regime due to inhomogeneous broadening caused by Doppler broadening, which washes out the fine spectral details. We demonstrate that the sideband gain peak is sustained in the warm vapor regime when both the pump Rabi frequency and detuning exceed the Doppler width. Our results can enable degenerate mirrorless lasing in thermal alkali atom vapors, offering a significant enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio for fluoroscopic remote magnetic sensing applications.

Title: Phases and propagation of closed p-brane
Authors: Kiyoharu Kawana
Abstract: We study phases and propagation of closed $p$-brane within the framework of effective field theory with higher-form global symmetries, i.e., {\it brane-field theory}. We extend our previous studies by including the kinetic term of the center-of-mass motion as well as the kinetic term for the relative motions constructed by the area derivatives. This inclusion gives rise to another scalar Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase, enriching the phase structures of $p$-brane. For example, when the higher-form global symmetries are discrete ones, we show that the low-energy effective theory in the broken phase is described by a topological field theory of the axion $\varphi(X)$ and $p$-form field $A_p^{}(X)$ with multiple (emergent) higher-form global symmetries. After the mean-field analysis, we investigate the propagation of $p$-brane in the present framework. We find the (functional) plane-wave solutions for the kinetic terms and derive a path-integral representation of the brane propagator. This representation motivates us to study the brane propagation within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the volume of $p$-brane is treated as constant. In the volume-less limit (i.e. point-particle limit), the propagator reduces to the ordinary propagator of relativistic particle, whereas it describes the propagation of the area elements in the large-volume limit. Correspondingly, it is shown that the Hausdorff dimension of $p$-brane varies from $2$ to $2(p+1)$ as we increase the $p$-brane volume within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Although these results are quite intriguing, we also point out that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is invalid in the point-particle limit, highlighting the quantum nature of $p$-brane as an extended object in spacetime.

Title: Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms
Authors: Gabriel Emperauger, Mu Qiao, Guillaume Bornet, Cheng Chen, Romain Martin, Yuki Torii Chew, Bastien G√©ly, Lukas Klein, Daniel Barredo, Antoine Browaeys, Thierry Lahaye
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced F√∂rster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.

Title: Controlled Diagonal Catalyst Improves the Efficiency of Quantum Annealing
Authors: Tomohiro Hattori, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It searches for the ground state of the Ising model, which corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state of its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the adiabatic theorem, the runtime required for quantum annealing to satisfy the adiabaticity scales is inverse to the square of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a result, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the energy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Expanding the energy gap is one strategy to improve the performance of quantum annealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains challenging. This study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small energy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and exploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The proposed method achieves an approximate square speed up in time-to-solution compared to the conventional quantum annealing. In addition, we investigate the transferability of the parameters obtained with the proposed method.

Title: System of stochastic interacting wave functions that model quantum measurements
Authors: Carlos M. Mora
Abstract: We develop a system of non-linear stochastic evolution equations that describes the continuous measurements of quantum systems with mixed initial state. We address quantum systems with unbounded Hamiltonians and unbounded interaction operators. Using arguments of the theory of quantum measurements we derive a system of stochastic interacting wave functions (SIWF for short) that models the continuous monitoring of quantum systems. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to this system under conditions general enough for the applications. We obtain that the mixed state generated by the SIWF at any time does not depend on the initial state, and satisfies the diffusive stochastic quantum master equation, which is also known as Belavkin equation. We present two physical examples. In one, the SIWF becomes a system of non-linear stochastic partial differential equations. In the other, we deal with a model of a circuit quantum electrodynamics.

Title: Engineering interaction potentials for stabilizing quantum quasicrystal phases
Authors: Matheus Grossklags, Daniel Lima, Vinicius Zampronio, Fabio Cinti, Alejandro Mendoza-Coto
Abstract: We investigate the necessary features of the pair interaction for the stabilization of self-assembled quantum quasicrystals in two-dimensional bosonic systems. Unlike the classical scenario, our results show that two-dimensional octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal aperiodic phases require a distinct number of properly tuned characteristic length scales for their stabilization. By using a mean field spectral variational approach and Gross-Pitaevskii numerical calculations, we determine that the dodecagonal quasicrystal structure requires at least two characteristic length scales for its stabilization, while the decagonal and octagonal patterns need at least three and four length scales, respectively. The family of pair interaction potentials considered, albeit simple, is well justified in terms of a novel experimental platform based on laser-painted interactions in a cavity QED setup. Finally, we perform a structural characterization of the quasicrystal patterns obtained and show that these phases coexist with a finite superfluid fraction, forming what can be called a super quasicrystal phase.

Title: Quasi-$Œ¶_0$-periodic supercurrent at quantum Hall transitions
Authors: Ivan Villani, Matteo Carrega, Alessandro Crippa, Elia Strambini, Francesco Giazotto, Vaidotas Miseikis, Camilla Coletti, Fabio Beltram, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Stefan Heun, Sergio Pezzini
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.

Title: HQNN-FSP: A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Neural Network for Regression-Based Financial Stock Market Prediction
Authors: Prashant Kumar Choudhary, Nouhaila Innan, Muhammad Shafique, Rajeev Singh
Abstract: Financial time-series forecasting remains a challenging task due to complex temporal dependencies and market fluctuations. This study explores the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to assist in financial trend prediction by leveraging quantum resources for improved feature representation and learning. A custom Quantum Neural Network (QNN) regressor is introduced, designed with a novel ansatz tailored for financial applications. Two hybrid optimization strategies are proposed: (1) a sequential approach where classical recurrent models (RNN/LSTM) extract temporal dependencies before quantum processing, and (2) a joint learning framework that optimizes classical and quantum parameters simultaneously. Systematic evaluation using TimeSeriesSplit, k-fold cross-validation, and predictive error analysis highlights the ability of these hybrid models to integrate quantum computing into financial forecasting workflows. The findings demonstrate how quantum-assisted learning can contribute to financial modeling, offering insights into the practical role of quantum resources in time-series analysis.

We show that the protocol is optimal in the sense that it scales in a way that saturates the quantum interest conjecture.

Title: Multi-Armed Bandits and Quantum Channel Oracles
Authors: Simon Buchholz, Jonas M. K√ºbler, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf
Abstract: Multi-armed bandits are one of the theoretical pillars of reinforcement learning. Recently, the investigation of quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandit problems was started, and it was found that a quadratic speed-up (in query complexity) is possible when the arms and the randomness of the rewards of the arms can be queried in superposition. Here we introduce further bandit models where we only have limited access to the randomness of the rewards, but we can still query the arms in superposition. We show that then the query complexity is the same as for classical algorithms. This generalizes the prior result that no speed-up is possible for unstructured search when the oracle has positive failure probability.

Title: Thermally driven quantum refrigerator autonomously resets superconducting qubit
Authors: Mohammed Ali Aamir, Paul Jamet Suria, Jos√© Antonio Mar√≠n Guzm√°n, Claudia Castillo-Moreno, Jeffrey M. Epstein, Nicole Yunger Halpern, Simone Gasparinetti
Abstract: Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22~mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks.

Title: Coherence manipulation in asymmetry and thermodynamics
Authors: Tulja Varun Kondra, Ray Ganardi, Alexander Streltsov
Abstract: In the classical regime, thermodynamic state transformations are governed by the free energy. This is also called as the second law of thermodynamics. Previous works showed that, access to a catalytic system allows us to restore the second law in the quantum regime when we ignore coherence. However, in the quantum regime, coherence and free energy are two independent resources. Therefore, coherence places additional non-trivial restrictions on the the state transformations, that remains elusive. In order to close this gap, we isolate and study the nature of coherence, i.e., we assume access to a source of free energy. We show that allowing catalysis along with a source of free energy allows us to amplify any quantum coherence present in the quantum state arbitrarily. Additionally, any correlations between the system and the catalyst can be suppressed arbitrarily. Therefore, our results provide a key step in formulating a fully general law of quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Entropic partial orderings of quantum measurements
Authors: Adam Teixid√≥-Bonfill, Joseph Schindler, Dominik ≈†afr√°nek
Abstract: We investigate four partial orderings on the space of quantum measurements (i.e on POVMs or positive operator valued measures), describing four notions of coarse/fine-ness of measurement. These are the partial orderings induced by: (1) classical post-processing, (2) measured relative entropy, (3) observational entropy, and (4) linear relation of POVMs. The orderings form a hierarchy of implication, where e.g. post-processing relation implies all the others. We show that this hierarchy is strict for general POVMs, with examples showing that all four orderings are strictly inequivalent. Restricted to projective measurements, all are equivalent. Finally we show that observational entropy equality $S_M = S_N$ (for all $\rho$) holds if and only if $M \equiv N$ are post-processing equivalent, which shows that the first three orderings induce identical equivalence classes.

Title: Complexity-theoretic foundations of BosonSampling with a linear number of modes
Authors: Adam Bouland, Daniel Brod, Ishaun Datta, Bill Fefferman, Daniel Grier, Felipe Hernandez, Michal Oszmaniec
Abstract: BosonSampling is the leading candidate for demonstrating quantum computational advantage in photonic systems. While we have recently seen many impressive experimental demonstrations, there is still a formidable distance between the complexity-theoretic hardness arguments and current experiments. One of the largest gaps involves the ratio of {particles} to modes -- all current hardness evidence assumes a dilute regime in which the number of linear optical modes scales at least quadratically in the number of particles. By contrast, current experiments operate in a saturated regime with a linear number of modes. In this paper we bridge this gap, bringing the hardness evidence for experiments in the saturated regime to the same level as had been previously established for the dilute regime. This involves proving a new worst-to-average-case reduction for computing the Permanent which is robust to both large numbers of row repetitions and also to distributions over matrices with correlated entries. We also apply similar arguments to give evidence for hardness of Gaussian BosonSampling in the saturated regime.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Lindbladian Dynamics via Repeated Interactions
Authors: Matthew Pocrnic, Dvira Segal, Nathan Wiebe
Abstract: The Lindblad equation generalizes the Schr√∂dinger equation to quantum systems that undergo dissipative dynamics. The quantum simulation of Lindbladian dynamics is therefore non-unitary, preventing a naive application of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. Here, we make use of an approximate correspondence between Lindbladian dynamics and evolution based on Repeated Interaction (RI) CPTP maps to write down a Hamiltonian formulation of the Lindblad dynamics and derive a rigorous error bound on the master equation. Specifically, we show that the number of interactions needed to simulate the Liouvillian $e^{t\mathcal{L}}$ within error $\epsilon$ scales in a weak coupling limit as $\nu\in O(t^2\|\mathcal{L}\|_{1\rightarrow 1}^2/\epsilon)$. This is significant because the error in the Lindbladian approximation to the dynamics is not explicitly bounded in existing quantum algorithms for open system simulations. We then provide quantum algorithms to simulate RI maps using an iterative Qubitization approach and Trotter-Suzuki formulas and specifically show that for iterative Qubitization the number of operations needed to simulate the dynamics (for a fixed value of $\nu$) scales in a weak coupling limit as $O(\alpha_0 t + \nu \log(1/\epsilon)/\log\log(1/\epsilon))$ where $\alpha_0$ is the coefficient $1$-norm for the system and bath Hamiltonians. This scaling would appear to be optimal if the complexity of $\nu$ is not considered, which underscores the importance of considering the error in the Liouvillian that we reveal in this work.

Title: Quantum metrology using quantum combs and tensor network formalism
Authors: Stanislaw Kurdzialek, Piotr Dulian, Joanna Majsak, Sagnik Chakraborty, Rafal Demkowicz-Dobrzanski
Abstract: We develop an efficient algorithm for determining optimal adaptive quantum estimation protocols with arbitrary quantum control operations between subsequent uses of a probed channel. We introduce a tensor network representation of an estimation strategy, which drastically reduces the time and memory consumption of the algorithm, and allows us to analyze metrological protocols involving up to $N=50$ qubit channel uses, whereas the state-of-the-art approaches are limited to $N<5$. The method is applied to study the performance of the optimal adaptive metrological protocols in presence of various noise types, including correlated noise.

Title: Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement
Authors: Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure. Recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles -- a phenomenon we name ensemble pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small (and tunable) amount of entanglement. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment, or number of copies. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp distinguishability transitions.

Title: Optimized Distribution of Entanglement Graph States in Quantum Networks
Authors: Xiaojie Fan, Caitao Zhan, Himanshu Gupta, C.R.Ramakrishnan
Abstract: Building large-scale quantum computers, essential to demonstrating quantum advantage, is a key challenge. Quantum Networks (QNs) can help address this challenge by enabling the construction of large, robust, and more capable quantum computing platforms by connecting smaller quantum computers. Moreover, unlike classical systems, QNs can enable fully secured long-distance communication. Thus, quantum networks lie at the heart of the success of future quantum information technologies. In quantum networks, multipartite entangled states distributed over the network help implement and support many quantum network applications for communications, sensing, and computing. Our work focuses on developing optimal techniques to generate and distribute multipartite entanglement states efficiently. Prior works on generating general multipartite entanglement states have focused on the objective of minimizing the number of maximally entangled pairs (EPs) while ignoring the heterogeneity of the network nodes and links as well as the stochastic nature of underlying processes. In this work, we develop a hypergraph based linear programming framework that delivers optimal (under certain assumptions) generation schemes for general multipartite entanglement represented by graph states, under the network resources, decoherence, and fidelity constraints, while considering the stochasticity of the underlying processes. We illustrate our technique by developing generation schemes for the special cases of path and tree graph states, and discuss optimized generation schemes for more general classes of graph states. Using extensive simulations over a quantum network simulator (NetSquid), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed techniques and show that they outperform prior known schemes by up to orders of magnitude.

Title: Symmetry-protection Zeno phase transition in monitored lattice gauge theories
Authors: Matteo M. Wauters, Edoardo Ballini, Alberto Biella, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Quantum measurements profoundly influence system dynamics. They lead to complex nonequilibrium phenomena like the quantum Zeno effect, and they can be used for mitigating errors in quantum simulations. Such an ability is particularly valuable for lattice gauge theories (LGTs), which require the challenging preservation of an extensive number of local conservation laws. While it is known that tailored quantum measurements can soften violations of gauge symmetry, the nature of this protection, and in particular the possibility of a threshold behavior, is still unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp transition, triggered by the measurement rate, between a protected gauge-theory regime resistant to simulation errors and an irregular regime. Our results are based on the paradigmatic example of a 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. We study in detail the protection through projective measurements of ancillary qubits coupled to the local symmetry generators, and compare this approach with analog (weak) measurement protocols. We show that, while the resulting ensemble averages in the continuous-time limit share the same Liouvillian dynamics, different physical implementations of the stochastic gauge protection protocol yield trajectory unravelings with vastly different statistics. Additionally, we design an on-chip feedback mechanism that corrects bit-flip errors and significantly enhances the discrete-time scheme. Our results shed light on the dissipative criticality of strongly-interacting, highly-constrained quantum systems, and they offer valuable insights into error mitigation and correction of gauge-theory quantum simulations.

Title: Heisenberg-limited adaptive gradient estimation for multiple observables
Authors: Kaito Wada, Naoki Yamamoto, Nobuyuki Yoshioka
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, measuring the expectation value of a general observable has an inherent statistical uncertainty that is quantified by variance or mean squared error of measurement outcome. While the uncertainty can be reduced by averaging several samples, the number of samples should be minimized when each sample is very costly. This is especially the case for fault-tolerant quantum computing that involves measurement of multiple observables of non-trivial states in large quantum systems that exceed the capabilities of classical computers. In this work, we provide an adaptive quantum algorithm for estimating the expectation values of $M$ general observables within root mean squared error $\varepsilon$ simultaneously, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\sqrt{M}\log M)$ queries to a state preparation oracle of a target state. This remarkably achieves the scaling of Heisenberg limit $1/\varepsilon$, a fundamental bound on the estimation precision in terms of mean squared error, together with the sublinear scaling of the number of observables $M$. The proposed method is an adaptive version of the quantum gradient estimation algorithm and has a resource-efficient implementation due to its adaptiveness. Specifically, the space overhead in the proposed method is $\mathcal{O}(M)$ which is independent from the estimation precision $\varepsilon$ unlike non-iterative algorithms. In addition, our method can avoid the numerical instability problem for constructing quantum circuits in a large-scale task (e.g., $\varepsilon\ll 1$ in our case), which appears in the actual implementation of many algorithms relying on quantum signal processing techniques. Our method paves a new way to precisely understand and predict various physical properties in complicated quantum systems using quantum computers.

Title: Robust preparation of ground state phases under noisy imaginary time evolution
Authors: Aleksei Khindanov, Yongxin Yao, Thomas Iadecola
Abstract: Non-unitary state preparation protocols such as imaginary time evolution (ITE) offer substantial advantages relative to unitary ones, including the ability to prepare certain long-range correlated states more efficiently. Here, we ask whether such protocols are also robust to noise arising due to coupling to the environment. We consider a non-unitary ITE "circuit" subjected to a variety of noise models and investigate whether the resulting steady state remains in the same phase as the target state of the ITE at finite noise strength. Taking the one-dimensional quantum Ising model as a concrete example, we find that the ground state order and associated phase transition persist in the presence of noise, provided the noise does not explicitly break the symmetry that protects the phase transition. That is, the noise must possess the protecting symmetry in a weak (or average) form. Our analysis is facilitated by a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian picture in a doubled Hilbert space. We discuss possible implications of these findings for quantum simulation on noisy quantum hardware.

Title: High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe$_2$ via phonon-assisted excitation
Authors: Claudia Piccinini, Athanasios Paralikis, Jos√© Ferreira Neto, Abdulmalik Abdulkadir Madigawa, Pawe≈Ç Wyborski, Vikas Remesh, Luca Vannucci, Niels Gregersen, Battulga Munkhbat
Abstract: The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources, as it governs exciton preparation, decay dynamics, and the spectral diffusion of emitted photons. While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.

Title: Acceleration Noise Induced Decoherence in Stern-Gerlach Interferometers for Gravity Experiments
Authors: Meng-Zhi Wu
Abstract: Stern-Gerlach interferometer (SGI) is a kind of matter-wave interferometer driven by magnetic field and has been proposed for many gravity experiments. Acceleration noises such as vibration and inertial forces, together with higher-order noises like the fluctuation of the gravity gradient or the magnetic field, can cause decoherence problems of SGI, including dephasing, loss of contrast and position localization decoherence. In this paper, I will theoretically study these mechanisms of decoherence based on the analytical time-evolution operator of an SGI modelled as a harmonic oscillator under acceleration noises described by Gaussian stochastic processes. As will be proved, for a single arm of an SGI, the shape of the Wigner function keeps invariant under an acceleration noise, although the phase and the coordinate in the classical phase space fluctuate as linear responses to the noise, and the spatial quantum state of a single path experiences a fidelity loss and position localization decoherence. For the witness constructed in the spin space, the degrees of freedom in the classical phase space have to be traced out, then acceleration noises can lead to dephasing effects on the witness, while the fidelity loss or position localization decoherence don't affect the density matrix in spin space as long as the noise is uniform to both arms of the interferometer. By contrast, path-dependent noises can lead to a loss of Loschmidt echo, resulting in a decoherence in the spin space, known as the Humpty-Dumpty problem. A final remark is that the randomness of the noise is essential for dephasing and position-localization decoherence, and these two mechanisms don't cause purity loss or entropy increase if the noise is determinstic rather than stochastic.

Title: On a Matrix Ensemble for Arbitrary Complex Quantum Systems
Authors: William E. Salazar, Juan Diego Urbina, Javier Madro√±ero
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analytical study of a variation of the eigenvector ensemble initially proposed by Deutsch for the foundations of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). This ensemble, called the $C$-ensemble, incorporates additional system-dependent information, enabling the study of complex quantum systems beyond the universal predictions of Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Specifically, we focus on how system-specific details influence late-time behavior in correlation functions, such as the spectral form factor, and how explicit Hamiltonian corrections not captured by RMT can be included. We demonstrate the consistency of this ensemble with respect to the universal (Haar) results by showing that it defines a unitary 1-design for arbitrary systems and for strongly chaotic systems it becomes an approximated 2-design. Universal expressions for two- and four-point ensemble-averaged correlation functions are derived, revealing how system-dependent information is spectrally decoupled. Furthermore, we show that for small energy windows, the correlation functions defined by this ensemble reduce to the predictions made by the ETH.

Title: High-Precision Multi-Qubit Clifford+T Synthesis by Unitary Diagonalization
Authors: Mathias Weiden, Justin Kalloor, Ed Younis, John Kubiatowicz, Costin Iancu
Abstract: Resource-efficient and high-precision approximate synthesis of quantum circuits expressed in the Clifford+T gate set is vital for Fault-Tolerant quantum computing. Efficient optimal methods are known for single-qubit $R_Z$ unitaries, otherwise the problem is generally intractable. Search-based methods, like simulated annealing, empirically generate low resource cost approximate implementations of general multi-qubit unitaries so long as low precision (Hilbert-Schmidt distances of $\epsilon \geq 10^{-2}$) can be tolerated. These algorithms build up circuits that directly invert target unitaries. We instead leverage search-based methods to first approximately diagonalize a unitary, then perform the inversion analytically. This lets difficult continuous rotations be bypassed and handled in a post-processing step. Our approach improves both the implementation precision and run time of synthesis algorithms by orders of magnitude when evaluated on unitaries from real quantum algorithms. On benchmarks previously synthesizable only with analytical techniques like the Quantum Shannon Decomposition, diagonalization uses an average of 95% fewer non-Clifford gates.

Title: Many-Body Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Rosario Fazio, Jonathan Keeling, Leonardo Mazza, Marco Schir√≤
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.

Title: Geometric contribution to adiabatic amplification in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Tomoki Ozawa, Henning Schomerus
Abstract: Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as those encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes was experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and it does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and we find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wave function changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.

Title: Resource Estimation for Delayed Choice Quantum Entanglement Based Sneakernet Networks Using Neutral Atom qLDPC Memories
Authors: S. Srikara, Andrew D. Greentree, Simon J. Devitt
Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is a vital phenomenon required for realizing secure quantum networks, so much that distributed entanglement can be re-imagined as a commodity which can be traded to enable and maintain these networks. We explore the idea of commercializing entanglement-based cryptography and future applications where advanced quantum memory systems support less advanced users. We design a sneakernet-based quantum communication network with a central party connecting the users through delayed-choice quantum entanglement swapping, using quantum Low-Density-Parity-Check (qLDPC) encoded qubits on neutral atoms. Our analysis compares this approach with traditional surface codes, demonstrating that qLDPC codes offer superior scaling in terms of resource efficiency and logical qubit count. We show that with near-term attainable patch sizes, one can attain medium-to-high fidelity correlations, paving the way towards large-scale commercial quantum networks.

Title: Universal adapters between quantum LDPC codes
Authors: Esha Swaroop, Tomas Jochym-O'Connor, Theodore J. Yoder
Abstract: We propose the repetition code adapter as a way to perform joint logical Pauli measurements within a quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codeblock or between separate such codeblocks. This adapter is universal in the sense that it works regardless of the LDPC codes involved and the Paulis being measured. The construction achieves joint logical Pauli measurement of $t$ weight $O(d)$ operators using $O(td\log^2d)$ additional qubits and checks and $O(d)$ time. We also show for some geometrically-local codes in fixed $D\ge2$ dimensions that only $O(td)$ additional qubits and checks are required instead. By extending the adapter in the case $t=2$, we construct a toric code adapter that uses $O(d^2)$ additional qubits and checks to perform targeted logical CNOT gates on arbitrary LDPC codes via Dehn twists. To obtain some of these results, we develop a novel weaker form of graph edge expansion.

Title: Squeezing via self-induced transparency in mercury-filled photonic crystal fibers
Authors: M. S. Najafabadi, J. F. Corney, L. L. S√°nchez-Soto, N. Y. Joly, G. Leuchs
Abstract: We investigate the squeezing of ultrashort pulses using self-induced transparency in a mercury-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. Our focus is on quadrature squeezing at low mercury vapor pressures, with atoms near resonance on the $^3{\rm D}_3 \to 6^3{\rm P}_2$ transition. We vary the atomic density, thus the gas pressure (from 2.72 to 15.7$\mu$bar), by adjusting the temperature (from 273~K to 303 ~K). Our results show that achieving squeezing at room temperature, considering both fermionic and bosonic mercury isotopes, requires ultrashort femtosecond pulses. We also determine the optimal detection length for squeezing at different pressures and temperatures.

Title: Entanglement between dependent degrees of freedom: Quasiparticle correlations
Authors: Franziska Barkhausen, Laura Ares Santos, Stefan Schumacher, Jan Sperling
Abstract: Common notions of entanglement are based on well-separated subsystems. However, obtaining such independent degrees of freedom is not always possible because of physical constraints. In this work, we explore the notion of entanglement in the context of dependent degrees of freedom. As a physically relevant application, we specifically study quantum correlation features for quasiparticle descriptions. Those are paramount for interacting light-matter systems, utilizing excitations of fermion-boson hybrid modes. By comparing independent and dependent degrees of freedom, we uncover that certain states are nonentangled although they would be entangled when only focusing on the common, independent description, and vice versa. Therefore, insight is provided into the resourcefulness of quantum correlations within the rarely discussed context of dependent degrees of freedom for light-matter links in quantum information applications.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Reinforcement Learning in Latent Observation Spaces
Authors: D√°niel T. R. Nagy, Csaba Czab√°n, Bence Bak√≥, P√©ter H√°ga, Zs√≥fia Kallus, Zolt√°n Zimbor√°s
Abstract: Recent progress in quantum machine learning has sparked interest in using quantum methods to tackle classical control problems via quantum reinforcement learning. However, the classical reinforcement learning environments often scale to high dimensional problem spaces, which represents a challenge for the limited and costly resources available for quantum agent implementations. We propose to solve this dimensionality challenge by a classical autoencoder and a quantum agent together, where a compressed representation of observations is jointly learned in a hybrid training loop. The latent representation of such an autoencoder will serve as a tailored observation space best suited for both the control problem and the QPU architecture, aligning with the agent's requirements. A series of numerical experiments are designed for a performance analysis of the latent-space learning method. Results are presented for different control problems and for both photonic (continuous-variable) and qubit-based agents, to show how the QNN learning process is improved by the joint training.

Title: Complex-Phase Extensions of Szegedy Quantum Walk on Graphs
Authors: Sergio A. Ortega, Miguel A. Martin-Delgado
Abstract: This work introduces a graph-phased Szegedy's quantum walk, which incorporates link phases and local arbitrary phase rotations (APR), unlocking new possibilities for quantum algorithm efficiency. We demonstrate how to adapt quantum circuits to these advancements, allowing phase patterns that ensure computational practicality. The graph-phased model broadens the known equivalence between coined quantum walks and Szegedy's model, accommodating a wider array of coin operators. Through illustrative examples, we reveal intriguing disparities between classical and quantum interpretations of walk dynamics. Remarkably, local APR phases emerge as powerful tools for marking graph nodes, optimizing quantum searches without altering graph structure. We further explore the surprising nuances between single and double operator approaches, highlighting a greater range of compatible coins with the latter. To facilitate these advancements, we present an improved classical simulation algorithm, which operates with superior efficiency. This study not only refines quantum walk methodologies but also paves the way for future explorations, including potential applications in quantum search and PageRank algorithms. Our findings illuminate the path towards more versatile and powerful quantum computing paradigms.

Title: Generalized many-body perturbation theory for the electron correlation energy: multi-reference random phase approximation via diagrammatic resummation
Authors: Yuqi Wang, Wei-Hai Fang, Zhendong Li
Abstract: Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) based on Green's functions and Feynman diagrams provides a fundamental theoretical framework for various \emph{ab initio} computational approaches in molecular and materials science, including the random phase approximation (RPA) and $GW$ approximation. Unfortunately, this perturbation expansion often fails in systems with strong multi-reference characters. Extending diagrammatic MBPT to the multi-reference case is highly nontrivial and remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the breakdown of Wick's theorem. In this work, we develop a diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of MBPT for computing correlation energies of strongly correlated systems, by using the cumulant expansion of many-body Green's function in place of Wick's theorem. This theoretical framework bridges the gap between MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation theories (MRPT) in quantum chemistry, which had been almost exclusively formulated within time-independent wavefunction frameworks prior to this work. Our formulation enables the explicit incorporation of strong correlation effects from the outset as in MRPT, while treating residual weak interactions through a generalized diagrammatic perturbation expansion as in MBPT. As a concrete demonstration, we formulate a multi-reference (MR) extension of the standard single-reference (SR) RPA by systematically resumming generalized ring diagrams, which naturally leads to a unified set of equations applicable to both SR and MR cases. Benchmark calculations on prototypical molecular systems reveal that MR-RPA successfully resolves the well-known failure of SR-RPA in strongly correlated systems. This theoretical advancement paves the way for advancing \emph{ab initio} computational methods through diagrammatic resummation techniques in future.

Title: Chasing shadows with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes
Authors: Jonathan Conrad, Jens Eisert, Steven T. Flammia
Abstract: In this work, we consider the task of performing shadow tomography of a logical subsystem defined via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code. We construct a logical shadow tomography protocol via twirling of continuous variable POVMs by displacement operators and Gaussian unitaries. In the special case of heterodyne measurement, the shadow tomography protocol yields a probabilistic decomposition of any input state into Gaussian states that simulate the encoded logical information of the input relative to a fixed GKP code and we prove bounds on the Gaussian compressibility of states in this setting. For photon parity measurements, logical GKP shadow tomography is equivalent to a Wigner sampling protocol for which we develop the appropriate sampling schemes and finally we derive a Wigner sampling scheme via random GKP codes. This protocol establishes how Wigner samples of any input state relative to a random GKP codes can be used to estimate any sufficiently bounded observable on CV space. This construction shows how a description of the physical state of the system can be reconstructed from encoded logical information relative to a random code and further highlights the power of performing idealized GKP error correction as a tomographic resource.

Title: Resource-Efficient Quantum Correlation Measurement: A Multicopy Neural Network Approach for Practical Applications
Authors: Patrycja Tulewicz, Karol Bartkiewicz, Adam Miranowicz, Franco Nori
Abstract: Measuring complex properties in quantum systems, such as measures of quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality, is inherently challenging. Traditional methods, like quantum state tomography (QST), necessitate a full reconstruction of the density matrix for a given system and demand resources that scale exponentially with system size. We propose an alternative strategy that reduces the required information by combining multicopy measurements with artificial neural networks (ANNs), resulting in a 67\% reduction in measurement requirements compared to QST. We have successfully measured two-qubit quantum correlations of Bell states subjected to a depolarizing channel (resulting in Werner states) and an amplitude damping channel (leading to Horodecki states) using the multicopy approach on real quantum hardware. Our experiments, conducted with transmon qubits on IBMQ processors, quantified the violation of Bell's inequality and the negativity of two-qubit entangled states. We compared these results with those obtained from the standard QST approach and applied a maximum likelihood method to mitigate noise. We trained ANNs to estimate entanglement and nonlocality measures using optimized sets of projections identified through Shapley's (SHAP) analysis for the Werner and Horodecki states. The ANN output, based on this reduced set of projections, aligns well with expected values and enhances noise robustness. This approach simplifies and improves the error-robustness of multicopy measurements, eliminating the need for complex nonlinear equation analysis. It represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted quantum measurements, making practical implementation on current quantum hardware more feasible.

Title: Analytical solution of the open dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model and perturbative analytical solution of the open quantum Rabi model
Authors: Antti Vaaranta, Marco Cattaneo, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings and quantum Rabi models are fundamental to cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics, as they describe the simplest form of light-matter interaction, where a single qubit is coupled to a single bosonic mode. A scenario that is commonly encountered in the experimental practice arises when the bosonic mode interacts with an external dissipative thermal bath, making the qubit-boson system open. In this work, we present new analytical solution of the Lindblad master equations for the open dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model and a perturbative analytical solution of the open quantum Rabi model in the limit of weak qubit-boson coupling $g$, using the holomorphic formalism in Bargmann space. Specifically, we derive the most general solution of the local Lindblad master equation for the open dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model coupled to a thermal bath, with the only assumptions that the initial state of the qubit-boson system is separable. Additionally, we obtain a perturbative analytical solution for the open quantum Rabi model up to second order in $g$. Notably, our findings include a new formula for the qubit's steady state at zeroth order, showing that the stationary populations depend on both qubit and boson frequencies in the quantum Rabi model, but not in the Jaynes-Cummings model, regardless of the value of $g$. Our results are of general interest to the study of open quantum systems in the context of light-matter interaction.

Title: Statistical features of quantum chaos using the Krylov operator complexity
Authors: Zhuoran Li, Wei Fan
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of Lanczos coefficients over an ensemble of random initial operators generating the Krylov space. We propose two statistical quantities that are important in characterizing the complexity: the average correlation matrix $\langle x_{i} x_{j}\rangle$ of Lanczos coefficients and the resulting distribution of the variance of Lanczos coefficients. Their resulting statistics are the Wishart distribution and the (rescaled) chi-square distribution respectively, which are independent of the distributions of initial operators and become the normal distribution in the case of large matrix size. As a numerical example, we use the typical billiard system with an integrability-breaking term and choose samples of random initial operators from given probability distributions (GOE, GUE and the uniform distribution). It agrees with the phenomenological analysis and further interesting behaviors are obtained, which indicates a consistent connection between RMT, Anderson localization and Krylov complexity.

Title: Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators
Authors: Hazar √áakƒ±r, Richard M. Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.

Title: Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Hong-Yu Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.

Title: Preconditioned Block Encodings for Quantum Linear Systems
Authors: Leigh Lapworth, Christoph S√ºnderhauf
Abstract: Quantum linear system solvers like the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) require a block encoding of the system matrix $A$ within a unitary operator $U_A$. Unfortunately, block encoding often results in significant subnormalisation and increase in the matrix's effective condition number $\kappa$, affecting the efficiency of solvers. Matrix preconditioning is a well-established classical technique to reduce $\kappa$ by multiplying $A$ by a preconditioner $P$. Here, we study quantum preconditioning for block encodings. We consider four preconditioners and two encoding approaches: (a) separately encoding $A$ and its preconditioner $P$, followed by quantum multiplication, and (b) classically multiplying $A$ and $P$ before encoding the product in $U_{PA}$. Their impact on subnormalisation factors and condition number $\kappa$ are analysed using practical matrices from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Our results show that (a) quantum multiplication introduces excessive subnormalisation factors, negating improvements in $\kappa$. We introduce preamplified quantum multiplication to reduce subnormalisation, which is of independent interest. Conversely, we see that (b) encoding of the classical product can significantly improve the effective condition number using the Sparse Approximate Inverse preconditioner with infill. Further, we introduce a new matrix filtering technique that reduces the circuit depth without adversely affecting the matrix solution. We apply these methods to reduce the number of QSVT phase factors by a factor of 25 for an example CFD matrix of size 1024x1024.

Title: Nonstabilizerness of a Boundary Time Crystal
Authors: Gianluca Passarelli, Angelo Russomanno, Procolo Lucignano
Abstract: Boundary time crystals exhibit measurement-induced phase transitions in their steady-state entanglement, with critical behavior that depends on the particular unraveling of the Lindblad dynamics. In this work, we investigate another key measure of quantum complexity -- nonstabilizerness (or magic) -- and show that it follows a markedly different pattern. Importantly, in contrast to entanglement, for large system sizes, magic remains invariant under different unraveling schemes -- a property we attribute to the inherent permutational symmetry of the model. Although the steady-state stabilizer entropy does not display a genuine phase transition, it exhibits a singular derivative (a cusp) at the mean-field critical point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that finite-size simulations of the average Lindblad evolution fail to capture the asymptotic behavior of magic in the time-crystal phase, while quantum trajectory unravelings correctly reveal its extensive scaling with system size. These findings offer insights into how different quantum resources manifest in open systems.

Title: Solving Dicke superradiance analytically: A compendium of methods
Authors: Raphael Holzinger, Nico S. Bassler, Julian Lyne, Fidel G. Jimenez, Julius T. Gohsrich, Claudiu Genes
Abstract: We present several analytical approaches to the Dicke superradiance problem, which involves determining the time evolution of the density operator for an initially inverted ensemble of $N$ identical two-level systems undergoing collective spontaneous emission. This serves as one of the simplest cases of open quantum system dynamics that allows for a fully analytical solution. We explore multiple methods to tackle this problem, yielding a solution valid for any time and any number of spins. These approaches range from solving coupled rate equations and identifying exceptional points in non-Hermitian evolution to employing combinatorial and probabilistic techniques, as well as utilizing a quantum jump unraveling of the master equation. The analytical solution is expressed as a residue sum obtained from a contour integral in the complex plane, suggesting the possibility of fully analytical solutions for a broader class of open quantum system dynamics problems.

Title: A Comparative Study of Quantum Optimization Techniques for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Benchmark Problems
Authors: Monit Sharma, Hoong Chuin Lau
Abstract: Quantum optimization holds promise for addressing classically intractable combinatorial problems, yet a standardized framework for benchmarking its performance, particularly in terms of solution quality, computational speed, and scalability is still lacking. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate a range of quantum optimization techniques against well-established NP-hard combinatorial problems. Our framework focuses on key problem classes, including the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), Maximum Independent Set (MIS), Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), and Market Share Problem (MSP). Our study evaluates gate-based quantum approaches, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its CVaR-enhanced variant, alongside advanced quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its extensions. To address resource constraints, we incorporate qubit compression techniques like Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) and Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO). Experimental results, obtained from simulated quantum environments and classical solvers, provide key insights into feasibility, optimality gaps, and scalability. Our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of quantum optimization, offering a structured pathway for future research and practical applications in quantum-enhanced decision-making.

Title: Spin contrast, finite temperature, and noise in matter-wave interferometer
Authors: Tian Zhou, Ryan Rizaldy, Martine Schut, Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: In this paper, we will show how finite-temperature corrections and spin-dependent/independent noise will affect the contrast in a matter-wave interferometer, especially with massive objects and large spatial superposition sizes. Typically, spin is embedded in a nanoparticle as a defect, which can be manipulated by the external magnetic field to create a macroscopic quantum superposition. These massive matter-wave interferometers are the cornerstone for many new fundamental advancements in physics; particularly, macroscopic quantum superposition can use entanglement features to, e.g., test physics beyond the Standard Model, test the equivalence principle, improve quantum sensors, and test the quantum nature of spacetime in a lab. We will consider a Stern-Gerlach type apparatus to create macroscopic quantum superposition in a harmonic oscillator trap, and figure out the spin contrast loss due to linear spin-independent and spin-dependent noise in a single interferometer. We will show that spin contrast loss due to spin-independent noise does not depend on the initial thermal state of the matter wave function. However, spin contrast loss due to spin-dependent fluctuations do depend on the initial thermal occupation of the quantum state. We will keep our discussion general as far as the noise parameters are concerned.

Title: Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian for the entanglement spectroscopy of fractional quantum Hall states
Authors: A. Nardin, R. Lopes, M. Rizzi, L. Mazza, S. Nascimbene
Abstract: We study the Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian for fractional quantum Hall states defined on a sphere and explore its relationship with the entanglement Hamiltonian associated to the state. We present results for several examples, namely the bosonic Laughlin state stabilized by contact two-body interactions and the bosonic Moore-Read state stabilized by either three- or two-body interactions. Our findings demonstrate that the Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian provides a reliable approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian as a fully-local operator that can be written without any prior knowledge of the specific state under consideration.

Title: Quantum advantage in zero-error function computation with side information
Authors: Ruoyu Meng, Aditya Ramamoorthy
Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice and Bob have correlated sources $X,Y$ with joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot, \cdot)$. Bob wants to calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. Alice encodes $m$-length blocks $(m \geq 1)$ of her observations to Bob over error-free channels, which can be classical or quantum. We consider two classical settings. (i) Alice communicates via a fixed length code (FLC), and (ii) Alice communicates via a variable length code (VLC). In the FLC scenario, the minimum communication rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the chromatic number of an appropriately defined $m$-instance ``confusion graph'' $G^{(m)}$. In the VLC scenario, the corresponding rate is characterized by the asymptotics of the chromatic entropy of $G^{(m)}$. %and has single-letter characterization in terms of K√∂rner's graph entropy if $G^{(m)}$ is $m$-times graph OR product. In the quantum setting, we only consider fixed length codes; the corresponding rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the orthogonal rank of the complement of $G^{(m)}$. The behavior of the communication rates depends critically on $G^{(m)}$, which is shown to be sandwiched between $G^{\boxtimes m}$ ($m$-times strong product) and $G^{\lor m}$ ($m$-times OR product) respectively. Our work presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the function $f(\cdot, \cdot)$ and joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot,\cdot)$ such that $G^{(m)}$ equals either $G^{\boxtimes m}$ or $G^{\lor m}$. Our work explores the multitude of possible behaviors of the quantum and classical (FLC/VLC) rates in the single-instance case and the asymptotic (in $m$) case for several classes of confusion graphs.

Title: Stochastic inflation and entropy bound in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Hiromasa Tajima, Yasusada Nambu
Abstract: We investigate the entropy dynamics of de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. The cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime, which limits the causally accessible region for an observer, exhibits thermal properties similar to a black hole event horizon. According to holographic principles, the entropy within a causally connected region is bounded by its surface area. However, this entropy bound is violated during the eternal phase of inflation. To address these violations from a quantum information perspective, we adopt a stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. Specifically, we analyze the Shannon entropy of the inflaton field's probability distribution, which mirrors the behavior of the entanglement entropy of a Hubble-sized region in stochastic inflation. Using the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we demonstrate a significant entropy behavior in de Sitter spacetime.

Title: Transformer neural networks and quantum simulators: a hybrid approach for simulating strongly correlated systems
Authors: Hannah Lange, Guillaume Bornet, Gabriel Emperauger, Cheng Chen, Thierry Lahaye, Stefan Kienle, Antoine Browaeys, Annabelle Bohrdt
Abstract: Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS), involving a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical data as well as experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], and show that the information from a second measurement basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.

Title: Radio-frequency cascade readout and coherent exchange control of spin qubits fabricated using a 300 mm wafer process

Abstract: Leveraging advanced semiconductor manufacturing promises potential for scaling up silicon-based quantum processors. In this context, control and readout of individual spin qubits have been shown on devices manufactured on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, which forms the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of $10$. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubits unit cell while providing high gain. We achieve a $74\%$ singlet-triplet readout fidelity in $8~\mu$s integration time, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration on a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards the large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.

Title: Experimental realization of entanglement between two Brownian particles
Authors: Lakshmanan Theerthagiri, Sergio Ciliberto
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of the quantum analog of entanglement between two electric circuits equivalent to two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales range is measured too.

Title: Complete classification of integrability and non-integrability of S=1/2 spin chains with symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction
Authors: Naoto Shiraishi
Abstract: We study S=1/2 quantum spin chains with shift-invariant and inversion-symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction, also known as zigzag spin chains. We completely classify the integrability and non-integrability of the above class of spin systems. We prove that in this class there are only two integrable models, a classical model and a model solvable by the Bethe ansatz, and all the remaining systems are non-integrable. Our classification theorem confirms that within this class of spin chains, there is no missing integrable model. This theorem also implies the absence of intermediate models with a finite number of local conserved quantities.

Title: Simultaneous Decoding of Classical Coset Codes over $3-$User Quantum Interference Channel : New Achievable Rate Regions
Authors: Fatma Gouiaa, Arun Padakandla
Abstract: We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating classical information over a $3-$user quantum interference channel (QIC) and focus on characterizing inner bounds. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that coding strategies based on coset codes can yield strictly larger inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of \textit{tilting}, \textit{smoothing} and \textit{augmentation} discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of a $3-$user QIC. The derived inner bound subsumes all current known bounds.
