Title: Multiparticle quantum plasmonics: fundamentals and applications
Authors: Mingyuan Hong
Abstract: Quantum plasmonics explores how light interacts with collective charge oscillations at metal-dielectric interfaces, enabling strong confinement and enhanced quantum effects at the nanoscale. While traditional quantum optics focuses on single photons, this thesis explores an intermediate regime - multiparticle quantum optics - where classical light, analyzed using photon-number-resolving detection and projective measurements, reveals nontrivial quantum correlations. We begin by establishing the theoretical foundation of multiparticle quantum plasmonics, introducing key concepts like photon-plasmon interactions, coherence, and statistical fluctuations. The first study shows that multiparticle scattering can alter quantum statistics in plasmonic systems, offering new control over fluctuations. The second reveals nonclassical near-field plasmon dynamics, showing how quantum coherence emerges from bosonic and fermionic contributions in subsystems. The third study presents a quantum plasmonic sensing method, using conditional detection to boost signal-to-noise ratio and improve phase estimation. The final study extends this approach to quantum imaging with natural light: by isolating multiphoton correlations from thermal light via photon-number-resolving detection and a single-pixel protocol, we enhance image contrast under noisy conditions. These results show that multiparticle interactions can control quantum statistical properties, even in classical fields. By bridging theory and application, this thesis advances quantum plasmonics and highlights the potential of multiphoton methods in imaging, sensing, and information processing.

Title: Role of Riemannian geometry in double-bracket quantum imaginary-time evolution
Authors: René Zander, Raphael Seidel, Li Xiaoyue, Marek Gluza
Abstract: Double-bracket quantum imaginary-time evolution (DB-QITE) is a quantum algorithm which coherently implements steps in the Riemannian steepest-descent direction for the energy cost function. DB-QITE is derived from Brockett's double-bracket flow which exhibits saddle points where gradients vanish. In this work, we perform numerical simulations of DB-QITE and describe signatures of transitioning through the vicinity of such saddle points. We provide an explicit gate count analysis using quantum compilation programmed in Qrisp.

Title: Predicting Dynamics from Flows of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis
Authors: Dominik Hahn, David M. Long, Marin Bukov, Anushya Chandran
Abstract: Analytical treatments of far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics are few, even in well-thermalizing systems. The celebrated eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a post hoc ansatz for the matrix elements of observables in the eigenbasis of a thermalizing Hamiltonian, given various response functions of those observables as input. However, the ETH cannot predict these response functions. We introduce a procedure, dubbed the statistical Jacobi approximation (SJA), to update the ETH ansatz after a perturbation to the Hamiltonian and predict perturbed response functions. The Jacobi algorithm diagonalizes the perturbation through a sequence of two-level rotations. The SJA implements these rotations statistically assuming the ETH throughout the diagonalization procedure, and generates integrodifferential flow equations for various form factors in the ETH ansatz. We approximately solve these flow equations for certain classes of observables, and predict both quench dynamics and autocorrelators in the thermal state of the perturbed Hamiltonian. The predicted dynamics compare well to exact numerics in both random matrix models and one-dimensional spin chains.

Title: Double-bracket algorithm for quantum signal processing without post-selection
Authors: Yudai Suzuki, Bi Hong Tiang, Jeongrak Son, Nelly H. Y. Ng, Zoë Holmes, Marek Gluza
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP), a framework for implementing matrix-valued polynomials, is a fundamental primitive in various quantum algorithms. Despite its versatility, a potentially underappreciated challenge is that all systematic protocols for implementing QSP rely on post-selection. This can impose prohibitive costs for tasks when amplitude amplification cannot sufficiently improve the success probability. For example, in the context of ground-state preparation, this occurs when using a too poor initial state. In this work, we introduce a new formula for implementing QSP transformations of Hermitian matrices, which requires neither auxiliary qubits nor post-selection. Rather, using approximation to the exact unitary synthesis, we leverage the theory of the double-bracket quantum algorithms to provide a new quantum algorithm for QSP, termed Double-Bracket QSP (DB-QSP). The algorithm requires the energy and energetic variance of the state to be measured at each step and has a recursive structure, which leads to circuit depths that can grow super exponentially with the degree of the polynomial. With these strengths and caveats in mind, DB-QSP should be viewed as complementing the established QSP toolkit. In particular, DB-QSP can deterministically implement low-degree polynomials to "warm start" QSP methods involving post-selection.

Title: Fault-tolerant correction-ready encoding of the [[7,1,3]] Steane code on a 2D grid
Authors: Andrea Rodriguez-Blanco, Ho Nam Nguyen, K. Birgitta Whaley
Abstract: Practical quantum computation heavily relies on the ability to perform quantum error correction in a fault-tolerant manner. Fault-tolerant encoding is a critical first step, and careful consideration of the error correction cycle that follows is essential for ensuring the encoding's effectiveness and compatibility. In this work, we investigate various correction-ready encoding methods to fault-tolerantly prepare the zero-logical state of the [[7,1,3]] Steane code on a 2D grid. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that parity-check encoding with a few Flag-Bridge qubits outperforms verification-based encoding by achieving lower error rates and allowing flexible tuning of the performance-efficiency trade-off. Additionally, parity-check approach enables a compact hybrid protocol that combines encoding and error correction, capable of matching the performance of a standalone error correction protocol with perfect encoding. Surprisingly, compared to the resource-intensive Steane error correction, this low-overhead method still offers a practical advantage in noisy settings. These findings highlight the approach with Flag-Bridge qubits as a robust and adaptable solution for noisy near-term quantum hardware.

Title: Quantum Resetting Protocols Based on Synchronizing Words
Authors: Jędrzej Stempin, Jan Wójcik, Andrzej Grudka, Marcin Karczewski, Paweł Kurzyński, Antoni Wójcik
Abstract: Resetting a system's state plays a fundamental role in physics, engineering, computer science, and many other fields. Here we focus on a method originally proposed in automata theory. The state of an automaton evolves according to a set of rules. These rules form an alphabet, and one can apply these rules one after another. Such a sequence of rules is known as a word. Some particular words, known as synchronizing words, enable a system to evolve into a predetermined state regardless of its initial configuration. This process, which is inherently irreversible, appears at first glance to be incompatible with the unitarity of quantum mechanics. Unitary evolution preserves information, hence forbids such classical resetting to a predetermined state. In this work, we introduce a novel resetting protocol based on quantum-synchronizing words by incorporating auxiliary qubits whose states encode rules of the automaton's alphabet. We further propose a quantum circuit that realizes this protocol and can be implemented on a quantum computer. Additionally, we establish a connection between this approach and Kraus channels, showing that quantum synchronizing words can be achieved without explicit reference to the states of ancillary qubits. Our results bridge classical and quantum notions of synchronizing words, shedding light on the interplay between quantum information processing and non-unitary dynamics.

Title: Diversity Methods for Improving Convergence and Accuracy of Quantum Error Correction Decoders Through Hardware Emulation
Authors: Francisco Garcia-Herrero, Javier Valls, Llanos Vergara-Picazo, Vicente Torres
Abstract: Understanding the impact of accuracy and speed when quantum error correction (QEC) decoders transition from floating-point software implementations to finite-precision hardware architectures is crucial for resource estimation on both classical and quantum sides. The final performance of the hardware implementation influences the code distance, affecting the number of physical qubits needed, and defines connectivity between quantum and classical control units, among other factors like refrigeration systems. This paper introduces a hardware emulator to evaluate QEC decoders using real hardware instead of software models. The emulator can explore $10^{13}$ different error patterns in 20 days with a single FPGA device running at 150 MHz, guaranteeing the decoder's performance at logical rates of $10^{-12}$, the requirement for most quantum algorithms. In contrast, an optimized C++ software on an Intel Core i9 with 128 GB RAM would take over a year to achieve similar results. The emulator also enables storing patterns that generate logical errors for offline analysis and to design new decoders. Using results from the emulator, we propose a diversity-based method combining several belief propagation (BP) decoders with different quantization levels. Individually, these decoders may show subpar error correction, but together they outperform the floating-point version of BP for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes like hypergraph or lifted product. Preliminary results with circuit-level noise and bivariate bicycle codes suggest hardware insights can also improve software. Our diversity-based proposal achieves a similar logical error rate as BP with ordered statistics decoding, with average speed improvements ranging from 30% to 80%, and 10% to 120% in worst-case scenarios, while reducing post-processing algorithm activation by 47% to 96.93%, maintaining the same accuracy.

Title: Characterizing and exploiting cross-talk effect in SPAD arrays for two-photon interference
Authors: Sergei Kulkov, Lada Radmacherova, Ondrej Matousek, Lou-Ann Pestana De Sousa, Ermanno Bernasconi, Claudio Bruschini, Tommaso Milanese, Edoardo Charbon, Andrei Nomerotski, Peter Svihra
Abstract: SPAD arrays are becoming a popular choice for measuring two-photon interference effects thanks to their high timing precision, fast readout, and high quantum efficiency. However, such sensors are affected by cross-talk that may mimic the useful signal. Even with a low probability of seeing cross-talk effect between neighboring SPADs, it was found that it still may reach the farther channels up to a half of millimeter away. Moreover, the use of microlenses that help SPADs achieve even better efficiency further boosts the cross-talk effect. In this work, we characterize the cross-talk effect and compare it to the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect in the LinoSPAD2 camera, which has a linear sensor of 512 SPADs. Additionally, we compare the results between sensors with and without the microlenses. Finally, we present a timing calibration technique for the detector that utilizes the cross-talk effect.

Abstract: Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.

Title: Accelerating Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithms through Time Rescaling
Authors: L. A. M. Rattighieri, G. E. L. Pexe, B. L. Bernado, F. F. Fanchini
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of time rescaling on the performance of Feedback Quantum Algorithms (FQA) and their variant for optimization tasks, FALQON. We introduce TR-FQA and TR-FALQON, time-rescaled versions of FQA and FALQON, respectively. The method is applied to two representative problems: the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem and ground-state preparation in the ANNNI quantum many-body model. The results show that TR-FALQON accelerates convergence to the optimal solution in the early layers of the circuit, significantly outperforming its standard counterpart in shallow-depth regimes. In the context of state preparation, TR-FQA demonstrates superior convergence, reducing the required circuit depth by several hundred layers. These findings highlight the potential of time rescaling as a strategy to enhance algorithmic performance on near-term quantum devices.

Title: Cross-Validating Quantum Network Simulators
Authors: Joaquin Chung, Michal Hajdušek, Naphan Benchasattabuse, Alexander Kolar, Ansh Singal, Kento Samuel Soon, Kentaro Teramoto, Allen Zang, Raj Kettimuthu, Rodney Van Meter
Abstract: We present a first cross-validation of two open-source quantum network simulators, QuISP and SeQUeNCe, focusing on basic networking tasks to ensure consistency and accuracy in simulation outputs. Despite very similar design objectives of both simulators, their differing underlying assumptions can lead to variations in simulation results. We highlight the discrepancies in how the two simulators handle connections, internal network node processing time, and classical communication, resulting in significant differences in the time required to perform basic network tasks such as elementary link generation and entanglement swapping. We devise common ground scenarios to compare both the time to complete resource distribution and the fidelity of the distributed resources. Our findings indicate that while the simulators differ in the time required to complete network tasks, a constant factor difference attributable to their respective connection models, they agree on the fidelity of the distributed resources under identical error parameters. This work demonstrates a crucial first step towards enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of quantum network simulations, as well as leading to full protocol development. Furthermore, our benchmarking methodology establishes a foundational set of tasks for the cross-validation of simulators to study future quantum networks.

Title: On the dual structure of the Schrödinger dynamics
Authors: Kazuo Takatsuka
Abstract: This paper elucidates the dual structure of the Schrödinger dynamics in two correlated stages: (1) We first derive the real-valued Schrödinger equation from scratch without referring to classical mechanics, wave mechanics, nor optics, and thereby attain a concrete and clear interpretation of the Schrödinger (wave) function. Beginning with a factorization of the density distribution function of the particles to two component vectors in configuration space, we impose very simple conditions on them such as translational invariance of space-time and the conservation of flux under a given potential function. A real-valued path-integral is formulated as a Green function for the real-valued Schrödinger equation. (2) We then study a quantum stochastic path dynamics in a manner compatible with the Schrödinger equation. The relation between them is like the Langevin dynamics with the diffusion equation. Each quantum path describes a \textquotedblleft trajectory\textquotedblright\ in configuration space representing, for instance, a singly launched electron in the double-slit experiment that leaves a spot one by one at the measurement board, while accumulated spots give rise to the fringe pattern as predicted by the absolute square of the Schrödinger function. We start from the relationship between the Ito stochastic differential equation, the Feynman-Kac formula, and the associated parabolic partial differential equations, to one of which\ the Schrödinger equation is transformed. The physical significance of the quantum intrinsic stochasticity and the indirect correlation among the quantum paths and so on are discussed. The self-referential nonlinear interrelationship between the Schrödinger functions (regarded as a whole) and the quantum paths (as its parts) is identified as the ultimate mystery in quantum dynamics.

Title: General channel capacities from quantum channel-state duality
Authors: Y.-D. Liu, D.-S. Wang
Abstract: The quantum channel-state duality permits the characterization of a quantum process through a quantum state, referred to as a Choi state. This characteristic serves as the impetus for the quantum computing paradigm that utilizes Choi states as information sources. In this work, the fundamental theorems regarding quantum channel capacity are proven when Choi states are considered as sources. This achievement enriches the set of capacities associated with quantum channels. Moreover, it gives rise to novel opportunities for the comprehension of superadditivity phenomena and the discovery of new classes of quantum error-correction codes.

Title: Quantum light sources with configurable lifetime leveraging parity-time symmetry
Authors: Nuo Chen, Wen-Xiu Li, Yun-Ru Fan, Hang-Hang Li, Hong Zeng, Wu-Qiang Chi, Heng Zhou, Hao Li, Li-Xing You, Guang-Can Guo, Qiang Zhou, Jing Xu, Xin-Liang Zhang
Abstract: Quantum light sources with configurable photon lifetimes are essential for large-scale quantum circuits, enabling applications in programmable quantum computing, various quantum key distribution protocols, and quantum tomography techniques. However, the fundamental trade-off between efficiency and photon lifetime imposes significant challenges on the design of high-performance large configurable lifetime quantum light sources. Here, we report on such chip-scale quantum light sources by harnessing the unique feature of parity-time (PT) symmetry. The core design centers on employing PT-symmetric coupling between two microresonators of distinct circumferences, enabling broad-range and selective tuning of intracavity photon density of states. By controlling the alignment between resonators, we achieved a 38-fold photon lifetime tuning range (4 ~ 158 ps), with the shortest lifetimes near the exceptional points of the PT-symmetric systems. The device generates energy-time entangled photon pairs with 87.1 +- 1.1% interference visibility and a heralded second-order autocorrelation of g_h^((2) ) (0)= 0.069 +- 0.001. Our work highlights the potential of PT symmetry for advanced quantum applications, including high-speed communication and programmable quantum computing, quantum coherent tomography, and beyond.

Title: Asymptotic Error Bounds and Fractional-Bit Design for Fixed-Point Grover's Quantum Algorithm Emulation
Authors: Seonghyun Choi, Kyeongwon Lee, Jongin Choi, Woojoo Lee
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) emulators, which simulate quantum algorithms on classical hardware, are indispensable platforms for testing quantum algorithms before scalable quantum computers become widely available. A critical challenge in QC emulation is managing numerical errors from finite arithmetic precision, especially truncation errors in resource-efficient fixed-point arithmetic. Despite its importance, systematic studies quantifying how truncation errors impact quantum algorithm accuracy are limited. In this paper, we propose a rigorous quantitative framework analyzing truncation error propagation in fixed-point QC emulation, focusing on Grover's quantum search algorithm. First, we introduce a simplified two-value amplitude representation of quantum states during Grover's iterations and prove its theoretical validity. Using this representation, we derive explicit mathematical expressions characterizing truncation error accumulation across quantum gate operations. We quantify the overall emulation error by the $\ell_2$ distance between ideal and emulated probability distributions, obtaining asymptotic bounds scaling as $O(2^{n-f})$, where $n$ is the number of qubits and $f$ is fractional-bit precision. Extensive numerical simulations and empirical experiments on a practical fixed-point QC emulator confirm that observed errors precisely match our theoretical predictions. Finally, we provide a closed-form formula to determine the minimal fractional-bit precision required to achieve a specified error threshold, offering clear guidelines for emulator designers balancing accuracy and resource utilization.

Title: Relativistic quantum Otto heat engine using a three-level Unruh-DeWitt detector
Authors: Tomoya Hirotani, Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura
Abstract: In this study, we explore a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine with a qutrit as the working substance interacting with a quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. Unlike qubits, which extract work by simply expanding or shrinking a single energy gap, qutrits allow multiple energy gaps to be adjusted independently, enabling more versatile work extraction in the quantum Otto cycle. We derive a general positive work condition in terms of the effective temperature that each pair of energy levels perceives. Moreover, we discuss additional subtleties that are absent when using a qubit, such as the generation of coherence terms in the density matrix due to interactions.

Title: Quantum Key Distribution with Efficient Post-Quantum Cryptography-Secured Trusted Node on a Quantum Network

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables two distant users to exchange a secret key with information-theoretic security, based on the fundamental laws of quantum physics. While it is arguably the most mature application of quantum cryptography, it has inherent limitations in the achievable distance and the scalability to large-scale infrastructures. While the applicability of QKD can be readily increased with the use of intermediary trusted nodes, this adds additional privacy requirements on third parties. In this work, we present an efficient scheme leveraging a trusted node with lower privacy requirements thanks to the use of post-quantum cryptographic techniques, and implement it on a deployed fiber optic quantum communication network in the Paris area.

Title: Characterization of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Pilar Martín Clavero, Alberto Rodríguez
Abstract: The chaotic phase of the tilted Bose-Hubbard model is identified as a function of energy, tilt strength and particle interaction, from the eigenstate structure and the statistical features of the energy spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the chaotic phase of the bare Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian can actually be enhanced by the presence of a moderate tilt. We further unveil the development and scaling of the chaotic regime from the perspective of a homogeneous density configuration typically used in cold atom experiments, providing a valuable phase diagram for future theoretical and experimental studies of this system.

Title: Thermalization in a model of enhanced memory capacity
Authors: Oleg Kaikov
Abstract: We study thermalization within a quantum system with an enhanced capacity to store information. This system has been recently introduced to provide a prototype model of how a black hole processes and stores information. We perform a numerical finite-size analysis of this isolated quantum system and find indications that its information-carrying subsystem approaches thermality in the large system-size limit. The results lead us to suggest a novel thermalization mechanism. The corresponding distinguishing characteristic is that for a large class of physically meaningful non-equilibrium initial states $| \text{in} \rangle$, a few-body observable $\hat{A}$ thermalizes despite unignorable correlations between the fluctuations of its eigenstate expectation values $\langle \alpha | \hat{A} | \alpha \rangle$ in the eigenstate basis of the model $\left\{ | \alpha \rangle \right\}$ and the fluctuations of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients $|C_{\alpha}|^2 = |\langle \alpha | \text{in} \rangle |^2$.

Title: Scalable Equivalence Checking and Verification of Shallow Quantum Circuits
Authors: Nengkun Yu, Xuan Du Trinh, Thomas Reps
Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of checking if two shallow (i.e., constant-depth) quantum circuits perform equivalent computations. Equivalence checking is a fundamental correctness question -- needed, e.g., for ensuring that transformations applied to a quantum circuit do not alter its behavior. For quantum circuits, the problem is challenging because a straightforward representation on a classical computer of each circuit's quantum state can require time and space that are exponential in the number of qubits $n$. The paper presents decision procedures for two variants of the equivalence-checking problem. Both can be carried out on a classical computer in time and space that, for any fixed depth, is linear in $n$. Our critical insight is that local projections are precise enough to completely characterize the output state of a shallow quantum circuit. Instead of explicitly computing the output state of a circuit, we generate a set of local projections that serve as constraints on the output state. Moreover, the circuit's output state is the unique quantum state that satisfies all the constraints. Beyond equivalence checking, we show how to use the constraint representation to check a class of assertions, both statically and at run time. Our assertion-checking methods are sound and complete for assertions expressed as conjunctions of local projections. Our experiments show that on a server equipped with 2 x Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Xeon\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Gold 6338 CPUs (128 threads total) and 1.0~TiB of RAM, running Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, the constraint representation of a random 100-qubit circuit of depth 6 can be computed in 19.8 seconds. For fixed inputs $\ket{0}^{\otimes 100}$, equivalence checking of {random} 100-qubit circuits of depth 3 takes 4.46 seconds; for arbitrary inputs, it takes no more than 31.96 seconds.

Title: Quantum Computing for Optimizing Aircraft Loading
Authors: Ananth Kaushik, Sang Hyub Kim, Willie Aboumrad, Martin Roetteler, Albana Topi, Richard Ashworth
Abstract: The aircraft loading optimization problem is a computationally hard problem with the best known classical algorithm scaling exponentially with the number of objects. We propose a quantum approach based on a multi-angle variant of the QAOA algorithm (Multi-Angle Layered Variational Quantum Algorithm (MAL-VQA)) designed to utilize a smaller number of two qubit gates in the quantum circuit as compared to the standard QAOA algorithm so that the quantum optimization algorithm can be run on near-term ion-trap quantum processing units (QPU). We also describe a novel cost function implementation that can handle many different types of inequality constraints without the overhead of introducing slack variables in the quantum circuit so that larger problems with complex constraints may be represented on near-term QPUs which have low qubit counts. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on different instances of the aircraft loading problem by execution on IonQ QPUs Aria and Forte. Our experiments obtain the optimal solutions for all the problem instances studied ranging from 12 qubits to 28 qubits. This shows the potential scalability of the method to significantly larger problem sizes with the improvement of quantum hardware in the near future as well as the robustness of the quantum algorithm against varying initial guesses and varying constraints of different problem instances.

Title: Entanglement in the symmetric subspace: mapping multipartite to bipartite states
Authors: Carlo Marconi, Satoya Imai
Abstract: We propose a technique to investigate multipartite entanglement in the symmetric subspace. Our approach is to map an $N$-qubit symmetric state onto a bipartite symmetric state of higher local dimension. We show that this mapping preserves separability and allows to characterize the entanglement of the original multipartite state. In particular, we provide several bounds to estimate the symmetric tensor rank and geometric measure of entanglement. Additionally, we identify multipartite symmetric states whose entanglement outperforms that of previously known candidates for maximally entangled symmetric states. Finally, we reveal the existence of entangled symmetric subspaces, where all bipartite states are entangled.

Title: Conditions for Unitarity in Timeless Quantum Theory
Authors: Simone Rijavec
Abstract: Quantum timeless approaches solve the problem of time by recovering the usual unitary evolution of quantum theory relative to a clock in a stationary quantum Universe. For some Hamiltonians of the Universe, such as those including an interaction term with the clock, the dynamics is substantially altered and can be non-unitary. This work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for the relative dynamics to be unitary and finds the general form of the unitary evolution operator. A physical interpretation of these conditions is given in terms of the clock's rate. Unitary dynamics is associated with rates that are constant in time and independent of the clock's internal structure.

Title: Sub-second spin and lifetime-limited optical coherences in $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$
Authors: Alexey Tiranov, Emanuel Green, Sophie Hermans, Erin Liu, Federico Chiossi, Diana Serrano, Pascal Loiseau, Achuthan Manoj Kumar, Sylvain Bertaina, Andrei Faraon, Philippe Goldner
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins have been extensively studied for quantum technologies, offering unique advantages for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Advancing these applications is generally limited by finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and long spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a CaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state, and demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin ensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of 185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75 ms. Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15 seconds at zero magnetic field between 50 mK and 1 K temperatures. These results demonstrate the potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building quantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical transducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.

Title: Adaptive mesh refinement quantum algorithm for Maxwell's equations
Authors: Elise Fressart, Michel Nowak, Nicole Spillane
Abstract: Algorithms that promise to leverage resources of quantum computers efficiently to accelerate the finite element method have emerged. However, the finite element method is usually incorporated into a high-level numerical scheme which allows the adaptive refinement of the mesh on which the solution is approximated. In this work, we propose to extend adaptive mesh refinement to the quantum formalism, and apply our method to the resolution of Maxwell's equations. An important step in this procedure is the computation of error estimators, which guide the refinement. By using block-encoding, we propose a way to compute these estimators with quantum circuits. We present first numerical experiments on a 2D geometry.

Title: Bubble Clustering Decoder for Quantum Topological Codes
Authors: Diego Forlivesi, Lorenzo Valentini, Marco Chiani
Abstract: Quantum computers are highly vulnerable to noise, necessitating the use of error-correcting codes to protect stored data. Errors must be continuously corrected over time to counteract decoherence using appropriate decoders. Therefore, fast decoding strategies capable of handling real-time syndrome extraction are crucial for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. In this paper, we introduce the bubble clustering (BC) decoder for quantum surface codes, which serves as a low-latency replacement for MWPM, achieving significantly faster execution at the cost of a slight performance degradation. This speed boost is obtained leveraging an efficient cluster generation based on bubbles centered on defects, and avoiding the computational overhead associated with cluster growth and merging phases, commonly adopted in traditional decoders. Our complexity analysis reveals that the proposed decoder operates with a complexity on the order of the square of the number of defects. For moderate physical error rates, this is equivalent to linear complexity in the number of data qubits.

Title: Preparation of conditionally-squeezed states in qubit-oscillator systems
Authors: Marius K. Hope, Jonas Lidal, Francesco Massel
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in the manipulation of superconducting circuits coupled to mechanical modes in the quantum regime, we propose a protocol for generating superpositions of orthogonally squeezed states in a quantum harmonic oscillator. The protocol relies on a quadratic coupling between the oscillator and a qubit, and is conceptually similar to methods used for preparing cat states in qubit-oscillator systems. We numerically evaluate the robustness of the state-preparation scheme in the presence of decoherence, considering environmental coupling for both the harmonic oscillator and the qubit. As a potential application, we introduce a quantum error-correcting code based on conditionally-squeezed states and analyze its error-mitigation properties.

Title: K-P Quantum Neural Networks
Authors: Elija Perrier
Abstract: We present an extension of K-P time-optimal quantum control solutions using global Cartan $KAK$ decompositions for geodesic-based solutions. Extending recent time-optimal \emph{constant-$\theta$} control results, we integrate Cartan methods into equivariant quantum neural network (EQNN) for quantum control tasks. We show that a finite-depth limited EQNN ansatz equipped with Cartan layers can replicate the constant-$\theta$ sub-Riemannian geodesics for K-P problems. We demonstrate how for certain classes of control problem on Riemannian symmetric spaces, gradient-based training using an appropriate cost function converges to certain global time-optimal solutions when satisfying simple regularity conditions. This generalises prior geometric control theory methods and clarifies how optimal geodesic estimation can be performed in quantum machine learning contexts.

Title: Self-Discharging Mitigated Quantum Battery
Authors: Wan-Lu Song, Ji-Ling Wang, Bin Zhou, Wan-Li Yang, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: As a quantum thermodynamic device that utilizes quantum systems for energy storage and delivery, the quantum battery (QB) is expected to offer revolutionary advantages in terms of increasing the charging power and the extractable work by using quantum resources. However, the ubiquitous decoherence in the microscopic world inevitably forces the QB to spontaneously lose its stored energy. This is called the self-discharging of the QB and severely limits its realization. We propose a QB scheme based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, where the electronic spin serves as the QB. Inspired by our finding that the coherent ergotropy decays more slowly than the incoherent ergotropy, we reveal a mechanism to enhance the inherent robustness of the QB to the self-discharging by improving the ratio of coherent ergotropy to total ergotropy. The unique hyperfine interaction between the electron and the native $^{14}$N nucleus in our scheme allows to coherently optimize this ratio. Enriching the understanding on the extractable work of the QB, our results pave the way for the practical realization of the QB.

Title: Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints
Authors: Adam Stokes, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys. Rev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021), while reaffirming the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013116 (2021).

Title: Iterative Interpolation Schedules for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
Authors: Anuj Apte, Shree Hari Sureshbabu, Ruslan Shaydulin, Sami Boulebnane, Zichang He, Dylan Herman, James Sud, Marco Pistoia
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum optimization heuristic with empirical evidence of speedup over classical state-of-the-art for some problems. QAOA solves optimization problems using a parameterized circuit with $p$ layers, with higher $p$ leading to better solutions. Existing methods require optimizing $2p$ independent parameters which is challenging for large $p$. In this work, we present an iterative interpolation method that exploits the smoothness of optimal parameter schedules by expressing them in a basis of orthogonal functions, generalizing Zhou et al. By optimizing a small number of basis coefficients and iteratively increasing both circuit depth and the number of coefficients until convergence, our approach enables construction of high-quality schedules for large $p$. We demonstrate our method achieves better performance with fewer optimization steps than current approaches on three problems: the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, portfolio optimization, and Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences (LABS). For the largest LABS instance, we achieve near-optimal merit factors with schedules exceeding 1000 layers, an order of magnitude beyond previous methods. As an application of our technique, we observe a mild growth of QAOA depth sufficient to solve SK model exactly, a result of independent interest.

Title: Variational preparation of entangled states in a system of transmon qubits
Authors: Alexander Yeremeyev, Aleksei Tolstobrov, Gleb Fedorov, Stefan Sanduleanu, Shamil Kadyrmetov, Aleksey Bolgar, Daria Kalacheva, Viktor Lubsanov, Oleg V. Astafiev
Abstract: The conventional method for generating entangled states in qubit systems relies on applying precise two-qubit entangling gates alongside single-qubit rotations. However, achieving high-fidelity entanglement demands high accuracy in two-qubit operations, requiring complex calibration protocols. In this work, we use a minimally calibrated two-qubit iSwap-like gate, tuned via straightforward parameter optimization (flux pulse amplitude and duration), to prepare Bell states and GHZ states experimentally in systems of two and three transmon qubits. By integrating this gate into a variational quantum algorithm (VQA), we bypass the need for intricate calibration while maintaining high fidelity. Our proposed methodology employs variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to create the target quantum state through imperfect multiqubit operations. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for Bell states, confirming their high fidelity of preparation.

Title: Time-optimal single-scalar control on a qubit of unitary dynamics
Authors: Chungwei Lin, Qi Ding, Petros T. Boufounos, Yanting Ma, Yebin Wang, Dries Sels, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: Optimal control theory is applied to analyze the time-optimal solution with a single scalar control knob in a two-level quantum system without quantum decoherence. Emphasis is \change{placed} on the dependence on the maximum control strength $u_\text{max}$. General constraints on the optimal protocol are derived and used to rigorously parameterize the time-optimal solution. Two concrete problems are investigated. For generic state preparation problems, both multiple bang-bang and bang-singular-bang are legitimate and should be considered. Generally, the optimal is bang-bang for small $u_\text{max}$, and there exists a state-dependent critical amplitude above which singular control emerges. For the X-gate operation of a qubit, the optimal protocol \change{is exclusively} multiple bang-bang. The minimum gate time is about 80\% of that based on the resonant Rabi $\pi$-pulse over a wide range of control strength; in the $u_\text{max} \rightarrow 0$ limit this ratio is derived to be $\pi/4$. To develop practically feasible protocols, we present methods to smooth the abrupt changes in the bang-bang control while preserving perfect gate fidelity. \change{The presence of bang-bang segments in the time-optimal protocol} indicates that the high-frequency components and a full calculation (instead of the commonly adopted Rotating Wave Approximation) are essential for the ultimate quantum speed limit.

Title: Multiplexed Control at Scale for Electrode Arrays in Trapped-Ion Quantum Processors
Authors: Ryutaro Ohira, Shinichi Morisaka, Ippei Nakamura, Atsushi Noguchi, Takefumi Miyoshi
Abstract: The scaling up of trapped-ion quantum processors based on the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture is difficult owing to the extensive electronics and high-density wiring required to control numerous trap electrodes. In conventional QCCD architectures, each trap electrode is controlled via a dedicated digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The conventional approach places an overwhelming demand on electronic resources and wiring complexity. This is because the number of trap electrodes typically exceeds the number of trapped-ion qubits. This study proposes a method that leverages a high-speed DAC to generate time-division multiplexed signals to control a large-scale QCCD trapped-ion quantum processor. The proposed method replaces conventional DACs with a single high-speed DAC that generates the complete voltage waveforms required to control the trap electrodes, thereby significantly reducing the wiring complexity and overall resource requirements. Based on realistic parameters and commercially available electronics, our analysis demonstrates that a QCCD trapped-ion quantum computer with 10,000 trap electrodes can be controlled using only 13 field-programmable gate arrays and 104 high-speed DACs. This is in stark contrast to the 10,000 dedicated DACs required by conventional control methods. Consequently, employing this approach, we developed a proof-of-concept electronic system and evaluated its analog output performance.

Title: Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation
Authors: Khalil Al Salahat, Mohamad El Moussawi, Veera Ganesh Yalla, Ali J. Ghandour
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing is crucial for high-resolution Earth observation and remote sensing applications, one of the most commonly used algorithms for this task is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA). Using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the collected signal is transformed to the frequency domain and then goes through the processing steps of this algorithm. However, when it comes to large datasets, this process can be computationally expensive. This paper explores the implementation of a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA), relying on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) as a speedup tool over the classical FFT. Additionally, it proposes a quantum version of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, one of the key correctional steps of the RDA algorithm, and compares it with its classical counterpart.

Title: Many neighbors little entanglement: A curious scaling in the variable-range extended Ising model
Authors: Harikrishnan K J, Debasis Sadhukhan, Amit Kumar Pal
Abstract: We study the two-point correlation functions and the bipartite entanglement in the ground state of the exactly-solvable variable-range extended Ising model of qubits in the presence of a transverse field on a one-dimensional lattice. We introduce the variation in the range of interaction by varying the coordination number, $\mathcal{Z}$, of each qubit, where the interaction strength between a pair of qubits at a distance $r$ varies as $\sim r^{-\alpha}$. We show that the algebraic nature of the correlation functions is present only up to $r=\mathcal{Z}$, above which it exhibits short-range exponential scaling. We also show that at the critical point, the bipartite entanglement exhibits a power-law decrease ($\sim\mathcal{Z}^{-\gamma}$) with increasing coordination number irrespective of the partition size and the value of $\alpha$ for $\alpha>1$. We further consider a sudden quench of the system starting from the ground state of the infinite-field limit of the system Hamiltonian via turning on the critical Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the long-time averaged bipartite entanglement exhibits a qualitatively similar variation ($\sim\mathcal{Z}^{-\gamma}$) with $\mathcal{Z}$.

Title: Threshold for Fault-tolerant Quantum Advantage with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm

Abstract: Optimization is often cited as a promising application of quantum computers. However, the low degree of provable quantum speedups has led prior rigorous end-to-end resource analyses to conclude that a quantum computer is unlikely to surpass classical state-of-the-art on optimization problems under realistic assumptions. In this work, we compile and analyze the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) combined with Amplitude Amplification (AA) applied to random 8-SAT at the satisfiability threshold. Our compilation involves careful optimization of circuits for Hamiltonian simulation, which may be of independent interest. We use the analytical scaling of the time-to-solution for QAOA identified by PRX Quantum 5, 030348 (2024) and find that with QAOA depth $p=623$, QAOA+AA achieves a crossover with state-of-the-art classical heuristics at 179 variables and 14.99 hours of runtime when executed on a surface-code-based fault-tolerant quantum computer with 73.91 million physical qubits, a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, and a $1~\mu$s code cycle time. Notably, we allow the classical solver to be parallelized as long as its total energy consumption is equal to that required for decoding in the surface code. We further show that this restriction on classical solver energy consumption can be relaxed given optimistic but plausible reductions in physical error rates and fault-tolerance overheads, enabling a crossover of 2.94 hours using 8.88 million physical qubits against a classical solver running on a supercomputer with $725,760$ CPU cores. These findings support the hypothesis that large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers will be useful for optimization.

Title: Joint estimation of position and momentum with arbitrarily high precision using non-Gaussian states
Authors: Massimo Frigerio, Matteo G. A. Paris, Carlos Ernesto Lopetegui, Mattia Walschaers
Abstract: We address the joint estimation of changes in the position and linear momentum of a quantum particle or, equivalently, changes in the complex field of a bosonic mode. Although these changes are generated by non-commuting operators, we show that leveraging non-Gaussianity enables their simultaneous estimation with arbitrarily high precision and arbitrarily low quantum incompatibility. Specifically, we demonstrate that any pure non-Gaussian state provides an advantage over all Gaussian states, whether pure or mixed. Moreover, properly tuned non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states can also serve as a resource.

Title: Fermionic Averaged Circuit Eigenvalue Sampling
Authors: Adrian Chapman, Steven T. Flammia
Abstract: Fermionic averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (FACES) is a protocol to simultaneously learn the averaged error rates of many fermionic linear optical (FLO) gates simultaneously and self-consistently from a suitable collection of FLO circuits. It is highly flexible, allowing for the in situ characterization of FLO-averaged gate-dependent noise under natural assumptions on a family of continuously parameterized one- and two-qubit gates. We rigorously show that our protocol has an efficient sampling complexity, owing in-part to useful properties of the Kravchuk transformations that feature in our analysis. We support our conclusions with numerical results. As FLO circuits become universal with access to certain resource states, we expect our results to inform noise characterization and error mitigation techniques on universal quantum computing architectures which naturally admit a fermionic description.

Title: It costs nothing to teleport information into a black hole
Authors: Jonah Kudler-Flam, Geoff Penington
Abstract: It is often claimed that adding a qubit to a black hole requires energy $\Delta E \geq T_H \log 2$ so that the extra Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can accommodate the qubit. In this essay, we explain how the recently discovered phenomenon of black hole decoherence allows quantum information to be teleported into a black hole, with arbitrarily small energy cost. The generalized second law is not violated and there is no conflict with unitarity because the teleportation creates new entanglement, analogous to Hawking radiation, between the black hole interior and exterior. In accordance with Landauer's principle, a nonzero minimum energy cost only appears when there is a net erasure of information and noise from the exterior or, equivalently, when ``zerobits'' are sent into the black hole.

Title: α-Ta (111) Thin Films for Qubit Applications: A Study of Thickness Dependence and Universal Scaling
Authors: Nate Price, Jose Gutiérrez, Sushant Padhye, Sara McGinnis, Carter Wade, Huma Yusuf, Lakshan Don Manuwelge Don, Kurt Eyink, J. Guerrero-Sánchez, Evgeny Mikheev, Joseph P. Corbett
Abstract: We explore the growth of {\alpha}-Ta thin films ranging from ultra-thin (2 nm) to thick (250 nm) films grown by sputter epitaxy on c-plane sapphire substrates. We utilized 100 W power with a 32 mTorr sputter pressure at 650 ° substrate deposition temperature. We used X-ray diffractometry to extract the lattice constant and growth orientation of the films, finding a mono-oriented (111) films with a lattice spacing in agreement with a bulk Ta value of 3.31 Å. X-ray reflectometry is used to characterize the native oxide, film, and substrate-film interface as a function of thickness. We observe a very smooth morphology with an average roughness of 700 pm, as determined by both reflectometry and atomic force microscopy. The film nucleates with small islands, whose terrace width grows linearly as a function of thickness until 150 nm, where the terrace width becomes constant. From our reflectometry measurements, we uncover a pseudomorphic layer with a critical thickness of 1 nm and a self-limiting amorphous oxide that grows to a thickness of 2.25 nm; both of these layers are independent of thickness beyond 4 nm total thickness. We also studied the superconducting transition through electronic transport measurements using the Van der Pauw method to measure resistivity as a function of temperature. We observed a smooth evolution in critical superconducting temperature with total film thickness, from 2.9 °K for 7.5 nm to 4.2 °K for 269.2 nm, as expected from universal thickness scaling in superconductors. Density functional theory simulations were used to understand the oxidation process at the top surface layers of {\alpha}-Ta (111). We observed that as the oxygen content on the surface increases, the Ta progressively loses its crystalline structure. Significant structural distortions occur when the Ta:O ratio exceeds 1:1, forming an amorphous TaO phase.

Title: Covariant decomposable maps on C*-algebras and quantum dynamics
Authors: Krzysztof Szczygielski
Abstract: We characterize covariant positive decomposable maps between unital C*-algebras in terms of a dilation theorem, which generalizes a seminal result by H. Scutaru from Rep. Math. Phys. 16 (1):79-87, 1979. As a case study, we provide a certain characterization of the operator sum representation of maps on $\mathbb{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$, covariant with respect to the maximal commutative subgroup of $\mathrm{U}(n)$. A connection to quantum dynamics is established by specifying sufficient and necessary conditions for covariance of D-divisible (decomposably divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 (2023) 485202.

Title: New intertwining operators for the Calogero model
Authors: Francisco Correa, Luis Inzunza, Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: It is long known that quantum Calogero models feature intertwining operators, which increase or decrease the coupling constant by an integer amount, for any fixed number of particles. We name these as ``horizontal'' and construct new ``vertical'' intertwiners, which \emph{change the number of interacting particles} for a fixed but integer value of the coupling constant. The emerging new structure of a grid of intertwiners exists only in the algebraically integrable situation (integer coupling) and allows one to obtain each Liouville charge from the free power sum in the particle momenta by iterated intertwining either horizontally or vertically. We present recursion formulæ for the new intertwiners as a factorization problem for partial differential operators and prove their existence for small values of particle number and coupling. As a byproduct, a new basis of non-symmetric Liouville integrals appears, algebraically related to the standard symmetric one.

Title: Multicriticality in stochastic dynamics protected by self-duality
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study the dynamical large deviations (LD) of a class of one-dimensional kinetically constrained models whose (tilted) generators can be mapped into themselves via duality transformations. We consider four representative models in detail: the domain-wall (DW) Fredrickson-Andersen (FA), the DW East, the ZZZ-FA, and the XOR-FA models. Using numerical tensor networks, we build the LD phase diagrams of these models in terms of the softness of the constraint and the counting field conjugate to the dynamical activity. In all cases, we find distinct dynamical phases separated by phase transitions along the self-dual lines, revealing the presence of multi-critical points that delimit first-order from continuous active-inactive transitions. We discuss connections to supersymmetry and possible extensions to higher spin and space dimensions.

Title: Bayesian critical points in classical lattice models
Authors: Adam Nahum, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen
Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution encodes our subjective knowledge of the configuration in a classical lattice model, given only its Hamiltonian. If we acquire further information about the configuration from measurement, our knowledge is updated according to Bayes' theorem. We examine the resulting "conditioned ensembles", finding that they show many new phase transitions and new renormalization-group fixed points. (Similar conditioned ensembles also describe "partial quenches" in which some of the system's degrees of freedom are instantaneously frozen, while the others continue to evolve.) After describing general features of the replica field theories for these problems, we analyze the effect of measurement on illustrative critical systems, including: critical Ising and Potts models, which show surprisingly rich phase diagrams, with RG fixed points at weak, intermediate, and infinite measurement strength; various models involving free fields, XY spins, or flux lines in 2D or 3D; and geometrical models such as polymers or clusters. We make connections with quantum dynamics, in particular with "charge sharpening" in 1D, by giving a formalism for measurement of classical stochastic processes: e.g. we give a purely hydrodynamic derivation of the known effective field theory for charge sharpening. We discuss qualitative differences between RG flows for the above measured systems, described by $N\to 1$ replica limits, and those for disordered systems, described by $N\to 0$ limits. In addition to discussing measurement of critical states, we give a unifying treatment of a family of inference problems for non-critical states. These are related to the Nishimori line in the phase diagram of the random-bond Ising model, and are relevant to various quantum error correction problems. We describe distinct physical interpretations of conditioned ensembles and note interesting open questions.

Title: Demonstrating Correlation Trends in the Electric Dipole Polarizabilities of Many Low-lying States in Cesium (Cs I) through First-principle Calculations
Authors: A. Chakraborty, B. K. Sahoo
Abstract: Electron correlation and higher-order relativistic effects are probed in the evaluation of scalar and tensor static electric dipole (E1) polarizabilities ($\alpha_d$) of several even- and odd-parity states in cesium (Cs) using the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method, second-order perturbation theory (MBPT(2)), third-order perturbation theory (MBPT(3)), random phase approximation (RPA), and singles and doubles approximated relativistic coupled-cluster (RCCSD) method. To account for perturbation due to odd-parity E1 operator on the atomic orbitals, calculations are carried out in the linear response approach. Our final $\alpha_d$ values, with the estimated uncertainties, show reasonably good agreement with the previous calculations and available experimental results. Differences among the DHF, MBPT(2), MBPT(3) and RPA results indicate pair-correlation (PC) effects play major roles than the core-polarization (CP) effects in the determination of $\alpha_d$ values in Cs. From the differences among the MBPT(3) and RCC results, we find correlations among the PC and CP effects and double CP effects together are also significant in these calculations. Contributions from the Breit interactions are found to be quite large in the high-lying states.

Title: Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality in $τ^+ τ^-$ at the LHC using Machine Learning for Neutrino Reconstruction
Authors: Yulei Zhang, Bai-Hong Zhou, Qi-Bin Liu, Shu Li, Shih-Chieh Hsu, Tao Han, Matthew Low, Tong Arthur Wu
Abstract: Experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have accumulated an unprecedented amount of data corresponding to a large variety of quantum states. Although searching for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics remains a high priority for the LHC program, precision measurements of the physical processes predicted in the Standard Model continue to lead us to a deeper understanding of nature at high energies. We carry out detailed simulations for the process $pp \to \tau^+\tau^- X$ to perform quantum tomography and to measure the quantum entanglement and the Bell nonlocality of the $\tau^+\tau^-$ two qubit state, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. By using advanced machine learning techniques for neutrino momentum reconstruction, we achieve precise measurements of the full spin density matrix, a critical advantage over previous studies limited by reconstruction challenges for missing momenta. Our analysis reveals a clear observation of Bell nonlocality with high statistical significance, surpassing 5$\sigma$, establishing $\tau^+ \tau^-$ as an ideal system for quantum information studies in high-energy collisions. Given its experimental feasibility and the high expected sensitivity for Bell nonlocality, we propose that $\tau^+ \tau^-$ should be regarded as the new benchmark system for quantum information studies at the LHC, complementing and extending the insights gained from the $t\bar{t}$ system.

Title: Linear Time Iterative Decoders for Hypergraph-Product and Lifted-Product Codes
Authors: Asit Kumar Pradhan, Nithin Raveendran, Narayanan Rengaswamy, Bane Vasić
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes with asymptotically non-zero rates are prominent candidates for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation, primarily due to their syndrome-measurement circuit's low operational depth. Numerous studies advocate for the necessity of fast decoders to fully harness the capabilities of QLDPC codes, thus driving the focus towards designing low-complexity iterative decoders. However, empirical investigations indicate that such iterative decoders are susceptible to having a high error floor while decoding QLDPC codes. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the decoding failures of the \emph{hypergraph-product} and \emph{lifted-product} codes and to design decoders that mitigate these failures, thus achieving a reduced error floor. The suboptimal performance of these codes can predominantly be ascribed to two structural phenomena: (1) stabilizer-induced trapping sets, which are subgraphs formed by stabilizers, and (2) classical trapping sets, which originate from the classical codes utilized in the construction of hypergraph-product and lifted-product codes. The dynamics of stabilizer-induced trapping sets is examined and a straightforward modification of iterative decoders is proposed to circumvent these trapping sets. Moreover, this work proposes a systematic methodology for designing decoders that can circumvent classical trapping sets in both hypergraph product and lifted product codes, from decoders capable of avoiding their trapping set in the parent classical LDPC code. When decoders that can avoid stabilizer-induced trapping sets are run in parallel with those that can mitigate the effect of classical TS, the logical error rate improves significantly in the error-floor region.

Title: Topological Feature of Real-time Fisher Zeros
Authors: Yuchen Meng, Yang Liu, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: There are numerous methods to characterize topology and its boundary zero modes, yet their statistical mechanical properties have not received as much attention as other approaches. Here, we investigate the Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics of topological models, revealing that boundary zero modes can be described by an overlooked real-time Fisher zero pairing effect. This effect is validated in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain model, with the latter exhibiting a Fisher zero braiding picture. Topological zero modes exhibit robustness even when non-Hermiticity is introduced into the system and display characteristics of imaginary-time crystals when the energy eigenvalues are complex. We further examine the real-time Fisher zeros of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, which maps to the Kitaev chain. We present a fractal picture of the Fisher zeros, illustrating how interactions eliminate topology. The mechanism of zero-pairing provides a natural statistical mechanical approach to understanding the connection between topology and many-body physics.

Title: Observing Spatial Charge and Spin Correlations in a Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gas
Authors: Cyprien Daix, Maxime Dixmerias, Yuan-Yao He, Joris Verstraten, Tim de Jongh, Bruno Peaudecerf, Shiwei Zhang, Tarik Yefsah
Abstract: Two-dimensional correlated fermions constitute a cornerstone of quantum matter, covering a broad fundamental and technological scope, and have attracted increasing interest with the emergence of modern materials such as high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, graphene, topological insulators, and Moiré structures. Atom-based quantum simulators provide a new pathway to understand the microscopic mechanisms occurring at the heart of such systems. In this work, we explore two-dimensional attractive Fermi gases at the microscopic level by probing spatial charge and spin correlations in situ. Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal a marked dip in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.

Title: Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Networks for solving Navier-Stokes equations
Authors: Tatjana Protasevich, Mikhail Surmach, Aleksandr Sedykh, Olga Tsurkan, Matvei Anoshin, Vadim Lopatkin, Leonid Fedichkin
Abstract: Understanding and solving fluid dynamics equations efficiently remains a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Traditional numerical solvers and physics-informed neural networks struggle to capture the full range of frequency components in partial differential equation solutions, limiting their accuracy and efficiency. Here, we propose the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network, a novel neural architecture that integrates quantum and classical layers in parallel to improve the accuracy of solving fluid dynamics equations, namely Kovasznay flow problem. This approach decomposes the solution into separate frequency components, each predicted by independent Parallel Hybrid Networks, simplifying the training process and enhancing performance. We evaluated the proposed model against a comparable classical neural network, the Multi-stream Physics Classical Network, in both data-driven and physics-driven scenarios. Our results show that the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network achieves a reduction in root mean square error by 36% for velocity components and 41% for pressure prediction compared to the classical model, while using 24% fewer trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures for advancing computational fluid dynamics.

Title: Quantum-amplified global-phase spectroscopy on an optical clock transition
Authors: Leon Zaporski, Qi Liu, Gustavo Velez, Matthew Radzihovsky, Zeyang Li, Simone Colombo, Edwin Pedrozo-Peñafiel, Vladan Vuletić
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) are at the forefront of precision metrology, operating near a standard quantum limit (SQL) set by quantum noise. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit, yet there remain practical roadblocks concerning scalability and measurement resolution requirements. Here, we adapt the holonomic quantum-gate concept to develop a novel Rabi-type "global-phase spectroscopy" (GPS) that utilizes the detuning-sensitive global Aharanov-Anandan phase. With this approach, we are able to demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy in an OLC that achieves 2.4(7) dB metrological gain without subtracting the laser noise, and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the SQL. We further introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light-atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-canceling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily owing to the global nature of entangling interaction, and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits.

Title: Integrated sub-terahertz cavity electro-optic transduction
Authors: Kevin K. S. Multani, Jason F. Herrmann, Emilio A. Nanni, Amir H. Safavi-Naeini
Abstract: Emerging communications and computing technologies will rely ever-more on expanding the useful radio frequency (RF) spectrum into the sub-THz and THz frequency range. Both classical and quantum applications would benefit from advancing integration and incorporation of sub-THz and electro-optic technologies into common devices, such as modulators. Here we demonstrate an integrated triply-resonant, superconducting electro-optic transducer. Our design incorporates an on-chip $107$ GHz sub-THz niobium titanium nitride superconducting resonator, modulating a thin-film lithium niobate optical racetrack resonator operating at telecom wavelengths. We observe a maximum photon transduction efficiency of $\eta_{\text{OE}}\approx 0.82\times 10^{-6}$ and an average single-photon electro-optic interaction rate of $g_0/2\pi\approx 0.7$ kHz. We also present a study and analysis of the challenges associated with the design of integrated sub-THz resonators and propose possible solutions to these challenges. Our work paves the way for further advancements in resonant electro-optic technologies operating at sub-THz frequencies.

Title: Proposal for an experiment to verify Wigner's rotation at non-relativistic speeds with massive spin-$1/2$ particles
Authors: Veiko Palge, Jacob Dunningham, Yuji Hasegawa, Christian Pfeifer
Abstract: The Wigner rotation of quantum particles with spin is one of the fascinating consequences of interplay between special relativity and quantum mechanics. In this paper we show that a direct experimental verification of Wigner's rotation is in principle accessible in the regime of non-relativistic velocities at $\sim 10^3$ m/s for massive spin-$1/2$ particles. We discuss how the experiment could be carried out in a laboratory using cold neutrons. The measurement at non-relativistic velocities becomes possible through letting neutrons propagate for a sufficiently long time because Wigner rotation is a cumulative effect.

Title: Quantum Advantage for Multi-option Portfolio Pricing and Valuation Adjustments
Authors: Jeong Yu Han, Bin Cheng, Dinh-Long Vu, Patrick Rebentrost
Abstract: A critical problem in the financial world deals with the management of risk, from regulatory risk to portfolio risk. Many such problems involve the analysis of securities modelled by complex dynamics that cannot be captured analytically, and hence rely on numerical techniques that simulate the stochastic nature of the underlying variables. These techniques may be computationally difficult or demanding. Hence, improving these methods offers a variety of opportunities for quantum algorithms. In this work, we study the problem of Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) which has significant importance in the valuation of derivative portfolios. As a variant, we also consider the problem of pricing a portfolio of many different financial options. We propose quantum algorithms that accelerate statistical sampling processes to approximate the price of the multi-option portfolio and the CVA under different measures of dispersion. Technically, our algorithms are based on enhancing the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms by Montanaro with an unbiased version of quantum amplitude estimation. We analyse the conditions under which we may employ these techniques and demonstrate the application of QMC techniques on CVA approximation when particular bounds for the variance of CVA are known.

Title: Accurate and Honest Approximation of Correlated Qubit Noise
Authors: F. Setiawan, Alexander V. Gramolin, Elisha S. Matekole, Hari Krovi, Jacob M. Taylor
Abstract: Accurate modeling of noise in realistic quantum processors is critical for constructing fault-tolerant quantum computers. While a full simulation of actual noisy quantum circuits provides information about correlated noise among all qubits and is therefore accurate, it is, however, computationally expensive as it requires resources that grow exponentially with the number of qubits. We propose an efficient systematic construction of approximate noise channels, where their accuracy can be enhanced by incorporating noise components with higher qubit-qubit correlation degree. To formulate such approximate channels, we first present a method, dubbed the cluster expansion approach, to decompose the Lindbladian generator of an actual noise channel into components based on interqubit correlation degree. We generate a $k$-th order approximate noise channel by truncating the cluster expansion and incorporating noise components with correlations up to the $k$-th degree. We require that the approximate noise channels must be accurate and also ``honest", i.e., the actual errors are not underestimated in our physical models. As an example application, we apply our method to model noise in a three-qubit quantum processor that stabilizes a [[2,0,2]] codeword, which is one of the four Bell states. We find that, for realistic noise strength typical for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits coupled via always-on static interactions, correlated noise beyond two-qubit correlation can significantly affect the code simulation accuracy. Since our approach provides a systematic characterization of multi-qubit noise correlations, it enables the potential for accurate, honest and scalable approximations to simulate large numbers of qubits from full modeling or experimental characterizations of small enough quantum subsystems, which are efficient but still retain essential noise features of the entire device.

Title: Photon Number-Resolving Quantum Reservoir Computing
Authors: Sam Nerenberg, Oliver D. Neill, Giulia Marcucci, Daniele Faccio
Abstract: Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.

Title: Biased Estimator Channels for Classical Shadows
Authors: Zhenyu Cai, Adrian Chapman, Hamza Jnane, Bálint Koczor
Abstract: Extracting classical information from quantum systems is of fundamental importance, and classical shadows allow us to extract a large amount of information using relatively few measurements. Conventional shadow estimators are unbiased and thus approach the true mean in the infinite-sample limit. In this work, we consider a biased scheme, intentionally introducing a bias by rescaling the conventional classical shadows estimators can reduce the error in the finite-sample regime. The approach is straightforward to implement and requires no quantum resources. We analytically prove average case as well as worst- and best-case scenarios, and rigorously prove that it is, in principle, always worth biasing the estimators. We illustrate our approach in a quantum simulation task of a $12$-qubit spin-ring problem and demonstrate how estimating expected values of non-local perturbations can be significantly more efficient using our biased scheme.

Title: Controlling measurement-induced phase transitions with tunable detector coupling
Authors: Ritu Nehra, Alessandro Romito, Dganit Meidan
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.

Title: Multi-Path and Multi-Particle Tests of Complex vs. Hyper-Complex Quantum Theory
Authors: Ece İpek Saruhan, Joachim von Zanthier, Marc-Oliver Pleinert
Abstract: The axioms of quantum mechanics provide limited information regarding the structure of the Hilbert space, such as the underlying number system. The latter is generally regarded as complex, but generalizations of complex numbers, so-called hyper-complex numbers, cannot be ruled out in theory. Therefore, specialized experiments to test for hyper-complex quantum mechanics are needed. To date, experimental tests are limited to single-particle interference exploiting a closed phase relation in a three-path interferometer called the Peres test. The latter distinguishes complex quantum mechanics from quaternionic quantum mechanics. Here, we propose a general matrix formalism putting the Peres test on a solid mathematical ground. On this basis, we introduce multi-path and multi-particle interference tests, which provide a direct probe for any dimension of the number system of quantum mechanics.

Title: Mirror-enhanced acceleration-induced geometric phase
Authors: Dipankar Barman, Debasish Ghosh, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect contains great amount of theoretical importance in various branches of physics. Requirement of very high acceleration hinders its experimental evidence. We put forward an idea to experimentally probe this effect by utilizing the Pancharatnam-Berry phase of an accelerated atom in presence of mirrors. We show that for much lower accelerations, the phase gets significantly enhanced in the presence of mirrors. We propose a schematic design of an interferometric set-up to experimentally capture this effect by utilizing the phase difference between an accelerated and an inertial atoms. For the choice of hydrogen atoms and suitable separation between atoms and mirrors, the required acceleration can be very low.

Title: Time-dependent Hamiltonian Simulation via Magnus Expansion: Algorithm and Superconvergence
Authors: Di Fang, Diyi Liu, Rahul Sarkar
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation becomes more challenging as the underlying unitary becomes more oscillatory. In such cases, an algorithm with commutator scaling and a weak dependence, such as logarithmic, on the derivatives of the Hamiltonian is desired. We introduce a new time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation algorithm based on the Magnus series expansion that exhibits both features. Importantly, when applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, we prove that the commutator in the second-order algorithm leads to a surprising fourth-order superconvergence, with an error preconstant independent of the number of spatial grids. This extends the qHOP algorithm [An, Fang, Lin, Quantum 2022] based on first-order Magnus expansion, and the proof of superconvergence is based on semiclassical analysis that is of independent interest.

Title: Charge and Spin Sharpening Transitions on Dynamical Quantum Trees
Authors: Xiaozhou Feng, Nadezhda Fishchenko, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Matteo Ippoliti
Abstract: The dynamics of monitored systems can exhibit a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) between entangling and disentangling phases, tuned by the measurement rate. When the dynamics obeys a continuous symmetry, the entangling phase further splits into a fuzzy phase and a sharp phase based on the scaling of fluctuations of the symmetry charge. While the sharpening transition for Abelian symmetries is well understood analytically, no such understanding exists for the non- Abelian case. In this work, building on a recent analytical solution of the MIPT on tree-like circuit architectures (where qubits are repatedly added or removed from the system in a recursive pattern), we study entanglement and sharpening transitions in monitored dynamical quantum trees obeying U (1) and SU (2) symmetries. The recursive structure of tree tensor networks enables powerful analytical and numerical methods to determine the phase diagrams in both cases. In the U (1) case, we analytically derive a Fisher-KPP-like differential equation that allows us to locate the critical point and identify its properties. We find that the entanglement/purification and sharpening transitions generically occur at distinct measurement rates. In the SU (2) case, we find that the fuzzy phase is generic, and a sharp phase is possible only in the limit of maximal measurement rate. In this limit, we analytically solve the boundaries separating the fuzzy and sharp phases, and find them to be in agreement with exact numerical simulations.

Title: Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing
Authors: Jean-Gabriel Hartmann, Denis Janković, Rémi Pasquier, Mario Ruben, Paul-Antoine Hervieux
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.

Title: Geometric measure of quantum complexity in cosmological systems
Authors: Satyaki Chowdhury, Martin Bojowald, Jakub Mielczarek
Abstract: In Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum complexity, the introduction of a suitable geometrical space, based on the Lie group formed by fundamental operators, facilitates the identification of complexity through geodesic distance in the group manifold. Earlier work has shown that the computation of geodesic distance can be challenging for Lie groups relevant to harmonic oscillators. Here, this problem is approached by working to leading order in an expansion by the structure constants of the Lie group. An explicit formula for an upper bound on the quantum complexity of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with time-dependent frequency is derived. Applied to a massless test scalar field on a cosmological de Sitter background, the upper bound on complexity as a function of the scale factor exhibits a logarithmic increase on super-Hubble scales. This result aligns with the gate complexity and earlier studies of de Sitter complexity. It demonstrates the consistent application of Nielsen complexity to quantum fields in cosmological backgrounds and paves the way for further applications.

Title: Noise-tolerant public-key quantum money from a classical oracle
Authors: Peter Yuen
Abstract: Quantum money is the task of verifying the validity of banknotes while ensuring that they cannot be counterfeited. Public-key quantum money allows anyone to perform verification, while the private-key setting restricts the ability to verify to banks, as in Wiesner's original scheme. The current state of technological progress means that errors are impossible to entirely suppress, hence the requirement for noise-tolerant schemes. We show for the first time how to achieve noise-tolerance in the public-key setting. Our techniques follow Aaronson and Christiano's oracle model, where we use the ideas of quantum error correction to extend their scheme: a valid banknote is now a subspace state possibly affected by noise, and verification is performed by using classical oracles to check for membership in "larger spaces." Additionally, a banknote in our scheme is minted by preparing conjugate coding states and applying a unitary that permutes the standard basis vectors.

Title: Approximate inverse measurement channel for shallow shadows
Authors: Riccardo Cioli, Elisa Ercolessi, Matteo Ippoliti, Xhek Turkeshi, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: Classical shadows are a versatile tool to probe many-body quantum systems, consisting of a combination of randomised measurements and classical post-processing computations. In a recently introduced version of the protocol, the randomization step is performed via unitary circuits of variable depth $t$, defining the so-called shallow shadows. For sufficiently large $t$, this approach allows one to get around the use of non-local unitaries to probe global properties such as the fidelity with respect to a target state or the purity. Still, shallow shadows involve the inversion of a many-body map, the measurement channel, which requires non-trivial computations in the post-processing step, thus limiting its applicability when the number of qubits $N$ is large. In this work, we put forward a simple approximate post-processing scheme where the infinite-depth inverse channel is applied to the finite-depth classical shadows and study its performance for fidelity and purity estimation. The scheme allows for different circuit connectivity, as we illustrate for geometrically local circuits in one and two spatial dimensions and geometrically non-local circuits made of two-qubit gates. For the fidelity, we find that the resulting estimator coincides with a known linear cross-entropy, achieving an arbitrary small approximation error $\delta$ at depth $t=O(\log (N/\delta))$ (independent of the circuit connectivity). For the purity, we show that the estimator becomes accurate at a depth $O(N)$. In addition, at those depths, the variances of both the fidelity and purity estimators display the same scaling with $N$ as in the case of global random unitaries. We establish these bounds by analytic arguments and extensive numerical computations in several cases of interest. Our work extends the applicability of shallow shadows to large system sizes and general circuit connectivity.

Title: Emergent non-Hermitian conservation laws at exceptional points
Authors: Zuo Wang, Liang He
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems can manifest rich static and dynamical properties at their exceptional points (EPs). Here, we identify yet another class of distinct phenomena that is hinged on EPs, namely, the emergence of a series of non-Hermitian conservation laws. We demonstrate these distinct phenomena concretely in the non-Hermitian Heisenberg chain and formulate a general theory for identifying these emergent non-Hermitian conservation laws at EPs. By establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the constant of motions at EPs and those in corresponding auxiliary Hermitian systems, we trace their physical origin back to the presence of emergent symmetries in the auxiliary systems. Concrete simulations on quantum circuits show that these emergent conserved dynamics can be readily observed in current digital quantum computing systems.

Title: Quantum metrological capability as a probe for quantum phase transition
Authors: Xiangbei Li, Yaoming Chu, Shaoliang Zhang, Jianming Cai
Abstract: The comprehension of quantum phase transitions (QPTs) is considered as a critical foothold in the field of many-body physics. Developing protocols to effectively identify and understand QPTs thus represents a key but challenging task for present quantum simulation experiments. Here, we establish a dynamical quench-interferometric framework to probe a zero-temperature QPT, which utilizes the evolved state by quenching the QPT Hamiltonian as input of a unitary interferometer. The metrological capability quantified by the quantum Fisher information captivatingly shows an unique peak in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, allowing us to probe the QPT without cooling the system to its ground state. We show that the probing can be implemented by extracting quantum fluctuations of the interferometric generator as well as parameter estimation uncertainty of the interferometric phase, and subsequently allows identifying the boundary of the phase diagram. Our results establish an important link between QPTs and quantum metrology, and enrich the toolbox of studying non-equilibrium many-body physics in current quantum simulators.

Title: GAN decoder on a quantum toric code for noise-robust quantum teleportation
Authors: Jiaxin Li, Zhimin Wang, Alberto Ferrara, Yongjian Gu, Rosario Lo Franco
Abstract: Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a strong deep learning model that has shown its value in applications such as image processing and data enhancement. Here, we propose a GAN-based quantum topological toric code decoder and we apply it to devise a quantum teleportation protocol which is robust to depolarizing noisy environments. We construct the generator and discriminator networks of GAN, train the network using the eigenvalue dataset of the toric code, and obtain an optimized decoder with a high decoding threshold compared to some existing decoders. The simulation experiments at code distances $d=3$ and $d=5$ show that the fidelity threshold of this GAN decoder is about $P=0.2108$, which is significantly larger than the threshold $P=0.1099$ of the classical decoding model. Also, the quantum teleportation protocol, optimized for noise resistance under $d=3$ and $d=5$ topological code, shows a fidelity improvement within the depolarizing noise threshold range of $P<0.06503$ and $P<0.07512$, respectively. With appropriate dataset training, the decoder can be adapted to other error models. More broadly, the proposed GAN model provides a novel approach for topological code decoders, offering a versatile framework for different types of noise processing.

Title: Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing with a Parametric Superconducting Resonator
Authors: Guillaume Beaulieu, Fabrizio Minganti, Simone Frasca, Marco Scigliuzzo, Simone Felicetti, Roberto Di Candia, Pasquale Scarlino
Abstract: Quantum metrology, a cornerstone of quantum technologies, exploits entanglement and superposition to achieve higher precision than classical protocols in parameter estimation tasks. When combined with critical phenomena such as phase transitions, the divergence of quantum fluctuations is predicted to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Here, we implement a critical quantum sensor using a superconducting parametric (i.e., two-photon driven) Kerr resonator. The sensor, a linear resonator terminated by a supercondicting quantum interference device, operates near the critical point of a finite-component second-order dissipative phase transition obtained by scaling the system parameters. We analyze the performance of a frequency-estimation protocol and show that quadratic precision scaling with respect to the system size can be achieved with finite values of the Kerr nonlinearity. Since each photon emitted from the cavity carries more information about the parameter to be estimated compared to its classical counterpart, our protocol opens perspectives for faster or more precise metrological protocols. Our results demonstrate that quantum advantage in a sensing protocol can be achieved by exploiting a finite-component phase transition.

Title: Strong Converse Exponent of Quantum Dichotomies
Authors: Mario Berta, Yongsheng Yao
Abstract: The quantum dichotomies problem asks at what rate one pair of quantum states can be approximately mapped into another pair of quantum states. In the many copy limit and for vanishing error, the optimal rate is known to be given by the ratio of the respective quantum relative distances. Here, we study the large-deviation behavior of quantum dichotomies and determine the exact strong converse exponent based on the purified distance. This is the first time to establish the exact high-error large-deviation analysis for this task in fully quantum setting.

Title: Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks
Authors: Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.

Title: Quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for multijet clustering
Authors: Hideki Okawa, Xian-Zhe Tao, Qing-Guo Zeng, Man-Hong Yung
Abstract: Jet clustering or reconstruction is a crucial component at high energy colliders, a procedure to identify sprays of collimated particles originating from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons. It is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem and requires intensive computing resources. In this study, we formulate jet reconstruction as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and introduce novel quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for clustering multiple jets in electron-positron collision events. One of these quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms, ballistic simulated bifurcation, overcomes problems previously observed in multijet clustering with quantum-annealing approaches. We find that both the distance defined in the QUBO matrix and the prediction power of the QUBO solvers have crucial impacts on the multijet clustering performance. This study opens up a new approach to globally reconstructing multijet beyond dijet in one go, in contrast to the traditional iterative method.

Title: Measurement-device-independent quantum-secret-sharing networks with linear Bell-state analysis
Authors: Tianqi Liu, Jiancheng Lai, Zhenhua Li, Tao Li
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) plays a pivotal role in multiparty quantum communication, ensuring the secure distribution of private information among multiple parties. However, the security of QSS schemes can be compromised by attacks exploiting imperfections in measurement devices. Here, we propose a reconfigurable approach to implement QSS based on measurement-device-independent (MDI) principles, utilizing linear two-photon Bell state this http URL employing single-qubit conjugate operations for encoding private classical information, our approach offers reconfigurability, allowing for the inclusion of additional parties without sacrificing efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust security of our MDI-QSS scheme against inter-eavesdropping by dishonest participants and establish lower bounds for secure communication among three legitimate parties. This work presents a flexible configuration for implementing multiparty secure quantum communication with imperfect measurement devices and represents a significant advancement in the development of secure quantum communication technologies.

Title: An Exponential Separation Between Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms for Linear Systems
Authors: Allan Grønlund, Kasper Green Larsen
Abstract: Achieving a provable exponential quantum speedup for an important machine learning task has been a central research goal since the seminal HHL quantum algorithm for solving linear systems and the subsequent quantum recommender systems algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash. These algorithms were initially believed to be strong candidates for exponential speedups, but a lower bound ruling out similar classical improvements remained absent. In breakthrough work by Tang, it was demonstrated that this lack of progress in classical lower bounds was for good reasons. Concretely, she gave a classical counterpart of the quantum recommender systems algorithm, reducing the quantum advantage to a mere polynomial. Her approach is quite general and was named quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Since then, almost all the initially exponential quantum machine learning speedups have been reduced to polynomial via new quantum-inspired classical algorithms. From the current state-of-affairs, it is unclear whether we can hope for exponential quantum speedups for any natural machine learning task. In this work, we present the first such provable exponential separation between quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for the basic problem of solving a linear system when the input matrix is well-conditioned and has sparse rows and columns.

Title: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem via Different Quantum Computing Architectures
Authors: Venkat Padmasola, Zhaotong Li, Rupak Chatterjee, Wesley Dyk
Abstract: We study the application of emerging photonic and quantum computing architectures to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known NP-hard optimization problem. We investigate several approaches: Simulated Annealing (SA), Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO-Ising) methods implemented on quantum annealers and Optical Coherent Ising Machines, as well as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm on gate-based quantum computers. QAOA and QPE were tested on the IBM Quantum platform. The QUBO-Ising method was explored using the D-Wave quantum annealer, which operates on superconducting Josephson junctions, and the Quantum Computing Inc (QCi) Dirac-1 entropy quantum optimization machine. Gate-based quantum computers demonstrated accurate results for small TSP instances in simulation. However, real quantum devices are hindered by noise and limited scalability. Circuit complexity grows with problem size, restricting performance to TSP instances with a maximum of 6 nodes. In contrast, Ising-based architectures show improved scalability for larger problem sizes. SQUID-based Ising machines can handle TSP instances with up to 12 nodes, while entropy computing implemented in hybrid optoelectronic components extend this capability to 18 nodes. Nevertheless, the solutions tend to be suboptimal due to hardware limitations and challenges in achieving ground state convergence as the problem size increases. Despite these limitations, Ising machines demonstrate significant time advantages over classical methods, making them a promising candidate for solving larger-scale TSPs efficiently.

Title: An Operational Quantum Field Theoretic Model for Gravitationally Induced Entanglement
Authors: Jackson Yant, Miles Blencowe
Abstract: We develop a quantum field-theoretic model of gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two massive objects in spatial superposition. The masses are described as excitations of a scalar field in an external harmonic potential, allowing for a well-defined notion of relativistic coherent states. Using linearized quantum gravity in the static limit, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that induces entanglement between the field modes occupied by the masses. To probe this entanglement, we construct an observable from field operators that corresponds to the probability density of detecting the center of mass of one of these massive objects. Using this, we compute the fringe visibility in the overlap region and find that gravitationally induced entanglement leads to a decrease in visibility, consistent with previous nonrelativistic results. Additionally, we identify relativistic corrections that accelerate the decay of fringe visibility. These results provide a framework for studying weakly relativistic quantum field systems and their gravitational interactions in tabletop experiments.

We derive the eigensystems by solving the Schr\''odinger-like equation which describes this system. We construct coherent states a Gazeau-Klauder for this system. We show that these states satisfy the Klauder's mathematical condition to build coherent states. We compute and analyse some statistical properties of these states. We find that these states exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics. We also evaluate quasiprobability distributions such as the Wigner function to demonstrate graphically nonclassical features of these states.

Abstract: Measures characterizing the non-Markovianity degree of the quantum dynamics have several drawbacks when applied to real devices. They depend on the chosen measurement time interval and are highly sensitive to experimental noise and errors. We propose several techniques to enhance the practical applicability of the measures and verify our findings experimentally on a superconducting transmon and a trapped-ion qubit. The time dependence can be disregarded by introduction of the measure per oscillation, while the sensitivity to noise is reduced by applying a regularization procedure. The results for both types of qubits are compared with theoretical predictions for a simple model of non-Markovianity based on qubit-qubit interaction.

Authors: Alexander I. Zenchuk, Wentao Qi, Junde Wu
Abstract: We further develop the family of matrix-manipulation algorithms based on the encoding the matrix elements into the probability amplitudes of the pure superposition state of a certain quantum system. We introduce two extensions to these algorithms which allow (i) to perform Hermitian conjugation of matrices under consideration and (ii) to weaken the restriction to the absolute values of matrix elements unavoidably imposed by the normalization condition for a pure quantum state. Both these extensions are applied to the matrix multiplication algorithm. Controlled measurement of ancilla state is implemented to avoid the problem of small success probability in the measurement process.

Title: Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands
Authors: Yutao Hu, Chao Yang, Yucheng Wang
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.

Title: Quantum "Teleportation" using local correlations
Authors: B. C. Sanctuary, Mangala Sunder Krishnan, S. Presse, Wei Chen
Abstract: The phenomenon called quantum "teleportation" has been formulated assuming the presence of entangled states and is interpreted as a realization of quantum non-locality. In contrast, correlations from both entanglement and disentanglement upon particle spearation exists and both of these are built into the EPR pair as they move apart. Here it is shown that quantum "teleportaton" can be formulated and interpreted without invoking a non-local hypothesis of quantum mechanics, and is better descrited as "quantum state selection".

Title: Correlations in Entangled States
Authors: B. C. Sanctuary
Abstract: Entangled EPR spin pairs can be treated using the statistical ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics. As such the singlet state results from an ensemble of spin pairs each with its own specific axis of quantization. This axis acts like a quantum mechanical hidden variable. If the spins lose coherence they disentangle into a mixed state that contains classical correlations. In this paper an infinitesimal phase decoherence is introduced to the singlet state in order to reveal more clearly some of the correlations. It is shown that a singlet state has no classical correlations.

Title: Signatures of Enhanced Superconducting Properties in Niobium Cavities

Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. Additionally, we report measurements of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of two Nb SRF cavities processed using distinct methods. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.

Title: On the metric property of quantum Wasserstein divergences
Authors: Gergely Bunth, József Pitrik, Tamás Titkos, Dániel Virosztek
Abstract: Quantum Wasserstein divergences are modified versions of quantum Wasserstein distances defined by channels, and they are conjectured to be genuine metrics on quantum state spaces by De Palma and Trevisan. We prove triangle inequality for quantum Wasserstein divergences for every quantum system described by a separable Hilbert space and any quadratic cost operator under the assumption that a particular state involved is pure, and all the states have finite energy. We also provide strong numerical evidence suggesting that the triangle inequality holds in general, for an arbitrary choice of states.

Title: Quantum entanglement in a pure state of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems
Authors: Yunori Nishikawa, Tomoki Yoshioka
Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to quantum impurity systems consisting of several sites and the single impurity Anderson model to study the relationship between their states and the behaviors of quantum informative quantities. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.

Authors: Michael A. Fedderke, Roni Harnik, David E. Kaplan, Sam Posen, Surjeet Rajendran, Francesco Serra, Vyacheslav P. Yakovlev
Abstract: We describe a gyroscope that measures rotation based on the effects of the rotation on the polarization of light. Rotation induces a differential phase shift in the propagation of left- and right-circularly polarized light and this phase shift can be measured in suitably designed interferometric setups. The signal in this setup is independent of the frequency of light, unlike various sources of noise such as vibrations, which cause phase shifts that depend on the frequency. Such vibrations are the practical limit on the sensitivity of conventional Sagnac-style optical interferometers that are typically used as gyroscopes. In the proposed setup, one can potentially mitigate this source of noise by simultaneously using two (or more) sources of light that have different frequencies. The signal in this setup scales with the total storage time of the light. Due to its frequency independence, it is thus most optimal to measure the signal using superconducting radio-frequency systems where the high finesse of the available cavities enables considerably longer storage times than is possible in an optical setup.

Title: Memory Kernel Coupling Theory: Obtain Time Correlation Function from Higher-order Moments
Authors: Wei Liu, Yu Su, Yao Wang, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: Dynamical observables can often be described by time correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum system--the spin-boson model.

Title: Robustness of electron charge shuttling: Architectures, pulses, charge defects and noise thresholds
Authors: Minjun Jeon, Simon C. Benjamin, Andrew J.Fisher
Abstract: In semiconductor-based quantum technologies, the capability to shuttle charges between components is profoundly enabling. We numerically simulated various "conveyor-belt" shuttling scenarios for simple Si/SiO2 devices, explicitly modelling the electron's wave function using grid-based split-operator methods and a time-dependent 2D potential (obtained from a Poisson solver). This allowed us to fully characterise the electron loss probability and excitation fraction. Remarkably, with as few as three independent electrodes the process can remain near-perfectly adiabatic even in the presence of pulse imperfection, nearby charge defects, and Johnson-Nyquist noise. Only a substantial density of charge defects, or defects at 'adversarial' locations, can catastrophically disrupt the charge shuttling. While we do not explicitly model the spin or valley degrees of freedom, our results from this charge propagation study support the conclusion that conveyor-belt shuttling is an excellent candidate for providing connectivity in semiconductor quantum devices.

Title: Spectral decomposition of field operators and causal measurement in quantum field theory
Authors: Robert Oeckl (CCM-UNAM)
Abstract: We construct the spectral decomposition of field operators in bosonic quantum field theory as a limit of a strongly continuous family of positive-operator-valued measure decompositions. The latter arise from integrals over families of bounded positive operators. Crucially, these operators have the same locality properties as the underlying field operators. We use the decompositions to construct families of quantum operations implementing measurements of the field observables. Again, the quantum operations have the same locality properties as the field operators. What is more, we show that these quantum operations do not lead to superluminal signaling and are possible measurements on quantum fields in the sense of Sorkin.

Title: Exceptional Points and Stability in Nonlinear Models of Population Dynamics having $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry
Authors: Alexander Felski, Flore K. Kunst
Abstract: Nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, for example due to environmental gain-loss processes, are a common occurrence throughout numerous areas of science and lie at the root of many remarkable phenomena. For the latter, parity-time-reflection ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry has played an eminent role in understanding exceptional-point structures and phase transitions in these systems. Yet their interplay has remained by-and-large unexplored. We analyze models governed by the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory and related Lotka-Volterra systems of population dynamics. These are foundational nonlinear models that find widespread application and offer a broad platform for non-Hermitian theory beyond physics. In this context we study the emergence of exceptional points in two cases: (a) when the governing symmetry properties are tied to global properties of the models, and, in contrast, (b) when these symmetries emerge locally around stationary states--in which case the connection between the linear non-Hermitian model and an underlying nonlinear system becomes tenuous. We outline further that when the relevant symmetries are related to global properties, the location of exceptional points in the linearization around coexistence equilibria coincides with abrupt global changes in the stability of the nonlinear dynamics. Exceptional points may thus offer a new local characteristic for the understanding of these systems. Tri-trophic models of population ecology serve as test cases for higher-dimensional systems.

Title: Measuring entanglement without local addressing in quantum many-body simulators via spiral quantum state tomography
Authors: Giacomo Marmorini, Takeshi Fukuhara, Daisuke Yamamoto
Abstract: Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable independent measurements. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the ``spin-spiral'' structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, under various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.

Title: Quantum sampling on a quantum annealer for large volumes in the strong coupling limit for gauge group U(3)
Authors: Jangho Kim, Thomas Luu, Wolfgang Unger
Abstract: In our previous studies [1, 2], we confirmed that a quantum annealer can be used for importance sampling of gauge theories. In this paper, we extend the previous results to larger 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional lattices to generate ensembles for U(3) gauge theory in the strong coupling limit. We make use of the D-Wave quantum annealer to generate histograms for sub-lattices, and use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to determine thermodynamic observables and their dependence on the physical parameters on large volumes. We benchmark our results to those obtained from classical Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Epitaxial Laterally Overgrown Diamond: Towards Up-scaling of Color Center-based Quantum Technologies
Authors: Nimba Oshnik, Sebastian Westrich, Nina Burmeister, Oliver Roman Opaluch, Lahcene Mehmel, Riadh Issaoui, Alexandre Tallaire, Ovidiu Brinza, Jocelyn Achard, Elke Neu
Abstract: Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g., via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.

Title: Stability of Floquet sidebands and quantum coherence in 1D strongly interacting spinless fermions
Authors: Karun Gadge, Salvatore R. Manmana
Abstract: For strongly correlated quantum systems, fundamental questions about the formation and stability of Floquet-Bloch sidebands (FBs) upon periodic driving remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly computing time-dependent single-particle spectral functions using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS). We study interacting metallic and correlated insulating phases in a chain of correlated spinless fermions. At high-frequency driving we obtain clearly separated, long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum. However, if there is significant overlap of the features, which is more probable in the low-frequency regime, the interactions lead to strong heating, which results in a significant loss of quantum coherence and of the FBs. Similar suppression of FBs is obtained in the presence of noise. The emerging picture is further elucidated by the behavior of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.

Title: Time operator from parametrization invariance and implications for cosmology
Authors: N. Dimakis
Abstract: Motivated by the parametrization invariance of cosmological Lagrangians and their equivalence to systems describing the motion of particles in curved backgrounds, we identify the phase space analogue of the notion of proper time. We define the corresponding quantum operator, which results in being canonically conjugate to that of the vanishing Hamiltonian. In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate. Finally, we derive the generic expression for the introduced time variable in the cosmological setting.

Title: Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid
Authors: Yi-Cai Zhang
Abstract: In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.
