Title: Comment on "Unifying Aspects of Generalized Calculus"
Authors: Mikołaj Sienicki, Krzysztof Sienicki
Abstract: Czachor's recent proposal introduces a form of non-Newtonian calculus built by pulling back arithmetic operations through arbitrary bijections between continua. Although the idea is mathematically inventive, it runs into serious conceptual trouble when examined from a physical standpoint. Claims of universal applicability quickly unravel under scrutiny -- especially when considering pathological bijections like the Cantor function, which break the framework's core assumptions. When applied to domains such as relativity, entropy, or cosmology, the results often collapse into tautological restatements lacking real predictive power. This commentary explores these issues in depth, highlighting where and why the formalism falls short of providing a physically coherent theory.

Title: Matrix Inversion by Quantum Walk
Authors: Alastair Kay, Christino Tamon
Abstract: The HHL algorithm for matrix inversion is a landmark algorithm in quantum computation. Its ability to produce a state $|x\rangle$ that is the solution of $Ax=b$, given the input state $|b\rangle$, is envisaged to have diverse applications. In this paper, we substantially simplify the algorithm, originally formed of a complex sequence of phase estimations, amplitude amplifications and Hamiltonian simulations, by replacing the phase estimations with a continuous time quantum walk. The key technique is the use of weak couplings to access the matrix inversion embedded in perturbation theory.

Title: Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information
Authors: Giovanni Cemin, Markus Schmitt, Marin Bukov
Abstract: We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.

Title: Nondegenerate Josephson Mixers with Enhanced Bandwidth and Saturation Power for Quantum Signal Amplification and Transduction
Authors: Baleegh Abdo, Dongbing Shao, Shayne Cairns, Jae-woong Nah, Oblesh Jinka, Srikanth Srinivasan, Thomas McConkey, Vincent Arena, Corrado Mancini
Abstract: Nondegenerate Josephson mixers (JMs), formed by coupling two different transmission-line resonators to Josephson ring modulators (JRMs), are vital and versatile devices capable of processing microwave signals at the quantum limit. Owing to the lossless nondegenerate three-wave mixing process enabled by the JRM, JMs can perform phase preserving amplification of quantum signals, generate two-mode squeezed states, and perform noiseless frequency conversion. However, due to their limited bandwidth and saturation power, such resonator-based JMs are generally unable to simultaneously process frequency-multiplexed signals required in large quantum processors. To overcome this longstanding dual challenge, we redesign the JRM parameters by optimizing its inductances to suppress higher order mixing products and engineer its electromagnetic environment by incorporating lumped-element coupled-mode networks between the JRM and the two distinct ports of the JM. By implementing these strategies, we measure for JMs realized with four coupled modes per port, operated in amplification (conversion), bandwidths of about 400 MHz (700 MHz) with power reflections above 10 dB (below -10 dB) and saturation powers of about -110 dBm at 15 dB (-91 dBm at -26 dB). Similarly, we demonstrate for a low external quality factor resonant-mode JM operated in conversion, a maximum bandwidth of about $670$ MHz with power reflections below -10 dB and a maximum saturation power of about -86 dBm at -17 dB. Such nondegenerate JMs with enhanced bandwidths and saturation powers could serve in a variety of frequency-multiplexed settings ranging from high fidelity qubit readout and unidirectional routing of quantum signals to generation of remote entanglement with continuous variables.

Title: A disputable assumption behind the empirical equivalence between pilot-wave theory and standard quantum mechanics
Authors: J. Manero, R. Muciño, E. Okon
Abstract: The de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory asserts that a complete characterization of an $N$-particle system is given by its wave function together with the (at-all-times-defined) positions of the particles, with the wave function always satisfying the Schrödinger equation and the positions evolving according to the deterministic "guiding equation". A complete agreement with the predictive apparatus of standard quantum mechanics, including the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic Born rule, is then said to emerge from these equations, without having to confer any special status to measurements or observers. Two key elements behind the proof of this complete agreement are absolute uncertainty and the POVM theorem. The former involves an alleged "naturally emerging, irreducible limitation on the possibility of obtaining knowledge within pilot-wave theory" and the latter establishes that the outcome distributions of all measurements are described by POVMs. Here, we argue that the derivations of absolute uncertainty and the POVM theorem depend upon the questionable assumption that "information is always configurationally grounded". We explain in detail why the offered rationale behind such an assumption is deficient and explore the consequences of having to let go of it.

Title: A scalable photonic quantum interconnect platform

Abstract: Many quantum networking applications require efficient photonic interfaces to quantum memories which can be produced at scale and with high yield. Synthetic diamond offers unique potential for the implementation of this technology as it hosts color centers which retain coherent optical interfaces and long spin coherence times in nanophotonic structures. Here, we report a technique enabling wafer-scale processing of thin-film diamond that combines ion implantation and membrane liftoff, high-quality overgrowth, targeted color center implantation, and serial, high-throughput thermocompression bonding with yields approaching unity. The deterministic deposition of thin diamond membranes onto semiconductor substrates facilitates consistent integration of photonic crystal cavities with silicon-vacancy (SiV) quantum memories. We demonstrate reliable, strong coupling of SiVs to photons with cooperativities approaching 100. Furthermore, we show that photonic crystal cavities can be reliably fabricated across several membranes bonded to the same handling chip. Our platform enables modular fabrication where the photonic layer can be integrated with functionalized substrates featuring electronic control lines such as coplanar waveguides for microwave delivery. Finally, we implement passive optical packaging with sub-decibel insertion loss. Together, these advances pave the way to the scalable assembly of optically addressable quantum memory arrays which are a key building block for modular photonic quantum interconnects.

Title: Reducing quantum resources for observable estimation with window-assisted coherent QPE
Authors: Harriet Apel, Cristian L. Cortes, Jessica Lemieux, Mark Steudtner
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) routines are known to fail probabilistically even with perfect gates and input states. This effect stems from an incompatibility of finite-sized quantum registers to capture a phase within QPE with phase angles of infinite precision, and the effect extend even beyond what would be reasonably expected from rounding. This effect can be partially mitigated by biasing the phase register with a window, or taper state, from classical signal processing. This paper focuses on how windowing a coherent QPE used as a subroutine can improve the accuracy of the overall algorithm. Specifically we study the quantum task of estimating observables where window-assisted coherent QPE is used as a subroutine to implement a reflection about an eigenstate. Quantum resource estimates show over 2-orders-of-magnitude reduction in Toffoli counts over the previous costed techniques -- also assisted by the use of improved block encoding techniques -- demonstrating an encouraging decrease in resources for quantum computation of molecular observables. Since QPE, as one of only a few quantum building blocks, appears as a subroutine in many algorithms; this analysis also provides a model for understanding how window functions propagate to an improved error in composite algorithms.

Title: Interference Between Electromagnetic and Mechanical Waves
Authors: Alexandre Cesar Ricardo, Ciro Micheletti Diniz, Celso Jorge Villas-Bôas
Abstract: Classically, wave interference is a phenomenon that can be explained by considering only the waves themselves, that is, without the need to consider the apparatus that monitors or observes them. Thus, in classical theories, interference can only occur between waves of the same nature. In quantum theory, the observed results require a description of the system and its measuring apparatus, which allows us to rethink the explanation of various natural phenomena. In this paper, we consider the ion-trap platform to study the interference of waves with different physical natures, specifically the electromagnetic and mechanical. At first, we drive two lasers onto a single-trapped ion to produce Jaynes-Cummings and Carrier interactions, where we verify that, depending on the phase relationship between the coherent state of the vibrational (mechanical) mode and the Carrier pulse (electromagnetic wave), the interactions enhance or cancel out population transfer to the electronic state of the ion, that works out as our measuring apparatus for those waves. Extending our result to an ion chain, we verify that a precise modulation of the Carrier Rabi frequency and phase (electromagnetic pulse) according to the amplitude of the incoming mechanical coherent state in the ion chain enables creating either constructive or destructive interference with propagating pulses, in which the electronic state of the driven ion is, respectively, populated more and faster, or transparent to both pulse waves, when the information flux behaves as if no external fields are applied. Finally, this new type of controlled interference between waves of different natures allows us to propose new hybrid quantum devices, such as transistors or filters of wave packets, where photonic (phononic) pulses control the passage of phononic (photonic) waves.

Title: Continuous-Time Quantum Markov Chains And Discretizations Of p-Adic Schrödinger Equations: Comparisons And Simulations
Authors: W. A. Zúñiga-Galindo, L. F. Chacón-Cortés
Abstract: The continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) are a fundamental tool in the development of quantum algorithms. Recently, it was shown that discretizations of p-adic Schrödinger equations give rise to continuous-time quantum Markov chains (CTQMCs); this type of Markov chain includes the CTQWs constructed using adjacency matrices of graphs as a particular case. In this paper, we study a large class of p-adic Schrödinger equations and the associated CTQMCs by comparing them with p-adic heat equations and the associated continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). The comparison is done by a mathematical study of the mentioned equations, which requires, for instance, solving the initial value problems attached to the mentioned equations, and through numerical simulations. We conducted multiple simulations, including numerical approximations of the limiting distribution. Our simulations show that the limiting distribution of quantum Markov chains is greater than the stationary probability of their classical counterparts, for a large class of CTQMCs.

Title: Rotation Errors Due to Field Quantization for Simultaneously Driven Atoms
Authors: Hunter Lindemann, Shanon Vuglar, Julio Gea-Banacloche
Abstract: When an electromagnetic field in a coherent or quasiclassical (e.g., squeezed) state is used to simultaneously drive an ensemble of two-level atoms, the quantum nature of the field will, in general, cause the final state of the atoms to differ from the one predicted for a totally classical field. This is a potential source of error in quantum logic gates in which the gate is the rotation of the atoms by a laser. In this paper, we use second order perturbation theory to find how this error scales with the number of atoms, $N$, being driven simultaneously, for an arbitrary rotation angle. The result depends on the initial atomic state: for some highly entangled states, and a field in a coherent state, the error may scale as $N^2$, yet we find that the average over a random distribution of initial states only scales as $N$. We discuss possible ways to mitigate the error, including the use of squeezed states, as well as adjusting the interaction time between the field and atoms to be different from what would be expected from the classical-field treatment.

Title: Unambiguous discrimination of the change point for quantum channels
Authors: Kenji Nakahira
Abstract: Identifying the precise moment when a quantum channel undergoes a change is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory. We study how accurately one can determine the time at which a channel transitions to another. We investigate the quantum limit of the average success probability in unambiguous discrimination, in which errors are completely avoided by allowing inconclusive results with a certain probability. This problem can be viewed as a quantum process discrimination task, where the process consists of a sequence of quantum channels; however, obtaining analytical solutions for quantum process discrimination is generally extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a method to derive lower and upper bounds on the maximum average success probability in unambiguous discrimination. In particular, when the channels before and after the change are unitary, we show that the maximum average success probability can be analytically expressed in terms of the length of the channel sequence and the discrimination limits for the two channels.

Title: Squeezed Magnons-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement in a Magnomechanical Cavity
Authors: Ziyad Imara, Khadija El Anouz, İlkay Demir, Abderrahim El Allati
Abstract: Magnomechanical cavities offer a new frontier in quantum electrodynamics that give rise to several significant theoretical and experimental results. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical mechanism for achieving a nonreciprocal macroscopic entanglement between magnons, photons and phonons, based on the use of an alternative squeezed magnons method. Indeed, in contrast to conventional approaches, we show how precise control of the amplitude and phase of the squeezed mode allows to obtain a tunable nonreciprocity of entanglement. The magnons resulting from the collective motion of the spin in a macroscopic ferrimagnet become coupled to the microwave photons via magnetic dipole interaction and to the phonons via magnetostrictive interaction. Moreover, we establish that the proposed scheme achieves ideal nonreciprocity, which can be optimized by cavity-magnon coupling and bath temperature control. Finally, by using the parameters that are experimentally feasible with current technologies, this work provides new perspectives for hybrid magnon-based quantum technologies.

Title: Counter-propagating Entangled Photon Pairs from a Monolayer
Authors: Zhuoyuan Lu, Jiri Janousek, Syed M. Assad, Shuyao Qiu, Mayank Joshi, Yecheng Hu, Alex Y Song, Chuanyu Wang, Manuka Suriyage, Jie Zhao, Ping Koy Lam, Yuerui Lu
Abstract: Non-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in atomically thin materials provides new degrees of freedom and enhanced quantum information capacity compared to conventional phase-matched sources. These systems emerged as promising platforms for quantum computing, communication, and imaging, with the potential to support higher-order nonlinear processes. However, direct observation of photon-pair emission from a monolayer has remained experimentally challenging. In this work, we theoretically modeled SPDC emission across the full angular space from a monolayer GaSe film and experimentally validated the model through measurements of both co- and counter-propagating photon pairs. We demonstrated two-photon quantum correlations in the telecom C-band from the thinnest SPDC source reported to date. The spatially symmetric, broadband emission predicted by theory was confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, we observed high-fidelity Bell states in the counter-propagating configuration, marking the first realization of polarization-entangled photon pairs from a monolayer. Our results revealed the emission characteristics of SPDC in the deeply subwavelength, non-phase-matched regime, and introduced atomically thin, counterpropagating SPDC as a scalable and integrable platform for programmable quantum state generation, extendable via moiré superlattice engineering.

Title: A Quantum Walk-Driven Algorithm for the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem under a Maximal Degree Constraint
Authors: F. S. Luiz, F. F. Fanchini, Victor Hugo C. de Albuquerque, J. P. Papa, M. C. de Oliveira
Abstract: We present a novel quantum walk-based approach to solve the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem under a maximal degree constraint (MDC). By recasting the classical MST problem as a quantum walk on a graph, where vertices are encoded as quantum states and edge weights are inverted to define a modified Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that the quantum evolution naturally selects the MST by maximizing the cumulative transition probability (and thus the Shannon entropy) over the spanning tree. Our method, termed Quantum Kruskal with MDC, significantly reduces the quantum resource requirement to $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ qubits while retaining a competitive classical computational complexity. Numerical experiments on fully connected graphs up to $10^4$ vertices confirm that, particularly for MDC values exceeding $4$, the algorithm delivers MSTs with optimal or near-optimal total weights. When MDC values are less or equal to $4$, some instances achieve a suboptimal solution, still outperforming several established classical algorithms. These results open promising perspectives for hybrid quantum-classical solutions in large-scale graph optimization.

Title: Bridging Classical and Quantum Computing for Next-Generation Language Models
Authors: Yi Pan, Hanqi Jiang, Junhao Chen, Yiwei Li, Huaqin Zhao, Lin Zhao, Yohannes Abate, Yingfeng Wang, Tianming Liu
Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with quantum computing is a critical challenge, hindered by the severe constraints of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including barren plateaus and limited coherence. Current approaches often fail due to static quantum-classical partitioning. We introduce Adaptive Quantum-Classical Fusion (AQCF), the first framework to bridge this gap through dynamic, quantum-classical co-design. AQCF's core principle is real-time adaptation: it analyzes input complexity to orchestrate seamless transitions between classical and quantum processing. The framework features three key innovations: (1) entropy-driven adaptive circuits that circumvent barren plateaus; (2) quantum memory banks that unify classical attention with quantum state-based similarity retrieval; and (3) intelligent fusion controllers that allocate tasks for optimal performance. This architecture maintains full compatibility with classical Transformers while progressively incorporating quantum advantages. Experiments on sentiment analysis demonstrate that AQCF achieves competitive performance, significantly improves quantum resource efficiency, and operates successfully within typical NISQ constraints. By providing a seamless integration pathway, AQCF offers both immediate practical value on current quantum hardware and a clear evolution path toward mature Quantum LLMs.

Title: Geometry-Controlled Freezing and Revival of Bell Nonlocality through Environmental Memory
Authors: Mohamed Hatifi
Abstract: We show that the distance between two qubits coupled to a structured reservoir acts as a single geometric control that can store, revive, or suppress Bell nonlocality. In a mirror-terminated guide, quantum correlations lost to the bath return at discrete recurrence times, turning a product state into a Bell-violating one without any entangling drive (only local basis rotations/readout). In the continuum limit, we derive closed-form criteria for the emergence of nonlocality from backflow, and introduce a Bell-based analogue of the BLP measure to quantify this effect. We also show how subwavelength displacements away from a decoherence-free node quadratically reduce the lifetime of a dark state or bright state, enabling highly sensitive interferometric detection. All results rely on analytically solvable models and are compatible with current superconducting and nanophotonic platforms, offering a practical route to passive, geometry-controlled non-Markovian devices.

Title: QuProFS: An Evolutionary Training-free Approach to Efficient Quantum Feature Map Search
Authors: Yaswitha Gujju, Romain Harang, Chao Li, Tetsuo Shibuya, Qibin Zhao
Abstract: The quest for effective quantum feature maps for data encoding presents significant challenges, particularly due to the flat training landscapes and lengthy training processes associated with parameterised quantum circuits. To address these issues, we propose an evolutionary training-free quantum architecture search (QAS) framework that employs circuit-based heuristics focused on trainability, hardware robustness, generalisation ability, expressivity, complexity, and kernel-target alignment. By ranking circuit architectures with various proxies, we reduce evaluation costs and incorporate hardware-aware circuits to enhance robustness against noise. We evaluate our approach on classification tasks (using quantum support vector machine) across diverse datasets using both artificial and quantum-generated datasets. Our approach demonstrates competitive accuracy on both simulators and real quantum hardware, surpassing state-of-the-art QAS methods in terms of sampling efficiency and achieving up to a 2x speedup in architecture search runtime.

Title: Low Cost Bayesian Experimental Design for Quantum Frequency Estimation with Decoherence
Authors: Alexandra Ramôa, Luís Paulo Santos, Akihito Soeda
Abstract: A two-level quantum system evolving under a time-independent Hamiltonian produces oscillatory measurement probabilities. The estimation of the associated frequency is a cornerstone problem in quantum metrology, sensing, calibration and control. In this work, we tackle this task by introducing WES: a Window Expansion Strategy for low cost adaptive Bayesian experimental design. WES employs empirical cost-reduction techniques to keep the optimization overhead low, curb scaling problems, and enable high degrees of parallelism. Unlike previous heuristics, it offers adjustable classical processing costs that determine the performance standard. As a benchmark, we analyze the performance of widely adopted heuristics, comparing them with the fundamental limits of metrology and a baseline random strategy. Numerical simulations show that WES delivers the most reliable performance and fastest learning rate, saturating the Heisenberg limit.

Title: Block encoding the 3D heterogeneous Poisson equation with application to fracture flow
Authors: Austin Pechan, John Golden, Daniel O'Malley
Abstract: Quantum linear system (QLS) algorithms offer the potential to solve large-scale linear systems exponentially faster than classical methods. However, applying QLS algorithms to real-world problems remains challenging due to issues such as state preparation, data loading, and efficient information extraction. In this work, we study the feasibility of applying QLS algorithms to solve discretized three-dimensional heterogeneous Poisson equations, with specific examples relating to groundwater flow through geologic fracture networks. We explicitly construct a block encoding for the 3D heterogeneous Poisson matrix by leveraging the sparse local structure of the discretized operator. While classical solvers benefit from preconditioning, we show that block encoding the system matrix and preconditioner separately does not improve the effective condition number that dominates the QLS runtime. This differs from classical approaches where the preconditioner and the system matrix can often be implemented independently. Nevertheless, due to the structure of the problem in three dimensions, the quantum algorithm achieves a runtime of $O(N^{2/3} \ \text{polylog } N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$, outperforming the best classical methods (with runtimes of $O(N \log N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$) and offering exponential memory savings. These results highlight both the promise and limitations of QLS algorithms for practical scientific computing, and point to effective condition number reduction as a key barrier in achieving quantum advantages.

Title: Optimal Quantum Estimation with Stabilizer-Based Local Measurements
Authors: Jia-Xuan Liu, Hai-Long Shi, Chunfeng Wu, Sixia Yu
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum metrology is to identify optimal protocols under measurement constraints that reflect realistic experimental conditions, e.g., local measurements in multipartite scenarios. Here, we present a sufficient criterion for metrological schemes to saturate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) using local measurements, based on stabilizer formalism. In ideal settings, we show that graph states always admit local estimation protocols with an optimal estimation precision determined only by the underlying graph structure. A family of graph states is identified as probe states that achieve suboptimal precision scaling. In noisy environments, we construct several subspaces of probe states (mixed in general) that not only saturate the QCRB with local measurements but also maintain approximately invariant precision scaling. These subspaces offer multiple metrological advantages, including high precision, partial noise resilience, and noise-correcting capability prior to parameter encoding. Under dephasing noise, they exhibit markedly better performance than Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. Our results advance the framework for local-measurement quantum metrology, achieving a robust trade-off between precision and noise tolerance.

Title: Bargmann invariants of Gaussian states
Authors: Jianwei Xu
Abstract: Given a set of ordered quantum states, described by density operators $% \{\rho _{j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$, the Bargmann invariant of $\{\rho _{j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$ is defined as tr($\rho _{1}\rho _{2}...\rho _{n}$). Bargmann invariant serves as a fundamental concept for quantum mechanics and has diverse applications in quantum information science. Bosonic Gaussian states are a class of quantum states on infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, widely used in quantum optics and quantum information science. Bosonic Gaussian states are conveniently and conventionally characterized by their means and covariance matrices. In this work, we provide the expression of Bargmann invariant tr($\rho _{1}\rho _{2}...\rho _{n}$) for any $m$-mode bosonic Gaussian states $\{\rho _{j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$ in terms of the means and covariance matrices of $\{\rho _{j}\}_{j=1}^{n}.$ We also use this expression to explore the permissible values of Bargmann invariants for bosonic Gaussian states.

Title: Positive-divisibility of Subsystems in Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Anumita Mukhopadhyay, Praggnyamita Ghosh, Shibdas Roy
Abstract: It is known that the existence of memory effect can revive quantum correlations in open system dynamics. In this regard, the backflow of information from environment to the system can be identified with Complete Positive (CP) indivisibility as well as Positive (P) indivisibility criteria. It is also known that if a quantum system is CP-divisible, it can also have memory effect which can be witnessed by P-indivisibility. Here, we have explored the relation of P-divisibility with unitality condition of noise channels, showing that a unital channel is P-divisible. We have shown how a system channel and its environment need to be both P-divisible, but cannot be both P-indivisible, provided the system-environment joint quantum state evolves unitarily. We have also established our results using three unitaries acting on different sets of states. In particular, due to backflow of information from the environment, quantumness of a system can increase, as shown for an example of the three-qubit W state.

Title: Squeezed Coherent States in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics with Position-Dependent Mass
Authors: Daniel Sabi Takou, Amidou Boukari, Assimiou Yarou Mora, Gabriel Y. H. Avossevou
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and analyze a class of squeezed coherent states within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM) involving a position-dependent mass (PDM). Using a deformed algebraic structure, we generalize the creation and annihilation operators to accommodate spatially varying mass profiles. The resulting states exhibit non-classical features, such as squeezing, coherence, and modified uncertainty relations, strongly influenced by both the deformation parameters and the mass function. We explore their physical properties through expectation values, variances, and probability densities. This work provides a pathway toward extending coherent state theory to more complex quantum systems with geometrical and algebraic richness.

Title: Information in quantum field theory simulators: Thin-film superfluid helium
Authors: Maciej T. Jarema, Cameron R. D. Bunney, Vitor S. Barroso, Mohammadamin Tajik, Chris Goodwin, Silke Weinfurtner
Abstract: Understanding quantum correlations through information-theoretic measures is fundamental to developments in quantum field theory, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics. A central feature in a plethora of systems is the area law, under which information scales with the size of the boundary of the system, rather than volume. Whilst many systems and regimes exhibiting an area law have been identified theoretically, experimental verification remains limited, particularly in continuous systems. We present a methodology for measuring mutual information in an experimental simulator of non-interacting quantum fields, and propose using the analogue $(2 + 1)$-dimensional spacetime offered by thin films of superfluid helium. We provide numerical predictions incorporating the natural thermal state of the helium sample that exemplify an area-law scaling of mutual information, and characterise deviations attributable to the inherent finite system size.

Title: The simplest Kochen-Specker set
Authors: Adán Cabello
Abstract: Kochen-Specker (KS) sets are fundamental in physics. Every time nature produces bipartite correlations attaining the nonsignaling limit, or two parties always win a nonlocal game impossible to always win classically, is because the parties are measuring a KS set. The simplest quantum system in which all these phenomena occur is a pair of three-level systems. However, the simplest KS sets in dimension three known are asymmetrical and require a large number of bases (the current minimum is 16, set by Peres and Penrose). Here we present a KS set that is much more symmetrical and easier to prove than any previous example. It sets a new record for minimum number of bases, 14, and enables us to refute Conjecture 2 in Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 010201 (2025), setting a new record for qutrit-qutrit perfect strategies with a minimum number of inputs: 5-9.

Title: Quantum MIMO Diversity over Discrete-Variable Crosstalk Channels
Authors: Shehbaz Tariq, Junaid ur Rehman, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: Quantum communication plays a pivotal role in enabling distributed quantum computing and sensing. Diversity strategies can be used to increase the communication reliability (in the sense of output fidelity with respect to the input quantum state) when multiple communication channels are available. The current paper proposes a diversity strategy for quantum discrete variable (DV) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels, utilizing approximate cloning to distribute information across multiple channels at the transmitter and purification to merge the noisy and entangled joint state into a single quantum state at the receiver. The proposed method is compared with simpler strategies, such as the best-channel selection, to identify the advantage regions over a quantum channel combining both crosstalk and depolarization, where the crosstalk is modeled by a controlled-SWAP operator. Our numerical results show that the cloning-purification strategy offers an advantage, especially in cases where full channel state information (CSI) can be exploited to optimize the cloning asymmetry. More importantly, and in contrast to the classic MIMO diversity, we demonstrate that the distribution of quantum information over all available channels does not always provide an advantage due to the dilution cost of the cloning operation.

Title: Integrating Quantum Computing with Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory for Biological Electron Transfer
Authors: Yibo Chen, Zirui Sheng, Weitang Li, Yong Zhang, Xun Xu, Jun-Han Huang, Yuxiang Li
Abstract: Accurate calculation of strongly correlated electronic systems requires proper treatment of both static and dynamic correlations, which remains challenging for conventional methods. To address this, we present VQE-PDFT, a quantum-classical hybrid framework that integrates variational quantum eigensolver with multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT). This framework strategically employs quantum circuits for multiconfigurational wavefunction representation while utilizing density functionals for correlation energy evaluation. The hybrid strategy maintains accurate treatment of static and dynamic correlations while reducing quantum resource requirements. Benchmark validation on the Charge-Transfer dataset confirmed that VQE-PDFT achieves results comparable to conventional MC-PDFT. Building upon this, we developed shallow-depth hardware-efficient ansatz circuits and integrated them into a QM/MM multiscale architecture to enable applications in complex biological systems. This extended framework, when applied to electron transfer in the European robin cryptochrome protein ErCRY4, yielded transfer rates that align well with experimental measurements. Importantly, successful execution on actual quantum hardware demonstrates practical feasibility for biological quantum computing applications, supported by comprehensive error analysis.

Title: Universally Robust Control of Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Lixiang Ding, Jingtao Fan, Xingze Qiu
Abstract: Mitigating noise-induced decoherence is the central challenge in controlling open quantum systems. While existing robust protocols often require precise noise models, we introduce a universal framework for noise-agnostic quantum control that achieves high-fidelity operations without prior environmental noise characterization. This framework capitalizes on the dynamical modification of the system-environment coupling through control drives, an effect rigorously encoded in the dynamical equation. Since the derived noise sensitivity metric remains independent of the coupling details between the system and the environment, our protocol demonstrates provable robustness against arbitrary Markovian noises. Numerical validation through quantum state transfer and gate operations reveals near-unity fidelity ($>\!99\%$) across diverse noise regimes, achieving orders-of-magnitude error suppression compared to target-only approaches. This framework bridges critical gaps between theoretical control design and experimental constraints, establishing a hardware-agnostic pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum technologies across platforms such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and solid-state qubits.

Title: Quanutm-State Texture as a Resource: Measures and Nonclassical Interdependencies
Authors: Yuntao Cui, Zhaobing Fan, Sunho Kim
Abstract: Quantum-state texture is a newly recognized quantum resource that has garnered attention with the advancement of quantum theory. In this work, we discuss several main tasks concerning quantum-state texture resource theory, including quantum-state texture measure, quantum state transformation under free operations, and relations between quantum resources. We first provide two new quantum-state texture measures and propose specific form of function for constructing quantum-state texture measures through a convex roof method. Then, we present the maximal probability of quantum state transformation through free operations. Lastly, we establish relationships between quantum-state texture and other highly regarded quantum resources, such as coherence, imaginary, and predictability. Our research complements the measure theory of quantum-state texture and enriches the theory framework of quantum-state texture resource.

Title: PHIP Sequences and Dipolar Fields
Authors: Martin C. Korzeczek, Ilai Schwartz, Martin B. Plenio
Abstract: Para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) achieves efficient hyperpolarisation of nuclear spins with the transfer of the singlet order of parahydrogen to target molecules through catalytic hydrogenation reactions and subsequent coherent control of the spin dynamics. However, in realistic conditions B0/B1 inhomogeneities lead to significant reduction in the polarization transfer efficiency. Moreover, in high-concentration samples, dipolar fields arising from the magnetisation of the sample can degrade polarisation transfer efficiency significantly. In this work, we present a theoretical framework and a comprehensive analysis of both pulsed and continuous-wave (CW) control sequences designed to mitigate the detrimental effects of dipolar fields, $B_0/B_1$ inhomogeneities, and moderate chemical shifts. By combining tools from average Hamiltonian theory with detailed numerical simulations, we introduce and characterise a wide range of transfer sequences, including dipolar-field adjusted and dipolar-field suppressing protocols. We identify conditions under which dipolar interactions either hinder or, perhaps surprisingly, stabilise polarization transfer, depending on the sequence structure. Our results offer practical guidance for the selection and design of PHIP transfer sequences under realistic experimental constraints and open pathways toward robust hyperpolarisation in concentrated liquid-state NMR samples.

Title: A Method for Constructing Quasi-Random Peaked Quantum Circuits
Authors: O.G. Udalov
Abstract: An algorithm is proposed for constructing quasi-random "peaked" quantum circuits, i.e., circuits whose final qubit state exhibits a high probability concentration on a specific computational basis state. These circuits consist of random gates arranged in a brick-wall architecture. While the multiqubit state in the middle of the circuit can exhibit significant entanglement, the final state is, with high probability, a predetermined pure bitstring. A technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of the final peaked state. A modified version of the algorithm enables the construction of double- or multi-peaked quantum circuits. The matrix product state (MPS) method is evaluated for simulating such circuits; it performs effectively for shallow peaked circuits but offers no significant advantage for deeper ones.

Title: Graded Quantum Codes: From Weighted Algebraic Geometry to Homological Chain Complexes
Authors: Tony Shaska
Abstract: We introduce graded quantum codes, unifying two classes of quantum error-correcting codes. The first, quantum weighted algebraic geometry (AG) codes, derives from rational points on hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces over finite fields. This extends classical AG codes by adding weighted degrees and singularities, enabling self-orthogonal codes via the CSS method with improved distances using algebraic structures and invariants like weighted this http URL second class arises from chain complexes of graded vector spaces, generalizing homological quantum codes to include torsion and multiple gradings. This produces low-density parity-check codes with parameters based on homology ranks, including examples from knot invariants and quantum rotors. A shared grading leads to a refined Singleton bound: $d \leq \frac{n - k + 2}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, where $\epsilon > 0$ reflects entropy adjustments from geometric singularities and defects. The bound holds partially for simple orbifolds and is supported by examples over small fields. Applications include post-quantum cryptography, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and optimization via graded neural networks, linking algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and quantum information.

Title: Error-Resilient Fast Entangling Gates for Scalable Ion-Trap Quantum Processors
Authors: Isabelle Savill-Brown, Zain Mehdi, Alexander K. Ratcliffe, Varun D. Vaidya, Haonan Liu, Simon A. Haine, C. Ricardo Viteri, Joseph J. Hope
Abstract: Non-adiabatic two-qubit gate proposals for trapped-ion systems offer superior performance and flexibility over adiabatic schemes at the cost of increased laser control requirements. Existing fast gate schemes are limited by single-qubit transition errors, which constrain the total number of pulses in high-fidelity solutions. We introduce an improved gate search scheme that enables both local and non-local two-qubit gates in chains containing tens of ions. These protocols use a multi-objective machine design approach that incorporates dominant sources of error in the design to ensure the solutions are compatible with existing fast laser controls. We also generalize previous schemes by allowing for unpaired pulses during the gate evolution. By imposing symmetries on the pulse sequences, we eliminate susceptibility to laser phase noise and further simplify the multi-mode control over the state-dependent motion of the ion crystal. We perform a comprehensive analysis of expected gate performance in the presence of random and systematic experimental errors to demonstrate the feasibility of performing microsecond two-qubit gates between arbitrary ion pairs in current linear ion-trap processors of up to $50$ ions with fidelities approaching $99.9\%$.

Title: Tomography-assisted noisy quantum circuit simulator using matrix product density operators
Authors: Wei-guo Ma, Yun-Hao Shi, Kai Xu, Heng Fan
Abstract: In recent years, efficient quantum circuit simulations incorporating ideal noise assumptions have relied on tensor network simulators, particularly leveraging the matrix product density operator (MPDO) framework. However, experiments on real noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices often involve complex noise profiles, encompassing uncontrollable elements and instrument-specific effects such as crosstalk. To address these challenges, we employ quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to directly capture the operational characteristics of the experimental setup and integrate them into numerical simulations using MPDOs. Our QPT-assisted MPDO simulator is then applied to explore a variational approach for generating noisy entangled states, comparing the results with standard noise numerical simulations and demonstrations conducted on the Quafu cloud quantum computation platform. Additionally, we investigate noisy MaxCut problems, as well as the effects of crosstalk and noise truncation. Our results provide valuable insights into the impact of noise on NISQ devices and lay the foundation for enhanced design and assessment of quantum algorithms in complex noise environments.

Title: Obfuscated Quantum and Post-Quantum Cryptography
Authors: Anju Rani, Xiaoyu Ai, Aman Gupta, Ravi Singh Adhikari, Robert Malaney
Abstract: In this work, we present an experimental deployment of a new design for combined quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Novel to our system is the dynamic obfuscation of the QKD-PQC sequence of operations, the number of operations, and parameters related to the operations; coupled to the integration of a GPS-free quantum synchronization protocol within the QKD process. We compare the performance and overhead of our QKD-PQC system relative to a standard QKD system with one-time pad encryption, demonstrating that our design can operate in real time with little additional overhead caused by the new security features. Since our system can offer additional defensive strategies against a wide spectrum of practical attacks that undermine deployed QKD, PQC, and certain combinations of these two primitives, we suggest that our design represents one of the most secure communication systems currently available. Given the dynamic nature of its obfuscation attributes, our new system can also be adapted in the field to defeat yet-to-be-discovered practical attacks.

Title: Estimating classical mutual information between quantum subsystems with neural networks
Authors: D. A. Konyshev, V. V. Mazurenko
Abstract: Characterizing correlations in a quantum system on the basis of the results of the projective measurements can be performed with different means including the calculation of the classical mutual information. Generally, estimating such information-entropy-based quantities requires having complete statistics of the system's states. Here we explore the possibility to reconstruct the classical mutual information and specific entropy of a quantum system with neural network approach on the basis of limited number of projective measurements. As a prominent example we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum Ising model in transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields which is in demand in both condensed matter physics and quantum computing. We show that the neural network approach gives reliable estimates of the classical mutual information even in the case of paramagnetic wave functions delocalized in the state space. In addition, the phase diagram of the considered quantum system is reconstructed with a special focus on discriminating various types of disordered states.

Title: Steady state properties of periodically driven quantum systems
Authors: Milan Šindelka, David Gelbwaser-Klimovsky
Abstract: Periodic driving is used to steer physical systems to unique stationary states or nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), producing enhanced properties inaccessible to non-driven systems. For open quantum systems, characterizing the NESS is challenging and existing results are generally limited to specific types of driving and the Born-Markov approximation. Here we go beyond these limits by studying a generic periodically driven $ N$-level quantum system interacting with a low-density thermal gas. Exploiting the framework of Floquet scattering theory, we establish general Floquet thermalization conditions constraining the nature of the NESS and the transition rates. Moreover, we examine theoretically the structure of the NESS at high temperatures, and find out that the NESS complies, rather surprisingly, with the Boltzmann law for any driving. Numerical calculations illustrate our theoretical elaborations for a simple toy model.

Title: Observation and Modulation of the Quantum Mpemba Effect on a Superconducting Quantum Processor

Abstract: In non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) emerges as a counterintuitive phenomenon: systems exhibiting greater initial symmetry breaking restore symmetry faster than those with less. While theoretical exploration of QME has surged, experimental studies on its multidimensional modulation remain limited. Here, we report the observation and control of QME using a superconducting processor featuring a unique fully connected, tunable-coupling architecture that enables precise modulation from short- to long-range interactions. This platform allows independent manipulation of coupling regimes, on-site potentials, and initial states, elucidating their roles in QME. To quantify symmetry restoration, we employ entanglement asymmetry (EA) -- the relative entropy between a subsystem reduced density matrix and its symmetric projection -- as a sensitive probe of symmetry breaking. In strong short-range coupling regimes, EA crossovers during quenches from tilted Néel states confirm the presence of QME. In contrast, in intermediate coupling regimes, synchronized EA and entanglement entropy dynamics reveal the suppression of QME. Remarkably, QME reemerges with the introduction of on-site linear potentials or quenches from tilted ferromagnetic states, the latter proving robust against on-site disorder. Our study provides the first demonstration of flexible QME modulation on a superconducting platform with multiple controllable parameters, shedding light on quantum many-body non-equilibrium dynamics and opening avenues for quantum information applications.

Title: Master Equation for Quantum Self-Organization of Atoms and Molecules in Cavities
Authors: Tom Schmit, Catalin-Mihai Halati, Tobias Donner, Giovanna Morigi, Simon B. Jäger
Abstract: Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable laboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range interacting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate interactions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay of photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations. Control of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms at play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective theoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field is treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly perturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of polarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to the cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large intracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field seed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical description by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature interval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to strong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework for the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits, amongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with a versatile experimental platform.

Title: Information Transport in Classic-Quantum Hybrid System
Authors: Julian Rapp, Radhika H. Joshi, Alwin van Steensel, Yuli V. Nazarov, Mohammad H. Ansari
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.

Title: GPU-Accelerated Syndrome Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes below the 63 $μ$s Latency Threshold
Authors: Oscar Ferraz, Bruno Coutinho, Gabriel Falcao, Marco Gomes, Francisco A. Monteiro, Vitor Silva
Abstract: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated decoder for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes that achieves sub-$63$ $\mu$s latency, below the surface code decoder's real-time threshold demonstrated on Google's Willow quantum processor. While surface codes have demonstrated below-threshold performance, the encoding rates approach zero as code distances increase, posing challenges for scalability. Recently proposed QLDPC codes, such as those by Panteleev and Kalachev, offer constant-rate encoding and asymptotic goodness but introduce higher decoding complexity. To address such limitation, this work presents a parallelized belief propagation decoder leveraging syndrome information on commodity GPU hardware. Parallelism was exploited to maximize performance within the limits of target latency, allowing decoding latencies under $50$ $\mu$s for [[$784$, $24$, $24$]] codes and as low as $23.3$ $\mu$s for smaller codes, meeting the tight timing constraints of superconducting qubit cycles. These results show that real-time, scalable decoding of asymptotically good quantum codes is achievable using widely available commodity hardware, advancing the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum computation beyond surface codes.

Title: Scheduling of syndrome measurements with a few ancillary qubits
Authors: Shintaro Sato, Yasunari Suzuki
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes are a vital technology for demonstrating reliable quantum computation. They require data qubits for encoding quantum information and ancillary qubits for taking error syndromes necessary for error correction. The need for a large number of ancillary qubits is an overhead specific to quantum computing, and it prevents the scaling of quantum computers to a useful size. In this work, we propose a framework for generating efficient syndrome measurement circuits with a few ancillary qubits in CSS codes and provide a method to minimize the total number of physical qubits in general settings. We demonstrated our proposal by applying it to surface codes, and we generated syndrome measurement circuits under several constraints of total qubit count. As a result, we find that balanced data and ancillary qubit counts achieve the lower logical error rates under a fixed total number of physical qubits. This result indicates that using fewer ancillary qubits than the number of stabilizers can be effective for reducing logical error rates in a practical noise model.

Title: Calculating the Projective Norm of higher-order tensors using a gradient descent algorithm
Authors: Aaditya Rudra, Maria Anastasia Jivulescu
Abstract: Projective Norms are a class of tensor norms that map on the input and output spaces. These norms are useful for providing a measure of entanglement. Calculating the projective norms is an NP-hard problem, which creates challenges in computing due to the complexity of the exponentially growing parameter space for higher-order tensors. We develop a novel gradient descent algorithm to estimate the projective norm of higher-order tensors. The algorithm guarantees convergence to a minimum nuclear rank decomposition of our given tensor. We extend our algorithm to symmetric tensors and density matrices. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by computing the nuclear rank and the projective norm for both pure and mixed states and provide numerical evidence for the same.

Title: Expanding a 4-qubit Dicke State a to 5-qubit Dicke State with Limited Qubit Access
Authors: Bibhuti Thapa, Oberon Moran, Duc-Kha Vu, Fatih Ozaydin
Abstract: In scenarios where full access to all qubits of a multipartite quantum system is available and global operations can be implemented, the preparation of arbitrary entangled states - including multipartite Dicke states - is theoretically straightforward. However, practical constraints often limit direct control over all qubits. In this work, we first present an efficient method for preparing a four-qubit Dicke state, and then demonstrate how a four-qubit Dicke state can be expanded to a five-qubit Dicke state even when only a subset of qubits is accessible. We propose a quantum circuit that achieves this transformation under restricted control, and support our analytical derivation with numerical simulations. We further carry out a robustness analysis of our circuit under imperfect gate implementations and find that it retains high fidelity for experimentally relevant levels of coherent over-rotation errors, confirming its resilience to realistic noise.

Title: $\bf A^2$-robust superradiant phase transition in hybrid qubit-cavity optomechanics
Authors: Gang Liu, Wei Xiong
Abstract: The $\mathbf{A}^2$ term presents a fundamental challenge to realizing the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system enabling SPT regardless of the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term. The system consisting of a qubit, a mechanical mode, and an optical cavity, where the qubit and mechanical mode constitute a quantum Rabi model, while the mechanical mode and cavity form an optomechanical system. Crucially, the auxiliary cavity introduces a switchable $\mathbf{A}^2$ term that effectively counteracts or even fully eliminates the original $\mathbf{A}^2$ effect. This allows controllable observation of SPT, diagnosed via the second-order equal-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ of phonons. Furthermore, the auxiliary cavity exponentially reduces the critical coupling strength, significantly relaxing experimental requirements. Besides, we show that phonons in the normal phase are bunching, but coherent in the superradiant phase. Interestly, higher-order squeezing is found in both phases, with near-perfect higher-order squeezing achieved at SPT point, establishing it as a probe for SPT behavior. Our work demonstrates that hybridizing optomechanics and cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a promising route to accessing SPT physics in the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term.

Title: Superresolution for two incoherent optical sources with arbitrary intensities in two dimensions
Authors: Junyan Li, Shengshi Pang
Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion has long served as a fundamental limit for the resolution of classical optical imaging. However, recent advances in quantum metrology have led to the quantum superresolution technique that can break Rayleigh's curse and estimate the separation between a pair of incoherent point sources with nonvanishing precision. For two-dimensional optical systems, the precision limit of estimating the whole separation, i.e., the distance, between two point sources remains unknown so far. In this paper, we investigate the estimation precision of the distance between two incoherent point sources with arbitrary intensities in a two-dimensional imaging system. Through the multiparameter quantum estimation theory, we obtain the ultimate estimation precision of the distance and show that it remains nonzero when the distance approaches zero, which surpasses the Rayleigh criterion. We further show that the precision can be enhanced by aligning the two point sources along specific directions if the point-spread functions of the two sources are not circularly symmetric, and find the optimial relative azimuth between the two point sources and the highest estimation precision of the distance. In addition to the distance estimation, we also consider the quantum estimation of the relative azimuth between two incoherent point sources. A surprising result is that the precision limit of the azimuth decays quadratically with the distance, which suggests that the azimuth cannot be resolved when the two point sources get sufficiently close to each other and is therefore inaccessible by the quantum superresolution technique in this case. This reveals a new and fundamental limitation on the resolvability of two incoherent point sources in multi-dimensional quantum imaging which cannot be addressed by optimizing the quantum measurements.

Title: The role of Quantum Diffusion Flux in Super-Luminal Wave Packets
Authors: Charalampos Antonakos
Abstract: In this short-length paper, we will present some math that play a central role in quantum hydrodynamics and that were presented by Mita in the past. In this formulation of QM, a quantity is involved which is called the diffusion flux. As we will see, this quantity plays a crucial role on the evolution of wave packets. More specifically, we will initially briefly explain some results derived in Mita's papers, by analyzing Gaussian and soliton wave packets, while our main focus is on the role of diffusion in the evolution of super-luminal wave packets

Title: How Quantum Agents Can Change Which Strategies Are More Complex
Authors: Spiros Kechrimparis, Nix Barnett, Mile Gu, Hyukjoon Kwon
Abstract: Whether winning blackjack or navigating busy streets, achieving desired outcomes requires agents to execute adaptive strategies, strategies where actions depend contextually on past events. In complexity science, this motivates memory as an operational quantifier of complexity: given two strategies, the more complex one demands the agent to track more about the past. Here, we show that conclusions about complexity fundamentally depend on whether agents can process and store quantum information. Thus, while classical agents might find Strategy A more complex to execute than Strategy B, quantum agents can reach the opposite conclusion. We derive sufficient conditions for such contradictory conclusions and illustrate the phenomenon across multiple scenarios. As a byproduct, our results yield an information-theoretic lower bound on the minimal memory required by any agent - classical or quantum - to execute a given strategy.

Title: Handling fabrication defects in hex-grid surface codes
Authors: Oscar Higgott, Benjamin Anker, Matt McEwen, Dripto M. Debroy
Abstract: Recent work has shown that a hexagonal grid qubit layout, with only three couplers per qubit, is sufficient to implement the surface code with performance comparable to that of a traditional four-coupler layout [McEwen et al., 2023]. In this work we propose a method for handling broken qubits and couplers even in hex-grid surface code architectures, using an extension of the LUCI framework [Debroy et al., 2024]. We show that for isolated broken qubits, the circuit distance drops by one, while for isolated broken couplers, the distance drops by one in one or both bases. By providing a viable dropout strategy, we have removed a critical roadblock to the implementation of hexagonal qubit grids in hardware for large-scale quantum error correction.

Title: Quantum Circuit Complexity of Matrix-Product Unitaries
Authors: Georgios Styliaris, Rahul Trivedi, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.

Title: Fast and efficient long-distance quantum state transfer in long-range spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models
Authors: F. Faria, C.C. Nelmes, T.J.G. Apollaro, T.P. Spiller, I. D'Amico
Abstract: Quantum state transfer is investigated beyond the nearest-neighbour coupling scheme in long spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ linear chains. Exploiting the properties of the next-nearest neighbour Hamiltonian's dispersion relation, it is shown that with minimal engineering, i.e., an on-site magnetic field on the two end sites and only a few symmetrically-modified end inter-site couplings, an average transfer fidelity above $99\%$ can be achieved. To leading order, the required time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality quantum state transfer is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to longer range coupling schemes.

Title: Characterization of syndrome-dependent logical noise in detector regions
Authors: Matthew Girling, Ben Criger, Cristina Cirstoiu
Abstract: Characterizing how quantum error correction circuits behave under realistic hardware noise is essential for testing the premises that enable scalable fault tolerance. Logical error rates conditioned on syndrome outcomes are needed to enable noise-aware decoding and validate threshold-relevant assumptions. We introduce a protocol to directly estimate the logical Pauli channels (and pure errors) associated with detector regions formed of two or more syndrome extraction gadgets, conditioned on observing a particular parity in the syndrome outcomes. The method is SPAM-robust and most suitable for flag-based syndrome measurement schemes. For classical processing of the experimental data we implement a Bayesian modelling approach. We validate this new protocol on a small error-detecting code using Quantinuum H1-1, a trapped-ion device, and demonstrate that several noise diagnostic tests for fault tolerance improve significantly when using noise tailoring and mitigation strategies, such as swapped measurements for leakage protection, and Pauli frame randomization.

Title: Single-Shot Decoding and Fault-tolerant Gates with Trivariate Tricycle Codes
Authors: Abraham Jacob, Campbell McLauchlan, Dan E. Browne
Abstract: While quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes are a low-overhead means of quantum information storage, it is valuable for quantum codes to possess fault-tolerant features beyond this resource efficiency. In this work, we introduce trivariate tricycle (TT) codes, qLDPC codes that combine several desirable features: high thresholds under a circuit-level noise model, partial single-shot decodability for low-time-overhead decoding, a large set of transversal Clifford gates and automorphisms within and between code blocks, and (for several sub-constructions) constant-depth implementations of a (non-Clifford) $CCZ$ gate. TT codes are CSS codes based on a length-3 chain complex, and are defined from three trivariate polynomials, with the 3D toric code (3DTC) belonging to this construction. We numerically search for TT codes and find several candidates with improved parameters relative to the 3DTC, using up to 48$\times$ fewer data qubits as equivalent 3DTC encodings. We construct syndrome-extraction circuits for these codes and numerically demonstrate single-shot decoding in the X error channel in both phenomenological and circuit-level noise models. Under circuit-level noise, TT codes have a threshold of $0.3\%$ in the Z error channel and $1\%$ in the X error channel (with single-shot decoding). All TT codes possess several transversal $CZ$ gates that can partially address logical qubits between two code blocks. Additionally, the codes possess a large set of automorphisms that can perform Clifford gates within a code block. Finally, we establish several TT code polynomial constructions that allows for a constant-depth implementation of logical $CCZ$ gates. We find examples of error-correcting and error-detecting codes using these constructions whose parameters out-perform those of the 3DTC, using up to $4\times$ fewer data qubits for equivalent-distance 3DTC encodings.

Title: Pangenome-guided sequence assembly via binary optimisation
Authors: Josh Cudby, James Bonfield, Chenxi Zhou, Richard Durbin, Sergii Strelchuk
Abstract: De novo genome assembly is challenging in highly repetitive regions; however, reference-guided assemblers often suffer from bias. We propose a framework for pangenome-guided sequence assembly, which can resolve short-read data in complex regions without bias towards a single reference genome. Our method frames assembly as a graph traversal optimisation problem, which can be implemented on quantum computers. The pipeline first annotates pangenome graphs with estimated copy numbers for each node, then finds a path on the graph that best explains those copy numbers. On simulated data, our approach significantly reduces the number of contigs compared to de novo assemblers. While it introduces a small increase in inaccuracies, such as false joins, our optimisation-based methods are competitive with current exhaustive search techniques. They are also designed to scale more efficiently as the problem size grows and will run effectively on future quantum computers.

Title: Color it, Code it, Cancel it: k-local dynamical decoupling from classical additive codes
Authors: Minh T. P. Nguyen, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Stefano Bosco
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling is a central technique in quantum computing for actively suppressing decoherence and systematic imperfections through sequences of single-qubit operations. Conventional sequences typically aim to completely freeze system dynamics, often resulting in long protocols whose length scales exponentially with system size. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing time-optimal, selectively-tailored sequences that remove only specific local interactions. By combining techniques from graph coloring and classical coding theory, our approach enables compact and hardware-tailored sequences across diverse qubit platforms, efficiently canceling undesired Hamiltonian terms while preserving target interactions. This opens up broad applications in quantum computing and simulation. At the core of our method is a mapping between dynamical decoupling sequence design and error-detecting codes, which allows us to leverage powerful coding-theoretic tools to construct customized sequences. To overcome exponential overheads, we exploit symmetries in colored interaction hypergraphs, extending graph-coloring strategies to arbitrary many-body Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through concrete examples, including compact sequences that suppress residual ZZ and ZZZ interactions in superconducting qubits and Heisenberg exchange coupling in spin qubits. We also show how it enables Hamiltonian engineering by simulating the anisotropic Kitaev honeycomb model using only isotropic Heisenberg interactions.

Title: Average Contraction Coefficients of Quantum Channels
Authors: Ruben Ibarrondo, Daniel Stilck França
Abstract: The data-processing inequality ensures quantum channels reduce state distinguishability, with contraction coefficients quantifying optimal bounds. However, these can be overly optimistic and not representative of the usual behavior. We study how noise contracts distinguishability of `typical' states, beyond the worst-case. To that end, we introduce and study a family of moments of contraction for quantum divergences, which interpolate between the worst-case contraction coefficient of a channel and its average behavior under a chosen ensemble of input states. We establish general properties of these moments, relate moments for different divergences, and derive bounds in terms of channel parameters like the entropy or purity of its Choi state. Focusing on the trace distance, we obtain upper and lower bounds on its average contraction under tensor-product noise channels, and prove that, depending on the local noise strength, there is a phase transition in the limit of many channel uses: below a critical error rate the average contraction remains near unity, whereas above it decays exponentially with system size. We extend these phase-transition phenomena to random quantum circuits with unital noise, showing that constant-depth noisy circuits do not shrink the trace distance on average, even when given highly entangled states as input. In contrast, even at $\log\log n$ depth, the average trace distance can become superpolynomially small. Finally, we explore moments of contraction for f-divergences and discuss applications to local differential privacy, demonstrating that noise regimes ensuring privacy can render outputs essentially indistinguishable on average. Thus, our results provide a fine-grained framework to quantify typical channel noise in quantum information and computation and unveil new phenomena in contraction coefficients, such as phase transitions for average contraction.

Title: Photon Statistics for Fock and Coherent States Interfering in a Beamsplitter
Authors: Jhordan A. T. Santiago
Abstract: We present a straightforward yet comprehensive theoretical study of different quantum states emerging from a bi-modal beamsplitter when various input states interfere. Specifically, we analyze the output states for different combinations of input fields, including Fock states $|n\rangle|m\rangle$, hybrid states $|n\rangle|\alpha\rangle$, and coherent states $|\alpha\rangle|\beta\rangle$. We derive explicit expressions for the output state vectors, calculate the mean photon number, photon number variance, Mandel Q parameter, and secondorder coherence function to characterize the statistical properties of the output fields. Our results are intended as a pedagogical resource, serving as an introductory reference for students and researchers aiming to understand basic photon statistics using beamsplitters.

Title: Quantum-centric simulation of hydrogen abstraction by sample-based quantum diagonalization and entanglement forging

Abstract: The simulation of electronic systems is an anticipated application for quantum-centric computers, i.e. heterogeneous architectures where classical and quantum processing units operate in concert. An important application is the computation of radical chain reactions, including those responsible for the photodegradation of composite materials used in aerospace engineering. Here, we compute the activation energy and reaction energy for hydrogen abstraction from 2,2-diphenyldipropane, used as a minimal model for a step in a radical chain reaction. Calculations are performed using a superconducting quantum processor of the IBM Heron family and classical computing resources. To this end, we combine a qubit-reduction technique called entanglement forging (EF) with sample based quantum diagonalization (SQD), a method that projects the Schrödinger equation into a subspace of configurations sampled from a quantum device. In conventional quantum simulations, a qubit represents a spin-orbital. In contrast, EF maps a qubit to a spatial orbital, reducing the required number of qubits by half. We provide a complete derivation and a detailed description of the combined EF and SQD approach, and we assess its accuracy across active spaces of varying sizes.

Title: Composable Quantum Fault-Tolerance
Authors: Zhiyang He, Quynh T. Nguyen, Christopher A. Pattison
Abstract: Proving threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a burdensome endeavor with many moving parts that come together in relatively formulaic but lengthy ways. It is difficult and rare to combine elements from multiple papers into a single formal threshold proof, due to the use of different measures of fault-tolerance. In this work, we introduce composable fault-tolerance, a framework that decouples the probabilistic analysis of the noise distribution from the combinatorial analysis of circuit correctness, and enables threshold proofs to compose independently analyzed gadgets easily and rigorously. Within this framework, we provide a library of standard and commonly used gadgets such as memory and logic implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum low-density parity check codes and distillation. As sample applications, we explicitly write down a threshold proof for computation with surface code and re-derive the constant space-overhead fault-tolerant scheme of Gottesman using gadgets from this library. We expect that future fault-tolerance proofs may focus on the analysis of novel techniques while leaving the standard components to the composable fault-tolerance framework, with the formal proof following the intuitive ``napkin math'' exactly.

Title: Observation of Metal-Insulator and Spectral Phase Transitions in Aubry-André-Harper Models
Authors: Quan Lin, Christopher Cedzich, Qi Zhou, Peng Xue
Abstract: Non-Hermitian extensions of the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model reveal a rich variety of phase transitions arising from the interplay of quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity. Despite their theoretical significance, experimental explorations remain challenging due to complexities in realizing controlled non-Hermiticity. Here, we present the first experimental realization of the unitary almost-Mathieu operator (UAMO) which simulates the AAH model by employing single-photon quantum walks. Through precise control of quasiperiodicity, we systematically explore the phase diagram displaying a phase transition between localized and delocalized regimes in the Hermitian limit. Subsequently, by introducing non-reciprocal hopping, we experimentally probe the parity-time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition that is characterized by the emergence of complex quasienergies. Moreover, we identify a novel spectral transition exclusive to discrete-time settings, where all quasienergies become purely imaginary. Both transitions are connected to changes in the spectral winding number, demonstrating their topological origins. These results clarify the interplay between localization, symmetry breaking, and topology in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, paving the way for future exploration of synthetic quantum matter.

Title: Half-life Measurements of Highly Charged Radioisotopes by Nuclear Recoil in a Penning Trap
Authors: Scott Moroch, Carolyn Chun, Doug VanDerwerken, Ariana Shearin, Brian Beaudoin, Klaus Blaum, Timothy Koeth
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the half-life of highly charged radioisotopes by non-destructive nuclear recoil detection in a Penning ion trap. A specific emphasis is placed on $\rm ^7Be^{3+}$, which plays a crucial role in stellar evolution and the production of solar neutrinos. The determination of the half-life is necessary to constrain the free electron capture rate in the solar environment, but is difficult to measure by existing techniques. Simulations of the sympathetic cooling of the recoiled daughter nuclei ($\rm ^7Li^{3+}$) with the trapped cloud of $\rm ^7Be^{3+}$ demonstrate a decay detection efficiency of $99.5\%$. A statistical analysis of half-life measurements on ensembles containing hundreds of ions shows that a final statistical uncertainty of less than $5\%$ is achieved with only 500 measured decays. By coherent control of hyperfine populations in trapped ions, the fidelity of the technique we describe enables the direct measurement and manipulation of state-dependent decay branching ratios for the first time.

Title: Local Diffusion Models and Phases of Data Distributions
Authors: Fangjun Hu, Guangkuo Liu, Yifan Zhang, Xun Gao
Abstract: As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions, which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers. Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions, the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.

Title: Real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in Rydberg-atom lattice gauge theory
Authors: De-Sheng Xiang, Peng Zhou, Chang Liu, Hao-Xiang Liu, Yao-Wen Zhang, Dong Yuan, Kuan Zhang, Biao Xu, Marcello Dalmonte, Dong-Ling Deng, Lin Li
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes. Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.

Title: Radiative Heat Transfer and 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Materials
Authors: Long Ma, Dai-Nam Le, Lilia M. Woods
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime. Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can be used for other materials families to build a materials database for radiative heat transfer.

Title: Engineered Molecular Clock Transitions for Symmetry Violation Searches
Authors: Yuiki Takahashi, Harish D. Ramachandran, Arian Jadbabaie, Yi Zeng, Chi Zhang, Nicholas R. Hutzler
Abstract: Heavy polar molecules are sensitive probes of physics Beyond the Standard Model. However, uncontrolled external electromagnetic fields pose challenges to achieving precise and accurate measurements. Minimizing susceptibility to these fields is therefore critical and has played an important role in all precision experiments of this type. Here we devise and demonstrate clock transitions engineered to realize robust symmetry violation searches in the polyatomic molecule YbOH. Sensitivities to external fields can be suppressed by orders-of-magnitude while preserving high sensitivity to the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). We perform Ramsey measurements on these clock transitions and observe suppression of electric and magnetic sensitivities by at least a factor of 700 and 200, respectively, and demonstrate the robustness of their spin coherence against large electromagnetic field fluctuations. We further identify and employ selected quantum states to make sensitive measurements of external magnetic and electric fields, another critical feature for highly accurate measurements. This approach of molecular engineering is broadly applicable to diverse molecular species and states, including those with complex nuclei and those that are compatible with state-of-the-art cooling and trapping techniques, thereby offering the potential to significantly improve experimental sensitivity to a wide range of New Physics while expanding the chemical design space for molecular quantum science.

Title: High-Fidelity Microwave-Polarization Control in a Rydberg-Ensemble Experiment
Authors: Deniz Kurdak, Yaxin Li, Patrick R. Banner, J. V. Porto, S. L. Rolston
Abstract: Control of the polarization of microwave fields is a key experimental capability for a number of atomic physics platforms. However, producing high-fidelity microwaves requires a well-controlled microwave environment, where reflections that distort the polarization must be avoided or well characterized, a constraint that often conflicts with other experimental design considerations. Here we demonstrate a microwave control system capable of producing high-fidelity microwave polarizations in a Rydberg-ensemble experiment. We use three in-vacuum DC electrodes, repurposed as microwave antennae, to produce imperfect and initially unknown polarizations. Each source is driven with independent phase and amplitude control to generate the desired microwave fields. We probe the fields produced at the position of the atoms using Rydberg-EIT spectroscopy of the microwave-induced avoided crossings. We produce $\sigma_-$, $\pi$, and $\sigma_+$ polarized microwaves with > 99 % fidelity and generate their combinations. We extend our purification techniques to frequencies away from Rydberg resonances by utilizing an auxiliary microwave field, generating two-photon microwave resonances. The techniques developed here will facilitate the engineering of dipolar interactions in atomic and molecular physics experiments.

Title: Reduced density matrix and cumulant approximations of quantum linear response
Authors: Theo Juncker von Buchwald, Erik Rosendahl Kjellgren, Jacob Kongsted, Stephan P. A. Sauer, Sonia Coriani, Karl Michael Ziems
Abstract: Linear response (LR) is an important tool in the computational chemist's toolbox. It is therefore no surprise that the emergence of quantum computers has led to a quantum version, quantum LR (qLR). However, the current quantum era of near-term intermediary scale quantum (NISQ) computers is dominated by noise, short decoherence times, and slow measurement speed. It is therefore of interest to find approximations that greatly reduce the quantum workload while only slightly impacting the quality of a method. In an effort to achieve this, we approximate the naive qLR with singles and doubles (qLRSD) method by either directly approximating the reduced density matrices (RDMs) or indirectly through their respective reduced density cumulants (RDCs). We present an analysis of the measurement costs behind qLR with RDMs, and report qLR results for model Hydrogen ladder systems; for varying active space sizes of OCS, SeH$_2$, and H$_2$S; and for symmetrically stretched H$_2$O and BeH$_2$. Discouragingly, while approximations to the 4-body RDMs and RDCs seem to produce good results for systems at the equilibrium geometry and for some types of core excitations, they both tend to fail when the system exhibits strong correlation. All approximations to the 3-body RDMs and/or RDCs severely affect the results and cannot be applied.

Title: Nonlinear Ringdowns as Sources and Detectors of Quantum Gravitational Waves
Authors: Thiago Guerreiro
Abstract: Is gravity quantum mechanical? If so, we argue that nonlinear effects in black hole ringdowns - notably second harmonic generation - generates gravitational waves in non-classical states. While quantum features of these states such as sub-Poissonian statistics or entanglement could in principle be measured at interferometric detectors, the tiny coupling of gravity to matter makes this extremely challenging. Drawing on ideas from quantum optics, we instead propose that the nonlinearities in ringdowns could be used as strongly coupled detectors of quantum gravitational radiation, potentially offering a new route to probing the quantum nature of gravity.

Title: Ion Coulomb crystals: an exotic form of condensed matter
Authors: Giovanna Morigi, John Bollinger, Michael Drewsen, Daniel Podolsky, Efrat Shimshoni
Abstract: Wigner crystals formed by laser-cooled ions in traps are unconventional condensed-matter systems, characterized by interparticle distances of several micrometers and energy scales on the order of $\mu$eV. Their crystalline structure emerges from the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the external confining potential, which can be readily tuned. Moreover, individual ions can be precisely manipulated with lasers and imaged via resonance fluorescence. These unusual and unique properties make ion crystals a powerful platform for studying phases of matter and their dynamics in the strongly correlated quantum regime. This review examines the theoretical framework and experimental characterization of ion Coulomb crystals from a condensed-matter perspective. We highlight their dynamical and thermodynamic properties in one, two, and three dimensions, along with recent investigations into their out-of-equilibrium behavior. We provide outlooks on future directions for exploring novel condensed matter phenomena with trapped ion crystals, as well as their many scientific and technical applications, which have driven advances in controlling and measuring ion crystals in the lab.

Title: Dissipation-induced Half Quantized Conductance in One-dimensional Topological Systems
Authors: Bozhen Zhou, Pan Zhang, Yucheng Wang, Chao Yang
Abstract: Quantized conductance from topologically protected edge states is a hallmark of two-dimensional topological phases. In contrast, edge states in one-dimensional (1D) topological systems cannot transmit current across the insulating bulk, rendering their topological nature invisible in transport. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with gain and loss, and show that the zero-energy conductance exhibits qualitatively distinct behaviors between the topologically trivial and nontrivial phases, depending on the hybridization and dissipation strengths. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate that the conductance can become half-quantized in the topologically nontrivial phase, a feature absent in the trivial phase. We further show that the half quantization predominantly originates from transport channels involving gain/loss and edge states. Our results uncover a new mechanism for realizing quantized transport in 1D topological systems and highlight the nontrivial role of dissipation in enabling topological signatures in open quantum systems.

Title: Nonequilibrium steady state in Lindblad dynamics for infinite quantum spin systems
Authors: Kenji Shimomura, Nagisa Hara, Seiichiro Kusuoka
Abstract: We consider Lindblad dynamics of quantum spin systems on infinite lattices and define a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) and a time-averaged nonequilibrium steady state (TANESS) on the basis of $C^*$-algebraic formalism. Generically, the NESS on an infinite system does not equal the thermodynamic limit of NESSs on finite systems. We give a sufficient condition that they coincide with each other, in terms of both a condition number, which quantifies the normality of a Liouvillian, and some spectral gaps on finite subsystems. To appreciate the importance of the condition number, we provide an example in which the spectral gaps have nonzero lower bounds uniformly for any finite subsystems but a thermodynamic limit and a long-time limit (or a long-time average) do not commute with each other.

Title: Spin Phonon Coupling and Relaxation time in Lu(II) compound with 9.2GHz clock transition
Authors: Xiaoliang Zhang, Haechan Park
Abstract: Electron spin qubits operating at atomic clock transitions exhibit exceptionally long coherence times, making them promising candidates for scalable quantum information applications. In solid-state systems, interactions between qubits and lattice phonons are known to play a critical role in spin relaxation (T1) and decoherence (T2). In this work, we perform first-principles calculations on a Lu(II) complex spin qubit featuring a prominent clock transition. By employing advanced electronic structure methods, we quantitatively evaluate the influence of phonons on the hyperfine interaction, which serves as the primary spin-lattice coupling mechanism. Treating these phonon-induced variations as first-order perturbations, we apply the Redfield master equation to compute both T1 and T2, along with their temperature dependencies. For T1, we adopt a second quantization formalism to describe phonon interactions, while T2 is evaluated by explicitly integrating acoustic phonon contributions across the full Brillouin zone. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic field dependence of T2, including the coherence peak near 0.43 T, though the absolute values of T1 and T2 differ by one to two orders of magnitude. Analysis reveals that T1 is primarily governed by longitudinal phonons, whereas T2 is most strongly influenced by mid-wavelength, mid-energy acoustic modes. These findings provide a quantitative demonstration of the clock transition protective effect on spin qubit coherence and offer a transferable computational framework for evaluating spin-phonon interactions in other molecular spin qubits.

Authors: Jianan Wang, Wenbo Guo, Xin Yue, Minjie Xu, Yueqiang Zheng, Jingxiang Dong, Jiarui Hu, Jian Xia, Chuixiong Wu
Abstract: The connect-fill-run workflow paradigm, widely adopted in mature software engineering, accelerates collaborative development. However, computational chemistry, computational materials science, and computational biology face persistent demands for multi-scale simulations constrained by simplistic platform designs. We present MiqroForge, an intelligent cross-scale platform integrating quantum computing capabilities. By combining AI-driven dynamic resource scheduling with an intuitive visual interface, MiqroForge significantly lowers entry barriers while optimizing computational efficiency. The platform fosters a collaborative ecosystem through shared node libraries and data repositories, thereby bridging practitioners across classical and quantum computational domains.

Title: Time Ordering Effects and Destruction of Quasiparticles in Two-dimensional Holographic CFTs
Authors: Weibo Mao, Masahiro Nozaki
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the entanglement dynamics induced by a composite operator, defined as the local operator evolved with the time evolution operator constructed of the Euclidean and Lorentzian ones. The systems under consideration are described by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories (2d holographic CFTs), the theories described by gravity. Then, we find that the time ordering of Euclidean and Lorentzian time evolutions affects the behavior of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation, especially their late-time ones. We also establish the relation between entanglement entropy and energy-momentum densities. This relation states that the late-time behaviors of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation strongly depend on the energy distribution. We also examine how the decay of the quasiparticle influences the bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation. Furthermore, we investigate the gravity dual of the systems considered in this paper.

Title: Topological quantum electrodynamics in synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields
Authors: Qinan Huang, Bengy T. T. Wong, Zehai Pang, Xudong Zhang, Zeling Chen, Yi Yang
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes light-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier. Here, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum emitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit, we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands. When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics with quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool for synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer, and controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for applications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.

Title: Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene
Authors: Yu.V. Shtanov, T.-H.O. Pokalchuk, S.G. Sharapov
Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift, which characterizes the dynamics of intrinsic spin, retains its conventional form in graphene, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity. Our analysis highlights both the similarities and differences between spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in graphene.

Title: v-representability on a one-dimensional torus at elevated temperatures
Authors: Sarina M. Sutter, Markus Penz, Michael Ruggenthaler, Robert van Leeuwen, Klaas J. H. Giesbertz
Abstract: We extend a previous result [Sutter et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 475202 (2024)] to give an explicit form of the set of $v$-representable densities on the one-dimensional torus with any fixed number of particles in contact with a heat bath at finite temperature. The particle interaction has to satisfy some mild assumptions but is kept entirely general otherwise. For densities, we consider the Sobolev space $H^1$ and exploit the convexity of the functionals. This leads to a broader set of potentials than the usual $L^p$ spaces and encompasses distributions. By including temperature and thus considering all excited states in the Gibbs ensemble, Gâteaux differentiability of the thermal universal functional is guaranteed. This yields $v$-representability and it is demonstrated that the given set of $v$-representable densities is even maximal.

Title: Memory Effects and Entanglement Dynamics of Finite time Acceleration
Authors: Nitesh K. Dubey, Sanved Kolekar
Abstract: We construct a smooth trajectory in Minkowski spacetime that is inertial in the asymptotic past and future but undergoes approximately uniform acceleration for a finite duration. In a suitable limit, this trajectory reduces to the standard Rindler trajectory, reproducing the expected Bogoliubov transformations and results consistent with the thermal time hypothesis. We analyze the behavior of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector following such a trajectory and explore the dependence of complete positivity (CP) divisibility on the detector's frequency, acceleration, and the duration of acceleration. Notably, we find that the detector exhibits a memory effect due to the finite duration of acceleration, which is also quantified by the Fisher information. We further examine two UDW detectors along various trajectory combinations and show that, unlike the transition rate, both the total correlation and the entanglement harvested return smoothly to their initial values after the acceleration/deceleration phase. These correlation measures behave similarly in both accelerating and decelerating segments. Interestingly, negativity and mutual information remain unaffected by the memory effect. We also discuss the physical significance of the sign of the flux of acceleration-induced radiation.

Abstract: We report on the realization of optical microcavities consisting in the plane-plane arrangement of two suspended Fano mirrors possessing spectrally overlapping high-quality factor internal resonances. We first investigate their generic transmission spectra as the cavity length is varied on the basis of a simple linear Fabry-Perot model, compare them with those of broadband mirror cavities or Fano cavities possessing a single Fano mirror, and then present an experimental realization using a pair of highly pretensioned, ultrathin silicon nitride films patterned with one-dimensional photonic crystal structures.

Title: Rabi Oscillations Modulated Noise Squeezing in Active Quantum Dot Ensembles
Authors: Ori Gabai, Amnon Willinger, Igor Khanonkin, Vitalii Sichkovskyi, Johann Peter Reithmaier, Gadi Eisenstein
Abstract: Generation of squeezed light is usually implemented in nonlinear \c{hi}(2) or \c{hi}(3) materials. Semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs) also offer non-linearities but they differ from passive elements in that they add amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE). In a semiconductor laser, squeezing to below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity and it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to squeezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but often the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier. At the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Short resonant pulses interacting with a quantum dot SOA induce coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that Rabi oscillations cause cyclical noise squeezing which varies periodically with the excitation pulse area. The noise in the present experiments does not reach the quantum limit so we term this condition quasi squeezing. It occurs during the portions of the Rabi cycle when the quantum dots provide gain and repeats with every fourfold increase of the pulse excitation energy which amounts to a 2{\pi} increase in pulse area. In all other cases, the noise exhibits the properties of a coherent state.

Title: Gradient Electronic Landscapes in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Nolan Lassaline, Camilla H. Sørensen, Giulia Meucci, Sander J. Linde, Kian Latifi Yaghin, Tuan K. Chau, Damon J. Carrad, Peter Bøggild, Thomas S. Jespersen, Timothy J. Booth
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices, heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching, which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes, limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.

Title: On Noise-Sensitive Automatic Tuning of Gate-Defined Sensor Dots
Authors: Fabian Hader, Jan Vogelbruch, Simon Humpohl, Tobias Hangleiter, Chimezie Eguzo, Stefan Heinen, Stefanie Meyer, Stefan van Waasen
Abstract: In gate-defined quantum dot systems, the conductance change of electrostatically coupled sensor dots allows the observation of the quantum dots' charge and spin states. Therefore, the sensor dot must be optimally sensitive to changes in its electrostatic environment. A series of conductance measurements varying the two sensor-dot-forming barrier gate voltages serve to tune the dot into a corresponding operating regime. In this paper, we analyze the noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to identify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio. Hence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal operating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators, modify them for 1D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality based on simulated data. The estimator of Chen et al. turns out to be best suited for our application concerning minimally scattering results. Furthermore, using this estimator in an algorithm for flank-of-interest classification in measured data shows the relevance and applicability of our approach.

Title: Frequency-Domain Analysis of Time-Dependent Multiomic Data in Progressive Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Proposed Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach with Quaternionic Extensions
Authors: John D. Mayfield M.D. Ph.D. M.Sc
Abstract: Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge deterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and neuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting predictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that transforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and Laplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and employs quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct serves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis of neurodegenerative diseases. We extend this to quaternionic representations with three imaginary axes ($i, j, k$) to model multistate Hamiltonians in multifaceted disorders, drawing from quantum neuromorphic computing to capture entangled neural dynamics \citep{Pehle2020, Emani2019}. This approach leverages quantum advantages in handling high-dimensional amplitude-phase data, enabling outlier detection and frequency signature analysis. Potential clinical applications include identifying high-risk patients with rapid progression or therapy resistance using s-domain biomarkers, supported by quantum machine learning (QML) precedents achieving up to 99.89% accuracy in Alzheimer's classification \citep{Belay2024, Bhowmik2025}. This framework aims to lay the groundwork for redefining precision medicine for neurodegenerative diseases through future validations.

Title: Algebraic approach to a $d$-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian with so($d+1)$ symmetry
Authors: Christiane Quesne
Abstract: A novel spin-extended so($d+1$,1) algebra is introduced and shown to provide an interesting framework for discussing the properties of a $d$-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian with spin 1/2 and so($d+1$) symmetry. With some $d+2$ additional operators, spanning a basis of an so($d+1$,1) irreducible representation, the so($d+1$,1) generators provide a very easy way for deriving the integrals of motion of the matrix Hamiltonian in Sturm representation. Such integrals of motion are then transformed into those of the matrix Hamiltonian in Schrödinger representation, including a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector with spin. This leads to a derivation of the latter, as well as its properties in a more extended algebraic framework.

Title: Proton-proton scattering on a quantum computer
Authors: Ratna Khadka, Gautam Rupak
Abstract: Scattering of charged particles is ubiquitous in nuclear physics. We calculate the proton-proton $s$-wave phase shift at low energy relevant to solar physics. The phase shift is calculated from the ratio of the regular and irregular solutions to the radial Schrödinger equation on a hard spherical wall boundary for the ground state. The ground state energy is calculated using a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm. A theory with short-ranged nuclear interaction in the presence of the long-ranged Coulomb force is used to describe the scattering. The theory is discretized on a spatial lattice for adaptation to the quantum computer in the second quantized language. The phase shifts at low momenta are accurately reproduced.

Title: Simulation of Charge Stability Diagrams for Automated Tuning Solutions (SimCATS)
Authors: Fabian Hader, Sarah Fleitmann, Jan Vogelbruch, Lotte Geck, Stefan van Waasen
Abstract: Quantum dots must be tuned precisely to provide a suitable basis for quantum computation. A scalable platform for quantum computing can only be achieved by fully automating the tuning process. One crucial step is to trap the appropriate number of electrons in the quantum dots, typically accomplished by analyzing charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Training and testing automation algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be either measured and manually labeled in an experiment or simulated. This article introduces a new approach to the realistic simulation of such measurements. Our flexible framework enables the simulation of ideal CSD data complemented with appropriate sensor responses and distortions. We suggest using this simulation to benchmark published algorithms. Also, we encourage the extension by custom models and parameter sets to drive the development of robust, technology-independent algorithms. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Spin liquid and glass behavior in quantum spin models with all-to-all p-spin interactions
Authors: Shusei Wadashima, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: Spin liquid and spin glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin-freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remain challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin liquid and spin glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among $p$ spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size $N$ dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of $p$. We show that the phase diagrams for different $p$ can be unified through a scaling with $N/p^2$, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin liquid phase and extends the spin glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin liquid phase transitions into the spin glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide new insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.

Title: The Algebra of the Pseudo-Observables I: Why Quantum Mechanics is the ultimate description of Reality
Authors: Edoardo Piparo (Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Università e della Ricerca)
Abstract: This paper is the first of several parts introducing a new powerful algebra: the algebra of the pseudo-observables. This is a C*-algebra whose set is formed by formal expressions involving observables. The algebra is constructed by applying the Occam's razor principle, in order to obtain the minimal description of physical reality. Proceeding in such a manner, every aspect of quantum mechanics acquires a clear physical interpretation or a logical explanation, providing, for instance, in a natural way the reason for the structure of complex algebra and the matrix structure of the formulation of Werner Heisenberg of quantum mechanics. Last but not least, the very general hypotheses assumed, allow one to state that quantum mechanics is the unique minimal description of physical reality.

Title: Analytical shortcuts to adiabaticity of weakly driven processes
Authors: Pierre Nazé
Abstract: The analytical expression for shortcuts to adiabaticity for any switching time and any thermally isolated system performing a finite-time and weakly driven process is presented. It is based on the analytical solution of the optimal protocols of weak processes for open systems. The extension to adiabatic processes was made by employing the concept of waiting time. The shortcuts to adiabaticity are proven by showing that the excess power is null in all instants, indicating that no nonequilibrium excitation occurs along the driving. Two examples are solved to verify the validity of such shortcuts: the typical case of oscillatory relaxation function and the transverse-field quantum Ising chain. In this last case, it is shown that non-quenching process outperforms the quenching one by suppressing the non-equilibrium excitations until the critical point is not achieved.

Title: Inverted Oscillators for Testing Gravity-induced Quantum Entanglement
Authors: Tomohiro Fujita, Youka Kaku, Akira Matsumura, Yuta Michimura
Abstract: In the quest for quantum gravity, we have lacked experimental verification, hampered by the weakness of gravity and decoherence. Recently, various experiments have been proposed to verify quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravitational interactions. However, they are not yet certainly feasible with existing techniques. To search for a new setup, we compute the logarithmic negativity of two oscillators with arbitrary quadratic potential coupled by gravity. We find that unstable inverted oscillators generate gravity-induced entanglement most quickly and are most resistant to decoherence from environmental fluctuations. As an experimental realization, we propose a setup of the optical levitation of mirrors with the anti-spring effect. To avoid decoherence due to photon shot noise, a sandwich configuration that geometrically creates the anti-spring is promising.

Title: On the electromagnetic couplings in superconducting qubit circuits
Authors: Ebrahim Forati, Brandon W. Langley, Ani Nersisyan, Reza Molavi
Abstract: The precise engineering of electromagnetic couplings is paramount for constructing scalable and highfidelity superconducting quantum processors. While essential for orchestrating qubit operations, these couplings also present significant design challenges, including the mitigation of crosstalk and the management of environmental decoherence. A clear and unified theoretical framework is therefore crucial for the design, simulation, and analysis of these complex quantum circuits. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the fundamental electromagnetic coupling mechanisms in superconducting devices. Starting from first principles, we formulate the equations of motion and derive the input-output relations for canonical systems, including a single resonator coupled to a multi-port microwave network, interacting resonators, and coupled transmission lines. We review rigorous definitions for key parameters such as the energy decay rate (\k{appa}) and the dimensionless coupling coefficient ({\zeta}) and connect these formalisms to practical methods of parameter extraction from electromagnetic simulations. This work provides a rigorous and pedagogical foundation for understanding and modeling linear electromagnetic interactions, serving as a vital resource for the development of advanced superconducting quantum hardware.

Title: Spin Squeezing Enhanced Quantum Magnetometry with Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Qutrits
Authors: L. Gassab, Ö. E. Müstecaplıoğlu
Abstract: We explore the utility of quantum spin squeezing in quantum magnetometry, focusing on three-level (qutrit) Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers within diamond, utilizing a standard Ramsey interferometry pulse protocol. Our investigation incorporates the effects of dephasing and relaxation on NV centers' dynamics during Ramsey measurements, modeled via the Lindblad quantum master equation. We conduct a comparative analysis between the metrological capabilities of a single NV center and a pair of NV centers, considering Quantum Fisher Information both with and without spin squeezing. The quantum correlations between NV centers are assessed through the evaluation of the Kitagawa-Ueda spin squeezing parameter within a two-level manifold. Additionally, parallel calculations are conducted using a two-level model (qubit) for NV centers. Our findings reveal that leveraging qutrits and spin squeezing yields enhanced magnetometric precision, albeit constrained by dephasing effects. Nevertheless, even in the absence of dynamical decoupling methods to mitigate environmental dissipation, strategic timing of squeezing and free evolution can sustain the advantages of qutrit-based magnetometry.

Title: Resource-efficient algorithm for estimating the trace of quantum state powers
Authors: Myeongjin Shin, Junseo Lee, Seungwoo Lee, Kabgyun Jeong
Abstract: Estimating the trace of quantum state powers, $\text{Tr}(\rho^k)$, for $k$ identical quantum states is a fundamental task with numerous applications in quantum information processing, including nonlinear function estimation of quantum states and entanglement detection. On near-term quantum devices, reducing the required quantum circuit depth, the number of multi-qubit quantum operations, and the copies of the quantum state needed for such computations is crucial. In this work, inspired by the Newton-Girard method, we significantly improve upon existing results by introducing an algorithm that requires only $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{r})$ qubits and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{r})$ multi-qubit gates, where $\widetilde{r} = \min\left\{\text{rank}(\rho), \left\lceil\ln\left({2k}/{\epsilon}\right)\right\rceil\right\}$. This approach is efficient, as it employs the $\tilde{r}$-entangled copy measurement instead of the conventional $k$-entangled copy measurement, while asymptotically preserving the known sample complexity upper bound. Furthermore, we prove that estimating $\{\text{Tr}(\rho^i)\}_{i=1}^{\tilde{r}}$ is sufficient to approximate $\text{Tr}(\rho^k)$ even for large integers $k > \widetilde{r}$. This leads to a rank-dependent complexity for solving the problem, providing an efficient algorithm for low-rank quantum states while also improving existing methods when the rank is unknown or when the state is not low-rank. Building upon these advantages, we extend our algorithm to the estimation of $\text{Tr}(M\rho^k)$ for arbitrary observables and $\text{Tr}(\rho^k \sigma^l)$ for multiple quantum states.

Title: Progress towards efficient 4-level photon echo memories
Authors: James Stuart, Kieran Smith, Morgan Hedges, Rose Ahlefeldt, Matthew Sellars
Abstract: Quantum memories could benefit many devices in quantum information processing. For a quantum to be useful in real-world applications, the quantum memory must have a high recall efficiency. Here we demonstrate an efficient (up to 80%) spin-storage quantum memory in Er:YSO, using the 4-level rephased amplified spontaneous emission protocol. We show non-classical correlations between the ASE and RASE fields produced by the quantum memory. Also, we demonstrate the storage of 70 temporal modes, with a write time of 150 us, and a storage time of 25 us. Finally, a clear pathway is presented to improve the efficiency, storage time, and mode capacity. Such a device would have applications in quantum networking and measurement-based quantum computing.

Title: Quantum-data-driven dynamical transition in quantum learning
Authors: Bingzhi Zhang, Junyu Liu, Liang Jiang, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: Quantum neural networks, parameterized quantum circuits optimized under a specific cost function, provide a paradigm for achieving near-term quantum advantage in quantum information processing. Understanding QNN training dynamics is crucial for optimizing their performance, however, the role of quantum data in training for supervised learning such as classification and regression remains unclear. We reveal a quantum-data-driven dynamical transition where the target values and data determine the convergence of the training. Through analytical classification over the fixed points of the dynamical equation, we reveal a comprehensive `phase diagram' featuring seven distinct dynamics originating from a bifurcation with multiple codimension. Perturbative analyses identify both exponential and polynomial convergence class. We provide a non-perturbative theory to explain the transition via generalized restricted Haar ensemble. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations and experimentation on IBM quantum devices. Our findings provide guidance on constructing the cost function to accelerate convergence in QNN training.

Title: Experimental protocol for observing single quantum many-body scars with transmon qubits
Authors: Peter Græns Larsen, Anne E. B. Nielsen, André Eckardt, Francesco Petiziol
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are energy eigenstates which fail to reproduce thermal expectation values of local observables, in systems where the rest of the many-body spectrum fulfils eigenstate thermalization. Experimental observation of quantum many-body scars has so far been limited to models with multiple scar states evenly spaced in energy. It is thus an interesting question whether even single isolated scars, which theoretically embody the weakest possibile violation of eigenstate thermalization and may be thought to have no detectable impact in experiments, can leave a trace in measurable quantities. Moreover, single scars offer an interesting scenario for exploring the connection between quantum many-body scars and the original notion of scarring in quantum dynamical systems theory. Here we propose protocols to observe single scars in architectures of fixed-frequency, fixed-coupling superconducting qubits. We first adapt known models possessing the desired features into a form particularly suited for the experimental platform. We develop protocols for the implementation of these models, through trotterized sequences of two-qubit cross-resonance interactions, and verify the existence of the approximate scar state in the stroboscopic effective Hamiltonian. Since a single scar cannot be detected from coherent revivals in the dynamics, differently from towers of scar states, we propose and numerically investigate alternative and experimentally-accessible signatures. These include the dynamical response of the scar to local state deformations, to controlled noise, and to the resolution of the Lie-Suzuki-Trotter digitization.

Title: Probabilistic Representation of Commutative Quantum Circuit Models
Authors: Richard Yu, Jorge Ramirez, Elaine Wong
Abstract: In commuting parametric quantum circuits, the Fourier series of the pairwise fidelity can be expressed as the characteristic function of random variables. Furthermore, expressiveness can be cast as the recurrence probability of a random walk on a lattice. This construction has been successfully applied to the group composed only of Pauli-Z rotations, and we generalize this probabilistic strategy to any commuting set of Pauli operators. We utilize an efficient algorithm by van den Berg and Temme (2020) using the tableau representation of Pauli strings to yield a unitary from the Clifford group that, under conjugation, simultaneously diagonalizes our commuting set of Pauli rotations. Furthermore, we fully characterize the underlying distribution of the random walk using stabilizer states and their basis state representations. This would allow us to tractably compute the lattice volume and variance matrix used to express the frame potential. Together, this demonstrates a scalable strategy to calculate the expressiveness of parametric quantum models.

Title: Resource-optimized fault-tolerant simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model and high-temperature superconductor models
Authors: Angus Kan, Benjamin Symons
Abstract: Exploring low-cost applications is paramount to creating value in early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here we optimize both gate and qubit counts of recent algorithms for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model. We further devise and compile algorithms to simulate established models of cuprate and pnictide high-temperature superconductors, which include beyond-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and multi-orbital interactions that are absent in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We show that simulations of these more realistic models of high-temperature superconductors require only an order of magnitude or so more Toffoli gates than a simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli and qubit counts that far lower than commonly considered quantum phase estimation circuits for electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry. We believe our results pave the way towards studying high-temperature superconductors on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Title: Quantum Policy Gradient in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
Authors: David M. Bossens, Kishor Bharti, Jayne Thompson
Abstract: Parametrised quantum circuits offer expressive and data-efficient representations for machine learning. Due to quantum states residing in a high-dimensional Hilbert space, parametrised quantum circuits have a natural interpretation in terms of kernel methods. The representation of quantum circuits in terms of quantum kernels has been studied widely in quantum supervised learning, but has been overlooked in the context of quantum RL. This paper proposes the use of kernel policies and quantum policy gradient algorithms for quantum-accessible environments. After discussing the properties of such policies and a demonstration of classical policy gradient on a coherent policy in a quantum environment, we propose parametric and non-parametric policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms with quantum kernel policies in quantum environments. This approach, implemented with both numerical and analytical quantum policy gradient techniques, allows exploiting the many advantages of kernel methods, including data-driven forms for functions (and their gradients) as well as tunable expressiveness. The proposed approach is suitable for vector-valued action spaces and each of the formulations demonstrates a quadratic reduction in query complexity compared to their classical counterparts. We propose actor-critic algorithms based on stochastic policy gradient, deterministic policy gradient, and natural policy gradient, and demonstrate additional query complexity reductions compared to quantum policy gradient algorithms under favourable conditions.

Title: Optimal Form Factors for Experimental Proposals on Gravity-Induced Entanglement
Authors: Ziqian Tang, Hanyu Xue, Zizhao Han, Zikuan Kan, Zeji Li, Yulong Liu
Abstract: The interface between quantum mechanics and gravity remains an unresolved issue. Recent advances in precision measurement suggest that detecting gravity-induced entanglement in oscillator systems could provide key evidence for the quantum nature of gravity. However, thermal decoherence imposes strict constraints on system parameters. For entanglement to occur, mechanical frequency $\omega_m$, dissipation rate $\gamma_m$, environmental temperature $T$, oscillator density $\rho$, and the form factor $\Lambda$-determined by the geometry and arrangement of oscillators-must satisfy a specific constraint. This constraint, intrinsic to the noise model, is considered universal and cannot be improved by quantum control. Given the difficulty in further optimizing $\omega_m$, $\gamma_m$, $\rho$, and $T$, optimizing $\Lambda$ can relax the constraints on these parameters. In this work, we prove that the form factor has a supremum of $2\pi$, revealing a fundamental limit of the oscillator system. We propose designs that approach this supremum, nearly an order of magnitude higher than typical spherical oscillators. This optimization could ease experimental constraints and bring quantum gravity validation based on gravity-induced entanglement closer to realization.

Title: Sample-based Hamiltonian and Lindbladian simulation: Non-asymptotic analysis of sample complexity
Authors: Byeongseon Go, Hyukjoon Kwon, Siheon Park, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. Wave matrix Lindbladization (WML) similarly processes multiple copies of a program state $\psi_L$ in order to realize a Lindbladian evolution. Both algorithms are prototypical sample-based quantum algorithms and can be used for various quantum information processing tasks, including quantum principal component analysis, Hamiltonian simulation, and Lindbladian simulation. In this work, we present detailed sample complexity analyses for DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, as well as for WML and sample-based Lindbladian simulation. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$ for evolution time $t$ and imprecision level $\varepsilon$ quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor. Additionally, we prove that the sample complexity of WML is no larger than $3t^2d^2/\varepsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space on which the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially, and we prove a lower bound of $10^{-4} t^2/\varepsilon$ on the sample complexity of sample-based Lindbladian simulation. These results prove that WML is optimal for sample-based Lindbladian simulation whenever the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially on a constant-sized system. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] and the WML sample complexity analysis in [Patel and Wilde, Open Systems \& Information Dynamics 30, 2350010 (2023)] appear to be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here.

Title: Perturbation-theory approach for predicting vibronic selectivity by entangled-photon-pair absorption
Authors: C. D. Rodriguez-Camargo, H. O. Gestsson, C. Nation, A. R. Jones, A. Olaya-Castro
Abstract: Using second-order perturbation theory in the light-matter interaction, we derive an analytical approximation for the vibronic populations of a diatomic system excited by ultrabroadband frequency entangled photons and evaluate the population dynamics for different degrees of entanglement between photon pairs. Our analytical approach makes the same predictions as previously derived via numerical solutions of the complete Schrödinger equation [H. Oka, Physical Review A 97, 063859 (2018)], with the added advantage of providing clear physical insights into the vibronic selectivity as a function of the degree of photon correlations while requiring significantly reduced computational effort. Specifically, our analytical expression for the probability of vibronic excitation includes a factor which predicts the enhancement of vibrational selectivity as a function of the degree correlation between the entangled photon pairs, the targeted vibrational energy level, and the vibrational molecular structure encoded in the Franck-Condon factors. Our results illustrate the importance of going beyond the usual approximations in second-order perturbation theory to capture the relevance of the vibrational structure of the molecular system of interest in order to gain a deeper understanding of the possible quantum-enhancement provided by the interaction between quantum light and matter.

Title: Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets
Authors: Akihiko Sekine, Ryo Murakami, Yoshiyasu Doi
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.

Title: Optimization of Quantum-Repeater Networks using Stochastic Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Guus Avis, Stefan Krastanov
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are envisioned to enable long-distance entanglement distribution. Analysis of quantum-repeater networks could hasten their realization by informing design decisions and research priorities. Determining derivatives of network properties is crucial towards that end, facilitating optimizations and revealing parameter sensitivity. Doing so, however, is difficult because the networks are discretely random. Here we use a recently developed technique, stochastic automatic differentiation, to automatically extract derivatives from discrete Monte Carlo simulations of repeater networks. With these derivatives, we optimize rate-fidelity tradeoffs in a repeater chain, determine the chain's sensitivity with respect to the coherence times of different nodes, and finally choose the locations of quantum repeaters in a two-dimensional plane to optimize the guaranteed quality of service between four end nodes. In particular, the technique enabled us to discover how the best achievable quality of service, the minimal number of repeaters required to improve a network, and the number of repeaters required to saturate the network scale with the physical size of the network.

Title: Riemannian quantum circuit optimization based on matrix product operators
Authors: Isabel Nha Minh Le, Shuo Sun, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: We significantly enhance the simulation accuracy of initial Trotter circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quantum systems by integrating first-order Riemannian optimization with tensor network methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude for systems of 50 qubits, although our method is also applicable to larger systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.

Title: Genuine Multipartite Nonlocality sharing under sequential measurement
Authors: Sk Sahadat Hossain, Indrani Chattopadhyay
Abstract: The study of quantum nonlocality sharing has garnered significant attention, particularly for two-qubit and three-qubit entangled systems. In this paper, we extend the investigation to $n$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) systems, analyzing nonlocality sharing under unbiased unsharp measurements. Employing the Seevink and Svetlichny inequalities, we explore both unilateral and multilateral sequential measurement scenarios. In the unilateral scenario, we derive the range for which an observer's multiple copies can share genuine $n$-partite nonlocality with single copies of the remaining parties. In the multilateral scenario, we identify the maximum number of independent observers on $m$ sides who can share genuine $n$-partite nonlocality with other parties. A crucial aspect of our results is that all findings stem from a measurement strategy where each sequential observer utilizes unbiased unsharp measurements. As a specific case, for the four-qubit maximally entangled GHZ state, we demonstrate that at most two copies of an observer (e.g., Alice) can share nonlocality in the unilateral sequential measurement scenario. However, in the multilateral scenario, no additional sharing is possible compared to the unilateral case. This finding highlights the significance of unsharp measurements in optimizing the recycling of qubits for generating quantum nonlocality.

Title: Two-Photon Interference from an InAs Quantum Dot emitting in the Telecom C-Band
Authors: Jaewon Kim, Jochen Kaupp, Yorick Reum, Giora Peniakov, Johannes Michl, Felix Kohr, Monika Emmerling, Martin Kamp, Yong-Hoon Cho, Tobias Huber-Loyola, Sven Höfling, Andreas T. Pfenning
Abstract: Two-photon interference from an InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dot (QD) emitting in the telecom C-band with a raw two-photon interference visibility of $V_{HOM}=(71.9\pm0.2)$ % is demonstrated. This is achieved by a two-fold approach: an improvement of the molecular beam epitaxial growth for better QDs, and integration of the QDs into an optical circular Bragg grating resonator for a Purcell enhancement of the radiative decay rate. The quantum optical properties of the fabricated device are studied by means of time-correlated single-photon counting under quasi-resonant excitation of the charged exciton line. A reduced lifetime of $T_1=(257.5\pm0.2)$ ps is found corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P\geqq(4.7\pm0.5)$. Pronounced anti-bunching of the second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)} (0)=(0.0307\pm0.0004)$ confirms the single-photon emission character. The two-photon interference is demonstrated with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration. We discuss strategies how to further improve the indistinguishability, and provide a survey of the state-of-the art.

Title: Heisenberg-limited calibration of entangling gates with robust phase estimation
Authors: Kenneth Rudinger, J. P. Marceaux, Akel Hashim, David I. Santiago, Irfan Siddiqi, Kevin C. Young
Abstract: The calibration of high-quality two-qubit entangling gates is an essential component in engineering large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, many standard calibration techniques are based on randomized circuits that are only quadratically sensitive to calibration errors. As a result, these approaches are inefficient, requiring many experimental shots to achieve acceptable performance. In this work, we demonstrate that robust phase estimation can enable high-precision, Heisenberg-limited estimates of coherent errors in multi-qubit gates. Equipped with an efficient estimator, the calibration problem may be reduced to a simple optimization loop that minimizes the estimated coherent error. We experimentally demonstrate our calibration protocols by improving the operation of a two-qubit controlled-Z gate on a superconducting processor, and we validate the improved performance with gate set tomography. Our methods are applicable to gates in other quantum hardware platforms such as ion traps and neutral atoms, and on other multi-qubit gates, such as CNOT or iSWAP.

Title: Computing Efficiently in QLDPC Codes

Abstract: It is the prevailing belief that quantum error correcting techniques will be required to build a utility-scale quantum computer able to perform computations that are out of reach of classical computers. The QECCs that have been most extensively studied and therefore highly optimized, surface codes, are extremely resource intensive in terms of the number of physical qubits needed. A promising alternative, QLDPC codes, has been proposed more recently. These codes are much less resource intensive, requiring up to 10x fewer physical qubits per logical qubit than practical surface code implementations. A successful application of QLDPC codes would therefore drastically reduce the timeline to reaching quantum computers that can run algorithms with proven exponential speedups like Shor's algorithm and QPE. However to date QLDPC codes have been predominantly studied in the context of quantum memories; there has been no known method for implementing arbitrary logical Clifford operators in a QLDPC code proven efficient in terms of circuit depth. In combination with known methods for implementing T gates, an efficient implementation of the Clifford group unlocks resource-efficient universal quantum computation. In this paper, we introduce a new family of QLDPC codes that enable efficient compilation of the full Clifford group via transversal operations. Our construction executes any m-qubit Clifford operation in at most O(m) syndrome extraction rounds, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art lattice surgery methods. We run circuit-level simulations of depth-126 logical circuits to show that logical operations in our QLDPC codes attains near-memory performance. These results demonstrate that QLDPC codes are a viable means to reduce, by up to 10x, the resources required to implement all logical quantum algorithms, thereby unlocking a much reduced timeline to commercially valuable quantum computing.

Title: Rapid and Stable Collective Charging and Discharge Suppression in Strongly Coupled Many-Body Quantum Batteries
Authors: Shun-Cai Zhao, Yi-Fan Yang, Ni-Ya Zhuang
Abstract: Achieving rapid and stable energy storage in quantum batteries (QBs) remains a key challenge, particularly under strong system-environment coupling where non-Markovian effects become prominent. While most previous studies focus on weak coupling regimes, we propose a many-body QB model exhibiting collective charging and discharge suppression in a non-perturbative regime. The model adopts a $\Lambda$-type configuration where multiple battery units share a common excited state and have individual ground states, forming an effective collective structure. To accurately capture the dynamics under strong coupling, the system's time evolution is governed by a Redfield-type master equation tincorporating memory effects via a Debye spectral density. We quantify the stored energy using ergotropy and analyze the impact of tunneling, driving strength, spectral width, and environmental temperature on charging performance. Numerical simulations reveal that optimized driving and reservoir engineering can simultaneously achieve rapid and stable charging while suppressing energy leakage. These results provide theoretical insight into strong-coupling thermodynamics and guide the design of robust QB platforms using solid-state or atomic systems.

Title: Optomechanically induced transparency in Four-wave mixing atomic ensemble assisted Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity system
Authors: Yue-Tong Hao, Yi-Mou Liu
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state optical response of a Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity system integrated with cold atoms featuring a double-$\Lambda$ energy level structure. Within this hybrid system, the atoms are driven by cavity mode and three coherent vortex beams, each carrying independent orbital angular momentum (OAM). We first check the steady-state output spectrum of the hybrid system in the passive/active case (without/with external cavity driving). Our findings reveal that the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) spectrum is modulated by the OAM difference $(\Delta \ell\hbar)$ from the atomic component throughout the four-wave mixing (FWM) process. The resulting loop phase ($\Delta \ell\theta$) can achieve a switching effect on the absorption and gain behavior of the hybrid system for the probe beam. Additionally, the group delay, indicative of fast/slow light phenomena, is also tuned by $\Delta \ell$. We further display how the atomic OAM modulates the periodicity of the output spot pattern in the hybrid system. This research provides valuable insights into the modulation of optical responses in Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity systems.

Title: Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction
Authors: Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-form symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.

Title: Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling
Authors: Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.

Title: Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy
Authors: Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.

Title: Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements
Authors: Adrian Skasberg Aasen, Andras Di Giovanni, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov, Martin Gärttner
Abstract: Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data postprocessing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error-mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures, using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.

Title: Optimal bound on long-range distillable entanglement
Authors: Jonah Kudler-Flam, Vladimir Narovlansky, Nikita Sopenko
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.

Title: A Constructive Definition of Space via Dynamical Evolution and Observational Acts
Authors: So Katagiri
Abstract: We propose a constructive and dynamical redefinition of spatial structure, grounded in the interplay between mechanical evolution and observational acts. Rather than presupposing space as a static background, we interpret space as an emergent entity that arises through observational acts. Using the framework of pre-topologies, measurable structures, and the GNS construction, we analyze how the choice of observables and the system's time evolution dynamically determine the topological and measure-theoretic features of space. This approach highlights the observer-dependent and context-sensitive nature of spatial concepts in both classical and quantum domains.

Title: Dynamic control of photon-magnon interactions via secondary magnon excitation
Authors: Fizaan Khan, Sachin Verma, Biswanath Bhoi, Rajeev Singh
Abstract: Photon-mediated magnon-magnon coupling between spatially separated Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) and permalloy (NiFe) thin films on a planar hexagonal ring resonator shows clear signatures of magnon-magnon interaction are observed without direct dipolar interaction between the magnetic films. The coupling strength between the hexagonal ring resonator and the permalloy film increases with the thickness of the YIG film, despite a fixed permalloy film thickness. This suggests the presence of an indirect interaction channel mediated by resonator photons. A theoretical model is presented that accurately reproduces the observed transmission spectra and reveals a nontrivial interdependence between the individual coupling strengths of YIG and permalloy to the resonator. These results highlight the importance of indirect interactions and potential crosstalk pathways in designing hybrid magnonic systems and scalable quantum architectures, while demonstrating the feasibility of cost-effective, planar configurations for experimental implementation. These insights are valuable for advancing low-loss, coherent information transfer in hybrid quantum devices.

Title: Variational-toolbox-based separability detection of multiqubit states
Authors: Jin-Min Liang, Shao-Ming Fei, Qiongyi He
Abstract: Parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) are crucial in variational quantum algorithms. While it is commonly believed that the optimal PQC is solely used to reproduce the target state, we here reveal that the optimal PQC can also provide valuable insights into the state's properties. We propose variational toolboxes to identify the $k$-separability of pure states, with or without preparation noise, by checking the structure within the optimal PQCs. Additionally, we introduce adaptive optimization strategies to detect the $k$-separability of mixed states. Compared to fixed PQCs, our approach controls fewer parameters for low-rank states. Finally, we validate our methods through numerical demonstrations for various states.

Title: Spin textures in curved paths on a curved surface
Authors: Guo-Hua Liang, Ai-Guo Mei, Zhi-Hui Yang, Ze-Lin Wei
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle confined to a curved path from the dynamics of a two-dimensional curved thin-layer system incorporating spin connection contributions. We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential, while the geodesic and Gaussian curvatures govern the effective scalar potential in the Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and without the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface topology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and to the pseudo-magnetic flux. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation. Furthermore, the spin evolution along Viviani's curve exemplifies surface dependence. The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and independence of the spin from the path direction. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling novel topological quantum control strategies.

Title: A Two-stage Optimization Method for Wide-range Single-electron Quantum Magnetic Sensing
Authors: Shiqian Guo, Jianqing Liu, Thinh Le, Huaiyu Dai
Abstract: Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity, revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond. At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.

Title: $d+1$ Measurement Bases are Sufficient for Determining $d$-Dimensional Quantum States: Theory and Experiment
Authors: Tianqi Xiao, Yaxin Wang, Ying Xia, Zhihao Li, Xiaoqi Zhou
Abstract: A long-standing problem in quantum physics is to determine the minimal number of measurement bases required for the complete characterization of unknown quantum states, a question of particular relevance to high-dimensional quantum information processing. Here, we propose a quantum state tomography scheme that requires only $d+1$ projective measurement bases to fully reconstruct an arbitrary $d$-dimensional quantum state. As a proof-of-principle, we experimentally verified this scheme on a silicon photonic chip by reconstructing quantum states for $d=6$, in which a complete set of mutually unbiased bases does not exist. This approach offers new perspectives for quantum state characterization and measurement design, and holds promise for future applications in quantum information processing.

Title: Cutting Slack: Quantum Optimization with Slack-Free Methods for Combinatorial Benchmarks
Authors: Monit Sharma, Hoong Chuin Lau
Abstract: Constraint handling remains a key bottleneck in quantum combinatorial optimization. While slack-variable-based encodings are straightforward, they significantly increase qubit counts and circuit depth, challenging the scalability of quantum solvers. In this work, we investigate a suite of Lagrangian-based optimization techniques including dual ascent, bundle methods, cutting plane approaches, and augmented Lagrangian formulations for solving constrained combinatorial problems on quantum simulators and hardware. Our framework is applied to three representative NP-hard problems: the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), and the Maximum Independent Set (MIS). We demonstrate that MDKP and TSP, with their inequality-based or degree-constrained structures, allow for slack-free reformulations, leading to significant qubit savings without compromising performance. In contrast, MIS does not inherently benefit from slack elimination but still gains in feasibility and objective quality from principled Lagrangian updates. We benchmark these methods across classically hard instances, analyzing trade-offs in qubit usage, feasibility, and optimality gaps. Our results highlight the flexibility of Lagrangian formulations as a scalable alternative to naive QUBO penalization, even when qubit savings are not always achievable. This work provides practical insights for deploying constraint-aware quantum optimization pipelines, with applications in logistics, network design, and resource allocation.

Title: Improving the Rate-Loss Scaling in Polarization Entanglement Distribution using Single-Click Entanglement Swapping
Authors: Hikaru Shimizu, Joe Yoshimoto, Daiki Ichii, Junko Ishi-Hayase, Rikizo Ikuta, Masahiro Takeoka
Abstract: Polarization entanglement is widely used in optical quantum information processing due to its compatibility with standard optical components. On the other hand, it is known that polarization entanglement is susceptible to the loss, more precisely, its transmission rate in a lossy channel is limited by the scaling of O({\eta}), where {\eta} is a transmittance of the channel. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that this rate-loss scaling limit can be overcome by a relatively simple protocol. This is possible by integrating the idea of the polarizaion-photon-number hybrid entanglement and the single-click entanglement swapping. We demonstrate square root improvement of the rate-loss scaling from the conventional approaches and achieve the fidelity of 0.843 for the distributed polarization entangled photon pairs. This improvement in the rate-loss scaling is equivalent to that achieved by 1-hop quantum repeater node. Our result paves a way to build a near-future quantum network and its applications.

Title: Electron charge coherence on a solid neon surface
Authors: Xinhao Li, Shan Zou, Qianfan Chen, Dafei Jin
Abstract: Recent experiments show ~0.1 ms coherence time for a single electron charge qubit on a solid neon surface. This remarkably long coherence time is believed to result from the intrinsic purity of solid neon as a qubit host. In this paper, we present theoretical studies on the decoherence mechanisms of an electron's charge (lateral motional) states on solid neon. At the typical experimental temperature of ~10 mK, the two main decoherence mechanisms are the phonon-induced displacement of neon surface and phonon-induced modulation of neon permittivity (dielectric constant). With a qubit frequency increasing from 1 GHz to 10 GHz, the charge coherence time decreases from about 366 s to 7 ms and from about 27 s to 0.3 ms, respectively, limited by the two mechanisms above. The calculated coherence times are at least one order longer than the observed ones at ~6.4 GHz qubit frequency, suggesting plenty of room for experimental improvement.

Title: On the Simulation of Conical Intersections in Water and Methanimine Molecules Via Variational Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Samir Belaloui, Nacer Eddine Belaloui, Achour Benslama
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of methanimine (CH2NH) and water (H2O) molecules in an effort to locate conical intersections (CIs) using variational quantum algorithms. Our approach implements and compares a range of hybrid quantum-classical methods, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), VQE with Automatically-Adjusted Constraints (VQE-AC), and we explore molecular configurations of interest using a State-Average (SA) approach. Exact Diagonalization is employed as the classical benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the quantum algorithms. We perform simulations across a range of molecular geometries, basis sets, and active spaces to compare each algorithm's performance and accuracy, and to enhance the detectability of CIs. This work confirms the quantum variational algorithms' capability of describing conical intersections in both molecules, as long as appropriate active spaces and geometries of the molecule are chosen. We also compare the accuracy and reliability of VQE-based methods for computing excited states with classical benchmark methods, and we demonstrate good agreement within desired regions.

Title: Magic States in the Asymmetric Quantum Rabi Model
Authors: A. Campos-Uscanga, E. Benítez Rodríguez, E. Piceno Martínez, M. A. Bastarrachea-Magnani
Abstract: Magic or non-stabilizerness is a resource for quantum computing that has been extensively studied in qudit networks. It describes the degree to which Clifford gates cannot generate a given state, capturing the advantage of quantum over classical computing. However, its definition in continuous variables and general composite systems remains an open issue. We study magic in a bipartite system, the Asymmetric Quantum Rabi model, a paradigmatic model from quantum optics. We explore the presence of magic in the qubit-reduced system throughout the Hamiltonian parameter space, the role of light-matter interactions in its generation, and the manifestation of Wigner function negativity in the corresponding bosonic degree of freedom. Finally, we discuss our results for magic state preparation in the strong and ultra-strong coupling regimes within the context of quantum informational systems.

Title: First Experience with Real-Time Control Using Simulated VQC-Based Quantum Policies
Authors: Yize Sun, Mohamad Hagog, Marc Weber, Daniel Hein, Steffen Udluft, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of quantum computing into offline reinforcement learning and the deployment of the resulting quantum policy in a real-time control hardware realization of the cart-pole system. Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) are used to represent the policy. Classical model-based offline policy search was applied, in which a pure VQC with trainable input-output weights is used as a policy network instead of a classical multilayer perceptron. The goal is to evaluate the potential of deploying quantum architectures in real-world industrial control problems. The experimental results show that the investigated model-based offline policy search is able to generate quantum policies that can balance the hardware cart-pole. A latency analysis reveals that while local simulated execution meets real-time requirements, cloud-based quantum processing remains too slow for closed-loop control.

Title: Charge sensitivity in the transmon regime
Authors: Rocio Gonzalez-Meza, Vito Iaia, Anika Zaman, Hiu-Yung Wong, Yujin Cho, Kristin Beck, Yaniv J. Rosen
Abstract: Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.

Title: Secure Quantum Key Distribution via Entangled Quantum Walkers
Authors: Chia-Tso Lai
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an emerging cryptographic method designed for secure key sharing. Its security is theoretically guaranteed by fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, making it a leading candidate for future communication protocols. Quantum Random Walks (QRWs), on the other hand, are quantum processes that exhibit intriguing phenomena such as interference and superposition, enabling the generation of decentralized and asymmetric probability distributions. Inspired by both fields of study, we propose a novel QKD protocol based on two entangled quantum walkers. Our protocol exploits the unique correlations between the walkers at extremal positions of the walk to establish secret keys shared exclusively by the two parties. The security of the protocol is augmented by analyzing the joint probability distributions of the walkers' measured positions and their associated coin states.

Title: Federated Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-term Memory for Human Activity Recognition
Authors: Yu-Chao Hsu, Jiun-Cheng Jiang, Chun-Hua Lin, Wei-Ting Chen, Kuo-Chung Peng, Prayag Tiwari, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, En-Jui Kuo
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Federated Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-term Memory (Fed-QK-LSTM) framework, integrating the quantum kernel methods and Long Short-term Memory into federated learning. Within Fed-QK-LSTM framework, we enhance human activity recognition (HAR) in privacy-sensitive environments and leverage quantum computing for distributed learning systems. The DeepConv-QK-LSTM architecture on each client node employs convolutional layers for efficient local pattern capture, this design enables the use of a shallow QK-LSTM to model long-range relationships within the HAR data. The quantum kernel method enables the model to capture complex non-linear relationships in multivariate time-series data with fewer trainable parameters. Experimental results on RealWorld HAR dataset demonstrate that Fed-QK-LSTM framework achieves competitive accuracy across different client settings and local training rounds. We showcase the potential of Fed-QK-LSTM framework for robust and privacy-preserving human activity recognition in real-world applications, especially in edge computing environments and on scarce quantum devices.

Title: Cavity-based optical switching via phase modulation in warm rubidium vapor
Authors: Georgia Booton, Tabijah Wasawo, William O.C. Davis, Cameron McGarry, Kristina R. Rusimova, Alex O.C. Davis, Josh Nunn, Peter J. Mosley
Abstract: Optical switching remains a key outstanding challenge for scalable fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing due to the trade-off between speed, bandwidth, and loss. Scalable quantum photonics demands all three, to enable high computational clock rates and resource efficient scaling to large systems. We present a cavity-based optical switch that overcomes this limitation, demonstrating 22 ns rise time, insertion loss of 2.4 dB, and 17.5 dB extinction ratio. All-optical control is achieved via phase modulation of a signal field detuned from the near-degenerate two-photon absorption ladder in warm rubidium vapor. The ultimate performance of our switch, combining both speed and efficiency, will find applications in active multiplexing, loop-based quantum memory, and feedforward for quantum error-correction protocols.

Title: Quantum asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory systems from the Koopman operator viewpoint
Authors: Yuzuru Kato
Abstract: We have recently proposed a fully quantum-mechanical definition of the asymptotic phase for quantum nonlinear oscillators, which is also applicable in the strong quantum regime [Kato and Nakao 2022 Chaos 32 063133]. In this study, we propose a definition of the quantum asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory systems, which naturally extends the asymptotic amplitude for classical nonlinear oscillators on the basis of the Koopman operator theory. We introduce the asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory systems by using the eigenoperator of the backward Liouville operator associated with the largest non-zero real eigenvalue. Using examples of the quantum van der Pol oscillator with the quantum Kerr effect, which exhibits quantum limit-cycle oscillations, and the quantum van der Pol model with the quantum squeezing and degenerate parametric oscillator with nonlinear damping, which exhibit quantum noise-induced oscillations, we demonstrate that the proposed quantum asymptotic amplitude yields isostable amplitude values that decay exponentially with a constant rate. Furthermore, using the quantum asymptotic amplitude, we introduce effective quantum periodic orbits for quantum limit-cycle oscillations and quantum noise-induced oscillations.

Title: Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and generalized Fermi surface formula in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: Kai Zhang, Chang Shu, Kai Sun
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially localized edge modes in open-boundary systems, has led to the discovery of numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to this familiar exponential localization, we report a distinct phenomenon--the algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect--which arises generically in non-Hermitian systems with two or more spatial dimensions. In such cases, the amplitude of skin modes typically decays from the boundary following a power law, rather than an exponential form--a behavior not captured by existing theoretical frameworks. To bridge this gap and describe the transition in localization from one to higher dimensions, we develop a generalized Fermi surface framework applicable to open-boundary systems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework not only reproduces known results for the exponential skin effect in 1D, but also predicts a new class of skin effects with algebraic decay in 2D and above. We demonstrate this framework in both tight-binding and continuum models in two and three dimensions. This investigation not only unveils a novel category of the non-Hermitian skin effect but also offers a comprehensive theoretical structure that describes skin effects in any non-Hermitian system, irrespective of its spatial dimensionality.

Title: Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with Plasma oscillation phase-matching
Authors: Emil Rizvanov, Samuel Kern, Pavol Neilinger, Miroslav Grajcar
Abstract: High gain and large bandwidth of traveling-wave parametric amplifier exploiting the nonlinearity of Josephson Junctions can be achieved by fulfilling the so-called phase-matching condition. This condition is usually addressed by placing resonant structures along the waveguide or by periodic modulations of its parameters, creating gaps in the waveguide's dispersion. Here, we propose to employ the Josephson junctions, which constitute the centerline of the amplifier, as resonant elements for phase matching. By numerical simulations in JoSIM (and WRspice) software, we show that Josephson plasma oscillations can be utilized to create wavevector mismatch sufficient for phase matching as well as to prevent the conversion of the pump energy to higher harmonics. The proposed TWPA design has a gain of 15 dB and a 3.5 GHz bandwidth, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art TWPAs.

Title: Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays
Authors: Aaron Holman, Yuan Xu, Ximo Sun, Jiahao Wu, Mingxuan Wang, Zezheng Zhu, Bojeong Seo, Nanfang Yu, Sebastian Will
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. However, existing tweezer platforms have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two dimensional arrays with more than 1000 trapped atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Leveraging sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, our platform allows scaling far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances will facilitate tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.

Title: Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Arijit Mandal, S. Satpathy, B.R.K. Nanda
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work opens up the scope to go beyond the existing avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.

Title: Time-reversed Young's experiment: Deterministic, diffractionless second-order interference effect
Authors: Jianming Wen
Abstract: The classic Young's double-slit experiment exhibits first-order interference, producing alternating bright and dark fringes modulated by the diffraction effect of the slits. In contrast, here we demonstrate that its time-reversed configuration produces an ideal, deterministic second-order 'ghost' interference pattern devoid of diffraction and first-order effect, with the size dependent on the dimensions of the `effectively extended light source.' Furthermore, the new system enables a range of effects and phenomena not available in traditional double-slit interference studies, including the formation of programmed and digitized interference fringes and the coincidence of the pattern plane and the source plane. Despite the absence of first-order interference, our proposed experiment does not rely on nonclassical correlations or quantum entanglement. The elimination of diffraction through time-reversal symmetry holds promise for advancing superresolution optical imaging and sensing techniques beyond existing capabilities.

Title: Quantum Cluster State Model with Haagerup Fusion Category Symmetry
Authors: Zhian Jia
Abstract: We propose a (1+1)D lattice model, inspired by a weak Hopf algebra generalization of the cluster state model, which realizes Haagerup fusion category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.

Title: Magnetic moments in the Poynting theorem, Maxwell equations, Dirac equation, and QED
Authors: Peter J Mohr
Abstract: The role of magnetic moments in classical and quantum electrodynamics is examined in this work. The effects are described by a classical extended Poynting theorem and extended Maxwell equations and by conventional quantum electrodynamics expressed in terms of electromagnetic fields. Both descriptions take into account energetics of the interaction of magnetic moments with inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We show how magnetic moment effects are included in either version of electrodynamics and that these apparently different formulations can give consistent results. In either case, we express the interactions in terms of electromagnetic fields only, avoiding use of a vector potential. The main focus is on magnetic dipole interactions, and magnetic monopole interactions are not considered.

Title: Quantum advantage in decentralized control of POMDPs: A control-theoretic view of the Mermin-Peres square
Authors: Venkat Anantharam
Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Pravin P. Varaiya.

Title: Complex entanglement entropy for complex conformal field theory
Authors: Haruki Shimizu, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.

Title: The Canonical Forms of Matrix Product States in Infinite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Authors: Niilo Heikkinen
Abstract: In this work, we prove that any element in the tensor product of separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be expressed as a matrix product state (MPS) of possibly infinite bond dimension. The proof is based on the singular value decomposition of compact operators and the connection between tensor products and Hilbert-Schmidt operators via the Schmidt decomposition in infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces. The construction of infinite-dimensional MPS (idMPS) is analogous to the well-known finite-dimensional construction in terms of singular value decompositions of matrices. The infinite matrices in idMPS give rise to operators acting on (possibly infinite-dimensional) auxiliary Hilbert spaces. As an example we explicitly construct an MPS representation for certain eigenstates of a chain of three coupled harmonic oscillators.

Title: Dynamic Hologram Generation with Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Xing-Yu Zhang, Yu-Qing Wang, Angrui Du, Han Wang, Lei Wang, Jinguo Liu
Abstract: We designed an automatic differentiation-based strategy to generate optical trap arrays that change smoothly in time. Instead of repeatedly regenerating the holograms for each time step, we derive the differential form of the phase dynamics that enables the continuous evolution of the trap coordinates. This differential form is derived from the implicit differentiation of the fixed point of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, which is computationally efficient. We carried out numerical and laboratory experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the phase continuity and reducing the computational burden compared to the traditional pure interpolation techniques. By combining the method with the spatial light modulator, the method is promising for the dynamic manipulation of particles in real experiments.

Title: Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D: ground state and real-time dynamics
Authors: Yantao Wu, Wen-Yuan Liu
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D for both ground state and real-time dynamics. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which already simplifies existing algorithms for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo (VMC), enabling efficient computations for (2+1)D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground state simulation of pure $Z_2$, $Z_3$ and $Z_4$ gauge theory, odd-$Z_2$ gauge theories, and $Z_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32 \times 32$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long-time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined $Z_2$ gauge field on a $10\times10$ lattice. This is also the first example of using VMC to simulate the real-time dynamics of PEPS, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory.

Abstract: We illustrate the emergence of classical analogue of coherent state and its generalisation in a purely classical field theoretical setting. Our algebraic approach makes use of the Poisson bracket and symmetries of the underlying field theory, in a complete parallel to the quantum construction. The classical phase space picture is found to play a key role in this construction.

Title: Valley Splitting Correlations Across a Silicon Quantum Well

Abstract: Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and >1{\mu}m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.

Title: Quantum Entanglement Autodistillation in Baryon Pair Decays
Authors: Hai-Long Feng, Hao Tang, Wu-zhong Guo, Qin Qin
Abstract: We study the spin-entangled mixed state of a spin-1/2 baryon-antibaryon pair produced in the process e+e- to J/psi, psi(2S) to BBbar. We demonstrate that the spin entanglement of the system can increase following the decays B to b + M and Bbar to bbar + Mbar, where b and bbar are spin-1/2 baryons and M, Mbar are spin-0 mesons. This phenomenon, known as entanglement autodistillation, represents a probabilistic amplification of entanglement during the decay process. We analyze the underlying mechanism and show that it depends only on the initial state of the BBbar system and the decay parameter alphaD, but not on the phase parameter phiD.

Title: Violation of Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis in $W_3$ Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar, Sujoy Mahato, Sukrut Mondkar, Praveen Thalore
Abstract: We show that a large central charge conformal field theory with $W_3$ symmetry exhibits violation of the conjectured operator growth bound if the Liouvillian is modified to incorporate $W_3$ generators. We get 23 classes of Lanczos coefficients, obtained by the action of the Liouvillian on a descendant state. Among these, 10 classes of Lanczos coefficients violate the conjectured upper bound by exhibiting a faster-than-linear growth with the descendant level $N$. Two classes of them have asymptotic growth saturating at $N^2$, displaying maximal violation.

Title: Extending unified gravity to account for graviton-graviton interaction
Authors: Mikko Partanen, Jukka Tulkki
Abstract: Recently, a gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] has been developed to extend the Standard Model to include gravity. Here we present unified gravity using the ordinary four-vector and tensor field notation of the Standard Model. The main goal of the present work is to extend the original Minkowski spacetime formulation of the theory to account for graviton-graviton interaction. This is a necessary extension for problems involving interactions between gravitational fields, for example, in the propagation of gravitational waves in external gravitational potentials. The 4xU(1) gauge invariance of unified gravity is preserved in this extension.

Title: A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model
Authors: Andris Ambainis, Joao F. Doriguello, Debbie Lim
Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time, freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al. (arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the $O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret, exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise all of our results to compact state spaces.

Title: Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions in Large $N$ Matrix Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Minjae Cho
Abstract: It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence, uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.

Title: Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing
Authors: Yan Xi Foo, Aisha Kermiche, Farhan T. Chowdhury, Clarice D. Aiello, Luke D. Smith
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.

Title: Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves
Authors: Partha Nandi, Frederik G. Scholtz
Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.
