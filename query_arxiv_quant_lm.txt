Title: QDCNN: Quantum Deep Learning for Enhancing Safety and Reliability in Autonomous Transportation Systems
Authors: Ashtakala Meghanath, Subham Das, Bikash K.Behera, Muhammad Attique Khan, Saif Al-Kuwari, Ahmed Farouk
Abstract: In transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS), ensuring safety and reliability in real-time decision-making is essential for successfully deploying autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation networks. However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UUâ€  method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate the key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time. This research demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced models in addressing critical limitations of classical methods, contributing to more dependable and robust autonomous transportation systems within the CPS framework.

Title: QCS-ADME: Quantum Circuit Search for Drug Property Prediction with Imbalanced Data and Regression Adaptation
Authors: Kangyu Zheng, Tianfan Fu, Zhiding Liang
Abstract: The biomedical field is beginning to explore the use of quantum machine learning (QML) for tasks traditionally handled by classical machine learning, especially in predicting ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties, which are essential in drug evaluation. However, ADME tasks pose unique challenges for existing quantum computing systems (QCS) frameworks, as they involve both classification with unbalanced dataset and regression problems. These dual requirements make it necessary to adapt and refine current QCS frameworks to effectively address the complexities of ADME predictions. We propose a novel training-free scoring mechanism to evaluate QML circuit performance on imbalanced classification and regression tasks. Our mechanism demonstrates significant correlation between scoring metrics and test performance on imbalanced classification tasks. Additionally, we develop methods to quantify continuous similarity relationships between quantum states, enabling performance prediction for regression tasks. This represents the first comprehensive approach to searching and evaluating QCS circuits specifically for regression applications. Validation on representative ADME tasks-one imbalanced classification and one regression-demonstrates moderate positive correlation between our scoring metrics and circuit performance, significantly outperforming baseline scoring methods that show negligible correlation.

Title: Universal Counterdiabatic Driving
Authors: Stewart Morawetz, Anatoli Polkovnikov
Abstract: Local counterdiabatic (CD) driving provides a systematic way of constructing a control protocol to approximately suppress the excitations resulting from changing some parameter(s) of a quantum system at a finite rate. However, designing CD protocols typically requires knowledge of the original Hamiltonian a priori. In this work, we design local CD driving protocols in Krylov space using only the characteristic local time scales of the system set by e.g. phonon frequencies in materials or Rabi frequencies in superconducting qubit arrays. Surprisingly, we find that convergence of these universal protocols is controlled by the asymptotic high frequency tails of the response functions. This finding hints at a deep connection between the long-time, low frequency response of the system controlling non-adiabatic effects, and the high-frequency response determined by the short-time operator growth and the Krylov complexity, which has been elusive until now.

Title: Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees
Authors: Jernej Rudi Finzgar, Simone Notarnicola, Madelyn Cain, Mikhail D. Lukin Mikhail, Dries Sels
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.

Title: Enhanced quantum frequency estimation by nonlinear scrambling
Authors: Victor Montenegro, Sara Dornetti, Alessandro Ferraro, Matteo G. A. Paris
Abstract: Frequency estimation, a cornerstone of basic and applied sciences, has been significantly enhanced by quantum sensing strategies. Despite breakthroughs in quantum-enhanced frequency estimation, key challenges remain: static probes limit flexibility, and the interplay between resource efficiency, sensing precision, and potential enhancements from nonlinear probes remains not fully understood. In this work, we show that dynamically encoding an unknown frequency in a nonlinear quantum electromagnetic field can significantly improve frequency estimation. To provide a fair comparison of resources, we define the energy cost as the figure of merit for our sensing strategy. We further show that specific higher-order nonlinear processes lead to nonlinear-enhanced frequency estimation. This enhancement results from quantum scrambling, where local quantum information spreads across a larger portion of the Hilbert space. We quantify this effect using the Wigner-Yanase skew information, which measures the degree of noncommutativity in the Hamiltonian structure. Our work sheds light on the connection between Wigner-Yanase skew information and quantum sensing, providing a direct method to optimize nonlinear quantum probes.

Title: Towards Practical Quantum Neural Network Diagnostics with Neural Tangent Kernels
Authors: Francesco Scala, Christa Zoufal, Dario Gerace, Francesco Tacchino
Abstract: Knowing whether a Quantum Machine Learning model would perform well on a given dataset before training it can help to save critical resources. However, gathering a priori information about model performance (e.g., training speed, critical hyperparameters, or inference capabilities on unseen data) is a highly non-trivial task, in general. Recently, the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) has been proposed as a powerful mathematical tool to describe the behavior of Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models. In this work, we propose a practical framework allowing to employ the QNTK for QNN performance diagnostics. More specifically, we show how a critical learning rate and a characteristic decay time for the average training error can be estimated from the spectrum of the QNTK evaluated at the initialization stage. We then show how a QNTK-based kernel formula can be used to analyze, up to a first-order approximation, the expected inference capabilities of the quantum model under study. We validate our proposed approach with extensive numerical simulations, using different QNN architectures and datasets. Our results demonstrate that QNTK diagnostics yields accurate approximations of QNN behavior for sufficiently deep circuits, can provide insights for shallow QNNs, and enables detecting - hence also addressing - potential shortcomings in model design.

Title: Entanglement dynamics of many-body quantum states with evolving system conditions
Authors: Devanshu Shekhar, Pragya Shukla
Abstract: The entanglement analysis of a pure state of a many-body quantum system requires a prior information about its density matrix/ state matrix, obtained in principle by solving the Hamiltonian matrix. The missing information due to complexity of the many-body interactions however renders it necessary to consider an ensemble of Hamiltonians and thereby an ensemble of pure states. This in turn leaves a statistical description of the entanglement measures as the only option. We consider physical Hamiltonians that can be modelled by a multiparametric Gaussian ensembles, theoretically derive the state ensembles for its eigenstates and analyze the effect of varying system conditions on its entanglement statistics. Our approach leads to a single parametric based common mathematical formulation for the evolution of the statistics of different state ensembles. The parameter turns out to be a single functional of the system parameters and thereby reveals a deep web of connection underlying different quantum states.

Title: Comments on: "Introduction to the Absolute Brightness and Number Statistics in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion" (2019 J. Opt. 21, 043501)
Authors: James Schneeloch
Abstract: These comments contain two primary improvements to the aforementioned article: Where previously mentioned in passing in section 3.4 of our article, we now provide, using the same basic steps as in Bennink's paper, [Phys. Rev. A 81, 053805 (2010)] (with some expanded discussion), a full derivation for the absolute generation rate of photon pairs from Spontaneous-Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) when using a focused gaussian pump beam as input, and collecting the output biphotons in a pair of focused gaussian collection modes. We do this to both show consistency between our formalism and his treatment, and to be able to use it to predict the absolute brightness of photon pair generation in these sources. In doing so, our formula differs from that in [Phys. Rev. A 81, 053805 (2010)] by only a constant factor based on the ratio of products of indices of refraction. Second, we correct an abuse of notation in our main work in which the quantization dimensions of the cavity modes of the electromagnetic field are conflated with the dimensions of the nonlinear medium. While this does not meaningfully affect the final formulas we obtain for the generation rates in the paper (adding a dimensionless correction factor of order unity), we use the gaussian-mode SPDC derivation here to show how the factors of the quantization dimensions disappear when converting from a discrete-momentum basis of rectangular cavity modes to a continuous frequency basis of gaussian spatial modes. In doing this, we find that applying this correction factor to our previous theoretical predictions for the photon pair generation rates brings them closer to the obtained experimental values.

Title: How to compute the volume in low dimension?
Authors: Arjan Cornelissen, Simon Apers, Sander Gribling
Abstract: Estimating the volume of a convex body is a canonical problem in theoretical computer science. Its study has led to major advances in randomized algorithms, Markov chain theory, and computational geometry. In particular, determining the query complexity of volume estimation to a membership oracle has been a longstanding open question. Most of the previous work focuses on the high-dimensional limit. In this work, we tightly characterize the deterministic, randomized and quantum query complexity of this problem in the high-precision limit, i.e., when the dimension is constant.

Title: Towards Heisenberg limit without critical slowing down via quantum reinforcement learning
Authors: Hang Xu, Tailong Xiao, Jingzheng Huang, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: Critical ground states of quantum many-body systems have emerged as vital resources for quantum-enhanced sensing. Traditional methods to prepare these states often rely on adiabatic evolution, which may diminish the quantum sensing advantage. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL)-enhanced critical sensing protocol for quantum many-body systems with exotic phase diagrams. Starting from product states and utilizing QRL-discovered gate sequences, we explore sensing accuracy in the presence of unknown external magnetic fields, covering both local and global regimes. Our results demonstrate that QRL-learned sequences reach the finite quantum speed limit and generalize effectively across systems of arbitrary size, ensuring accuracy regardless of preparation time. This method can robustly achieve Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg limits, even in noisy environments with practical Pauli measurements. Our study highlights the efficacy of QRL in enabling precise quantum state preparation, thereby advancing scalable, high-accuracy quantum critical sensing.

Title: Linear Programming Bounds on $k$-Uniform States
Authors: Yu Ning, Fei Shi, Tao Luo, Xiande Zhang
Abstract: The existence of $k$-uniform states has been a widely studied problem due to their applications in several quantum information tasks and their close relation to combinatorial objects like Latin squares and orthogonal arrays. With the machinery of quantum enumerators and linear programming, we establish several improved non-existence results and bounds on $k$-uniform states. 1. First, for any fixed $l\geq 1$ and $q\geq 2$, we show that there exists a constant $c$ such that $(\left\lfloor{n/2}\right\rfloor-l)$-uniform states in $(\mathbb{C}^q)^{\otimes n}$ do not exist when $n\geq cq^2+o(q^2)$. The constant $c$ equals $4$ when $l=1$ and $6$ when $l=2$, which generalizes Scott's bound (2004) for $l=0$. 2. Second, when $n$ is sufficiently large, we show that there exists a constant $\theta<1/2$ for each $q \le 9$, such that $k$-uniform states in $(\mathbb{C}^q)^{\otimes n}$ exist only when $k\leq \theta n$. In particular, this provides the first bound (to the best of our knowledge) of $k$ for $4\leq q\leq 9$ and confirms a conjecture posed by Shi et al. (2023) when $q=5$ in a stronger form. 3. Finally, we improve the shadow bounds given by Shi et al. (2023) by a constant for $q = 3,4,5$ and small $n$. When $q=4$, our results can update some bounds listed in the code tables maintained by Grassl (2007--2024).

Title: Variety of Superradiant Phase Transition in Bose-Fermi System with Tight-Binding Model in the weak-coupling regime
Authors: Xing Su, Jian-Jian Cheng, Lin Zhang
Abstract: We present a full exploration of the dynamic diversity inherent in superradiant phase transitions within a one-dimensional tight-binding electronic chain that is intricately coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. By employing a quantized electromagnetic vector potential via the Peierls substitution, this gauge-coupled Bose-Fermi system facilitates momentum-dependent superradiant transitions. These transitions are characterized by the displacement of the cavity mode and the redistribution of electronic momentum, thereby circumventing the second-order spurious phase transitions typically observed in Dicke-like models. Distinct from multimode cavity QED systems with atomic gases, the single-mode optical configuration unveils a range of nonlinear phenomena, including multistability and varied spontaneous symmetry breaking. This configuration enables the precise manipulation of superradiant phases in weak coupling regimes, devoid of the quantum fluctuation divergence. Our findings advance the understanding of tunable quantum devices and highlight potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.

Title: Mantra: Rewriting Quantum Programs to Minimize Trap-Movements for Zoned Rydberg Atom Arrays
Authors: Enhyeok Jang, Youngmin Kim, Hyungseok Kim, Seungwoo Choi, Yipeng Huang, Won Woo Ro
Abstract: A zoned neutral atom architecture achieves exceptional fidelity by segregating the execution spaces of 1- and 2-qubit gates, being a promising candidate for high-accuracy quantum systems. Unfortunately, naively applying programs designed for static qubit topologies to zoned architectures may result in most execution time being consumed by inter-zone travels of atoms. To address this, we introduce Mantra (Minimizing trAp movemeNts for aTom aRray Architectures), which rewrites quantum programs to reduce the interleaving of single- and two-qubit gates. Mantra incorporates three strategies: (i) a fountain-shaped controlled-Z (CZ) chain, (ii) ZZ-interaction protocol without a 1-qubit gate, and (iii) preemptive gate scheduling. Mantra reduces inter-zone movements by 68%, physical gate counts by 35%, and improves circuit fidelities by 17% compared to the standard executions.

Title: CQ CNN: A Hybrid Classical Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Diffusion Generated and U Net Segmented 3D MRI
Authors: Mominul Islam, Mohammad Junayed Hasan, M.R.C. Mahdy
Abstract: The detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) from clinical MRI data is an active area of research in medical imaging. Recent advances in quantum computing, particularly the integration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with classical machine learning architectures, offer new opportunities to develop models that may outperform traditional methods. However, quantum machine learning (QML) remains in its early stages and requires further experimental analysis to better understand its behavior and limitations. In this paper, we propose an end to end hybrid classical quantum convolutional neural network (CQ CNN) for AD detection using clinically formatted 3D MRI data. Our approach involves developing a framework to make 3D MRI data usable for machine learning, designing and training a brain tissue segmentation model (Skull Net), and training a diffusion model to generate synthetic images for the minority class. Our converged models exhibit potential quantum advantages, achieving higher accuracy in fewer epochs than classical models. The proposed beta8 3 qubit model achieves an accuracy of 97.50%, surpassing state of the art (SOTA) models while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. In particular, the architecture employs only 13K parameters (0.48 MB), reducing the parameter count by more than 99.99% compared to current SOTA models. Furthermore, the diffusion-generated data used to train our quantum models, in conjunction with real samples, preserve clinical structural standards, representing a notable first in the field of QML. We conclude that CQCNN architecture like models, with further improvements in gradient optimization techniques, could become a viable option and even a potential alternative to classical models for AD detection, especially in data limited and resource constrained clinical settings.

Title: Alternative Framework to Quantize Fermionic Fields
Authors: Jianhao M. Yang
Abstract: In quantum field theory, the quantization of classical fields is traditionally achieved through canonical quantization or the Feynman path integral formalism. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach based on the extended stationary action principle. This framework has been successfully applied to recover non-relativistic quantum mechanics and quantize scalar fields. Here, we extend it to fermionic fields by addressing the complexities associated with Grassmann-valued field variables. By recursively applying the extended stationary action principle, we derive a generalized Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields. The resulting Hamiltonian satisfies the symmetry constraints of special relativity by generating the PoincarÃ© algebra. To highlight the distinctiveness of this quantization method, we apply it to the weak interaction theory of fermionic fields, which is non-renormalizable under standard canonical quantization. Our approach leads to a non-linear SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the wave functional, offering new insights into the quantization of non-renormalizable theories.

Title: Long distance local local oscillator continuous variable quantum key distribution with digital signal processing
Authors: Dengke Qi, Xiangyu Wang, Jiayu Ma, Zhenghua Li, Ziyang Chen, Yueming Lu, Song Yu
Abstract: Quantum key distribution relying on the principles of quantum mechanics enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key, thereby ensuring the security of data transmission. Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is widely applied because it can be well combined with standard telecommunication technology. Compared to CV-QKD with a transmitting local oscillator, the proposal of CV-QKD with a local local oscillator overcomes the limitation that local oscillator will attenuate as transmission distance increases, providing new possibilities in long-distance transmission. However, challenges still persist in practical long-distance transmission, including data sampling and recovery under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. In order to better recover data and reduce the additional excess noise, we propose the least squares fitting algorithm to get more accurate sampling data and complete more accurate phase this http URL, we demonstrate the long-distance local local oscillator CV-QKD experiment which have considered the effect of finite-size block over 120 km of standard optical fiber with high efficient real-time post-processing. The results not only verify the good performance of the system over long distance, but also paves the way for large-scale quantum secure communications in the future.

Title: Realizing Quantum Adversarial Defense on a Trapped-ion Quantum Processor
Authors: Alex Jin, Tarun Dutta, Anh Tu Ngo, Anupam Chattopadhyay, Manas Mukherjee
Abstract: Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning, typically performed using classical models. Quantum machine learning (QML), however, offers distinct advantages, such as enhanced representational power through high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and energy-efficient reversible gate operations. Despite these theoretical benefits, the robustness of QML classifiers against adversarial attacks and inherent quantum noise remains largely under-explored. In this work, we implement a data re-uploading-based quantum classifier on an ion-trap quantum processor using a single qubit to assess its resilience under realistic conditions. We introduce a novel convolutional quantum classifier architecture leveraging data re-uploading and demonstrate its superior robustness on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, we quantify the effects of polarization noise in a realistic setting, where both bit and phase noises are present, further validating the classifier's robustness. Our findings provide insights into the practical security and reliability of quantum classifiers, bridging the gap between theoretical potential and real-world deployment.

Title: Quantum measurement fitting
Authors: Pieter Thijs Eendebak
Abstract: Quantum measurements are not deterministic. For this reason quantum measurements are repeated for a number of shots on identically prepared systems. The uncertainty in each measurement depends on the number of shots and the expected outcome of the measurement. This information can be used to improve the fitting of models to quantum measurements. In this paper we analyse ordinary-least squares, weighted least squares and maximum-likelihood estimation. We show that using the information on the quantum measurement uncertainty can lead to improved estimation of system parameters. We also introduce the concept of model violation and demonstrate it can be a valuable tool to analyze model assumptions and performance of quantum systems.

Title: Quantum memristor with vacuum--one-photon qubits
Authors: Simone Di Micco, Beatrice Polacchi, Taira Giordani, Fabio Sciarrino
Abstract: Quantum memristors represent a promising interface between quantum and neuromorphic computing, combining the nonlinear, memory-dependent behavior of classical memristors with the properties of quantum states. An optical quantum memristor can be realized with a vacuum--one-photon qubit entering a tunable beam splitter whose reflectivity is adapted according to the mean number of photons in the device. In this work, we report on the experimental implementation of a bulk quantum-optical memristor, working with single-rail coherent superposition states in the Fock basis, generated via a resonantly excited quantum dot single-photon source. We demonstrate that the coherence of the input state is preserved by the quantum memristor. Moreover, our modular platform allows investigating the nonlinear behavior arising from a cascade of two quantum memristors, a building block for larger networks of such devices towards the realization of complex neuromorphic quantum architectures.

Title: Classical and mixed classical-quantum systems from van Hove's unitary representation of contact transformations
Authors: Marcel Reginatto, AndrÃ©s BermÃºdez, Sebastian Ulbricht
Abstract: Descriptions of classical mechanics in Hilbert space go back to the work of Koopman and von Neumann in the 1930s. Decades later, van Hove derived a unitary representation of the group of contact transformations which recently has been used to develop a novel formulation of classical mechanics in Hilbert space. This formulation differs from the Koopman-von Neumann theory in many ways. Classical observables are represented by van Hove operators, which satisfy a commutation algebra isomorphic to the Poisson algebra of functions in phase space. Moreover, these operators are both observables and generators of transformations, which makes it unnecessary to introduce unobservable auxiliary operators as in the Koopman-von Neumann theory. In addition, for consistency with classical mechanics, a constraint must be imposed that fixes the phase of the wavefunction. The approach can be extended to hybrid mixed classical-quantum systems in Hilbert space. The formalism is applied to the measurement of a quantum two-level system (qubit) by a classical apparatus.

Title: An rf-SQUID-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier with -84 dBm input saturation power across more than one octave bandwidth
Authors: Victor Gaydamachenko, Christoph Kissling, Lukas GrÃ¼nhaupt
Abstract: Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have become an essential tool for the readout of quantum circuits and the search for dark matter. We report on the implementation of an rf-SQUID-based Josephson TWPA with an average saturation power of -84 dBm, while providing an average power gain of 20 dB from 3.5 to 8.5 GHz. This wide bandwidth is enabled by reducing the curvature of the dispersion in the signal band while suppressing detrimental mixing processes. With 2393 rf-SQUIDs our device has a comparable number of nonlinear elements, but achieves ten times higher saturation power than previous works, showing that using rf-SQUIDs results in a more favorable trade-off between device length and saturation power. Harnessing wideband characterization techniques we determine the TWPA's excess noise above the quantum limit to be 0.8 to 1.5 photons. In addition, we validate signal-to-noise ratio improvement as a practical measure for tuning the TWPA to minimize the total system noise, and demonstrate that its optimum does not coincide with the highest gain.

Title: Quantum Computer Does Not Need Coherent Quantum Access for Advantage
Authors: Nhat A. Nghiem
Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage has been a pressing challenge in the field. A majority of claimed quantum speedups rely on a subroutine in which classical information can be accessed in a coherent quantum manner, which imposes a crucial constraint on the practicability of these quantum algorithms. It has even been shown that without such an access, the quantum computer cannot be (exponentially) stronger than the classical counterpart for many problems. Thus, whether or not a quantum computer can be useful for practical applications has been central to investigation. In this work, we develop a quantum gradient descent algorithm for polynomial optimization, which is a fundamental technique that enjoys a wide range of applications. The algorithm's running time is logarithmical relative to the number of variables and consumes logarithmic numbers of qubits. Our method can work with many classes of polynomials and, most importantly, it removes the requirement for such a coherent quantum access. Thus, it implies great potential for near-term realization and particularly surpasses the belief that quantum speedup is only possible with strong input assumptions. As immediate applications, we show how to translate the capability of performing gradient descent into solving a linear system, performing least-square fitting, building a support vector machine, performing supervised cluster assignment, training neural network, and solving for ground-state/excited-state energy, performing principle component analysis, with end-to-end applications of quantum algorithms. Thus, our result adds another prominent example to some existing literature, provably demonstrating the quantum advantage toward highly practical problems, suggesting a new and promising prospect for the real-world application of a quantum computer.

Title: Coherent backscattering and coherent forward scattering effects in variations of the random quantum kicked rotor
Authors: Hugo Thomas, Julien HÃ©braud, Bertrand Georgeot, Gabriel LemariÃ©, Christian Miniatura, Olivier Giraud
Abstract: We investigate coherent multiple scattering effects in the random quantum kicked rotor model. By changing the starting time of the Floquet period, two new classes of models can be introduced that exhibit similar interference structures. For one of the two classes, these structures appear on top of a non-trivial background, which we describe in detail. Its origin is identified and an approximate analytical formula is proposed. The asymptotic contrast profile, as well as the height of the coherent backscattering and the coherent forward scattering peaks, are also analyzed. Our findings are relevant to provide an interpretation of cold atom experiments aiming at observing such interference effects with matter waves.

Title: Quantum state exclusion for group-generated ensembles of pure states
Authors: Arnau Diebra, Santiago Llorens, Emili Bagan, Gael SentÃ­s, Ramon MuÃ±oz-Tapia
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is the task of determining which states from a given set a system was not prepared in. We provide a complete solution to optimal quantum state exclusion for arbitrary sets of pure states generated by finite groups, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for perfect (zero-error conclusive) exclusion. When perfect exclusion is impossible, we introduce two natural extensions: minimum-error and unambiguous exclusion. For both, we derive the optimal protocols and present analytical expressions for the corresponding failure probabilities and measurements, offering a new perspective on how quantum states encode information.

Title: Unclonable Encryption with Continuous Variables
Authors: Arpan Akash Ray, Boris Å koriÄ‡
Abstract: We propose the first continuous-variable (CV) unclonable encryption scheme, extending the paradigm of quantum encryption of classical messages (QECM) to CV systems. In our construction, a classical message is first encrypted classically and then encoded using an error-correcting code. Each bit of the codeword is mapped to a CV mode by creating a coherent state which is squeezed in the $q$ or $p$ quadrature direction, with a small displacement that encodes the bit. The squeezing directions are part of the encryption key. We prove unclonability in the framework introduced by Broadbent and Lord, via a reduction of the cloning game to a CV monogamy-of-entanglement game.

Title: Quantum probability for statisticians; some new ideas
Authors: Inge S. Helland
Abstract: It is argued from several points of view that quantum probabilities might play a role in statistical settings. New approaches toward quantum foundations have postulates that appear to be equally valid in macroscopic settings. One such approach is described here in detail, while one other is briefly sketched. In particular, arguments behind the Born rule, which gives the basis for quantum probabilities, are given. A list of ideas for possible statistical applications of quantum probabilities is provided and discussed. A particular area is machine learning, where there exists substantial literature on links to quantum probability. Here, an idea about model reduction is sketched and is motivated from a quantum probability model. Quantum models can play a role in model reduction, where the partial least squares regression model is a special case. It is shown that for certain experiments, a Bayesian prior given by a quantum probability can be motivated. Quantum decision theory is an emerging discipline that can be motivated by this author's theory of quantum foundations.

Title: Quantum Charging Advantage from Multipartite Entanglement
Authors: Hai-Long Shi, Li Gan, Kun Zhang, Xiao-Hui Wang, Wen-Li Yang
Abstract: Collective quantum batteries (QBs) demonstrate remarkable acceleration in charging dynamics compared to their individual counterparts, underscoring the pivotal contribution of quantum correlations to advanced energy storage paradigms. A fundamental challenge lies in identifying QBs that exhibit genuine quantum advantages derived from multipartite entanglement. In this Letter, based on numerical and analytical evidence, we conjecture a universal bound on the charging rate for fully charging schemes, which is determined by the maximum entanglement depth arising during the charging dynamics. Here, the charging rate quantifies the intrinsic evolution speed of the charging process, appropriately normalized against the quantum speed limit (QSL). We analytically validate this conjecture in three distinct scenarios: (i) fully charging schemes saturating the QSL, (ii) fully parallel charging schemes, and (iii) the SU(2) fully charging schemes. Moreover, we establish a novel lower bound for entanglement depth detection, facilitating numerical verification of our proposed conjecture. By defining the genuine quantum charging advantage as the ratio between entanglement-enhanced charging rates and the maximum achievable non-entangling charging rate, we demonstrate that the charging rate constitutes a robust indicator of genuine quantum advantages.

Title: Enhancing the charging performance of an atomic quantum battery
Authors: Ming-Liang Hu, Ting Gao, Heng Fan
Abstract: We study a quantum battery (QB) model composed of two atoms, where the charger and battery elements are coupled to a multimode vacuum field that serves as a mediator for energy transfer. Different figures of merit such as ergotropy, charging time, and charging efficiency are analyzed, putting emphasis on the role of various control parameters on the charging performance. It is found that there is a range of angle between the transition dipole moments and interatomic axis in which the QB can be charged. The optimal charging performance is achieved if the atomic dipole moments are perpendicular or parallel to the interatomic axis. The charging performance also improves with the decrease of the interatomic distance. Besides, the charged ergotropy can be enhanced by increasing the initial ergotropy of the charger and it is beneficial to charge the QB starting from a passive state.

Title: Generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs from two interacting quantum emitters
Authors: AdriÃ¡n Juan-Delgado, Geza Giedke, Javier Aizpurua, Ruben Esteban
Abstract: Entangled photon pairs are key elements in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. State-of-the-art sources of entangled photons are mainly based on parametric-down conversion from nonlinear crystals, which is probabilistic in nature, and on cascade emission from biexciton quantum dots, which finds difficulties in generating entangled photons in the visible regime. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that polarization-entangled photon pairs can be emitted from two interacting quantum emitters with two-level-system behaviour and perpendicular transition dipole moments. These emitters can represent a large variety of systems (e.g., organic molecules, quantum dots and diamond-color centers) offering a large technological versatility, for example in the spectral regime of the emission. We show that a highly entangled photon pair can be post-selected from this system by including optical filters. Additionally, we verify that the photon entanglement is not significantly affected by small changes in the detection directions and in the orientation between the dipole moments.

Title: A Note on the Complexity of the Spectral Gap Problem
Authors: Justin Yirka
Abstract: The problem of estimating the spectral gap of a local Hamiltonian is known to be contained in the class $P^{QMA[log]}$: polynomial time with access to a logarithmic number of QMA queries. The problem was shown to be hard for $P^{UQMA[log]}$, a weaker class, under Turing reductions by Gharibian and Yirka [arXiv:1606.05626]. I give a brief proof that the Spectral Gap problem is QMA-hard under a many-one (Karp) reduction. Consequently, the problem is $P^{QMA[log]}$-complete under truth-table reductions. It remains open to characterize the complexity of the Spectral Gap problem under many-one reductions. I conjecture that the problem belongs to a strict subclass of $P^{QMA[log]}$.

Title: Comparative study of divacancies in 3C-, 4H- and 6H-SiC
Authors: Danial Shafizade, Joel Davidsson, Takeshi Ohshima, Nguyen Tien Son, Ivan G. Ivanov
Abstract: The divacancy comprising two neighboring vacant sites in the SiC lattice is a promising defect for applications in quantum technology. So far, most work is concerned with the divacancy in 4H-SiC, whereas the divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC have received much less attention. Here, we outline arguments showing that the neutral charge state of the divacancies in the latter two polytypes is intrinsically stable, in contrast to that in 4H-SiC where the photoluminescence quenches in most materials for certain excitation energies (below approximately 1.3 eV). Divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC are anticipated to remain stable even with resonant excitation. We provide new ab initio calculation results for the charge transfer levels of divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC. Using the temperature dependence of the divacancy emission in 3C-SiC, we estimate the energy position of the (+|0) charge transfer level of the divacancy within the bandgap of this polytype and compare with theoretical results.

Title: Efficient Quantum Chemistry Calculations on Noisy Quantum Hardware
Authors: Nora Bauer, KÃ¼bra Yeter-Aydeniz, George Siopsis
Abstract: We present a hardware-efficient optimization scheme for quantum chemistry calculations, utilizing the Sampled Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) method. Our algorithm, optimized SQD (SQDOpt), combines the classical Davidson method technique with added multi-basis measurements to optimize a quantum Ansatz on hardware using a fixed number of measurements per optimization step. This addresses the key challenge associated with other quantum chemistry optimization protocols, namely Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which must measure in hundreds to thousands of bases to estimate energy on hardware, even for molecules with less than 20 qubits. Numerical results for various molecules, including hydrogen chains, water, and methane, demonstrate the efficacy of our method compared to classical and quantum variational approaches, and we confirm the performance on the IBM-Cleveland quantum hardware, where we find instances where SQDOpt either matches or exceeds the solution quality of noiseless VQE. A runtime scaling indicates that SQDOpt on quantum hardware is competitive with classical state-of-the-art methods, with a crossover point of 1.5 seconds/iteration for the SQDOpt on quantum hardware and classically simulated VQE with the 20-qubit H$_{12}$ molecule. Our findings suggest that the proposed SQDOpt framework offers a scalable and robust pathway for quantum chemistry simulations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

Title: Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory
Authors: Vaibhav Sharma, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.

Title: Atomistic tight-binding Hartree-Fock calculations of multielectron configurations in P-doped silicon devices: wavefunction reshaping
Authors: Maicol A. Ochoa, Keyi Liu, Piotr RÃ³Å¼aÅ„ski, MichaÅ‚ ZieliÅ„ski, Garnett W. Bryant
Abstract: Donor-based quantum devices in silicon are attractive platforms for universal quantum computing and analog quantum simulations. The nearly-atomic precision in dopant placement promises great control over the quantum properties of these devices. We present atomistic calculations and a detailed analysis of many-electron states in a single phosphorus atom and selected phosphorus dimers in silicon. Our self-consistent method involves atomistic calculations of the electron energies utilizing representative tight-binding Hamiltonians, computations of Coulomb and exchange integrals without any reference to an atomic orbital set, and solutions to the associated Hartree-Fock equations. First, we assess the quality of our tight-binding Hartree-Fock protocol against Configuration-Interaction calculations for two electrons in a single phosphorus atom, finding that our formalism provides an accurate estimation of the electron-electron repulsion energy requiring smaller computational boxes and single-electron wavefunctions. Then, we compute charging and binding energies in phosphorus dimers observing their variation as a function of impurity-impurity separation. Our calculations predict an antiferromagnetic ground state for the two-electron system and a weakly bound three-electron state in the range of separations considered. We rationalize these results in terms of the single-electron energies, charging energies, and the wavefunction reshaping.

Title: Measuring Quantum Discord at the LHC
Authors: Tao Han, Matthew Low, Navin McGinnis, Shufang Su
Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in exploring quantities associated with quantum information at colliders. We perform a detailed analysis describing how to measure the quantum discord in the top anti-top quantum state at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). While for pure states, quantum discord, entanglement, and Bell nonlocality all probe the same correlations, for mixed states they probe different aspects of quantum correlations. The quantum discord, in particular, is interesting because it aims to encapsulate all correlations between systems that cannot have a classical origin. We employ two complementary approaches for the study of the top anti-top system, namely the decay method and the kinematic method. We highlight subtleties associated with measuring discord for reconstructed quantum states at colliders. Usually quantum discord is difficult to compute due to an extremization that must be performed. We show, however, that for the $t\bar{t}$ system this extremization can be performed analytically and we provide closed-form formulas for the quantum discord. We demonstrate that at the high luminosity LHC, discord is projected to be measurable with a precision of approximately 5% using the decay method and sub-percent levels using the kinematic method. Even with current LHC datasets, discord can be measured with 1-2% precision with the kinematic method. By systematically investigating quantum discord for the first time through a detailed collider analysis, this work expands the toolkit for quantum information studies in particle physics and lays the groundwork for deeper insights into the quantum properties in high-energy collisions.

Title: Enforced Gaplessness from States with Exponentially Decaying Correlations
Authors: Rahul Sahay, Curt von Keyserlingk, Ruben Verresen, Carolyn Zhang
Abstract: It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta > \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.

Title: Superconducting qubit based on a single molecule: the carbon nanotube gatemon
Authors: H. Riechert, S. Annabi, A. Peugeot, H. Duprez, M. Hantute, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, E. Arrighi, J. Griesmar, J.-D. Pillet, L. Bretheau
Abstract: Gate-tunable transmon qubits are based on quantum conductors used as weak links within hybrid Josephson junctions. These gatemons have been implemented in just a handful of systems, all relying on extended conductors, namely epitaxial semiconductors or exfoliated graphene. Here we present the coherent control of a gatemon based on a single molecule, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube, which is integrated into a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. The measured qubit spectrum can be tuned with a gate voltage and reflects the quantum dot behaviour of the nanotube. Our ultraclean integration, using a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, results in record coherence times of 200ns for such a qubit. Furthermore, we investigate its decoherence mechanisms, thus revealing a strong gate dependence and identifying charge noise as a limiting factor. On top of positioning carbon nanotubes as contenders for future quantum technologies, our work paves the way for studying microscopic fermionic processes in low-dimensional quantum conductors.

Title: Time operator from parametrization invariance and implications for cosmology
Authors: N. Dimakis
Abstract: Motivated by the parametrization invariance of cosmological Lagrangians and their equivalence to systems describing the motion of particles in curved backgrounds, we identify the phase space analogue of the notion of proper time. We define the corresponding quantum operator, which results in being canonically conjugate to that of the vanishing Hamiltonian. In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate. Finally, we derive the generic expression for the introduced time variable in the cosmological setting.

Title: Chemically resolved nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy by longitudinal magnetization detection with a diamond magnetometer
Authors: Janis Smits, Yaser Silani, Zaili Peng, Bryan A. Richards, Andrew F. McDowell, Joshua T. Damron, Maxwell D. Aiello, Maziar Saleh Ziabari, Andrey Jarmola, Victor M. Acosta
Abstract: Non-inductive magnetometers based on solid-state spins offer a promising solution for small-volume nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection. A remaining challenge is to operate at a sufficiently high magnetic field to resolve chemical shifts at the part-per-billion level. Here, we demonstrate a Ramsey-M_z protocol that uses Ramsey interferometry to convert an analyte's transverse spin precession into a longitudinal magnetization (M_z), which is subsequently modulated and detected with a diamond magnetometer. We record NMR spectra at B0=0.32 T with a fractional spectral resolution of ~350 ppb, limited by the stability of the electromagnet bias field. We perform NMR spectroscopy on a ~1 nL detection volume of ethanol and resolve the chemical shift structure with negligible distortion. Through simulation, we show that the protocol can be extended to fields up to B0=3 T, with minimal spectral distortion, using composite nuclear-spin inversion pulses. For sub-nanoliter analyte volumes, we estimate a resolution of ~1 ppb and concentration sensitivity of ~40 mM s^{1/2} is feasible with improvements to the sensor design. Our results establish diamond magnetometers as high-resolution NMR detectors in the moderate magnetic field regime, with potential applications in metabolomics and pharmaceutical research.

Title: Charges in light cones and quenched infrared radiation
Authors: Detlev Buchholz, Fabio Ciolli, Giuseppe Ruzzi, Ezio Vasselli
Abstract: The creation of electrically charged states and the resulting electromagnetic fields are considered in space-time regions in which such experiments can actually be carried out, namely in future-directed light cones. Under the simplifying assumption of external charges, charged states are formed from neutral pairs of opposite charges, with one charge being shifted to light-like infinity. It thereby escapes observation. Despite the fact that this charge moves asymptotically at the speed of light, the resulting electromagnetic field has a well-defined energy operator that is bounded from below. Moreover, due to the spatiotemporal restrictions, the transverse electromagnetic field (the radiation) has no infrared singularities in the light cone. They are quenched and the observed radiation can be described by states in the Fock space of photons. The longitudinal field between the charges (giving rise to Gauss's law) disappears for inertial observers in an instant. This is consistent with the fact that there is no evidence for the existence of longitudinal photons. The results show that the restrictions of operations and observations to light cones, which are dictated by the arrow of time, amount to a Lorentz-invariant infrared cutoff.

Title: Giant moment increase by ultrafast laser light
Authors: Sangeeta Sharma, Deepika Gill, Jyoti Krishna, Eddie Harris-Lee, John Kay Dewhurst, Sam Shallcross
Abstract: It is now well established that a few femtosecond laser pulse will induce an ultrafast loss of moment in a magnetic material. Here we show that the opposite effect can also occur: an ultrafast increase in moment. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory we find that laser light tuned to the majority spin conduction band in the 2d magnets CrI$_3$ and CrSBr generates an ultrafast giant moment increase, of up to 33\% in the case of CrI$_3$ (2~$\mu_B$). Underpinning this is spin-orbit induced valence band spin texture that, in combination with a strong field light pulse, facilitates an optical spin flip transition involving both intra- and inter-band excitation. Our findings, that establish a general mechanism by which ultrafast light pulses may enhance as well as decrease the magnetic moment, point towards rich possibilities for light control over magnetic matter at femtosecond times.

Title: Measurement-Induced Crossover of Quantum Jump Statistics in Postselection-Free Many-Body Dynamics
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We reveal a nontrivial crossover of subsystem fluctuations of quantum jumps in continuously monitored many-body systems, which have a trivial maximally mixed state as a steady-state density matrix. While the fluctuations exhibit the standard volume law $\propto L$ following Poissonian statistics for sufficiently weak measurement strength, anomalous yet universal scaling law $\propto L^\alpha \:(\alpha\sim 2.7)$ indicating super-Poissonian statistics appears for strong measurement strength. This drastically affects the precision of estimating the rate of quantum jumps: for strong (weak) measurement, the estimation uncertainty is enhanced (suppressed) as the system size increases. We demonstrate that the anomalous scaling of the subsystem fluctuation originates from an integrated many-body autocorrelation function and that the transient dynamics contributes to the scaling law rather than the Liouvillian gap. The measurement-induced crossover is accessed only from the postselection-free information obtained from the time and the position of quantum jumps and can be tested in ultracold atom experiments.

Title: A compact unshielded optically-pumped magnetic gradiometer
Authors: Hangfei Ye, Chenlu Xu, Min Hu, Haifeng Dong
Abstract: Optically-pumped magnetic gradiometers (OPGs) play a crucial role in applications such as magnetic anomaly detection and bio-magnetic measurements. This study classifies current OPGs into four types based on their differential modes: voltage, frequency, optical rotation, and magnetic field differential modes. We introduce the concept of inherent Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) and analyze the differences between the inherent CMRR and the measured CMRR, as well as the upper limit of inherent CMRR. We point out that although magnetic field differential method has the potential to increase inherent CMRR by a factor of 1+AF, the difference between the feedback gains is often neglected, which may set the limit of inherent CMRR. We designed and fabricated a compact, unshielded OPG with a specially designed scheme to minimize the distance between the sensing heads and the magnetic source. Measurement results demonstrate a measured CMRR of 1200@1Hz and a sensitivity of approximately 5 pT/cm/\sqrt{Hz} from 1 Hz to 100 Hz.

Title: Nonadiabatic quantum kinetic equations and Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism for Schwinger pair production in time-varying electric fields with multiple components
Authors: Z. L. Li, R. Z. Jiang, Y. J. Li
Abstract: The nonadiabatic quantum kinetic equations and Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism for Schwinger pair production in a spatially uniform and time-varying electric field with multiple components are derived and proven to be equivalent. The relation between nonadiabatic and adiabatic quantum kinetic equations is also established. By analyzing the time evolution of the distribution functions of particles created in a circularly polarized Gaussian pulse field with a subcycle structure, it is found that the nonadiabatic and adiabatic distribution functions are the same after the field, with a sufficient number of oscillation cycles, fades away. However, during the presence of the field, the two distribution functions typically differ. Nonetheless, the time evolution characteristics of the nonadiabatic and adiabatic momentum distributions are similar. For instance, the number of spirals is one less than the number of photons absorbed in both cases. Furthermore, for a rapidly oscillating electric field, the nonadiabatic quantum kinetic approaches may provide a more meaningful description of pair production at intermediate times. These findings deepen our understanding of the nonadiabatic quantum kinetic approaches and their application in pair production.

Title: Identifying two-dimensional topological phase transition by entanglement spectrum : A fermion Monte Carlo study
Authors: Weilun Jiang, Xiaofan Luo, Bin-Bin Mao, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Among many types of quantum entanglement properties, the entanglement spectrum provides more abundant information than other observables. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group method could handle the system in one-dimension properly, while in higher dimension, it exceeds the capacity of the algorithms. To expand the ability of existing numerical methods, we takes a different approach via quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. By exploiting particle number and spin symmetry, we realize an efficient algorithms to solve the entanglement spectrum in the interacting fermionic system. Taking two-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger as example, we verify the existence of topological phase transition under different types of many-body interactions. The calculated particle number distribution and wave-function of entanglement Hamiltonian indicate that the two belong distinct types of topological phase transitions.

Title: Melting of devil's staircases in the long-range Dicke-Ising model
Authors: Jan Alexander Koziol, Anja Langheld, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.

Title: Critical Dynamics in Short-Range Quadratic Hamiltonians
Authors: Miroslav Hopjan, Lev Vidmar
Abstract: We investigate critical transport and the dynamical exponent through the spreading of an initially localized particle in quadratic Hamiltonians with short-range hopping in lattice dimension $d_l$. We consider critical dynamics that emerges when the Thouless time, i.e., the saturation time of the mean-squared displacement, approaches the typical Heisenberg time. We establish a relation, $z=d_l/d_s$, linking the critical dynamical exponent $z$ to $d_l$ and to the spectral fractal dimension $d_s$. This result has notable implications: it says that superdiffusive transport in $d_l\geq 2$ and diffusive transport in $d_l\geq 3$ cannot be critical in the sense defined above. Our findings clarify previous results on disordered and quasiperiodic models and, through Fibonacci potential models in two and three dimensions, provide non-trivial examples of critical dynamics in systems with $d_l\neq1$ and $d_s\neq1$.

Title: Thermodynamic Computing via Autonomous Quantum Thermal Machines
Authors: Patryk Lipka-Bartosik, MartÃ­ Perarnau-Llobet, Nicolas Brunner
Abstract: We develop a physics-based model for classical computation based on autonomous quantum thermal machines. These machines consist of few interacting quantum bits (qubits) connected to several environments at different temperatures. Heat flows through the machine are here exploited for computing. The process starts by setting the temperatures of the environments according to the logical input. The machine evolves, eventually reaching a non-equilibrium steady state, from which the output of the computation can be determined via the temperature of an auxilliary finite-size reservoir. Such a machine, which we term a ``thermodynamic neuron'', can implement any linearly-separable function, and we discuss explicitly the cases of NOT, 3-MAJORITY and NOR gates. In turn, we show that a network of thermodynamic neurons can perform any desired function. We discuss the close connection between our model and artificial neurons (perceptrons), and argue that our model provides an alternative physics-based analogue implementation of neural networks, and more generally a platform for thermodynamic computing.

Authors: Kamila Zaman, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Abdullah Hanif, Muhammad Shafique
Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) claims to improve the efficiency of solving complex problems, compared to classical computing. When QC is integrated with Machine Learning (ML), it creates a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) system. This paper aims to provide a thorough understanding of the foundational concepts of QC and its notable advantages over classical computing. Following this, we delve into the key aspects of QML in a detailed and comprehensive manner. In this survey, we investigate a variety of QML algorithms, discussing their applicability across different domains. We examine quantum datasets, highlighting their unique characteristics and advantages. The survey also covers the current state of hardware technologies, providing insights into the latest advancements and their implications for QML. Additionally, we review the software tools and simulators available for QML development, discussing their features and usability. Furthermore, we explore practical applications of QML, illustrating how it can be leveraged to solve real-world problems more efficiently than classical ML methods. This paper serves as a valuable resource for readers seeking to understand the current state-of-the-art techniques in the QML field, offering a solid foundation to embark on further exploration and development in this rapidly evolving area.

Title: Nuclear spin relaxation in solid state defect quantum bits via electron-phonon coupling in their optical excited state
Authors: GergÅ‘ Thiering, Adam Gali
Abstract: Optically accessible solid state defect spins serve as a primary platform for quantum information processing, where precise control of the electron spin and ancillary nuclear spins is essential for operation. Using the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond as an example, we employ a combined group theory and density functional theory study to demonstrate that spin-lattice relaxation of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin is significantly enhanced due to strong entanglement with orbital degrees of freedom in the $|^3E\rangle$ optical excited state of the defect. This mechanism is common to other solid-state defect nuclear spins with similar optical excited states. Additionally, we propose a straightforward and versatile \textit{ab initio} scheme for predicting orbital-dependent spin Hamiltonians for trigonal defects exhibiting orbital degeneracy.

Title: Tsirelson bounds for quantum correlations with indefinite causal order
Authors: Zixuan Liu, Giulio Chiribella
Abstract: Quantum theory is in principle compatible with processes that violate causal inequalities, an analogue of Bell inequalities that constrain the correlations observed by sets of parties operating in a definite causal order. Since the introduction of causal inequalities, determining their maximum quantum violation, analogue to Tsirelson's bound for Bell inequalities, has remained an open problem. Here we provide a general method for bounding the violation of arbitrary causal inequalities, establishing limits to the correlations achievable by arbitrary local experiments and by arbitrary quantum processes with indefinite causal order. We prove that the maximum violation is generally smaller than the algebraic maximum of the corresponding correlation, and determine Tsirelson-like bounds for a class of causal inequalities including some of the most paradigmatic examples. Our results motivate a search for physical principles characterizing the boundary of the set of quantum correlations with indefinite causal order.

Title: Exploring the Non-Markovian Dynamics in Depolarizing Maps
Authors: Ali Abu-Nada, Subhashish Banerjee, Vivek Balasaheb Sabale
Abstract: The non-Markovian depolarizing channel is explored from the perspective of understanding its non-Markovian behavior as well as the occurrence of singularities. The study brings together the various ways to identify and quantify non-Markovianity. This includes dynamical techniques such as quantum information backflow witness, Breuer-Laine-Piilo, Rivas-Huelga-Plenio and Hall- Cresser-Li-Andersson measures. In addition, geometrical visualization of non-Markovian effects is presented using the variation in the volume of accessible states during dynamical evolution. Further, a trajectory-based visualization of the dynamical map within the parameter space is presented. The trajectories traced during evolution demonstrate the loss of CP divisibility and the emergence of non-Markovianity under systematic variations of the system parameters. The effects of increasing system dimensions and qubit numbers on singularity and non-Markovianity are presented, with an extension of characterization techniques to higher-dimensional systems.

Title: Mutual Information Bounded by Fisher Information
Authors: Wojciech GÃ³recki, Xi Lu, Chiara Macchiavello, Lorenzo Maccone
Abstract: We derive a general upper bound to mutual information in terms of the Fisher information. The bound may be further used to derive a lower bound for the Bayesian quadratic cost. These two provide alternatives to other inequalities in the literature (e.g.~the van Trees inequality) that are useful also for cases where the latter ones give trivial bounds. We then generalize them to the quantum case, where they bound the Holevo information in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We illustrate the usefulness of our bounds with a case study in quantum phase estimation. Here, they allow us to adapt to mutual information (useful for global strategies where the prior plays an important role) the known and highly nontrivial bounds for the Fisher information in the presence of noise. The results are also useful in the context of quantum communication, both for continuous and discrete alphabets.

Title: Generating Quantum Reservoir State Representations with Random Matrices
Authors: Samuel Tovey, Tobias Fellner, Christian Holm, Michael Spannowsky
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computation measurements using random matrices. We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices could be used for real-world computational applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means of generating state representations. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail, along with an exploration of the diversity of measurements provided by the random matrices. In addition, we explore the role of reservoir parameters such as coupling strength and measurement dimension, providing insight into how these learning machines could be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices, and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.

Title: Frequency Shift Caused by Nonuniform Field and Boundary Relaxation in Magnetic Resonance and Comagnetometers
Authors: Xiangdong Zhang, Jinbo Hu, Da-Wu Xiao, Nan Zhao
Abstract: In magnetic resonance experiments, it is widely recognized that a nonuniform magnetic field can lead to an increase in the resonance line width, as well as a reduction in sensitivity and spectral resolution. However, a nonuniform magnetic field can also cause shifts in resonance frequency, which has received far less attention. In this work, we investigate the frequency shift caused by boundary relaxation and nonuniform magnetic field with arbitrary spatial distribution. We find that this frequency shift is spin-species dependent, implying a systematic error in NMR gyroscope and comagnetometers. The first order correction to this systematic error is proportional to the difference of boundary relaxation rate, and dominates for small cells. In contrast, the third and higher order corrections arise from the difference of gyromagnetic ratios of spin species, and dominates for large cells. This insight helps understanding the unexplained isotope shifts in recent NMR gyroscope and new physics searching experiments that utilize comagnetometers. Finally, we propose a tool for wall interaction research based on the frequency shift's dependency on boundary relaxation.

Title: Quantum Sensing from Gravity as Universal Dephasing Channel for Qubits
Authors: Alexander V. Balatsky, Pedram Roushan, Joris Schaltegger, Patrick J. Wong
Abstract: We investigate the interaction of a transmon qubit with a classical gravitational field. Exploiting the generic phenomena of the gravitational redshift and Aharonov-Bohm phase, we show that entangled quantum states dephase with a universal rate. The gravitational phase shift is expressed in terms of a quantum computing noise channel. We give a measurement protocol based on a modified phase estimation algorithm which is linear in the phase drift, which is optimal for measuring the small phase that is acquired from the gravitation channel. Additionally, we propose qubit-based platforms as quantum sensors for precision gravitometers and mechanical strain gauges as an example of this phenomenon's utility. We estimate a sensitivity for measuring the local gravitational acceleration to be $\delta g/g \sim 10^{-7}$. This paper demonstrates that classical gravitation has a non-trivial influence on quantum computing hardware, and provides an illustration of how quantum computing hardware may be utilized for purposes other than computation. While we focus on superconducting qubits, we point the universal nature of gravitational phase effects for all quantum platforms.

Title: Exploring the dynamical interplay between mass-energy equivalence, interactions and entanglement in an optical lattice clock
Authors: Anjun Chu, Victor J. MartÃ­nez-Lahuerta, Maya Miklos, Kyungtae Kim, Peter Zoller, Klemens Hammerer, Jun Ye, Ana Maria Rey
Abstract: We propose protocols that probe manifestations of the mass-energy equivalence in an optical lattice clock (OLC) interrogated with spin coherent and entangled quantum states. To tune and uniquely distinguish the mass-energy equivalence effects (gravitational redshift and second order Doppler shift) in such a setting, we devise a dressing protocol using an additional nuclear spin state. We then analyze the dynamical interplay between photon-mediated interactions and gravitational redshift and show that such interplay can lead to entanglement generation and frequency synchronization dynamics. In the regime where all atomic spins synchronize, we show the synchronization time depends on the initial entanglement of the state and can be used as a proxy of its metrological gain compared to a classical state. Our work opens new possibilities for exploring the effects of general relativity on quantum coherence and entanglement in OLC experiments.

Title: Quantum gates between distant atoms mediated by a Rydberg excitation antiferromagnet
Authors: Georgios Doultsinos, David Petrosyan
Abstract: We present a novel protocol for implementing quantum gates between distant atomic qubits connected by an array of neutral atoms that play the role of a quantum bus. The protocol is based on adiabatically transferring the atoms in the array to an antiferromagnetic-like state of Rydberg excitations using chirped laser pulses. Upon exciting and de-exciting the atoms in the array under the blockage of nearest neighbors, depending on the state of the two qubits, the system acquires a conditional geometric $\pi$-phase, while the dynamical phase cancels exactly, even when the atomic positions are disordered but nearly frozen in time, which requires sufficiently low temperatures. With experimentally relevant parameters, using smooth pulses minimizing the Rydberg-state decay and non-adiabatic errors, we obtain the gate times of $2-3\:\mu$s and gate fidelities of 0.99-0.98 for a pair of atoms separated by $L=20-30\:\mu$m and connected by a quantum bus of several ($3-6$) atoms. Optimizing the pulses, we can obtain faster gates exhibiting even better fidelities than those with smooth adiabatic pulses.

Title: Quantum Multimodal Contrastive Learning Framework
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Aidan Hung-Wen Tsai, Sheng-Chieh Huang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multimodal contrastive learning utilizing a quantum encoder to integrate EEG (electroencephalogram) and image data. This groundbreaking attempt explores the integration of quantum encoders within the traditional multimodal learning framework. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing, our method enhances the representation learning capabilities, providing a robust framework for analyzing time series and visual information concurrently. We demonstrate that the quantum encoder effectively captures intricate patterns within EEG signals and image features, facilitating improved contrastive learning across modalities. This work opens new avenues for integrating quantum computing with multimodal data analysis, particularly in applications requiring simultaneous interpretation of temporal and visual data.

Title: Quantum integration of decay rates at second order in perturbation theory
Authors: Jorge J. MartÃ­nez de Lejarza, David F. RenterÃ­a-Estrada, Michele Grossi, GermÃ¡n Rodrigo
Abstract: We present the first quantum computation of a total decay rate in high-energy physics at second order in perturbative quantum field theory. This work underscores the confluence of two recent cutting-edge advances. On the one hand, the quantum integration algorithm Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which efficiently decomposes the target function into its Fourier series through a quantum neural network before quantumly integrating the corresponding Fourier components. On the other hand, causal unitary in the loop-tree duality (LTD), which exploits the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in LTD to coherently generate all contributions with different numbers of final-state particles to a scattering or decay process, leading to singularity-free integrands that are well suited for Fourier decomposition. We test the performance of the quantum algorithm with benchmark decay rates in a quantum simulator and in quantum hardware, and find accurate theoretical predictions in both settings.

Title: Satellite image classification with neural quantum kernels
Authors: Pablo Rodriguez-Grasa, Robert Farzan-Rodriguez, Gabriele Novelli, Yue Ban, Mikel Sanz
Abstract: Achieving practical applications of quantum machine learning for real-world scenarios remains challenging despite significant theoretical progress. This paper proposes a novel approach for classifying satellite images, a task of particular relevance to the earth observation (EO) industry, using quantum machine learning techniques. Specifically, we focus on classifying images that contain solar panels, addressing a complex real-world classification problem. Our approach begins with classical pre-processing to reduce the dimensionality of the satellite image dataset. We then apply neural quantum kernels (NQKs)-quantum kernels derived from trained quantum neural networks (QNNs)-for classification. We evaluate several strategies within this framework, demonstrating results that are competitive with the best classical methods. Key findings include the robustness of or results and their scalability, with successful performance achieved up to 8 qubits.

Title: Design the Quantum Instruction Set with the Cartan Coordinate Analysis Framework
Authors: Anbang Wu, Jingwen Leng, Minyi Guo
Abstract: Most quantum compiling efforts rely on standard two-qubit basis gates, such as CX and iSWAP, to implement general quantum operations. However, with the advancement of quantum architecture design, more nonstandard two-qubit gates can now be implemented and calibrated on devices. Using these nonstandard gates may improve the performance of quantum computation. Despite this potential, it remains unclear how to efficiently incorporate these nonstandard gates into the quantum instruction set to enhance quantum advantage. To address this, we propose an analytical framework that facilitates the design of quantum instruction sets based on nonstandard gates. Our approach is grounded in the KAK decomposition and an analysis of the Cartan coordinate of two-qubit operations, enabling analytical conversion between any two two-qubit operations. This framework also demonstrates the lower and upper bounds of the conversion cost, revealing the relationship between the entangling power of two-qubit instructions and their Cartan coordinates. We further develop a compiler based on the analytical framework, which reduces the unitary decomposition cost with nonstandard two-qubit instructions. Using the proposed compiler, we evaluate various options for designing a quantum instruction set based on nonstandard gates. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in the quantum instruction set design. Compared to the state-of-the-art method that is based on the numerical search, our framework reduces the time/resource overhead of exploring the instruction set design space by thousands of times. Moreover, with the established framework, we propose feasible designs for the quantum instruction set by modeling real-world quantum processors, further promoting the quantum advantage.

Title: Energetic Analysis of Emerging Quantum Communication Protocols
Authors: Raja Yehia, Yoann PiÃ©tri, Carlos Pascual-GarcÃ­a, Pascal Lefebvre, Federico Centrone
Abstract: With the rapid development and early industrialization of quantum technologies, it is of great interest to analyze their overall energy consumption before planning for their wide-scale deployments. The evaluation of the total energy requirements of quantum networks is a challenging task: different networks require very disparate techniques to create, distribute, manipulate, detect, and process quantum signals. This paper aims to lay the foundations of a framework to model the energy requirements of different quantum technologies and protocols applied to near-term quantum networks. Different figures of merit are discussed and a benchmark on the energy consumption of bipartite and multipartite network protocols is presented. An open-source software to estimate the energy consumption of photonic setups is also provided.

Title: $2+1$ dimensional Floquet systems and lattice fermions: Exact bulk spectral equivalence
Authors: Thomas Iadecola, Srimoyee Sen, Lars Sivertsen
Abstract: A connection has recently been proposed between periodically driven systems known as Floquet insulators in continuous time and static fermion theories in discrete time. This connection has been established in a $(1+1)$-dimensional free theory, where an explicit mapping between the spectra of a Floquet insulator and a discrete-time Dirac fermion theory has been formulated. Here we investigate the potential of static discrete-time theories to capture Floquet physics in higher dimensions, where so-called anomalous Floquet topological insulators can emerge that feature chiral edge states despite having bulk bands with zero Chern number. Starting from a particular model of an anomalous Floquet system, we provide an example of a static discrete-time theory whose bulk spectrum is an exact analytic match for the Floquet spectrum. The spectra with open boundary conditions in a particular strip geometry also match up to finite-size corrections. However, the models differ in several important respects. The discrete-time theory is spatially anisotropic, so that the spectra do not agree for all lattice terminations, e.g. other strip geometries or on half spaces. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the static discrete-time model is quasi-one-dimensional in nature and therefore has a different bulk-boundary correspondence than the Floquet model.

Title: Ultrastrong coupling, nonselective measurement and quantum Zeno dynamics
Authors: Stefano Marcantoni, Marco Merkli
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an open quantum system linearly coupled to a bosonic reservoir. We show that, in the ultrastrong coupling limit, the system undergoes a nonselective measurement and then evolves unitarily according to an effective Zeno Hamiltonian. This dynamical process is largely independent of the reservoir state. We examine the entanglement breaking effect of the ultrastrong coupling on the system. We also derive the evolution equation for systems in contact with several reservoirs when one coupling is ultrastrong. The effective system dynamics displays a rich structure and, contrarily to the single reservoir case, it is generally non-Markovian. Our approach is based on a Dyson series expansion, in which we can take the ultrastrong limit termwise, and a subsequent resummation of the series. Our derivation is mathematically rigorous and uncomplicated.

Title: Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Pratik Nandy, Tanay Pathak, Zhuo-Yu Xian, Johanna Erdmenger
Abstract: We propose a tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples, including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal$^{\dagger}$, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.

Title: Mixed-State Quantum Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
Authors: Gino Kwun, Bingzhi Zhang, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: Generative quantum machine learning has gained significant attention for its ability to produce quantum states with desired distributions. Among various quantum generative models, quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models (QuDDPMs) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 100602 (2024)] provide a promising approach with stepwise learning that resolves the training issues. However, the requirement of high-fidelity scrambling unitaries in QuDDPM poses a challenge in near-term implementation. We propose the \textit{mixed-state quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model} (MSQuDDPM) to eliminate the need for scrambling unitaries. Our approach focuses on adapting the quantum noise channels to the model architecture, which integrates depolarizing noise channels in the forward diffusion process and parameterized quantum circuits with projective measurements in the backward denoising steps. We also introduce several techniques to improve MSQuDDPM, including a cosine-exponent schedule of noise interpolation, the use of single-qubit random ancilla, and superfidelity-based cost functions to enhance the convergence. We evaluate MSQuDDPM on quantum ensemble generation tasks, demonstrating its successful performance.

Title: Variational Quantum Algorithm for Constrained Topology Optimization
Authors: Jungin E. Kim, Yan Wang
Abstract: One of the challenging scientific computing problems is topology optimization, where searching through the combinatorially complex configurations and solving the constraints of partial differential equations need to be done simultaneously. In this paper, a novel variational quantum algorithm for constrained topology optimization is proposed, which allows for the single-loop parallel search for the optimal configuration that also satisfies the physical constraints. The optimal configurations and the solutions to physical constraints are encoded with two separate registers. A constraint encoding scheme is also proposed to incorporate volume and connectivity constraints in optimization. The gate complexity of the proposed quantum algorithm is analyzed. The algorithm is demonstrated with compliance minimization problems including truss structures and Messerschmitt-BÃ¶lkow-Blohm beams.

Title: Near-Term Spin-Qubit Architecture Design via Multipartite Maximally-Entangled States
Authors: Nikiforos Paraskevopoulos, Matthew Steinberg, Brennan Undseth, Aritra Sarkar, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen, Xiao Xue, Sebastian Feld
Abstract: The design and benchmarking of quantum computer architectures traditionally rely on practical hardware restrictions, such as gate fidelities, control, and cooling. At the theoretical and software levels, numerous approaches have been proposed for benchmarking quantum devices, ranging from, inter alia, quantum volume to randomized benchmarking. In this work, we utilize the quantum information-theoretic properties of multipartite maximally-entangled quantum states, in addition to their correspondence with quantum error correction codes, permitting us to quantify the entanglement generated on near-term bilinear spin-qubit architectures. For this aim, we introduce four metrics which ascertain the quality of genuine multipartite quantum entanglement, along with circuit-level fidelity measures. As part of the task of executing a quantum circuit on a device, we devise simulations which combine expected hardware characteristics of spin-qubit devices with appropriate compilation techniques; we then analyze three different architectural choices of varying lattice sizes for bilinear arrays, under three increasingly realistic noise models. We find that if the use of a compiler is assumed, sparsely-connected spin-qubit lattices can approach comparable values of our metrics to those of the most highly-connected device architecture. Even more surprisingly, by incorporating crosstalk into our last noise model, we find that, as error rates for crosstalk approach realistic values, the benefits of utilizing a bilinear array with advanced connectivity vanish. Our results highlight the limitations of adding local connectivity to near-term spin-qubit devices, and can be readily adapted to other qubit technologies. The framework developed here can be used for analyzing quantum entanglement on a device before fabrication, informing experimentalists on concomitant realistic expectations.

Title: Quantum Search with the Signless Laplacian
Authors: Molly E. McLaughlin, Thomas G. Wong
Abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks are typically effected by either the discrete Laplacian or the adjacency matrix. In this paper, we explore a third option: the signless Laplacian, which has applications in algebraic graph theory and may arise in layered antiferromagnetic materials. We explore spatial search on the complete bipartite graph, which is generally irregular and breaks the equivalence of the three quantum walks for regular graphs, and where the search oracle breaks the equivalence of the Laplacian and signless Laplacian quantum walks on bipartite graphs without the oracle. We prove that a uniform superposition over all the vertices of the graph partially evolves to the marked vertices in one partite set, with the choice of set depending on the jumping rate of the quantum walk. We boost this success probability to 1 by proving that a particular non-uniform initial state completely evolves to the marked vertices in one partite set, again depending on the jumping rate. For some parameter regimes, the signless Laplacian yields the fastest search algorithm of the three, suggesting that it could be a new tool for developing faster quantum algorithms.

Title: Nonlocal characteristics of two-qubit gates and their argand diagrams
Authors: M. Karthick Selvan, S. Balakrishnan
Abstract: In this paper, we show the usefulness of the chords present in the argand diagram of squared eigenvalues of nonlocal part of two-qubit gates to study their nonlocal characteristics. We discuss the criteria for perfect entanglers to transform a pair of orthonormal product states into a pair of orthonormal maximally entangled states. Perfect entanglers with a chord passing through origin can do such a transformation. In the Weyl chamber, we identify the regions of perfect entanglers with at least one chord passing through origin. We also provide the conditions for a perfect entangler without any chord passing through origin to transform a pair of orthonormal product states into orthonormal maximally entangled states. Finally, we show that similar to entangling power, gate typicality can also be described using the chords present in the argand diagram. For each chord describing the entangling power, there exists a chord describing the gate typicality. We show the geometrical relation between the two sets of chords.

Title: Hamiltonian Learning at Heisenberg Limit for Hybrid Quantum Systems
Authors: Lixing Zhang, Ze-Xun Lin, Prineha Narang, Di Luo
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems with different particle species are fundamental in quantum materials and quantum information science. In this work, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian learning in hybrid spin-boson systems can achieve the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, we establish a rigorous theoretical framework proving that, given access to an unknown hybrid Hamiltonian system, our algorithm can estimate the Hamiltonian coupling parameters up to root mean square error (RMSE) $\epsilon$ with a total evolution time scaling as $T \sim \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ using only $\mathcal{O}({\rm polylog}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ measurements. Furthermore, it remains robust against small state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. In addition, we also provide an alternative algorithm based on distributed quantum sensing, which significantly reduces the maximum evolution time per measurement. To validate our method, we apply it to the generalized Dicke model for Hamiltonian learning and the spin-boson model for spectrum learning, demonstrating its efficiency in practical quantum systems. These results provide a scalable and robust framework for precision quantum sensing and Hamiltonian characterization in hybrid quantum platforms.

Title: Exploring the Potential of QEEGNet for Cross-Task and Cross-Dataset Electroencephalography Encoding with Quantum Machine Learning
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Huan-Hsin Tseng
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in neuroscience and clinical research for analyzing brain activity. While deep learning models such as EEGNet have shown success in decoding EEG signals, they often struggle with data complexity, inter-subject variability, and noise robustness. Recent advancements in quantum machine learning (QML) offer new opportunities to enhance EEG analysis by leveraging quantum computing's unique properties. In this study, we extend the previously proposed Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a hybrid neural network incorporating quantum layers into EEGNet, to investigate its generalization ability across multiple EEG datasets. Our evaluation spans a diverse set of cognitive and motor task datasets, assessing QEEGNet's performance in different learning scenarios. Experimental results reveal that while QEEGNet demonstrates competitive performance and maintains robustness in certain datasets, its improvements over traditional deep learning methods remain inconsistent. These findings suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures require further optimization to fully leverage quantum advantages in EEG processing. Despite these limitations, our study provides new insights into the applicability of QML in EEG research and highlights challenges that must be addressed for future advancements.

Authors: Peng Wang, Houwen Wu, Haitang Yang
Abstract: In this paper, based on RT formula, by identifying the pure state UV and IR entanglement entropies of a perturbed CFT$_2$ with geodesic lengths in the bulk, we demonstrate that the dual geometry is uniquely determined to be asymptotically AdS$_3$. The pure AdS$_3$ geometry is recovered by taking the massless limit of the system. Our derivations hold in both static and covariant scenarios.

Title: Categorical relations and bipartite entanglement in tensor cones for Toeplitz and FejÃ©r-Riesz operator systems
Authors: Douglas Farenick
Abstract: The present paper aims to understand separability and entanglement in tensor cones, in the sense of Namioka and Phelps, that arise from the base cones of operator system tensor products. Of particular interest here are the Toeplitz and FejÃ©r-Riesz operator systems, which are, respectively, operator systems of Toeplitz matrices and Laurent polynomials of bounded degree (that is, trigonometric polynomials), and which are related in the operator system category through duality. Some additional categorical relationships established in this paper for Toeplitz and FejÃ©r-Riesz operator systems. Of independent interest is a single matrix criterion, similar to the criterion involving the Choi matrix, for a linear map of the FejÃ©r-Riesz operator system to be completely positive.

Title: Systematic Modulation of Charge and Spin in Graphene Nanoribbons on MgO
Authors: Amelia DomÃ­nguez-Celorrio, Leonard Edens, SofÃ­a Sanz, Manuel Vilas-Varela, Jose Martinez-Castro, Diego PeÃ±a, VÃ©ronique Langlais, Thomas Frederiksen, JosÃ© I. Pascual, David Serrate
Abstract: Graphene nanostructures can be engineered with atomic precision to display customized electronic states with application in spintronics or quantum technologies. In order to take advantage of their full potential, their charge and spin state must be precisely controlled. Graphene systems exchange charge to reach thermodynamic equilibrium with their environment, requiring external gating potentials to tune their ground state. Alternative strategies like intrinsic doping or substrate modifications provided small variations of their equilibrium charge and poor control over their spin. Here, we show systematic manipulation of the electron occupation in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) laying on MgO layers grown on Ag(001). Owing to the extraordinary decoupling properties of MgO, and the electropositive character of the substrate, GNRs are found to host an integer number of electron charges that depend on their length and shape. This results in the alternation between a non-magnetic closed-shell state and an open-shell paramagnetic system for even and odd electron occupations respectively. For the odd case, we found the spectral fingerprint of a narrow Coulomb correlation gap, which is the smoking gun of its spin 1/2 paramagnetic state. Comparisons of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) data with mean-field Hubbard (MFH) simulations confirm the practical discretization of the GNR electronic states and point to charge excess of up to 19 electrons in a single ribbon. We anticipate that GNRs supported by MgO ultra-thin insulating films can open the door to customized devices for quantum sensing and quantum processing applications..

Title: QEEGNet: Quantum Machine Learning for Enhanced Electroencephalography Encoding
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Aidan Hung-Wen Tsai, Chun-Shu Wei
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a critical tool in neuroscience and clinical practice for monitoring and analyzing brain activity. Traditional neural network models, such as EEGNet, have achieved considerable success in decoding EEG signals but often struggle with the complexity and high dimensionality of the data. Recent advances in quantum computing present new opportunities to enhance machine learning models through quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. In this paper, we introduce Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a novel hybrid neural network that integrates quantum computing with the classical EEGNet architecture to improve EEG encoding and analysis, as a forward-looking approach, acknowledging that the results might not always surpass traditional methods but it shows its potential. QEEGNet incorporates quantum layers within the neural network, allowing it to capture more intricate patterns in EEG data and potentially offering computational advantages. We evaluate QEEGNet on a benchmark EEG dataset, BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms traditional EEGNet on most of the subjects and other robustness to noise. Our results highlight the significant potential of quantum-enhanced neural networks in EEG analysis, suggesting new directions for both research and practical applications in the field.

Title: Kohn-Sham inversion with mathematical guarantees
Authors: Michael F. Herbst, VebjÃ¸rn H. Bakkestuen, Andre Laestadius
Abstract: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion algorithm which is demonstrated for representative bulk materials, specifically bulk silicon, gallium arsenide, and potassium chloride. This inversion algorithm allows the construction of rigorous error bounds that we are able to verify numerically. This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate functionals.

Title: Multiscale Embedding for Quantum Computing
Authors: Leah P. Weisburn, Minsik Cho, Moritz Bensberg, Oinam Romesh Meitei, Markus Reiher, Troy Van Voorhis
Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.

Title: Moment method and continued fraction expansion in Floquet Operator Krylov Space
Authors: Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Aditi Mitra
Abstract: Recursion methods such as Krylov techniques map complex dynamics to an effective non-interacting problem in one dimension. For example, the operator Krylov space for Floquet dynamics can be mapped to the dynamics of an edge operator of the one-dimensional Floquet inhomogeneous transverse field Ising model (ITFIM), where the latter, after a Jordan-Wigner transformation, is a Floquet model of non-interacting Majorana fermions, and the couplings correspond to Krylov angles. We present an application of this showing that a moment method exists where given an autocorrelation function, one can construct the corresponding Krylov angles, and from that the corresponding Floquet-ITFIM. Consequently, when no solutions for the Krylov angles are obtained, it indicates that the autocorrelation is not generated by unitary dynamics. We highlight this by studying certain special cases: stable $m$-periodic dynamics derived using the method of continued fractions, exponentially decaying and power-law decaying stroboscopic dynamics. Remarkably, our examples of stable $m$-periodic dynamics correspond to $m$-period edge modes for the Floquet-ITFIM where deep in the chain, the couplings correspond to a critical phase. Our results pave the way to engineer Floquet systems with desired properties of edge modes and also provide examples of persistent edge modes in gapless Floquet systems.

Title: Diverging entanglement of critical magnons in easy-axis antiferromagnets
Authors: Jongjun M. Lee, Hyun-Woo Lee, Myung-Joong Hwang
Abstract: We study the instability of antiferromagnets with easy-axis anisotropy under a magnetic field, uncovering single or even multiple phase transitions at the boundary between non-collinear and collinear spin orderings. Near the phase boundary, the entanglement between the sublattice magnons diverges due to the interplay among antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, anisotropy, and magnetic field. Furthermore, our study reveals that this magnetic criticality extends to a superradiant phase transition within cavity magnonics systems. The magnon-photon interaction results in diverging cavity photon numbers and squeezing in the ground state at the transition points between spin orderings. This investigation not only elucidates the criticality of multi-component squeezed magnons in antiferromagnets, but also proposes cavity photon measurements as a viable method for detecting magnetic phase transitions.

Title: Giant Rabi frequencies between qubit and excited hole states in silicon quantum dots
Authors: E. Fanucchi, G. Forghieri, A. Secchi, P. Bordone, F. Troiani
Abstract: Holes in Si quantum dots are being investigated for the implementation of electrically addressable spin qubits. In this perspective, the attention has been focused on the electric-field induced transitions between the eigenstates belonging to the ground doublet. Here we theoretically extend the analysis to the first excited doublet. We show that - in a prototypical quantum dot structure - transitions involving the lowest excited states display Rabi frequencies that are several orders of magnitude larger than those occurring in the ground doublet. A clear relation with the symmetries of the eigenstates emerges, as well as a wide tunability of the Rabi frequencies by means of the applied bias. A preliminary discussion on the possible implications of the present results for multilevel manipulation schemes and for multi-hole qubit encodings is provided.

Title: Gravitational entanglement witness through Einstein ring image
Authors: Youka Kaku, Yasusada Nambu
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between quantum theory and gravity by exploring gravitational lensing and Einstein ring images in a weak gravitational field induced by a mass source in spatial quantum superposition. We analyze a quantum massless scalar field propagating in two distinct models of gravity: the first quantized Newtonian gravity (QG) model, which generates quantum entanglement between the mass source and other systems, and the SchrÃ¶dinger-Newton (SN) gravity model, which does not produce entanglement. Visualizing the two-point correlation function of the scalar field, we find that the QG model produces a composition of multiple Einstein rings, reflecting the spatial superposition of the mass source. By contrast, the SN model yields a single deformed ring image, representing a classical spacetime configuration. Furthermore, we introduce a specific quantity named the which-path information indicator and visualize its image. The QG model again reveals multiple Einstein rings, while the image intensity in the SN model notably vanishes. Our findings provide a visual approach to witness gravity-induced entanglement through distinct features in Einstein ring images. This study advances our understanding of quantum effects in general relativistic contexts and establishes a foundation for future studies of other relativistic phenomena.

Title: General Relativistic Center-of-Mass Coordinates for Composite Quantum Particles
Authors: Gregor Janson, Richard Lopp
Abstract: Recent proposals suggested quantum clock interferometry for tests of the Einstein equivalence principle. However, atom interferometric models often include relativistic effects only in an ad hoc fashion. Here, instead, we start from the multi-particle nature of quantum-delocalizable atoms in curved spacetime and generalize the special-relativistic center of mass (COM) and relative coordinates that have previously been studied for Minkowski spacetime to obtain the light-matter dynamics in curved spacetime. In particular, for a local Schwarzschild observer located at the surface of the Earth using Fermi-Walker coordinates, we find gravitational correction terms for the PoincarÃ© symmetry generators and use them to derive general relativistic COM and relative coordinates. In these coordinates we obtain the Hamiltonian of a fully first-quantized two-particle atom interacting with the electromagnetic field in curved spacetime that naturally incorporates special and general relativistic effects.

Title: The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a 'large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed 'small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. Critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the FL-SDW quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the 'foot' of strange metal transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the 'fan' of strange metal behavior of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and the pseudogap metal is described by thermal fluctuations above a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) or a 'holon metal', with the descriptions related by a duality on a background spin liquid. The quantum critical fan is described using a field theory for an underlying FL-FL* quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder. This field theory can be mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully models linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations in the quantum critical fan. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.

Title: Universal whirling magnetic orders in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type quasicrystal approximants
Authors: Farid Labib, Kazuhiro Nawa, Yusuke Nambu, Hiroyuki Takakura, Yoichi Ikeda, Kazuhiko Deguchi, Masato Matsuura, Asuka Ishikawa, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Kazuhiko Ikeuchi, Taku J. Sato, Ryuji Tamura
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.
