Title: Optimized Amplitude Amplification for Quantum State Preparation
Authors: Artem Chernikov, Karina Zakharova, Sergey Sysoev
Abstract: In this paper, we present an algorithm for preparing quantum states of the form $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \alpha_i |i\rangle$, where the coefficients $\alpha_i$ are specified by a quantum oracle. Our method achieves this task twice as fast as the best existing algorithm known to the authors. Such state preparation is essential for quantum algorithms that process large classical inputs, including matrix inversion and linear system solvers. The standard approach relies on amplitude amplification, a process that may require multiple, time-consuming oracle queries. Consequently, reducing the number of queries - and thereby the overall time complexity can lead to significant performance improvements in practice.

Title: Improved Ground State Estimation in Quantum Field Theories via Normalising Flow-Assisted Neural Quantum States
Authors: Vishal S. Ngairangbam, Michael Spannowsky, Timur Sypchenko
Abstract: We propose a hybrid variational framework that enhances Neural Quantum States (NQS) with a Normalising Flow-based sampler to improve the expressivity and trainability of quantum many-body wavefunctions. Our approach decouples the sampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model that targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space. This overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and autoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and volume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail. Our results showcase the utility of flow-assisted sampling as a scalable tool for quantum simulation and offer a new approach toward learning expressive quantum states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Title: Universal Spreading of Nonstabilizerness and Quantum Transport
Authors: Emanuele Tirrito, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Marcello Dalmonte, Piotr Sierant, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: We investigate how transport properties of $U(1)$-conserving dynamics impact the growth of quantum resources characterizing the complexity of many-body states. We quantify wave-function delocalization using participation entropy (PE), a measure rooted in the coherence theory of pure states, and assess nonstabilizerness through stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Focusing on the XXZ spin chain initialized in domain-wall state, we demonstrate universal power-law growth of both PE and SRE, with scaling exponents explicitly reflecting the underlying transport regimes, ballistic, diffusive, or KPZ-type superdiffusive. Our results establish a solid connection between quantum resources and transport, providing insights into the dynamics of complexity within symmetry-constrained quantum systems.

Title: Single-photon emission modeling with statistical estimators for the exponential distribution
Authors: Artur Czerwinski, Katarzyna Czerwinska, Xiangji Cai, Asad Ali, Hashir Kuniyil, Atta ur Rahman, Saif Al-Kuwari, Saeed Haddadi
Abstract: Single-photon sources are used in numerous quantum technologies, from sensing and imaging to communication, making the accurate modeling of their emissions essential. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for describing single-photon emission processes and implement estimators for the exponential distribution to quantify this phenomenon. Our approach provides a reliable method for estimating the radiative decay time, represented by the inverse rate parameter, which is crucial in quantum optics applications. We explore several statistical estimators, including maximum likelihood estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and best linear unbiased estimator. To validate our theoretical methods, we test the proposed estimators on experimental data, demonstrating their applicability in real-world settings. We also evaluate the performance of these estimators when dealing with censored data, a frequent limitation in photon emission experiments. The analysis allows us to track the performance of the proposed estimators as the amount of available data decreases, providing insights into their reliability for modeling single-photon emission events under limited resources.

Title: Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation
Authors: Zhongda Zeng, Giuliano Giudici, Aruku Senoo, Alexander Baumgärtner, Adam M. Kaufman, Hannes Pichler
Abstract: Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.

Title: Thermal state preparation by repeated interactions at and beyond the Lindblad limit
Authors: Carlos Ramon-Escandell, Alessandro Prositto, Dvira Segal
Abstract: We study the nature of thermalization dynamics and the associated preparation (simulation) time under the repeated interaction protocol uncovering a generic anomalous, Mpemba-like trend. As a case study, we focus on a three-level system and analyze its dynamics in two complementary regimes, where the system-ancilla interaction strength is either large or small. Focusing on the estimation of the simulation time, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum number of collisions, or minimal simulation time, required to achieve a thermal state, which is within $\epsilon$ distance to the target thermal state. At zero temperature, we analytically identify a set of points (interaction strength $\times$ their duration) that minimize the simulation time. At nonzero temperature, we observe a Mpemba-like effect: Starting from a maximally mixed state, thermalization to an intermediate-temperature state takes longer than to a lower-temperature one. We provide an accurate analytical approximation for this phenomenon and demonstrate its occurrence in larger systems and under randomized interaction strengths. The prevalence of the Mpemba effect in thermal state preparation presents a significant challenge for preparing states in large systems, an open problem calling for new strategies.

Title: OSI Stack Redesign for Quantum Networks: Requirements, Technologies, Challenges, and Future Directions
Authors: Shakil Ahmed, Muhammad Kamran Saeed, Ashfaq Khokhar
Abstract: Quantum communication is poised to become a foundational element of next-generation networking, offering transformative capabilities in security, entanglement-based connectivity, and computational offloading. However, the classical OSI model-designed for deterministic and error-tolerant systems-cannot support quantum-specific phenomena such as coherence fragility, probabilistic entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and proposes an architectural redesign of the OSI model for quantum networks in the context of 7G. We introduce a Quantum-Converged OSI stack by extending the classical model with Layer 0 (Quantum Substrate) and Layer 8 (Cognitive Intent), supporting entanglement, teleportation, and semantic orchestration via LLMs and QML. Each layer is redefined to incorporate quantum mechanisms such as enhanced MAC protocols, fidelity-aware routing, and twin-based applications. This survey consolidates over 150 research works from IEEE, ACM, MDPI, arXiv, and Web of Science (2018-2025), classifying them by OSI layer, enabling technologies such as QKD, QEC, PQC, and RIS, and use cases such as satellite QKD, UAV swarms, and quantum IoT. A taxonomy of cross-layer enablers-such as hybrid quantum-classical control, metadata-driven orchestration, and blockchain-integrated quantum trust-is provided, along with simulation tools including NetSquid, QuNetSim, and QuISP. We present several domain-specific applications, including quantum healthcare telemetry, entangled vehicular networks, and satellite mesh overlays. An evaluation framework is proposed based on entropy throughput, coherence latency, and entanglement fidelity. Key future directions include programmable quantum stacks, digital twins, and AI-defined QNet agents, laying the groundwork for a scalable, intelligent, and quantum-compliant OSI framework for 7G and beyond.

Title: Multimode and Random-Access Optical Quantum Memory via Adiabatic Phase Imprinting
Authors: Nasser Gohari Kamel, Sourabh Kumar, Ujjwal Gautam, Erhan Saglamyurek, Vahid Salari, Daniel Oblak
Abstract: A photonic quantum memory capable of simultaneously storing multiple qubits and subsequently recalling any randomly selected subset of the qubits, is essential for large-scale quantum networking and computing. Such functionality, akin to classical Random-Access Memory (RAM), has proven difficult to implement due to the absence of a versatile random-access mechanism and limited multimode capacity in existing quantum memory protocols. A potential path to developing the quantum analog to RAM is offered by photon-echo protocols in rare-earth ion-doped materials, such as Revival Of Silenced Echo. These can utilize optical rephasing pulses to selectively read-out frequency multiplexed photonic qubits within an inhomogeneously broadened optical transition. However, the conventional non-adiabatic nature of the rephasing pulses requires intense, short-duration pulses, impeding their fidelity and multimode capacity. To address these critical limitations, we introduce an alternate protocol that employs Rapid Adiabatic Passage (RAP) rephasing pulses, to realize quantum memory, which invokes phase-imprints to suppress undesirable echoes. Using the optical transitions of a $^{171}{\rm Yb}^{3+}$:${\rm Y}_2{\rm SiO}_5$ crystal, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of multiple intricate spectro-temporally photonic modes and achieve optical random access memory across eight distinct spectral modes. This protocol yields greatly enhanced mode-mapping versatility while substantially lowering the required rephasing pulse intensity, providing a more efficient and reliable approach for high-fidelity qubit storage and retrieval.

Title: Fully Collective Superradiant Lasing with Vanishing Sensitivity to Cavity Length Vibrations
Authors: Jarrod T. Reilly, Simon B. Jäger, John Cooper, Murray J. Holland
Abstract: To date, realization of a continuous-wave active atomic clock has been elusive primarily due to parasitic heating from spontaneous emission while repumping the atoms. Here, we propose a solution to this problem by replacing the random emission with coupling to an auxiliary cavity, making repumping a fully collective process. While it is known that collective two-level models do not possess a generic lasing threshold, we show this restriction is overcome with multi-level atoms since collective pumping and decay can be performed on distinct transitions. Using relevant atomic parameters, we find this system is capable of producing an $\mathcal{O}$(100 $\mu$Hz)-linewidth continuous-wave superradiant laser. Our principal result is the potential for an operating regime with cavity length vibration sensitivity below $\mathcal{O}(10^{-14} / g)$, including a locus of parameter values where it completely vanishes even at steady-state.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning
Authors: Muhammad Usman
Abstract: The meteoric rise of artificial intelligence in recent years has seen machine learning methods become ubiquitous in modern science, technology, and industry. Concurrently, the emergence of programmable quantum computers, coupled with the expectation that large-scale fault-tolerant machines will follow in the near to medium-term future, has led to much speculation about the prospect of quantum machine learning (QML), namely machine learning (ML) solutions which take advantage of quantum properties to outperform their classical counterparts. Indeed, QML is widely considered as one of the front-running use cases for quantum computing. In recent years, research in QML has gained significant global momentum. In this chapter, we introduce the fundamentals of QML and provide a brief overview of the recent progress and future trends in the field of QML. We highlight key opportunities for achieving quantum advantage in ML tasks, as well as describe some open challenges currently facing the field of QML. Specifically in the context of cybersecurity, we introduce the potential for QML in defence and security-sensitive applications, where it has been predicted that the seamless integration of quantum computing into ML will herald the development of robust and reliable QML systems, resilient against sophisticated threats arising from data manipulation and poisoning.

Title: Dynamical non-Hermitian systems: Fingerprints and pure dephasing induced protection effect
Authors: Wanchen Ma, Hao Zhang, Junjie Liu
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have shown promising potential for realizing quantum information tasks that lack counterparts in the Hermitian realm. Understanding the dynamical characteristics of non-Hermitian systems as reflected in information-theoretic quantities is essential for advancing their applications. Here we investigate dynamics of trace distance and concurrence, which quantify information flow and entanglement, respectively, in non-Hermitian qubit systems exhibiting either parity-time or anti-parity-time symmetry. We identify dynamical fingerprints from the system density matrix which provide a unified explanation to the common oscillation and relaxation dynamics shared by trace distance and concurrence observed in existing studies. We further investigate the fate of dynamical fingerprints under the impact of pure dephasing. Surprisingly, we find that pure dephasing can slow down the inherent relaxation of information flow and entanglement in non-Hermitian systems with unbroken anti-parity-time symmetry, suggesting a passive environment-assisted information protection in this class of non-Hermitian systems. Our findings enhance our understanding of dynamical non-Hermitian systems and have specific relevance to their information-oriented applications.

Title: Physical-Layer Machine Learning with Multimode Interferometric Photon Counting
Authors: Jia-Jin Feng, Anthony J. Brady, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: The learning of the physical world relies on sensing and data post-processing. When the signals are weak, multi-dimensional and correlated, the performance of learning is often bottlenecked by the quality of sensors, calling for integrating quantum sensing into the learning of such physical-layer data. An example of such a learning scenario is the stochastic quadrature displacements of electromagnetic fields, modeling optomechanical force sensing, radiofrequency photonic sensing, microwave cavity weak signal sensing and other applications. We propose a unified protocol that combines machine learning with interferometric photon counting to reduce noise and reveal correlations. By applying variational quantum learning with multimode programmable quantum measurements, we enhance signal extraction. Our results show that multimode interferometric photon counting outperforms conventional homodyne detection proposed in prior works for tasks like principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-correlation analysis (CCA), even below vacuum noise levels. To further enhance the performance, We also integrate entanglement-enhanced modules, in the form of squeezed state distribution and anti-squeezing at detection, into the protocol. Combining the multimode interferometric photon counting and multipartite entanglement, the proposed protocol provides a powerful toolbox for learning weak signals.

Title: Nonreciprocal quantum coherence in cavity magnomechanics via the Barnett effect
Authors: Jinhao Jia, Yingru Li, Juan Huang, Mei Zhang
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the quantum coherence ans its nonreciprocity in a cavity magnomechanical (CMM) syetem, which consists of a rotating yittrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and a microwave cavity. By adjusting the direction of the magnetic field, the frequency shift of a magnon mode can be tuned from positive to negative due to the Barnett effect. This effect leads to a significant difference in the system stability and is responsible for the nonreciprocal quantum coherence. We examine how the input power, magnomechanical and magnon-photon coupling rates, decay rates of both the cavity photon modes and the magnon modes influence the quantum coherence. Through careful tuning of system parameters, nearly perfect nonreciprocity can be achieved. Our results provide a controllable mechanism for direction-dependent quantum coherence, with potential applications in nonreciprocal quantum devices and information processing.

Title: Component Based Quantum Machine Learning Explainability
Authors: Barra White, Krishnendu Guha
Abstract: Explainable ML algorithms are designed to provide transparency and insight into their decision-making process. Explaining how ML models come to their prediction is critical in fields such as healthcare and finance, as it provides insight into how models can help detect bias in predictions and help comply with GDPR compliance in these fields. QML leverages quantum phenomena such as entanglement and superposition, offering the potential for computational speedup and greater insights compared to classical ML. However, QML models also inherit the black-box nature of their classical counterparts, requiring the development of explainability techniques to be applied to these QML models to help understand why and how a particular output was generated. This paper will explore the idea of creating a modular, explainable QML framework that splits QML algorithms into their core components, such as feature maps, variational circuits (ansatz), optimizers, kernels, and quantum-classical loops. Each component will be analyzed using explainability techniques, such as ALE and SHAP, which have been adapted to analyse the different components of these QML algorithms. By combining insights from these parts, the paper aims to infer explainability to the overall QML model.

Title: State-Based Quantum Simulation of Imaginary-Time Evolution
Authors: S. Alipour, T. Ojanen
Abstract: Imaginary time evolution is a powerful technique for computing the ground state of quantum Hamiltonians, where the convergence to ground state in asymptotic imaginary time is guaranteed. However, implementing this method on quantum computers is challenging due to its nonunitary nature. Here, we propose a fully quantum approach for simulation of imaginary time evolutions which eliminates the need for intermediate classical computation or state tomography. Our method leverages the recently introduced state-based quantum simulation technique, in which using quantum states besides quantum gates allows to simulate a broader class of evolutions beyond the natural quantum dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate how by using a set of quantum states and by applying only controlled-SWAP gates and measurements, one can simulate the nonunitary imaginary time evolution. We illustrate our results in an example.

Title: Simulating the Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Model on a Spin-Frustrated Kagome Lattice with the Contextual Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Tim Weaving, Alexis Ralli, Vinul Wimalaweera, Peter J. Love, Peter V. Coveney
Abstract: In this work we investigate the ground state properties of a candidate quantum spin liquid using a superconducting Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device. Specifically, we study the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice, a geometrically frustrated structure that gives rise to a highly degenerate energy spectrum. To successfully simulate this system, we employ a qubit reduction strategy leveraging the Contextual Subspace methodology, significantly reducing the problem size prior to execution on the quantum device. We improve the quality of these subspaces by using the wavefunctions obtained from low bond dimension Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations to bias the subspace stabilizers through a symplectic approximate symmetry generator extraction algorithm. Reducing the Hamiltonian size allows us to implement tiled circuit ensembles and deploy the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to estimate the ground state energy. We adopt a hybrid quantum error mitigation strategy combining Readout Error Mitigation (REM), Symmetry Verification (SV) and Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). This approach yields high-accuracy energy estimates, achieving error rates on the order of 0.01% and thus demonstrating the potential of near-term quantum devices for probing frustrated quantum materials.

Title: Marginal second-order moments do not suffice for entanglement detection
Authors: A. García-Velo, M. Paraschiv, Y. Ban, E. Torrontegui, R. Puebla
Abstract: The complete knowledge of the global and marginal second-order moments of a quantum state is in general insufficient for entanglement detection. By deriving the conditions on local-unitary (LU) transformations through the second-order moments, we construct pairs of separable and entangled states that are not LU equivalent, contain different amount of entanglement, and are not equivalent under stochastic local operations and classical communication, even though the states share identical global and marginal second-order moments.

Title: Accelerated Inchworm Method with Tensor-Train Bath Influence Functional
Authors: Geshuo Wang, Yixiao Sun, Siyao Yang, Zhenning Cai
Abstract: We propose an efficient tensor-train-based algorithm for simulating open quantum systems with the inchworm method, where the reduced dynamics of the open quantum system is expressed as a perturbative series of high-dimensional integrals. Instead of evaluating the integrals with Monte Carlo methods, we approximate the costly bath influence functional (BIF) in the integrand as a tensor train, allowing accurate deterministic numerical quadrature schemes implemented in an iterative manner. Thanks to the low-rank structure of the tensor train, our proposed method has a complexity that scales linearly with the number of dimensions. Our method couples seamlessly with the tensor transfer method, allowing long-time simulations of the dynamics.

Title: Collective Excitations of Dissipative Time Crystals
Authors: Gage W. Harmon, Giovanna Morigi, Simon B. Jäger
Abstract: We study the dynamics of atoms interacting periodically with a dissipative optical cavity and employ Floquet theory to analyze their low-frequency behavior. By means of an effective atom-only master equation, valid in the bad cavity regime, we characterize the excitation spectrum of the atoms across the transition from a normal phase to a time-crystalline phase where the atoms undergo stable oscillations. We identify features in the complex excitation spectra when crossing second and first order transitions where the order parameter changes continuously or abruptly. Finally, we discuss how these results can be detected experimentally by probing the cavity with an additional drive. Our work provides important tools for analyzing the response of dynamical out-of-equilibrium phases.

Title: Noise tolerance via reinforcement: Learning a reinforced quantum dynamics
Authors: Abolfazl Ramezanpour
Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to find a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This approach also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.

Title: Analysis of quantum neural network performance via edge cases
Authors: Maximilian Balthasar Mansky, Tobias Rohe, Linus Menzel, Dmytro Bondarenko, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien
Abstract: We evaluate the particular performance of different quantum machine learning networks on a graph classification task. Quantum circuits with varying internal symmetry that completely, partially and not at all confer to the symmetry of the graph show different performance on the data set. The convergence results are inspected using a number of special graphs with particular structure. These are unlikely to occur in the training data and cover specific cases that refute the assumption that the quantum neural network learns simpler surrogate models based on the number of edges in the graph.

Title: Ab Initio Polaritonic Chemistry on Diverse Quantum Computing Platforms: Qubit, Qudit, and Hybrid Qubit-Qumode Architectures
Authors: Even Chiari, Wafa Makhlouf, Lucie Pepe, Johanna Klein, Emiel Koridon, Johanna Klein, Bruno Senjean, Benjamin Lasorne, Saad Yalouz
Abstract: Trying to export ab initio polaritonic chemistry onto emerging quantum computers raises fundamental questions. A central one is how to efficiently represent both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom on the same platform, in order to develop computational strategies that can accurately capture strong electron-photon correlations at a reasonable cost for implementation on near-term hardware. Given the hybrid fermion-boson nature of polaritonic problem, one may legitimately ask: should we rely exclusively on conventional qubit-based platforms, or consider alternative computational paradigms? To explore this, we investigate in this work three strategies: qubit-based, qudit-based, and hybrid qubit-qumode approaches. For each platform, we design compact, physically motivated quantum circuit ansätze and integrate them within the state-averaged variational quantum eigensolver to compute multiple polaritonic eigenstates simultaneously. A key element of our approach is the development of compact electron-photon entangling circuits, tailored to the native capabilities and limitations of each hardware architecture. We benchmark all three strategies on a cavity-embedded H$_{2}$ molecule, reproducing characteristic phenomena such as light-induced avoided crossings. Our results show that each platform achieves comparable accuracy in predicting polaritonic eigen-energies and eigenstates. However, with respect to quantum resources required the hybrid qubit-qumode approach offers the most favorable tradeoff between resource efficiency and accuracy, followed closely by the qudit-based method. Both of which outperform the conventional qubit-based strategy. Our work presents a hardware-conscious comparison of quantum encoding strategies for polaritonic systems and highlights the potential of higher-dimensional quantum platforms to simulate complex light-matter systems.

Title: Magnetic properties of the frustrated decorated Ising chain
Authors: D.V. Laptiev, O.O. Krivchikov, Yu.V. Savin, V.V. Slavin
Abstract: Using the Kramers-Wannier transfer matrix method we studied several decorated Ising chains. The exact expressions for thermodynamic characteristics, including the ground state characteristics, were obtained. We considered a number of modeling chains with different signs and absolute values of exchange constants for the nearest- and the next-nearest neighbors. For these models we calculated the magnetization curves. The critical values of magnetic fields and corresponding magnetization plateau parameters were obtained. Analytic expressions for the ground state entropy were obtained for the chains with different interaction constants. The dependencies of the number of states with minimum energy (the degeneration of the ground state) as the function of the number of particles were found. It was shown that these dependencies are expressed in terms of well-known numerical sequences - Lucas numbers and Pell numbers, which, in the limit of a large number of particles, are proportional to the powers of the golden and silver sections. Therefore, the ground state entropy (per particle) of the systems under consideration can be described in terms of these sections and, therefore, is nonzero.

Title: Inequality for von Neumann entropy change under measurement and dissipation
Authors: Kohei Kobayashi
Abstract: We derive a universal inequality that provides a lower bound on the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy change in a quantum system subject to continuous measurement and dissipation. Our result clarifies how entropy production is fundamentally constrained by three distinct contributions: (i) the non-Hermitian structure of the dissipation operator, (ii) the standard variance associated with measurement-induced fluctuations, and (iii) a generalized quantum variance reflecting the noncommutativity between the measurement observable and the quantum state. This third term vanishes when the state and observable commute, and thus represents a purely quantum contribution arising from coherence disturbance and measurement backaction. The derived inequality generalizes classical information-thermodynamic relations, such as the Sagawa--Ueda inequality, to the quantum regime, providing a new perspective on the trade-offs between information acquisition, control, and entropy production in continuously monitored open quantum systems.

Title: Multimode Bosonic State Tomography with Single-Shot Joint Parity Measurement of a Trapped Ion
Authors: Honggi Jeon, Jiyong Kang, Wonhyeong Choi, Kyunghye Kim, Jaehun You, Taehyun Kim
Abstract: The full characterization of a continuous-variable quantum system is a challenging problem. For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of reconstructing the quantum states have been developed, including the measurement of the Q quasi-probability function and the density matrix elements in the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale to multi-mode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for reconstructing a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct single-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped ion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that coherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the ion. This interaction encodes the joint parity information into the relative phase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined phonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this capability, we directly measure multi-mode Wigner quasi-probability distributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent state, and show that the generated state is non-positive under partial transpose, confirming its entanglement. We further show that the single-shot joint parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time. By post-selecting the parity measurement outcomes, we experimentally demonstrate the extension of the bosonic state lifetime, effectively implementing an error mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various sources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter operation and study the feasibility of high fidelity operations. The interaction studied in this work can be easily extended to more than two modes, and is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum metrology.

Title: Beyond Dicke superradiance: Universal scaling of the peak emission rate
Authors: Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity for many spatially separated emitters remained challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Derived from exact numerics, we present an analytically compact and easily computable formula for the peak photon emission rate of fully excited quantum emitter systems undergoing superradiant decay. The result applies to emitter configurations in any geometry and reveals a universal behavior: spatially extended quantum systems have a geometry-dependent optimal emitter number and always reach a peak photon emission rate that increases only linearly with $N$. Our results encompass quantum systems ranging from cold atomic gases and neutral-atom arrays to molecular aggregates and solid-state materials.

Title: Fully Quantum Lattice Gas Automata Building Blocks for Computational Basis State Encodings
Authors: Călin A. Georgescu, Merel A. Schalkers, Matthias Möller
Abstract: Lattice Gas Automata (LGA) is a classical method for simulating physical phenomena, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Quantum LGA (QLGA) is the family of methods that implement LGA schemes on quantum computers. In recent years, QLGA has garnered attention from researchers thanks to its potential of efficiently modeling CFD processes by either reducing memory requirements or providing simultaneous representations of exponentially many LGA states. In this work, we introduce novel building blocks for QLGA algorithms that rely on computational basis state encodings. We address every step of the algorithm, from initial conditions to measurement, and provide detailed complexity analyses that account for all discretization choices of the system under simulation. We introduce multiple ways of instantiating initial conditions, efficient boundary condition implementations for novel geometrical patterns, a novel collision operator that models less restricted interactions than previous implementations, and quantum circuits that extract quantities of interest out of the quantum state. For each building block, we provide intuitive examples and open-source implementations of the underlying quantum circuits.

Title: A unified picture for quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects
Authors: Sacha Greenfield, Archana Kamal, Justin Dressel, Eli Levenson-Falk
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect is a striking feature of quantum mechanics with foundational implications and practical applications in quantum control, error suppression, and error correction. The effect has branched off into a variety of different interpretations, making it easy to miss the unifying features of the underlying effect. In particular, the quantum Zeno effect has been studied in the context of both selective and nonselective measurements; for both pulsed and continuous interactions; for suppression and enhancement of decay (Zeno / anti-Zeno effects); and even in the absence of measurement entirely. This concise review presents a unified picture of these effects by examining how they all arise in the context of a driven qubit subjected to measurements or dissipation. Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are revealed as regimes of a unified effect that appears whenever a measurement-like process competes with a non-commuting evolution. The current landscape of Zeno and anti-Zeno effects is reviewed through this unifying lens, with a focus on experimental applications and implementations. The quantum Zeno effect is found to be both ubiquitous and essential for the future of near-term quantum computing.

Title: Multiphoton blockade by multi-tone drive
Authors: Guang-Yu Zhang, Zhi-Hao Liu, Jie-Qiao Liao, Xun-Wei Xu
Abstract: Multiphoton blockade provides an efficient way to achieve entangled photon sources and leads to wide applications in modern quantum technologies. Here, we propose a scheme to realize multiphoton blockade by a multi-tone drive. Specifically, we demonstrate two-photon and three-photon blockades in a single-mode optical Kerr resonator using a two-tone and a three-tone drive, respectively. In comparison with the single-tone drive, except for the blockade of the $(n+1)$th photon excitation due to large detuning, the key mechanism in this scheme is the sequently resonant excitations of all the $m$-photon states ($m\leq n$) by the $n$-tone drive, which lead to the enhancement of photon generation and the demonstration of multiphoton blockade in the weak driving regime. Moreover, the photon distribution within the system can be adjusted on demand by tuning the relative amplitudes of the driving fields for different frequencies. The scheme can be extended to other bosonic systems and be applied to demonstrate other multiphoton physical effects.

Title: Non-Markovian Protection and Thermal Fragility of Quantum Resources in a Spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg Diamond Chain
Authors: Fadwa Benabdallah, M. Y. Abd-Rabbou, Mohammed Daoud
Abstract: This research investigates the dynamics of entanglement and uncertainty-induced nonlocality in a spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain subjected to local non-Markovian decoherence channels. By examining amplitude damping and random telegraph noise in both zero and finite temperature regimes, the study reveals nuanced distinctions in the degradation and revival of quantum correlations. The interplay between intrinsic spin couplings, thermal effects, and memory-induced coherence backflow highlights the complex behavior of quantum resources under realistic noise conditions. Concurrence emerges as a sensitive marker of entanglement recovery in dephasing environments, while uncertainty-induced nonlocality proves more resilient in high-temperature or dissipative regimes. The analysis further demonstrates that moderate thermal activation and external magnetic fields can nontrivially enhance or suppress quantum features depending on system parameters. These findings offer a detailed perspective on the robustness and complementarity of different quantum correlation measures, providing guiding principles for the design of thermally stable and noise-resilient quantum information protocols.

Abstract: The capabilities of modern artificial intelligence (AI) as a ``scientific collaborator'' are explored by engaging it with three nuanced problems in quantum optics: state populations in optical pumping, resonant transitions between decaying states (the Burshtein effect), and degenerate mirrorless lasing. Through iterative dialogue, the authors observe that AI models--when prompted and corrected--can reason through complex scenarios, refine their answers, and provide expert-level guidance, closely resembling the interaction with an adept colleague. The findings highlight that AI democratizes access to sophisticated modeling and analysis, shifting the focus in scientific practice from technical mastery to the generation and testing of ideas, and reducing the time for completing research tasks from days to minutes.

Title: The effect of Quantum Time Crystal Computing to Quantum Machine Learning methods
Authors: Hikaru Wakaura, Andriyan B. Suksmono
Abstract: Many body localization shows the robustness for external perturbations and time reversal symmetry on Time Crystal. This Time Crystal prolongs the coherence time, hence, it is used for quantum computers as qubits. Therefore, we established the method to exploit Time Crystals for quantum computing by controlling external noise called Quantum Time Crystal Computing and demonstrated solving the problem of generating correct waves using Quantum Reservoir Computing, and fitting of given function using Quantum Neural Network and Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. As a consequence, we revealed that Quantum Time Crystal Computing lower the accuracy of Quantum Reservoir Computing and improved the accuracy of Quantum Neural Network and Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. This result may be the one of milestones of Quantum Error Mitigation as the case that noise improves the accuracy of Quantum Machine Learning.

Title: Distinguishing Quantum and Classical Gravity via Non-Stationary Test Mass Dynamics
Authors: Wenjie Zhong, Yubao Liu, Yiqiu Ma
Abstract: Classical gravity theory predicts a state-dependent gravitational potential for a quantum test mass, leading to nonlinear Schrodinger-Newton (SN) state evolution that contrasts with quantum gravity. Testing the effect of SN evolution can provide evidence for distinguishing quantum gravity and classical gravity, which is challenging to realize in the stationary optomechanical systems as analyzed in previous works [Phys. Rev. D 107, 024004 (2023), Phys. Rev. D 111, 062004 (2025)]. This work is devoted to analyzing the possibility of capturing the signature of SN theory during the non-stationary evolution of the test mass under the optomechanical measurement, where the second-order moments of a test mass can exhibit a distinctive oscillatory behavior. We show that this feature manifest in the non-stationary noise spectrum of outgoing light as additional peaks structures, although resolving these structures in practical experiments requires a larger number of repetitive trials with our sampling parameters, which is cost-prohibitive. To address this issue, we further employ statistical inference methods to extract more comprehensive information, thereby reducing the required number of experimental repetitions. Through Mock-Data simulations, we demonstrate that only 10 experimental trials of 40 seconds each are sufficient to reduce the false alarm rate for distinguishing between the two models to below one percent.

Title: Experimental Observation of Purity-Like Invariants of Multi-photon States in Linear Optics
Authors: Baichuan Yang, Hao Zhan, Minghao Mi, Aonan Zhang, Liang Xu, Lijian Zhang
Abstract: Linear optical networks (LONs) with multi-photon inputs offer a powerful platform for advanced quantum technologies. However, the number of degrees of freedom of a LON is far fewer than the dimensionality of the multi-photon multi-mode Fock space, therefore it cannot implement arbitrary unitary evolutions on multi-photon states. Understanding these intrinsic constraints is essential for the preparation, manipulation, and measurement of multi-photon states with LONs. Although several properties of the multi-photon state have been shown to be invariant under LON unitary evolution, their physical interpretation remains elusive. Here, we introduce a Hermitian transfer matrix approach to explore the multi-photon evolution, revealing that the overall state purity decomposes into three distinct invariants -- each arising from either single-photon dynamics or the multi-photon interference. We experimentally observe these purity-like invariants by preparing distinct initial states, applying LON unitaries, and measuring the resulting invariants. Our results not only confirm their conservation but also provide valuable insights into multi-photon state evolution in linear optics.

Title: Cascaded quantum time transfer breaking the no-cloning barrier with entanglement relay architecture
Authors: H. Hong, X. Xiang, R. Quan, B. Shi, Y. Liu, Z. Xia, T. Liu, X. Li, M. Cao, S. Zhang, K. Guo, R. Dong
Abstract: Quantum two-way time transfer (Q-TWTT) leveraging energy-time entangled biphotons has achieved sub-picosecond stability but faces fundamental distance limitations due to the no-cloning theorem's restriction on quantum amplification. To overcome this challenge, we propose a cascaded Q-TWTT architecture employing relay stations that generate and distribute new energy-time entangled biphotons after each transmission segment. Theoretical modeling reveals sublinear standard deviation growth (merely N increase for N equidistant segments), enabling preservation of sub-picosecond stability over extended distances. We experimentally validate this approach using a three-station cascaded configuration over 200 km fiber segments, demonstrating strong agreement with theory. Utilizing independent Rb clocks at end and relay stations with online frequency skew correction, we achieve time stabilities of 3.82 ps at 10 s and 0.39 ps at 5120 s. The consistency in long-term stability between cascaded and single-segment configurations confirms high-precision preservation across modular quantum networks. This work establishes a framework for long-distance quantum time transfer that surpasses the no-cloning barrier, providing a foundation for future quantum-network timing infrastructure.

Title: Quantum Fidelity Estimation in the Resource Theory of Nonstabilizerness
Authors: Zhiping Liu, Kun Wang, Xin Wang
Abstract: Quantum fidelity estimation is essential for benchmarking quantum states and processes on noisy quantum devices. While stabilizer operations form the foundation of fault-tolerant quantum computing, non-stabilizer resources further enable universal quantum computation through state injection. In this work, we propose several efficient fidelity estimation protocols for both quantum states and channels within the resource theory of nonstabilizerness, focusing on qudit systems with odd prime dimensions. Our protocols require measuring only a constant number of phase-space point operator expectation values, with operators selected randomly according to an importance weighting scheme tailored to the target state. Notably, we demonstrate that mathematically defined nonstabilizerness measures--such as Wigner rank and mana--quantify the sample complexity of the proposed protocols, thereby endowing them with a clear operational interpretation in the fidelity estimation task. This connection reveals a fundamental trade-off: while fidelity estimation for general quantum states and channels requires resources that scale exponentially with their nonstabilizerness, the task remains tractable for states and channels that admit efficient classical simulation.

Title: Robust certification of quantum instruments through a sequential communication game
Authors: Pritam Roy, Subhankar Bera, A. S. Majumdar, Shiladitya Mal
Abstract: We propose a communication game in the sequential measurement scenario, involving a sender and two receivers with restricted collaboration among the latter parties. In the framework of the prepare-transform-measure scenario, we find a prominent quantum advantage in the receiver's decoding of the message originally encoded by the sender. We show that an optimal trade-off between the success probabilities of the two receivers enables self-testing of the sender's state preparation, the first receiver's instruments, and the measurement device of the second receiver. Our protocol enables a more robust certification of the unsharp measurement parameter of the first receiver compared to the protocol without collaboration among the receivers. We further generalize our game to higher-dimensional systems, revealing greater quantum advantage with an increase in dimensions.

Title: Acoustic Phonon-Induced Dephasing in Gallium Nitride Defect-Based Quantum Emitters
Authors: Yifei Geng
Abstract: GaN defect based quantum emitters have recently gained attention as promising single photon sources for quantum information applications. However, dephasing processes, manifested as photoluminescence (PL) linewidth broadening, pose a limitation to photon indistinguishability. In this study, we use a custom built confocal scanning microscope to examine the temperature dependent PL spectra of GaN defect quantum emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses, with the goal of elucidating their dephasing mechanisms. Our experimental findings show that at low temperatures, the PL lineshape exhibits a Gaussian profile with a constant, temperature independent linewidth, consistent with spectral diffusion. As the temperature increases, the PL lineshape evolves into a Lorentzian, and the temperature dependent linewidth deviates from the common T3 law. Considering the Debye temperature of GaN (about 600 K), the experimentally observed temperature dependent linewidth can be modeled by the quadratic Stark effect modulated by acoustic phonons in defect rich crystals. Furthermore, this model exhibits a level of accuracy comparable to that of the defect-E2(low) optical phonon coupling model previously reported in the literature. Our work reveals the mechanism of acoustic phonon induced dephasing in GaN defect emitters and demonstrates that both acoustic and optical phonons can contribute to their dephasing.

Title: Quantum Engineering of Qudits with Interpretable Machine Learning
Authors: Yule Mayevsky, Akram Youssry, Ritik Sareen, Gerardo A. Paz-Silva, Alberto Peruzzo
Abstract: Higher-dimensional quantum systems (qudits) offer advantages in information encoding, error resilience, and compact gate implementations, and naturally arise in platforms such as superconducting and solid-state systems. However, realistic conditions such as non-Markovian noise, non-ideal pulses, and beyond rotating wave approximation (RWA) dynamics, pose significant challenges for controlling and characterizing qudits. In this work, we present a machine-learning-based graybox framework for the control and noise characterization of qudits with arbitrary dimension, extending recent methods developed for single-qubit systems. Additionally, we introduce a local analytic expansion that enables interpretable modelling of the noise dynamics, providing a structured and efficient way to simulate system behaviour and compare different noise models. This interpretability feature allows us to to understand the mechanisms underlying successful control strategies; and opens the way for developing methods for distinguishing noise sources with similar effects. We demonstrate high-fidelity implementations of both global unitary operations as well as two-level subspace gates. Our work establishes a foundation for scalable and interpretable quantum control techniques applicable to both NISQ devices and finite-dimensional quantum systems, enhancing the performance of next-generation quantum technologies.

Title: Testing the quantum nature of gravity through interferometry
Authors: Yubao Liu, Yanbei Chen, Kentaro Somiya, Yiqiu Ma
Abstract: We propose a Michelson-type interferometric protocol for testing the quantum nature of gravity through testing the phenomenology of semi-classical gravity theory, which predicts a state-dependent Schrodinger-Newton (SN) evolution of the test mass. The protocol's feature lies in utilizing the asymmetry of two interferometric arms induced by SN self-gravity to create cross-talk between the common and differential motion of the test masses. This cross-talk is imprinted as a clean binary signature in the correlation measurements of the interferometer's output light fields. Our results demonstrate that, when assisted by 10 dB squeezed input states, 3 hours of aggregated measurement data can provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to conclusively test the SN theory in 1 Kelvin environment. This shows the strong feasibility of using such interferometric protocols to test if gravity operates quantum-mechanically.

Abstract: We examine the implications of quantum foundations for AGI, focusing on how seminal results such as Bell's theorems (non-locality), the Kochen-Specker theorem (contextuality) and no-cloning theorem problematise practical implementation of AGI in quantum settings. We introduce a novel information-theoretic taxonomy distinguishing between classical AGI and quantum AGI and show how quantum mechanics affects fundamental features of agency. We show how quantum ontology may change AGI capabilities, both via affording computational advantages and via imposing novel constraints.

Title: Quantum Recurrent Embedding Neural Network
Authors: Mingrui Jing, Erdong Huang, Xiao Shi, Shengyu Zhang, Xin Wang
Abstract: Quantum neural networks have emerged as promising quantum machine learning models, leveraging the properties of quantum systems and classical optimization to solve complex problems in physics and beyond. However, previous studies have demonstrated inevitable trainability issues that severely limit their capabilities in the large-scale regime. In this work, we propose a quantum recurrent embedding neural network (QRENN) inspired by fast-track information pathways in ResNet and general quantum circuit architectures in quantum information theory. By employing dynamical Lie algebras, we provide a rigorous proof of the trainability of QRENN circuits, demonstrating that this deep quantum neural network can avoid barren plateaus. Notably, the general QRENN architecture resists classical simulation as it encompasses powerful quantum circuits such as QSP, QSVT, and DQC1, which are widely believed to be classically intractable. Building on this theoretical foundation, we apply our QRENN to accurately classify quantum Hamiltonians and detect symmetry-protected topological phases, demonstrating its applicability in quantum supervised learning. Our results highlight the power of recurrent data embedding in quantum neural networks and the potential for scalable quantum supervised learning in predicting physical properties and solving complex problems.

Title: Theory of Stationary Photon Emission from a Steadily Driven Parametric Oscillator Based on the Complex Spectral Analysis of the Heisenberg Equation
Authors: Kazuki Kanki, Satoshi Tanaka
Abstract: We show how the properties of photon emission to a continuous field from a parametric oscillator relate to the behavior of the complex eigenfrequencies of the oscillator. The parametric oscillator has complex eigenfrequencies due to non-Hermiticity with two origins: parametric amplification and dissipation resulting from the loss of photons to a continuous field. In situations where the oscillator is close to the parametric resonance, and the coupling to the driving field is strong enough for a complex eigenfrequency to lie in the upper half of the first Riemann sheet, the number of photons of the parametric oscillator and the continuous field increases exponentially. The parametric amplification is counteracted by dissipation due to the coupling of the parametric oscillator to the continuous field, and if the dissipation is sufficiently strong relative to the amplification, the exponential growth is suppressed. The suppression occurs when the complex eigenfrequency responsible for the exponential growth moves into the second Riemann sheet analytically continued beyond the branch cut of the Green function on the real axis along the continuum of frequency. As a result, there appears a stationary photon emission, where creation of photons balance with dissipation due to emission of the photons to the continuous field. Then there is a constant flux of photons, with the number of photons in the continuous field increasing in proportion to time, while the number of photons in the parametric oscillator remains constant.

Title: Rydberg blockade mechanism through the lens of graph theory: characterization and applications
Authors: Elie Bermot, Lucia Valor, Wesley Coelho, Louis-Paul Henry, Natalie Pearson
Abstract: The Rydberg blockade phenomenon is fundamental to quantum algorithms employing neutral atom devices. By preventing two neighboring atoms from being simultaneously excited, it facilitates the embedding of unit disk graphs. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the Rydberg blockade and its behavior under various drive schemes. We introduce new metrics for graph embedding, specifically the correlation matrix and maximum independence violation, and apply them to facilitate the embedding of disk graphs, a parent class of the unit disk graph class. Furthermore, we address the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on embedded disk graphs and demonstrate that a local drive, informed by local blockade radii, outperforms the globally applied drive commonly used for solving the MIS problem in unit disk graphs.

Title: Scalable Simulation of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics with Or-Represented Quantum Algebra
Authors: Lukas Broers, Rong-Yang Sun, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: High-performance numerical methods are essential not only for advancing quantum many-body physics but also for enabling integration with emerging quantum computing platforms. We present a scalable and general-purpose parallel algorithm for quantum simulations based on or-represented quantum algebra (ORQA). This framework applies to arbitrary spin systems and naturally integrates with quantum circuit simulation in the Heisenberg picture, particularly relevant to recent large-scale experiments on superconducting qubit processors [Kim et al., Nature 618, 500 (2023)]. As a benchmark, we simulate the kicked Ising model on a 127-qubit heavy-hexagon lattice, tracking the time evolution of local magnetization using up to one trillion Pauli strings. Executed on the supercomputer Fugaku, our simulations exhibit strong scaling up to $2^{17}$ parallel processes with near-linear communication overhead. These results establish ORQA as a practical and high-performance tool for quantum many-body dynamics, and highlight its potential for integration into hybrid quantum-classical computational frameworks, complementing recent advances in tensor-network and surrogate simulation techniques.

Title: Quantum-Enhanced Simulated Annealing Using Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Seokho Jeong, Juyoung Park, Jaewook Ahn
Abstract: Quantum-classical hybrid algorithms offer a promising strategy for tackling computationally challenging problems, such as the maximum independent set (MIS) problem that plays a crucial role in areas like network design and data analysis. This study experimentally demonstrates that a Rydberg quantum-classical hybrid algorithm, termed as quantum-enhanced simulated annealing (QESA), provides a computational time advantage over standalone simulated annealing (SA), a classical heuristic optimization method. The performance of QESA is evaluated based on the approximation ratio and the Hamming distance, relative to the graph size. The analysis shows that QESA outperforms standalone SA by leveraging a warm-start input derived from two types of Rydberg atomic array experimental data: quench evolution (QE) (implemented on the Quera Aquila machine) and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) (using the experimental dataset archieved in K. Kim et al., Scientific Data 11, 111 (2024). Based on these results, an estimate is provided for the maximum graph size that can be handled within a one-day computational time limit on a standard personal computer. These findings suggest that QESA has the potential to offer a computational advantage over classical methods for solving complex optimization problems efficiently.

Title: Numerical ranges of Bargmann invariants
Authors: Jianwei Xu
Abstract: Bargmann invariants have recently emerged as powerful tools in quantum information theory, with applications ranging from geometric phase characterization to quantum state distinguishability. Despite their widespread use, a complete characterization of their physically realizable values has remained an outstanding challenge. In this work, we provide a rigorous determination of the numerical range of Bargmann invariants for quantum systems of arbitrary finite dimension. We demonstrate that any permissible value of these invariants can be achieved using either (i) pure states exhibiting circular Gram matrix symmetry or (ii) qubit states alone. These results establish fundamental limits on Bargmann invariants in quantum mechanics and provide a solid mathematical foundation for their diverse applications in quantum information processing.

Title: New Paradigm for Integrated sensing and Communication with Rydberg Atomic Receiver
Authors: Minze Chen, Tianqi Mao, Yang Zhao, Wei Xiao, Dezhi Zheng, Zhaocheng Wang, Jun Zhang, Sheng Chen
Abstract: The RYDberg Atomic Receiver (RYDAR) has been demonstrated to surmount the limitation on both the sensitivity and operating bandwidth of the classical electronic counterpart, which can theoretically detect indiscernible electric signals below -174 dBm/Hz with optical measurement through Rydberg-state atoms. Such miracle has established a new quantum-based paradigm for communications and sensing, which motivates a revolution of the transceiver design philosophies to fully unleash the potential of RYDAR towards next-generation networks. Against this background, this article provides a thorough investigation of Rydberg atomic communications and sensing from theory to hardware implementations. Specifically, we highlight the great opportunities from the hybridization between the RYDAR and the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), followed by essential preliminaries of the quantum-based receiver. Then we propose a theoretical framework for broadband ISAC based on RYDAR, demonstrated by the proof-of-concept experiments. Afterwards, the enabling technologies for the ISAC framework are explored ranging from channel characterization, waveform design to array-based receiver configurations, where the open problems are also summarized. Finally, the future applications of RYDAR-based ISAC are envisioned, indicating its significant potential for both civilian and military purposes.

Title: Efficient algorithms for quantum chemistry on modular quantum processors
Authors: Tian Xue, Jacob P. Covey, Matthew Otten
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a promising application of future quantum computers, but the requirements on qubit count and other resources suggest that modular computing architectures will be required. We introduce an implementation of a quantum chemistry algorithm that is distributed across several computational modules: the distributed unitary selective coupled cluster (dUSCC). We design a packing scheme using the pseudo-commutativity of Trotterization to maximize the parallelism while optimizing the scheduling of all inter-module gates around the buffering of inter-module Bell pairs. We demonstrate dUSCC on a 3-cluster (H$_4$)$_3$ chain and show that it naturally utilizes the molecule's structure to reduce inter-module latency. We show that the run time of dUSCC is unchanged with inter-module latency up to $\sim$20$\times$ slower than intra-module gates in the (H$_4$)$_3$ while maintaining chemical accuracy. dUSCC should be "free" in the weakly entangled systems, and the existence of "free" dUSCC can be found efficiently using classical algorithms. This new compilation scheme both leverages pseudo-commutativity and considers inter-module gate scheduling, and potentially provides an efficient distributed compilation of other Trotterized algorithms.

Title: Quantum thermalization mechanism and the emergence of symmetry-breaking phases
Authors: Sebastián Gómez, Ángel L. Corps, Armando Relaño
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis accounting for the emergence of symmetry-breaking phases. It consists of two conditions that any system with a degenerate spectrum must fulfill in order to thermalize. The failure of each of them generates a different non-thermalizing scenario. One is due to the absence of chaos and may indicate that extra constants of motion are required to describe equilibrium states. The other one implies the existence of initial conditions evolving towards symmetry-breaking equilibrium states. If it spreads across an entire spectral region, then this region gives rise to a symmetry-breaking phase. We explore the applicability of this formalism by means of numerical experiments on a three-site Bose-Hubbard model with two non-commuting discrete symmetries.

Title: Excitation-Pulse Intensity Mediated Coherent Control in V-Type Systems
Authors: Rishabh Tripathi, Krishna K. Maurya, Rohan Singh
Abstract: V-type three-level systems, where two excited states share a common ground state, serve as fundamental models for exploring coherent light-matter interactions in a range of quantum systems, from atomic gases to semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, we investigate the coherent evolution of such a system under strong femtosecond-pulse excitation by numerically solving the optical Bloch equations. We demonstrate that the coherent evolution of a three-level system critically depends on the product of the excitation-pulse duration and energy separation between the excited states. Using this understanding, we extend our analysis to simulate two-dimensional coherent spectra in a high-intensity regime. We show that by varying the pulse areas of the excitation pulses, one can selectively turn individual spectral features on or off, corresponding to distinct quantum pathways. Moreover, we can precisely adjust the phase of these peaks, illustrating an advanced level of coherent control within the system. Our approach provides a simple and robust framework for achieving advanced coherent control in multilevel systems.

Title: Entanglement-minimized orbitals enable faster quantum simulation of molecules
Authors: Zhendong Li
Abstract: Quantum computation offers significant potential for accelerating the simulation of molecules and materials through algorithms such as quantum phase estimation (QPE). However, the expected speedup in ground-state energy estimation depends critically on the ability to efficiently prepare an initial state with high overlap with the true ground state. For strongly correlated molecules such as iron-sulfur clusters, this overlap is demonstrated to decay exponentially with system size. To alleviate this problem, we introduce an efficient classical algorithm to find entanglement-minimized orbitals (EMOs) using spin-adapted matrix product states (MPS) with small bond dimensions. The EMO basis yields a more compact ground-state representation, significantly easing initial state preparation for challenging systems. Our algorithm improves initial state overlap by nearly an order of magnitude over prior orbital optimization approaches for an iron-sulfur cluster with four irons, and is scalable to larger systems with many unpaired electrons, including the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase with eight transition metal centers. For these systems, we achieve substantial enhancements on initial state overlap by factors of $O(10^2)$ and $O(10^5)$, respectively, compared to results obtained using localized orbitals. Our results show that initial state preparation for these challenging systems requires far fewer resources than prior estimates suggested.

Title: Exact Quantum Capacity of Decohering Channels in Arbitrary Dimensions
Authors: Shayan Roofeh, Vahid Karimipour
Abstract: We derive an exact analytical expression for the quantum capacity of a broad class of decohering channels of the form $\Lambda(\rho) = (1 - x)\rho + x D(\rho),$ where $D(\rho)$ denotes different forms of decoherence of the density matrix $\rho$. Unlike previous studies restricted to qubit systems or asymptotic bounds, our result holds for arbitrary finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We show that these channels are degradable for all $x$, leading to a closed-form, single-letter capacity formula that does not require regularization. Besides full decoherence, we extend our analysis to block-decohering channels, where decoherence occurs within orthogonal or overlapping subspaces. This family interpolates between identity channels and classical-quantum channels. Our findings clarify the role of coherence in quantum communication and provide rare exact benchmarks in the study of quantum channel capacities.

Title: Cavity Optomechanical Probe of Gravity Between Massive Mechanical Oscillators
Authors: Ziqian Tang, Wenlong Li, Huanying Sun, Xiaoxia Cai, Tiefu Li, Yulong Liu
Abstract: Exploring gravitational interactions between objects with small masses has become increasingly timely. Concurrently, oscillators with masses ranging between milligrams and grams in cavity optomechanical systems sparked interest for probing gravity, and even investigating gravity within macroscopic quantum systems. Here we present a measurement scheme for probing gravity in a microwave optomechanical setup that incorporates periodic gravitational modulation between the test mass and the driven source mass at the milligram scale. Optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) can be utilized to sense the gravitational interactions between test masses and source masses. Specifically, the relative variation in the height of the OMIT peak, expressed as $|1 + re^{i\phi}|^2 - 1$, where $r$ represents the ratio of the amplitude of the gravitational driving force to the radiation pressure force of the probe tone, and $\phi$ denotes their phase difference, can reach up to 2.3\% under plausible experimental conditions.

Title: Nonclassicality of fully degenerate triple-photon states and its application in generating non-Gaussian entanglement
Authors: Da Zhang, Yu Zhang, Juan Gao
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate via numerical modeling that fully degenerate triple-photon states generated by three-mode spontaneous parametric down-conversion can be categorized into four distinct states: 0-phase, $\pi$/2-phase, $\pi$-phase, and 3$\pi$/2-phase squeezed states. Using quantum relative entropy and Wigner negativity as quantitative measures, we show that the nonGaussianity and nonclassicality of these squeezed states increase with the increase of interaction strength. Analogous to Gaussian scenarios, these squeezed states serve as basic building blocks for deterministic preparation of two-mode non-Gaussian states. We study the correlation properties of two-mode state generated by interfering 0-phase and $\pi$-phase squeezed states on a beam splitter, and reveal its entanglement at 3rd and 6th-order moments using the positive partial transposition criterion based on higher-order covariance matrices. In particular, by adjusting the intensities of the two input beams, the entanglement of the two output modes at the 3rd- and 6th-order moments can be dynamically modulated. Our results highlight the nonclassical nature of fully degenerate triple-photon states and establish a pathway for preparing non-Gaussian entanglement based on such states.

Title: Q-AIM: A Unified Portable Workflow for Seamless Integration of Quantum Resources
Authors: Zhaobin Zhu, Cedric Gaberle, Sarah M. Neuwirth, Thomas Lippert, Manpreet S. Jattana
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) holds the potential to solve classically intractable problems. Although there has been significant progress towards the availability of quantum hardware, a software infrastructure to integrate them is still missing. We present Q-AIM (Quantum Access Infrastructure Management) to fill this gap. Q-AIM is a software framework unifying the access and management for quantum hardware in a vendor-independent and open-source fashion. Utilizing a dockerized micro-service architecture, we show Q-AIM's lightweight, portable, and customizable nature, capable of running on different hosting paradigms ranging from small personal computing devices to cloud servers and dedicated server infrastructure. Q-AIM exposes a single entry point into the host's infrastructure, providing secure and easy interaction with quantum computers on different levels of abstraction. With a minimal memory footprint, the container is optimized for deployment on even the smallest server instances, reducing costs and instantiation overhead while ensuring seamless scalability to accommodate increasing demands. Q-AIM intends to equip research groups and facilities purchasing and hosting their own quantum hardware with a tool simplifying the process from procurement to operation and removing non-research related technical redundancies.

Title: Pairing particles into holonomies
Authors: Vera Neef, Matthias Heinrich, Tom A.W. Wolterink, Alexander Szameit
Abstract: Holonomies are of great interest to quantum computation and simulation. The geometrical nature of these entities offers increased stability to quantum gates. Furthermore, symmetries of particle physics are naturally reflected in holonomies, making them ideally suited for quantum simulation of quantum chromodynamics and grand unified theories. Yet, practically designing quantum holonomies with the required properties and scale is challenging. Here, we construct a new class of holonomies by increasing the particle number. We show that multi-particle holonomies can even exist in systems devoid of any single-particle holonomies. We present a comprehensive framework for multi-particle quantum holonomies and experimentally realize various two-particle holonomies in integrated photonics. Our results enable particle number to be harnessed as a design parameter, offering increased freedom in constructing holonomies for quantum computation and simulation.

Title: A Two-stage Optimization Method for Wide-range Single-electron Quantum Magnetic Sensing
Authors: Shiqian Guo, Jianqing Liu, Thinh Le, Huaiyu Dai
Abstract: Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity, revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond. At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.

Title: Quantum algorithm for solving generalized eigenvalue problems with application to the Schrödinger equation
Authors: Grzegorz Rajchel-Mieldzioć, Szymon Pliś, Emil Zak
Abstract: Accurate computation of multiple eigenvalues of quantum Hamiltonians is essential in quantum chemistry, materials science, and molecular spectroscopy. Estimating excited-state energies is challenging for classical algorithms due to exponential scaling with system size, posing an even harder problem than ground-state calculations. We present a quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues and singular values of parameterized matrix families, including solving generalized eigenvalue problems that frequently arise in quantum simulations. Our method uses quantum amplitude amplification and phase estimation to identify matrix eigenvalues by locating minima in the singular value spectrum. We demonstrate our algorithm by proposing a quantum-computing formulation of the pseudospectral collocation method for the Schrödinger equation. We estimate fault-tolerant quantum resource requirements for the quantum collocation method, showing favorable scaling in the size of the problem $N$ (up to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{N})$) compared to classical implementations with $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, for certain well-behaved potentials. Additionally, unlike the standard collocation method, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem requiring matrix inversion, our algorithm circumvents the associated numerical instability by scanning a parameterized matrix family and detecting eigenvalues through singular value minimization. This approach is particularly effective when multiple eigenvalues are needed or when the generalized eigenvalue problem involves a high condition number. In the fault-tolerant era, our method may thus be useful for simulating high-dimensional molecular systems with dense spectra involving highly excited states, such as those encountered in molecular photodynamics or quasi-continuum regimes in many-body and solid-state systems.

Title: High-expressibility Quantum Neural Networks using only classical resources
Authors: Marco Maronese, Francesco Ferrari, Matteo Vandelli, Daniele Dragoni
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs), as currently formulated, are near-term quantum machine learning architectures that leverage parameterized quantum circuits with the aim of improving upon the performance of their classical counterparts. In this work, we show that some desired properties attributed to these models can be efficiently reproduced without necessarily resorting to quantum hardware. We indeed study the expressibility of parametrized quantum circuit commonly used in QNN applications and contrast it to those of two classes of states that can be efficiently simulated classically: matrix-product states (MPS), and Clifford-enhanced MPS (CMPS), obtained by applying a set of Clifford gates to MPS. In addition to expressibility, we assess the level of primary quantum resources, entanglement and non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. "magic"), in random ensembles of such quantum states, tracking their convergence to the Haar distribution. While MPS require a large number of parameters to reproduce an arbitrary quantum state, we find that CMPS approach the Haar distribution more rapidly, in terms of both entanglement and magic. Our results indicate that high expressibility in QNNs is attainable with purely classical resources.

Title: Blocklet concatenation: Low-overhead fault-tolerant protocols for fusion-based quantum computation
Authors: Daniel Litinski
Abstract: We introduce a construction for protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computing based on code concatenation and transversal gates. These protocols can be interpreted as families of quantum circuits of low-weight stabilizer measurements without strict locality constraints, effectively implementing concatenated codes. However, we primarily study these protocols in the context of photonic fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC), where they yield families of fusion networks with constant-sized resource states. Their high erasure thresholds relative to their resource-state cost establish them as promising candidates to replace surface codes in the context of FBQC. Examples include protocol families using 8-, 10- and 12-qubit resource states, with erasure thresholds of 13.8%, 19.1% and 11.5%, and footprint-per-logical-qubit scaling as $\mathcal{O}(d)$, $\mathcal{O}(d^{1.46})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{0.58})$, respectively, where $d$ is the code distance. We also present techniques for performing logical operations, decoding, and implementing the protocols in photonic hardware. Although we focus on photonic FBQC, these ideas may also be of interest in other settings.

Title: High-fidelity entanglement and coherent multi-qubit mapping in an atom array
Authors: Aruku Senoo, Alexander Baumgärtner, Joanna W. Lis, Gaurav M. Vaidya, Zhongda Zeng, Giuliano Giudici, Hannes Pichler, Adam M. Kaufman
Abstract: Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits as well as enhanced GHZ state fidelities in analog preparation. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.

Title: Towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with universal continuous-variable gates
Authors: Sheron Blair, Francesco Arzani, Giulia Ferrini, Alessandro Ferraro
Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) systems have shown remarkable potential for quantum computation, particularly excelling in scalability and error correction through bosonic encoding. Within this framework, the foundational notion of computational universality was introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1784 (1999)], and has proven especially successful since it allows for the identification of finite sets of universal CV gates independent of the encoding scheme. However, achieving the critical objective of fault-tolerant computation requires some form of encoding, and to date there has been no proof that these universal CV gates can lead to encoded fault tolerance. We present compelling evidence in this direction by utilizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. Specifically, we numerically optimize the generation of GKP states from vacua using circuits comprised solely of universal CV gates. We demonstrate that these states can be attained with sufficient quality to exhibit error probabilities lower than the threshold needed to achieve a fault-tolerant memory via concatenated GKP-stabilizer codes.

Title: Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements
Authors: Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.

Title: Leveraging erasure errors in logical qubits with metastable $^{171}$Yb atoms
Authors: Bichen Zhang, Genyue Liu, Guillaume Bornet, Sebastian P. Horvath, Pai Peng, Shuo Ma, Shilin Huang, Shruti Puri, Jeff D. Thompson
Abstract: Implementing large-scale quantum algorithms with practical advantage will require fault-tolerance achieved through quantum error correction, but the associated overhead is a significant cost. The overhead can be reduced by engineering physical qubits with fewer errors, and by shaping the residual errors to be more easily correctable. In this work, we demonstrate quantum error correcting codes and logical qubit circuits in a metastable ${}^{171}$Yb qubit with a noise bias towards erasure errors, that is, errors whose location can be detected separate from any syndrome information. We show that dephasing errors on the nuclear spin qubit during coherent transport can be strongly suppressed, and implement robust entangling gates that maintain a high fidelity in the presence of gate beam inhomogeneity or pointing error. We demonstrate logical qubit encoding in the $[[4,2,2]]$ code, with error correction during decoding based on mid-circuit erasure measurements despite the fact that the code is too small to correct any Pauli errors. Finally, we demonstrate logical qubit teleportation between multiple code blocks with conditionally selected ancillas based on mid-circuit erasure checks, which is a key ingredient for leakage-robust error correction with neutral atoms.

Title: Numerical Derivatives, Projection Coefficients, and Truncation Errors in Analytic Hilbert Space With Gaussian Measure
Authors: M. W. AlMasri
Abstract: We introduce the projection coefficients algorithm, a novel method for determining the leading terms of the Taylor series expansion of a given holomorphic function from a graph perspective, while also analyzing the associated truncation errors. Let $ f(z) $ be a holomorphic function, and let $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denote the inner product defined over an analytic Hilbert space equipped with a Gaussian measure. The derivatives $ f^{(n)}(z) $ at a point $ z_0 $ can be computed theoretically by evaluating an inner product of the form $ f^{(n)}(z_0) = \frac{\langle z^n, f(z) \rangle}{C}, $ where $ C $ is a normalization constant. Specifically, in the Bargmann space (the analytic Hilbert space with a Gaussian weight and orthogonal monomials), this constant is $ \pi $. This result assumes that $ f(z) $ is a holomorphic function of a single complex variable. The accuracy of the computed derivative values depends on the precision and reliability of the numerical routines used to evaluate these inner products. The projection coefficients offer valuable insights into certain properties of analytic functions, such as whether they are odd or even, and whether the $ n $-th derivatives exist at a given point $ z_0 $. Due to its relevance to quantum theory, our approach establishes a correspondence between quantum circuits derived from quantum systems and the theory of analytic functions. This study lays the groundwork for further applications in numerical analysis and approximation theory within Hilbert spaces equipped with Gaussian measures. Additionally, it holds potential for advancing fields such as quantum computing, reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods -- which are widely used in support vector machines (SVM) and other areas of machine learning -- and probabilistic numerics.

Title: Quantum quenches with long range interactions
Authors: Marianna Sorba, Nicolò Defenu, Gesualdo Delfino
Abstract: We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.

Title: Ultrafast dynamics of quantum matter driven by time-energy entangled photons
Authors: Giovanni Citeroni, Marco Polini, Michael Dapolito, D. N. Basov, Giacomo Mazza
Abstract: We study the dynamics of quantum matter interacting with time-energy entangled photons. We consider the stimulation of a collective mode of a two-dimensional material by means of one of the two partners of a time-energy entangled pair of photons. Using an exactly solvable model, we analyze the out-of-equilibrium properties of both light and matter degrees of freedom, and show how entanglement in the incident photons deeply modifies relevant time scales of the light-matter interaction process. We find that entanglement strongly suppresses the delay between the transmission and absorption events, which become synchronous in the limit of strongly entangled wave packets. By comparing numerical simulations with analytic modeling, we trace back this behavior to the representation of entangled wave packets in terms of a superposition of multiple train pulses containing an increasing number of ultrashort non-entangled packets. As a result, we show that the entangled driving allows the creation of a matter excitation on a time scale shorter than the temporal width of the pulse. Eventually, by analyzing temporal correlations of the excited matter degrees of freedom, we show that driving with entangled photons imprints characteristic temporal correlations of time-energy entangled modes in the matter degree of freedom.

Title: Discrimination of metric theories
Authors: F. J. Lobo, M. Rivera-Tapia, G. Rubilar, O. Jiménez, A. Delgado
Abstract: We study the possibility of discriminating between metric theories within the Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism. In this approach, the two-dimensional quantum state of a massive quantum clock becomes, after propagating at low speed and in a weak gravitational field, a function of the post-Newtonian parameters and thus a signature of a metric theory. To discriminate among metric theories, we resort to quantum-state discrimination strategies such as minimum error and unambiguous state discrimination. In particular, we show that it is possible to refute the hypothesis that a particular metric theory describes spacetime with a single detection event and that it is possible to discriminate with certainty between two different metrics, also with a single detection event. In general, the success probability of the discrimination strategy is a harmonic function of the product of the difference of the proper time corresponding to each quantum clock state, the energy difference between the energy eigenstates of the quantum clock, the propagation length, and speed. It is thus possible to find suitable length and speed scales such that the success probability is close to one by selecting a quantum system with the highest energy difference and the largest natural lifetime. According to this, atomic nuclei such as thorium are considered the most suitable quantum clocks.

Authors: Hamed Amini, Nina H. Amini, Sofiane Chalal, Gaoyue Guo
Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on a class of dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system of equations, study its well-posedness, and establish a propagation of chaos result for multiple bosonic systems with blockwise interactions. We then discuss applications to quantum graphon games and quantum state preparation.

Title: Multi-state detection and spatial addressing in a microscope for ultracold molecules
Authors: Jonathan M. Mortlock, Adarsh P. Raghuram, Benjamin P. Maddox, Philip D. Gregory, Simon L. Cornish
Abstract: Precise measurement of the particle number, spatial distribution and internal state is fundamental to all proposed experiments with ultracold molecules both in bulk gases and optical lattices. Here, we demonstrate in-situ detection of individual molecules in a bulk sample of 87Rb133Cs molecules. Extending techniques from atomic quantum gas microscopy, we pin the molecules in a deep two-dimensional optical lattice and, following dissociation, collect fluorescence from the constituent atoms using a high-numerical-aperture objective. This enables detection of individual molecules up to the resolution of the sub-micron lattice spacing. Our approach provides direct access to the density distribution of small samples of molecules, allowing us to obtain precise measurements of density-dependent collisional losses. Further, by mapping two internal states of the molecule to different atomic species, we demonstrate simultaneous detection of the position and rotational state of individual molecules. Finally, we implement local addressing of the sample using a focused beam to induce a spatially-dependent light shift on the rotational transitions of the molecules.

Title: Learning Best Paths in Quantum Networks
Authors: Xuchuang Wang, Maoli Liu, Xutong Liu, Zhuohua Li, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, John C.S. Lui, Don Towsley
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) transmit delicate quantum information across noisy quantum channels. Crucial applications, like quantum key distribution (QKD) and distributed quantum computation (DQC), rely on efficient quantum information transmission. Learning the best path between a pair of end nodes in a QN is key to enhancing such applications. This paper addresses learning the best path in a QN in the online learning setting. We explore two types of feedback: "link-level" and "path-level". Link-level feedback pertains to QNs with advanced quantum switches that enable link-level benchmarking. Path-level feedback, on the other hand, is associated with basic quantum switches that permit only path-level benchmarking. We introduce two online learning algorithms, BeQuP-Link and BeQuP-Path, to identify the best path using link-level and path-level feedback, respectively. To learn the best path, BeQuP-Link benchmarks the critical links dynamically, while BeQuP-Path relies on a subroutine, transferring path-level observations to estimate link-level parameters in a batch manner. We analyze the quantum resource complexity of these algorithms and demonstrate that both can efficiently and, with high probability, determine the best path. Finally, we perform NetSquid-based simulations and validate that both algorithms accurately and efficiently identify the best path.

Title: Defect-Mediated Pairing and Dissociation of Strongly Correlated Electrons in Low Dimensional Lattices: The Quantum Taxi Effect
Authors: Vincent Pouthier, Saad Yalouz
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a strongly correlated electron pair in a one-dimensional lattice, focusing on the occurrence of local dissociation/pairing mechanisms induced by a site energy defect. To this end, we simulate the time evolution of two interacting electrons on a finite-size chain governed by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian including on-site Coulomb repulsion $ U $ and nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, along with single-electron hopping $J$. By introducing a local site energy defect with amplitude $ \Delta $, we show that a transition between spatially paired/dissociated electrons can occur in the vicinity of this site. Such mechanisms arise in a strongly correlated regime with non-zero nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions and under the conditions $ (U \sim V \sim \Delta) \gg J$. To rationalize these phenomena, we reformulate the two-electron dynamics of the original Hubbard chain as an effective single-particle problem on a two-dimensional network. Within this framework, we show that the pairing/dissociation dynamics are driven by resonances between two distinct families of two-electron eigenstates: $(i)$ states with two spatially well-separated electrons with one located at the site defect, and $(ii)$ states with locally bound electron located away from the defect. At resonance, these states hybridize, allowing transitions from locally paired to dissociated electrons (and vice versa) in the vicinity of the defect. These results provide new insights into exotic pairing phenomena in strongly correlated electronic systems and may have implications for the design of tunable many-body states in low-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Statistical Description of Fermi System over a Surface in a Uniform External Field
Authors: Yu.M. Poluektov, A.A. Soroka
Abstract: A statistical approach to the description of the thermodynamic properties of the Fermi particle system occupying a half-space over a plane of finite size in a uniform external field is proposed. The number of particles per unit area is assumed to be arbitrary, in particular, small. General formulas are obtained for entropy, energy, thermodynamic potential, heat capacities under various conditions and the distribution of the particle number density over the surface. In the continuum limit of a large surface area, the temperature dependences of heat capacities and density distribution are calculated. The cases of gravitational and electric fields are considered.

Title: The Software Landscape for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group
Authors: Per Sehlstedt, Jan Brandejs, Paolo Bientinesi, Lars Karlsson
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.

Title: Thermal Fisher information for a rotating BTZ black hole
Authors: Everett A. Patterson, Robert B. Mann
Abstract: Relativistic quantum metrology provides a framework within which we can quantify the quality of measurement and estimation procedures while accounting for both quantum and relativistic effects. The chief measure for describing such procedures is the Fisher information, which quantifies how sensitive a given estimation is to a variance of some underlying parameter. Recently, the Fisher information has been used to quantify the spacetime information accessible to two-level quantum particle detectors. We have previously shown that such a system is capable of discerning black hole mass for static black holes in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we extend these results to the astrophysically interesting case of rotating black holes and show that the Fisher information is also sensitive to the rotation of a black hole.

Title: Energy as a Primitive Ontology for the Physical World
Authors: J.E. Horvath, B.B. Martins
Abstract: We reanalyze from a modern perspective the bold idea of G. Helm, W. Ostwald, P. Duhem and others that energy is the fundamental entity composing the physical world. We start from a broad perspective reminding the search for a fundamental ``substance'' (perhaps better referred to as ous\'ıa, the original Greek word) from the pre-Socratics to the important debate between Ostwald and Boltzmann about the energy vs. atoms at the end of the 19th century. While atoms were eventually accepted (even by Ostwald himself), the emergence of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity were crucial to suggest that the dismissal of energy in favor of atoms was perhaps premature, and should be revisited. We discuss how the so-called primitive ontology programme can be implemented with energy as the fundamental entity, and why fields (and their quanta, particles) should rather be considered as non-fundamental. We sketch some of the difficulties introduced by the attempt to include gravitation in the general scheme.

Title: Operators of Dirac's theory with mass and axial chemical potential
Authors: Ion I. Cotaescu
Abstract: The Dirac equation with mass and axial chemical potential is solved analytically obtaining the mode spinors and corresponding projection operators giving the spectral representations of the principal conserved operators. In this framework, the odd partner of the Pryce spin operator is defined for the first time showing how these operators may be combined for defining the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators of Dirac's theory of massive fermions either in the free case or in the presence of the axial chemical potential. The quantization procedure is applied in both these cases obtaining two distinct operator algebras in which the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators take canonical forms. In this approach statistical operators with independent particle and antiparticle vortical chemical potentials may be constructed.

Title: Studying Maximal Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider
Authors: Wei Qi, Zijing Guo, Bo-Wen Xiao
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to test quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). By computing the spin correlations in quark-antiquark pairs produced via photon-gluon fusion, we find that longitudinally polarized photons produce maximal entanglement at leading order, while transversely polarized photons generate significant entanglement near the threshold and in the ultra-relativistic regime. Compared to hadron colliders, the EIC provides a cleaner experimental environment for measuring entanglement through the $\gamma^\ast g \to q\bar{q}$ channel, offering a strong signal and a promising avenue to verify Bell nonlocality. This study extends entanglement measurements to the EIC, presenting new opportunities to explore the interplay of quantum information phenomena and hadronic physics in the EIC era.

Title: Newton optimization for the Multiconfiguration Self Consistent Field method at the basis set limit: closed-shell two-electron systems
Authors: Evgueni Dinvay, Rasmus Vikhamar-Sandberg, Luca Frediani
Abstract: The multiconfiguration self-consistent-field (MCSCF) method is revisited with the specific focus on the two electron systems for simplicity. A wave function is represented as a linear combination of Slater determinants. Both orbitals and coefficients of this configuration interaction expansion are optimized following the variational principle making use of the Newton optimization technique. It reduces the MCSCF problem to solving a particular differential Newton system, which can be discretized with multiwavelets and solved iteratively.

Title: Multi-parameter isospectral Fokker-Planck equations
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.

Title: Fragmentation of a trapped multiple-species bosonic mixture
Authors: O. E. Alon, L. S. Cederbaum
Abstract: We consider a multiple-species mixture of interacting bosons, $N_1$ bosons of mass $m_1$, $N_2$ bosons of mass $m_2$, and $N_3$ bosons of mass $m_3$ in a harmonic trap of frequency $\omega$. The corresponding intraspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{11}$, $\lambda_{22}$, and $\lambda_{33}$, and the interspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{12}$, $\lambda_{13}$, and $\lambda_{23}$. When the shape of all interactions are harmonic, this is the generic multiple-species harmonic-interaction model which is exactly solvable. We start by solving the many-particle Hamiltonian and concisely discussing the ground-state wavefunction and energy in explicit forms as functions of all parameters, the masses, numbers of particles, and the intraspecies and interspecies interaction strengths. We then move to compute explicitly the reduced one-particle density matrices for all the species and diagonalize them, thus generalizing the treatment in [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 161}, 184307 (2024)]. The respective eigenvalues determine the degree of fragmentation of each species. As applications, we focus on aspects that do not appear for the respective single-species and two-species systems. For instance, placing a mixture of two kinds of bosons in a bath made by a third kind, and controlling the fragmentation of the former by coupling to the latter. Another example exploits the possibility of different connectivities (i.e., which species interacts with which species) in the mixture, and demonstrates how the fragmentation of species $3$ can be manipulated by the interaction between species $1$ and species $2$, when species $3$ and $1$ do not interact with each other. We thereby highlight properties of fragmentation that only appear in the multiple-species mixture. Further applications are briefly discussed.

Title: The impact of parameter spread of high-temperature superconducting Josephson junctions on the performance of quantum-based voltage standards
Authors: Guanghong Wen, Yi Zhu, Yingxiang Zheng, Shuhe Cui, Ji Wang, Yanyun Ren, Hao Li, Guofeng Zhang, Lixing You
Abstract: Quantum metrology based on Josephson junction array reproduces the most accurate desired voltage by far, therefore being introduced to provide voltage standards worldwide. In this work, we quantitatively analyzed the dependence of the first Shapiro step height of the junction array at 50 GHz on the parameter spread of 10,000 Josephson junctions by numerical simulation with resistively shunted junction model. The results indicate an upper limit spread of the critical current and resistance of the Josephson junctions. Specifically, to keep the maximum first Shapiro step above 0.88 mA, the critical current standard deviation, $\sigma$, should not exceed 25%, and for it to stay above 0.6 mA, the resistance standard deviation should not exceed 1.5%.

Title: Diagnosing 2D symmetry protected topological states via mixed state anomaly
Authors: Chao Xu, Yunlong Zang, Yixin Ma, Yingfei Gu, Shenghan Jiang
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are short-range entangled quantum states characterized by anomalous edge behavior, a manifestation of the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological phases. Moreover, the Li-Haldane conjecture posits that the entanglement spectrum exhibits the same anomaly as the physical edge spectrum, thereby serving as an entanglement-based fingerprint for identifying topological phases. In this work, we extend the entanglement-based diagnostic tools by demonstrating that the edge anomaly is manifested not only in the entanglement spectrum but also in the reduced density matrix itself, a phenomenon we refer to as the mixed state anomaly. Focusing on the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase, we show that this anomaly is subtly encoded in symmetry-twisted mixed states, leading to a topological contribution to the disorder parameter beyond the area law, as well as a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking type long-range order when time reversal symmetry is present.

Title: Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles
Authors: L. Ruks, J. Ruostekoski
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been shown to achieve exceptional performance for computer vision tasks like image recognition, segmentation, and reconstruction or denoising. Here, we evaluate the ultimate performance limits of deep convolutional neural network models for image reconstruction, by comparing them against the standard quantum limit set by shot-noise and the Heisenberg limit on precision. We train U-Net models on images of natural objects illuminated with coherent states of light, and find that the average mean-squared error of the reconstructions can surpass the standard quantum limit, and in some cases reaches the Heisenberg limit. Further, we train models on well-parameterized images for which we can calculate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound to determine the minimum possible measurable variance of an estimated parameter for a given probe state. We find the mean-squared error of the model predictions reaches these bounds calculated for the parameters, across a variety of parameterized images. These results suggest that deep convolutional neural networks can learn to become the optimal estimators allowed by the laws of physics, performing parameter estimation and image reconstruction at the ultimate possible limits of precision for the case of classical illumination of the object.

Title: Series of molecular-like doubly excited states of a quasi-three-body Coulomb system
Authors: Matthieu Génévriez, Maxence Jungers, Christian Rosen, Ulrich Eichmann
Abstract: We investigated resonant multiphoton excitation of high-angular-momentum planetary states of the strontium atom, a quasi-three-body Coulomb system, both experimentally and theoretically. A series of highly doubly excited electronic states converging to the double ionization threshold was identified and reproduced by first-principles calculations, which provided access to the two-electron wavefunctions of the resonances. In these states, the outer electron is dynamically localized at large distances by pendulum-like oscillations of the inner electron across the nucleus. A complementary simple molecular-like adiabatic model offers a clear interpretation of the correlated two-electron motion and suggests that the series is a general feature of highly doubly excited states of atoms and molecules.

Title: A note on Hall conductance and Hall conductivity in interacting Fermion systems
Authors: Stefan Teufel, Marius Wesle
Abstract: In this note we consider lattice fermions on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with a gapped ground state and show how to apply the NEASS approach to linear response to derive the formula for the Hall conductance in terms of an expectation of a commutator of modified step functions. This formula is usually derived by a charge pumping argument going back to Laughlin. Here we show that it can also be obtained as the linear response coefficient of the microscopic current response to an adiabatic increase of the chemical potential on a half plane. We discuss the connection with the double commutator formula with modified position operators for the Hall conductivity derived in arXiv:2411.06967 as the linear response coefficient of the macroscopic current response to the adiabatic application of a constant electric field.

Title: Observation of many-body coherence in quasi-one-dimensional attractive Bose gases
Authors: Hikaru Tamura, Sambit Banerjee, Rongjie Li, Panayotis Kevrekidis, Simeon I. Mistakidis, Chen-Lung Hung
Abstract: Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.

Title: POPQC: Parallel Optimization for Quantum Circuits (Extended Version)
Authors: Pengyu Liu, Jatin Arora, Mingkuan Xu, Umut A. Acar
Abstract: Optimization of quantum programs or circuits is a fundamental problem in quantum computing and remains a major challenge. State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimizers rely on heuristics and typically require superlinear, and even exponential, time. Recent work proposed a new approach that pursues a weaker form of optimality called local optimality. Parameterized by a natural number $\Omega$, local optimality insists that each and every $\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to an external optimizer, called the oracle. Local optimization can be performed using only a linear number of calls to the oracle but still incurs quadratic computational overheads in addition to oracle calls. Perhaps most importantly, the algorithm is sequential. In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for local optimization of quantum circuits. To ensure efficiency, the algorithm operates by keeping a set of fingers into the circuit and maintains the invariant that a $\Omega$-deep circuit needs to be optimized only if it contains a finger. Operating in rounds, the algorithm selects a set of fingers, optimizes in parallel the segments containing the fingers, and updates the finger set to ensure the invariant. For constant $\Omega$, we prove that the algorithm requires $O(n\lg{n})$ work and $O(r\lg{n})$ span, where $n$ is the circuit size and $r$ is the number of rounds. We prove that the optimized circuit returned by the algorithm is locally optimal in the sense that any $\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to the oracle.

Title: Compact representation and long-time extrapolation of real-time data for quantum systems
Authors: Andre Erpenbeck, Yuanran Zhu, Yang Yu, Lei Zhang, Richard Gerum, Olga Goulko, Chao Yang, Guy Cohen, Emanuel Gull
Abstract: Representing real-time data as a sum of complex exponentials provides a compact form that enables both denoising and extrapolation. As a fully data-driven method, the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm is agnostic to the underlying physical equations, making it broadly applicable to various observables and experimental or numerical setups. In this work, we consider applications of the ESPRIT algorithm primarily to extend real-time dynamical data from simulations of quantum systems. We evaluate ESPRIT's performance in the presence of noise and compare it to other extrapolation methods. We demonstrate its ability to extract information from short-time dynamics to reliably predict long-time behavior and determine the minimum time interval required for accurate results. We discuss how this insight can be leveraged in numerical methods that propagate quantum systems in time, and show how ESPRIT can predict infinite-time values of dynamical observables, offering a purely data-driven approach to characterizing quantum phases.

Title: Improved Quantum Query Upper Bounds Based on Classical Decision Trees
Authors: Arjan Cornelissen, Nikhil S. Mande, Subhasree Patro
Abstract: Given a classical query algorithm as a decision tree, when does there exist a quantum query algorithm with a speed-up over the classical one? We provide a general construction based on the structure of the underlying decision tree, and prove that this can give us an up-to-quadratic quantum speed-up. In particular, we obtain a bounded-error quantum query algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{s})$ to compute a Boolean function (more generally, a relation) that can be computed by a classical (even randomized) decision tree of size $s$. Lin and Lin [ToC'16] and Beigi and Taghavi [Quantum'20] showed results of a similar flavor, and gave upper bounds in terms of a quantity which we call the "guessing complexity" of a decision tree. We identify that the guessing complexity of a decision tree equals its rank, a notion introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Inf. Comp.'89] in the context of learning theory. This answers a question posed by Lin and Lin, who asked whether the guessing complexity of a decision tree is related to any complexity-theoretic measure. We also show a polynomial separation between rank and randomized rank for the complete binary AND-OR tree. Beigi and Taghavi constructed span programs and dual adversary solutions for Boolean functions given classical decision trees computing them and an assignment of non-negative weights to its edges. We explore the effect of changing these weights on the resulting span program complexity and objective value of the dual adversary bound, and capture the best possible weighting scheme by an optimization program. We exhibit a solution to this program and argue its optimality from first principles. We also exhibit decision trees for which our bounds are asymptotically stronger than those of Lin and Lin, and Beigi and Taghavi. This answers a question of Beigi and Taghavi, who asked whether different weighting schemes could yield better upper bounds.

Title: Estimating the Jones polynomial for Ising anyons on noisy quantum computers
Authors: Chris N. Self, Sofyan Iblisdir, Gavin K. Brennen, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis
Abstract: The evaluation of the Jones polynomial at roots of unity is a paradigmatic problem for quantum computers. In this work we present experimental results obtained from existing noisy quantum computers for special cases of this problem, where it is classically tractable. Our approach relies on the reduction of the problem of evaluating the Jones polynomial of a knot at lattice roots of unity to the problem of computing quantum amplitudes of qudit stabiliser circuits, which are classically efficiently simulatable. More specifically, we focus on evaluation at the fourth root of unity, which is a lattice root of unity, where the problem reduces to evaluating amplitudes of qubit stabiliser circuits. To estimate the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes up to additive error we use the Hadamard test, yielding non-Clifford circuits that nevertheless we can always efficiently compute the correct output of. Hence, we further argue that this setup defines a standard benchmark for near-term noisy quantum processors. Additionally, we study the benefit of performing quantum error mitigation with the method of zero noise extrapolation.

Title: Resilient superconducting-element design with genetic algorithms
Authors: F. A. Cárdenas-López, J. C. Retamal, Xi Chen, G. Romero, M. Sanz
Abstract: We present superconducting quantum circuits which exhibit atomic energy spectrum and selection rules as ladder and lambda three-level configurations designed by means of genetic algorithms. These heuristic optimization techniques are employed for adapting the topology and the parameters of a set of electrical circuits to find the suitable architecture matching the required energy levels and relevant transition matrix elements. We analyze the performance of the optimizer on one-dimensional single- and multi-loop circuits to design ladder ($\Xi$) and lambda ($\Lambda$) three-level system with specific transition matrix elements. As expected, attaining both the required energy spectrum and the needed selection rules is challenging for single-loop circuits, but they can be accurately obtained even with just two loops. Additionally, we show that our multi-loop circuits are robust under random fluctuation in their circuital parameters, i.e. under eventual fabrication flaws. Developing an optimization algorithm for automatized circuit quantization opens an avenue to engineering superconducting circuits with specific symmetry to be used as modules within large-scale setups, which may allow us to mitigate the well-known current errors observed in the first generation of quantum processors.

Title: Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Betti Numbers Using Cohomology Approach
Authors: Nhat A. Nghiem, Xianfeng David Gu, Tzu-Chieh Wei
Abstract: Topological data analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale data. An abstract simplicial complex, in principle, can be built from data points, and by using tools from homology, topological features could be identified. Given a simplex, an important feature is called the Betti numbers, which roughly count the number of `holes' in different dimensions. Calculating Betti numbers exactly can be $\#$P-hard, and approximating them can be NP-hard, which rules out the possibility of any generic efficient algorithms and unconditional exponential quantum speedup. Here, we explore the specific setting of a triangulated manifold. In contrast to most known methods to estimate Betti numbers, which rely on homology, we exploit the `dual' approach, namely, cohomology, combining the insight of the Hodge theory and de Rham cohomology. Our proposed algorithm can calculate its $r$-th normalized Betti number $\beta_r/|S_r|$ up to some additive error $\epsilon$ with running time $\mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\log(|S_r^K| |S_{r+1}^K|)}{\epsilon^2} \log (\log |S_r^K|) \big( r\log |S_r^K| \big) \Big)$, where $|S_r|$ is the number of $r$-simplexes in the given complex. For the estimation of $r$-th Betti number $\beta_r$ to a chosen multiplicative accuracy $\epsilon'$, our algorithm has complexity $ \mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\log(|S_r^K| |S_{r+1}^K|)}{\epsilon'^2} \big( \frac{ \Gamma}{\beta_r}\big)^2 (\log |S_r^K|) \log \big( r\log |S_r^K| \big) \Big)$, where $\Gamma \leq |S_r^K|$ can be chosen. A detailed analysis is provided, showing that our cohomology framework can even perform exponentially faster than previous homology methods in several regimes. In particular, our method is most effective when $\beta_r \ll |S_r^K|$, which can offer more flexibility and practicability than existing quantum algorithms that achieve the best performance in the regime $\beta_r \approx |S_r^K|$.

Title: Family of attainable geometric quantum speed limits
Authors: Zi-yi Mai, Zheng Liu, Chang-shui Yu
Abstract: We propose a quantum state distance and develop a family of geometrical quantum speed limits (QSLs) for open and closed systems. The QSL time includes an alternative function by which we derive three QSL times with particularly chosen functions. It indicates that two QSL times are exactly the ones presented in Ref. [1] and [2], respectively, and the third one can provide a unified QSL time for both open and closed systems. The three QSL times are attainable for any given initial state in the sense that there exists a dynamics driving the initial state to evolve along the geodesic. We numerically compare the tightness of the three QSL times, which typically promises a tighter QSL time if optimizing the alternative function.

Title: On the Conditions for a Quantum Violent Relaxation
Authors: Guido Giachetti, Nicolò Defenu
Abstract: In general, classical fully-connected systems are known to undergo violent relaxation. This phenomenon refers to the relaxation of observables to stationary, non-thermal, values on a finite timescale, despite their long-time dynamics being dominated by mean-field effects in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we analyze the ``quantum" violent relaxation by studying the dynamics of generic many-body systems with two-body, all-to-all, interactions in the thermodynamic limit. We show that, in order for violent relaxation to occur very specific conditions on the spectrum of the mean-field effective Hamiltonian have to be met. These conditions are hardly met and ``quantum" violent relaxation is observed rarely with respect to its classical counterpart. Our predictions are validated by the study of a spin model which, depending on the value of the coupling, shows a transition between violent-relaxation and a generic prethermal phase. We also analyze a spin version of the quantum Hamiltonian-Mean-Field model, which is shown not to exhibit violent-relaxation. Finally, we discuss how the violent-relaxation picture emerges back in the classical limit. Our results demonstrate how, even in the mean-field regime, quantum effects have a rather dramatic impact on the dynamics, paving the way to a better understanding of light-matter coupled systems.

Title: An invitation to the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing
Authors: Hao-Chung Cheng, Nilanjana Datta, Nana Liu, Theshani Nuradha, Robert Salzmann, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of QHT, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on QHT, we characterize the sample complexity of binary QHT in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse type II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy, provided that the type II error probability is sufficiently small. We then provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds. The final part of our paper outlines and reviews how sample complexity of QHT is relevant to a broad swathe of research areas and can enhance understanding of many fundamental concepts, including quantum algorithms for simulation and search, quantum learning and classification, and foundations of quantum mechanics. As such, we view our paper as an invitation to researchers coming from different communities to study and contribute to the problem of sample complexity of QHT, and we outline a number of open directions for future research.

Title: Lindblad-like quantum tomography for non-Markovian quantum dynamical maps
Authors: Santiago Varona, Markus Müller, Alejandro Bermudez
Abstract: We introduce Lindblad-like quantum tomography (L$\ell$QT) as a quantum characterization technique of time-correlated noise in quantum information processors. This approach enables the estimation of time-local master equations, including their possible negative decay rates, by maximizing a likelihood function subject to dynamical constraints. We discuss L$\ell$QT for the dephasing dynamics of single qubits in detail, which allows for a neat understanding of the importance of including multiple snapshots of the quantum evolution in the likelihood function, and how these need to be distributed in time depending on the noise characteristics. By a detailed comparative study employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, we assess the accuracy and precision of L$\ell$QT of a dephasing quantum dynamical map that goes beyond the Lindblad limit, focusing on two different microscopic noise models that can be realised in either trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit architectures. We explore the optimization of the distribution of measurement times to minimize the estimation errors, assessing the superiority of each learning scheme conditioned on the degree of non-Markovinity of the noise, and setting the stage for future experimental designs of non-Markovian quantum tomography.

Title: Multivariate Fidelities
Authors: Theshani Nuradha, Hemant K. Mishra, Felix Leditzky, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.

Title: Collectively enhanced ground-state cooling in subwavelength atomic arrays
Authors: Oriol Rubies-Bigorda, Raphael Holzinger, Ana Asenjo-Garcia, Oriol Romero-Isart, Helmut Ritsch, Stefan Ostermann, Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero, Susanne F. Yelin, Cosimo C. Rusconi
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays feature strong light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, resulting in subradiant collective resonances characterized by narrowed linewidths. In this work, we present a sideband cooling scheme for atoms trapped in subwavelength arrays that utilizes these narrow collective resonances. Working in the Lamb-Dicke regime, we derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground-state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.

Title: Measurement-induced phase transition in free bosons
Authors: Kazuki Yokomizo, Yuto Ashida
Abstract: The competition between quantum many-particle dynamics and continuous monitoring can lead to measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). So far, MIPTs have been extensively explored in fermionic or spin systems. To examine the possibility of an MIPT in bosonic systems, we study the entanglement structure in continuously monitored free bosons with long-range couplings. When the measurement is local, we find that no MIPTs occur because the substantial entanglement generated by the long-range coupling overcomes the entanglement destruction due to the measurement. In contrast, we show that the nonlocal measurement can efficiently suppress the entanglement generation, leading to an MIPT where the bipartite entanglement entropy exhibits the subvolume-to-area law phase transition as the measurement strength is increased. Our numerical results indicate that the critical point should be described by a certain conformal field theory, while the transition does not belong to a conventional universality class such as Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless class.

Title: Revising the quantum work fluctuation framework to encompass energy conservation
Authors: Giulia Rubino, Karen V. Hovhannisyan, Paul Skrzypczyk
Abstract: Work is a process-based quantity, and its measurement typically requires interaction with a measuring device multiple times. While classical systems allow for non-invasive and accurate measurements, quantum systems present unique challenges due to the influence of the measuring device on the final value of work. As recent studies have shown, among these challenges is the impossibility of formulating a universal definition of work that respects energy conservation for coherent quantum systems and is compatible with the Jarzynski equality - a fluctuation relation linking the equilibrium free energy difference to the non-equilibrium work. Here we overcome this challenge by introducing a genuinely quantum, positive correction to the Jarzynski equality stemming from imposing energy conservation. When sufficiently large, this correction forces quantum work to violate the second law more often. Moreover, we construct modified two-point measurement (TPM) schemes for work along with circuit implementations for them. These measurement schemes correctly certify energy conservation and remain consistent with our quantum-corrected fluctuation relation.

Title: Quantum interrogation of imperfect absorbers using post-selection
Authors: Muhammad Abdullah Ijaz, Syed Bilal Hyder Shah, Muhammad Sabieh Anwar
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum interrogation measurements using constructive interference and post-selection to achieve single-pass high-efficiency detection for imperfect absorbers. We illustrate that our method works for heralded single-photon and weak attenuated sources. We also study the influence of noise in our experimental implementation and show that post-selection imparts additional robustness to the scheme against noise. We further demonstrate that fringe visibility from post-selection interferometry can be used to quantify the transmittance of the imperfect absorber. An interesting link between the interrogation and weak values of nonunitary operators is also highlighted.

Title: Breakdown of Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions Under Information Loss
Authors: Alessio Paviglianiti, Giovanni Di Fresco, Alessandro Silva, Bernardo Spagnolo, Davide Valenti, Angelo Carollo
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.

Title: Ultrabright Entanglement Based Quantum Key Distribution over a 404 km Optical Fiber

Abstract: Entangled photons are crucial resources for quantum information processing. Here, we present an ultrabright polarization-entangled photon source based on a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide designed for practical quantum communication networks. Using a 780 nm pump laser, the source achieves a pair generation rate of 2.4 $\times 10^{10}$ pairs/s/mW. Remarkably, the entangled photons are bright enough to be detected by a power meter, reaching a power of 17.9 nW under a pump power of 3.2 mW. We demonstrate the practicality of the source by conducting quantum key distribution experiments over long-distance fiber links. Wavelength-division multiplexing was employed to enhance the key generation, and nonlocal dispersion compensation was implemented to ensure precise timing coincidence measurements across a broad spectral range. By utilizing nine pairs of wavelength channels, the system achieved the applicable secure key rates of up to 440.80 bits/s over 200 km with a 62 dB loss and extended the maximum secure key generation distance to 404 km. These results demonstrate the potential of wavelength-multiplexed polarization-entangled photon sources for high-speed, long-distance quantum communication, positioning them as key components for future large-scale quantum networks.

Title: Quantum Register Machine: Efficient Implementation of Quantum Recursive Programs
Authors: Zhicheng Zhang, Mingsheng Ying
Abstract: Quantum recursive programming has been recently introduced for describing sophisticated and complicated quantum algorithms in a compact and elegant way. However, implementation of quantum recursion involves intricate interplay between quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls. In this paper, we aim at resolving this fundamental challenge and develop a series of techniques to efficiently implement quantum recursive programs. Our main contributions include: 1. We propose a notion of quantum register machine, the first quantum architecture (including an instruction set) that provides instruction-level support for quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls at the same time. 2. Based on quantum register machine, we describe the first comprehensive implementation process of quantum recursive programs, including the compilation, the partial evaluation of quantum control flow, and the execution on the quantum register machine. 3. As a bonus, our efficient implementation of quantum recursive programs also offers automatic parallelisation of quantum algorithms. For implementing certain quantum algorithmic subroutine, like the widely used quantum multiplexor, we can even obtain exponential parallel speed-up (over the straightforward implementation) from this automatic parallelisation. This demonstrates that quantum recursive programming can be win-win for both modularity of programs and efficiency of their implementation.

Title: Angular Momentum Entanglement Mediated By General Relativistic Frame Dragging
Authors: Trinidad B. Lantaño, Luciano Petruzziello, Susana F. Huelga, Martin B. Plenio
Abstract: Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction in the Newtonian limit. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering the general relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.

Title: Refining Ky Fan's majorization relation with linear programming
Authors: Mohammad A. Alhejji
Abstract: A separable version of Ky Fan's majorization relation is proven for a sum of two operators that are each a tensor product of two positive semi-definite operators. In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.

Title: Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body systems in continuous space addressed by a tensor network approach
Authors: Rui Hong, Hao-Wei Cui, An-Chun Ji, Shi-Ju Ran
Abstract: Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schrödinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling behaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide strong numerical evidence supporting the efficiency of TN in representing continuous-space quantum wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit and offer an efficient approach to studying entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.

Title: Generalizing the matching decoder for the Chamon code
Authors: Zohar Schwartzman-Nowik, Benjamin J. Brown
Abstract: Different choices of quantum error-correcting codes can reduce the demands on the physical hardware needed to build a quantum computer. To achieve the full potential of a code, we must develop practical decoding algorithms that can correct errors that have occurred with high likelihood. Matching decoders are very good at correcting local errors while also demonstrating fast run times that can keep pace with physical quantum devices. We implement variations of a matching decoder for a three-dimensional, non-CSS, low-density parity check code known as the Chamon code, which has a non-trivial structure that does not lend itself readily to this type of decoding. The non-trivial structure of the syndrome of this code means that we can supplement the decoder with additional steps to improve the threshold error rate, below which the logical failure rate decreases with increasing code distance. We find that a generalized matching decoder that is augmented by a belief-propagation step prior to matching gives a threshold of 10.5% for depolarizing noise.

Title: A Classical Analogue of Entanglement for a Kicked Top
Authors: Bilal Khalid, Sabre Kais
Abstract: It is widely believed that quantum mechanics cannot exhibit chaos, since unitarity of time evolution ensures that distances between quantum states are preserved. However, a parallel argument can be constructed in classical mechanics that would seem to deny the existence of classical chaos too. The argument works by describing classical states as probability distributions in phase space and showing that the inner product between distributions on phase space is preserved under Liouvillian dynamics. Thus, the more faithful classical analogy of a quantum state is not a single phase space trajectory but is instead a phase space distribution, and chaos in such states must be identified by some statistical signatures instead of exponential separation of nearby states. The search for these signatures is the primary goal in quantum chaos research. However, this perspective also naturally motivates the search for classical analogues of these signatures, to reveal the inner machinery of chaos in quantum systems. One widely recognized signature of chaos in quantum systems is the dynamical generation of entanglement. Chaos in the classical system is correlated with a greater entanglement production in the corresponding quantum system. One of the most well-studied examples of this is the kicked top model. In this paper, we construct a classical analogue of bipartite entanglement in terms of the mutual information between phase space distributions of subsystems and find completely analogous signatures of chaos as those found in entanglement for the kicked top Hamiltonian.

Title: A purely geometrical Aharonov-Bohm effect
Authors: Jean-Pierre Gazeau, Tomoi Koide, Romain Murenzi, Aidan Zlotak
Abstract: We present an application of the affine covariant integral quantization (ACIQ) (this http URL, 5, 901, 2020, this http URL, 7.1, 2020) to quantum mechanics on the punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), which comprises translations, rotations, and dilations of the plane. Due to the topology of the punctured plane, our quantization procedure gives rise to an affine vector potential. This potential can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge field produced by an infinite solenoid. This observation supports a reinterpretation of the AB effect: it emerges from the topological constraint imposed by the impenetrable coil rather than from an externally applied classical gauge field. In addition to this gauge structure, ACIQ also generates a repulsive, centrifugal-like scalar potential, a feature already encountered when applying ACIQ to motion on the half-line, whose phase space is the open half-plane. These results provide a new perspective on the AB effect, highlighting the central roles of topology and symmetry in quantum mechanics.

Title: Interference of interference effects
Authors: Kevin J. Randles, S. J. van Enk
Abstract: We analyze the interference of individual photons in a linear-optical setup comprised of two overlapping Mach-Zehnder interferometers joined via a common beam splitter. We show how, in this setup, two kinds of standard interference effects -- namely, single-photon Mach-Zehnder interference and two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference -- interfere with one another, partially canceling each other out. This new perspective, along with the overall pedagogical exposition of this work, is intended as an intuitive illustration of why quantum effects can combine nontrivially and, moreover, of the fundamental notion that quantum interference happens at measurement. This work can serve as a bridge to more advanced quantum mechanical concepts. For instance, analyses of this setup in terms of entanglement have a rich history and can be used to test the predictions of quantum mechanics versus local realism (e.g., as in Hardy's Paradox).

Title: Highly sensitive temperature sensing via quadratic optomechanical coupling
Authors: Yu-Sheng Tang, Xun-Wei Xu, Jie-Qiao Liao, Hui Jing, Le-Man Kuang
Abstract: The effective frequency of a mechanical resonator can be tuned via the spring effect induced by quadratic optomechanical (QOM) coupling, and both spontaneous symmetry breaking and anti-parity-time phase transition were predicted in the QOM systems. Here, we show that the mechanical susceptibility can be enhanced significantly by driving the QOM system with a strong external optical field, and divergence will happen as the driving strength approaches the critical point (CP) for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on the CP, we propose a highly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically coupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength approaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high in the low-temperature limit. Our work provides an effective way to realize highly sensitive temperature sensing at ultra-low temperature in the QOM systems.

Abstract: Flat-band systems provide an ideal platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, where the strongly suppressed kinetic energy in these flat energy bands suggests the potential for exotic phases driven by geometric structure, disorder, and interactions. While intriguing phenomena and physical mechanisms have been unveiled in theoretical models, synthesizing such systems within scalable quantum platforms remains challenging. Here, we present the experimental realization of a $\pi$-flux rhombic system using a two-dimensional superconducting qubit array with tunable coupling. We experimentally observe characteristic dynamics, e.g., $\pi$-flux driven destructive interference, and demonstrate the protocol for eigenstate preparation in this rhombic array with coupler-assisted flux. Our results provide future possibilities for exploring the interplay of geometry, interactions, and quantum information encoding in such degenerate systems.

Title: Efficient learning and optimizing non-Gaussian correlated noise in digitally controlled qubit systems
Authors: Wenzheng Dong, Yuanlong Wang, Muhammad Qasim Khan
Abstract: Precise qubit control in the presence of spatio-temporally correlated noise is pivotal for transitioning to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generically, such noise can also have non-Gaussian statistics, which hampers existing non-Markovian noise spectroscopy protocols. By utilizing frame-based characterization and a novel symmetry analysis, we show how to achieve higher-order spectral estimation for noise-optimized circuit design. Remarkably, we find that the digitally driven qubit dynamics can be solely determined by the complexity of the applied control, rather than the non-perturbative nature of the non-Gaussian environment. This enables us to address certain non-perturbative qubit dynamics more simply. We delineate several complexity bounds for learning such high-complexity noise and demonstrate our single and two-qubit digital characterization and control using a series of numerical simulations. Our results not only provide insights into the exact solvability of (small-sized) open quantum dynamics but also highlight a resource-efficient approach for optimal control and possible error reduction techniques for current qubit devices.

Title: Reservoir-assisted quantum battery charging at finite temperatures
Authors: Y. Yao, X. Q. Shao
Abstract: Quantum batteries, as highly efficient energy storage devices, have garnered significant research interest. A key challenge in their development is to maximize the extractable energy (ergotropy) when operating within a finite-temperature reservoir. To address this, we applied quantum feedback control to the charger and investigated the effects of fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs on the performance of quantum batteries, including stored energy, ergotropy, and charging efficiency, in an open environment. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the type of thermal reservoir, the system exhibits optimal charging parameters. In particular, in a fermionic thermal reservoir, increasing the environmental temperature enhances battery performance, enabling stable and efficient charging. In contrast, within a bosonic thermal reservoir, higher temperatures hinder energy storage and extraction, significantly reducing charging efficiency. Additionally, we explored the impact of battery size and found that, under a fermionic reservoir, increasing the battery size appropriately can further improve performance.

Title: Topology-Driven Quantum Architecture Search Framework
Authors: Junjian Su, Jiacheng Fan, Shengyao Wu, Guanghui Li, Sujuan Qin, Fei Gao
Abstract: The limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have motivated the development of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), which are designed to potentially achieve quantum advantage for specific tasks. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms play a critical role in automating the design of high-performance Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) for VQAs. However, existing QAS approaches struggle with large search spaces, leading to substantial computational overhead when optimizing large-scale quantum circuits. Extensive empirical analysis reveals that circuit topology has a greater impact on quantum circuit performance than gate types. Based on this insight, we propose the Topology-Driven Quantum Architecture Search (TD-QAS) framework, which first identifies optimal circuit topologies and then fine-tunes the gate types. In the fine-tuning phase, the QAS inherits parameters from the topology search phase, eliminating the need for training from scratch. By decoupling the large search space into separate topology and gate-type components, TD-QAS avoids exploring gate configurations within low-performance topologies, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity. Numerical simulations across various tasks, under both noiseless and noisy conditions, validate the effectiveness of the TD-QAS framework. This framework advances standard QAS algorithms by enabling the identification of high-performance quantum circuits while minimizing computational demands. These findings indicate that TD-QAS deepens our understanding of VQAs and offers broad potential for the development of future QAS algorithms.

Title: Scalable registration of single quantum emitters within solid immersion lenses through femtosecond laser writing
Authors: Alexander R. Jones, Xingrui Cheng, Shravan Kumar Parthasarathy, Muhammad Junaid Arshad, Pasquale Cilibrizzi, Roland Nagy, Patrick Salter, Jason Smith, Cristian Bonato, Christiaan Bekker
Abstract: The precise registration of solid-state quantum emitters to photonic structures is a major technological challenge for fundamental research (e.g. in cavity quantum electrodynamics) and applications to quantum technology. Standard approaches include the complex multi-step fabrication of photonic structures on pre-existing emitters, both registered within a grid of lithographically-defined markers. Here, we demonstrate a marker-free, femtosecond laser writing technique to generate individual quantum emitters within photonic structures. Characterization of 28 defect centers, laser-written at the centers of pre-existing solid immersion lens structures, showed offsets relative to the photonic structure's center of 260~nm in the x-direction and 60~nm in the y-direction, with standard deviations of $\pm 170$~nm and $\pm 90$~nm, respectively, resulting in an average 4.5 times enhancement of the optical collection efficiency. This method is scalable for developing integrated quantum devices using spin-photon interfaces in silicon carbide and is easily extendable to other materials.

Title: Protocols for inter-module two-qubit gates mediated by time-bin encoded photons
Authors: Z. M. McIntyre, W. A. Coish
Abstract: As quantum devices scale to larger numbers of qubits, entangling gates between distant stationary qubits will help provide flexible, long-range connectivity in modular architectures. In this work, we present protocols for implementing long-range two-qubit gates mediated by either Fock-state or time-bin qubits -- photonic encodings that are both compatible with the coplanar waveguide resonators commonly used in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). These protocols become deterministic in the limit of vanishing photon loss. Additionally, photon loss can be heralded, signaling a failed two-qubit gate attempt. We model the loss of a time-bin qubit to a dielectric environment consisting of an ensemble of two-level systems (TLSs), which are believed to be the dominant mechanism for dielectric loss in circuit QED architectures. The backaction (on the stationary qubits) associated with the loss of the time-bin qubit is strongly suppressed in a non-Markovian regime where the temporal separation of the time bins is short compared to the dielectric environment's correlation time. This result suggests strategies based on a combination of materials-fabrication and time-bin-qubit optimization for ensuring that the loss of a time-bin qubit is not only heralded, but also approximately backaction-free.

Title: A Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Quantum Realizability of Correlations for Arbitrary Normalized Observables in the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt Setup
Authors: Ryosuke Nogami, Jaeha Lee
Abstract: We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quantum state that reproduces given correlation values in the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt (CHSH) setup for any fixed normalized observables. This result addresses a fundamental question shared by both local realism and quantum mechanics: under what conditions a given set of observed data can be reproduced by a physical model. While previous studies have mainly addressed conditions for correlations achievable without specifying the measurement settings, our result gives a finer characterization by treating the observables as fixed in advance. The resulting quantum condition strengthens previously known constraints, such as Tsirel'son's inequalities and the Tsirel'son--Landau inequality, by characterizing statistical constraints explicitly for each specified set of observables. In particular, we show that our condition applies to Bell's original scenario and reveals that whether Bell's original inequality is violated depends sensitively on the chosen observables. More broadly, this perspective offers new insights into how quantum violations of local realism depend on the measurement settings.

Title: A classical proof of quantum knowledge for multi-prover interactive proof systems
Authors: Anne Broadbent, Alex B. Grilo, Nagisa Hara, Arthur Mehta
Abstract: In a proof of knowledge (PoK), a verifier becomes convinced that a prover possesses privileged information. In combination with zero-knowledge proof systems, PoKs play an important role in security protocols such as in digital signatures and authentication schemes, as they enable a prover to demonstrate possession of certain information (such as a private key or a credential), without revealing it. A PoK is formally defined via the existence of an extractor, which is capable of reconstructing the key information that makes a verifier accept, given oracle access to any accepting prover. We extend this concept to the setting of a single classical verifier and multiple quantum provers and present the first statistical zero-knowledge (ZK) PoK proof system for problems in QMA. To achieve this, we establish the PoK property for the ZK protocol of Broadbent, Mehta, and Zhao (TQC 2024), which applies to the local Hamiltonian problem. More specifically, we construct an extractor which, given oracle access to a provers' strategy that leads to high acceptance probability, is able to reconstruct the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Our result can be seen as a new form of self-testing, where, in addition to certifying a pre-shared entangled state, the verifier also certifies that a prover has access to a quantum system, in particular, a ground state; this indicates a new level of verification for a proof of quantumness.

Title: PHOENIX: Pauli-Based High-Level Optimization Engine for Instruction Execution on NISQ Devices
Authors: Zhaohui Yang, Dawei Ding, Chenghong Zhu, Jianxin Chen, Yuan Xie
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.

Title: Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing
Authors: Ewan McCulloch, J. Alexander Jacoby, Curt von Keyserlingk, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.

Title: Spatially Resolved Optical Responses of a High-Kinetic-Inductance Microwave Resonator
Authors: R. Hirotsuru, H. Kurokawa, K. Takaki, H. Terai, H. Kosaka
Abstract: Understanding the optical response of a high-kinetic-inductance microwave resonator is crucial for applications ranging from single-photon detection to quantum transduction between microwave and optical domains, which is gaining significant attention for scaling up quantum computers. However, interactions between the pump light and the superconducting resonator often induce unintended resonance frequency shifts and linewidth broadening. In this study, we measure the local optical response of a NbTiN nanowire resonator using a laser-scanning microwave spectroscopy system integrated with a dilution refrigerator. The optical response of the resonator shows correlation with the resonance modes and position, which is attributed to the two-level system around the resonator. These findings not only contribute to the design and understanding of quantum transducers and single-photon detectors, but also to the understandings of catastrophic high-energy particle irradiation events that generate unintended phonons in quantum devices.

Title: Many-body quantum dimerization in 2D atomic arrays
Authors: Giuseppe Calajò, Matija Tečer, Simone Montangero, Pietro Silvi, Marco Di Liberto
Abstract: We consider a 2D atomic array coupled to different photonic environments, focusing on the half-filled excitation subspace, where strong photon interactions can give rise to complex many-body states. In particular, we demonstrate that the least radiant state in this sector is well described by a coherent superposition of all possible quantum dimer coverings: a resonating valence bond (RVB) liquid state. We discuss possible strategies to probe this exotic state, along with their limitations and challenges. Finally, we show that such a quantum dimer covering can also emerge as the ground state of the coherent Hamiltonian describing a 2D atomic array coupled to a photonic band-gap material.

Title: Scalable fluxonium qubit architecture with tunable interactions between non-computational levels
Authors: Peng Zhao, Guming Zhao, Shaowei Li, Chen Zha, Ming Gong
Abstract: The fluxonium qubit has emerged as a promising candidate for superconducting quantum computing due to its long coherence times and high-fidelity gates. Nonetheless, further scaling up and improving performance remain critical challenges for establishing fluxoniums as a viable alternative to transmons. A key obstacle lies in developing scalable coupling architectures. In this work, we introduce a scalable fluxonium architecture that enables decoupling of qubit states while maintaining tunable couplings between non-computational states. Beyond the well-studied ZZ crosstalk, we identify that always-on interactions involving non-computational levels can significantly degrade the fidelities of initialization, control, and readout in large systems, thereby impeding scalability. Based on two possible physical realizations of the architecture, we demonstrate that the issue can be mitigated by implementing tunable couplings for fluxonium plasmon transitions, meanwhile enabling fast, high-fidelity gates with passive ZZ suppression. This comparative analysis enables us to establish general principles for realizing the architecture while understanding and addressing implementation-specific challenges.

Title: Quantum-Enhanced Change Detection and Joint Communication-Detection
Authors: Zihao Gong, Saikat Guha
Abstract: Quick detection of transmittance changes in optical channel is crucial for secure communication. We demonstrate that pre-shared entanglement using two-mode squeezed vacuum states significantly reduces detection latency compared to classical and entanglement-augmented coherent-state probes. The change detection latency is inversely proportional to the quantum relative entropy (QRE), which goes to infinity in the absence of thermal noise, suggesting idealized instantaneous detection. However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods. Additionally, we explore the fundamental trade-off between communication capacity and change detection latency, highlighting how pre-shared entanglement enhances both.

Authors: Ali Abbassi, Lionel Bayle
Abstract: This paper aims to determine the exact success probability at each step of Shor's algorithm. Although the literature usually provides a lower bound on this probability, we present an improved bound. The derived formulas enable the identification of all failure cases in Shor's algorithm, which correspond to a success probability of zero. A simulation routine is provided to evaluate the theoretical success probability for a given integer when its prime factorization is known with potential applications in quantum resource estimation and algorithm benchmarking.

Title: CONQURE: A Co-Execution Environment for Quantum and Classical Resources
Authors: Atulya Mahesh, Swastik Mittal, Frank Mueller
Abstract: Cutting edge classical computing today relies on a combination of CPU-based computing with a strong reliance on accelerators. In particular, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) rely heavily on acceleration via GPUs for numerical kernels. In the future, acceleration via quantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide quantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms. Computing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs) requires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto HPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms, parallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a lack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum acceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm development and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to efficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of quantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results, providing results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC scheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum and classical resources. CONQURE is a fully open-source cloud queue framework that presents a novel modular scheduling framework allowing users to offload OpenMP quantum kernels to QPUs as quantum circuits, to relay results back to calling contexts in classical computing, and to schedule quantum resources via our CONQURE API. We show our API has a low overhead averaging 12.7ms in our tests, and we demonstrate functionality on an ion-trap device. Our OpenMP extension enables the parallelization of VQE runs with a 3.1X reduction in runtime.

Title: Designing open quantum systems for enabling quantum enhanced sensing through classical measurements
Authors: Robert Mattes, Albert Cabot, Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: Quantum systems in nonequilibrium conditions, where coherent many-body interactions compete with dissipative effects, can feature rich phase diagrams and emergent critical behavior. Associated collective effects, together with the continuous observation of quanta dissipated into the environment -- typically photons -- allow to achieve quantum enhanced parameter estimation. However, protocols for tapping this enhancement typically involve intricate measurements on the combined system-environment state. Here we show that many-body quantum enhancement can in fact be obtained through classical measurements, such as photon counting and homodyne detection. We illustrate this in detail for a class of open spin-boson models which can be realized in trapped-ion or cavity QED setups. Our findings highlight a route towards the design of systems that enable a practical implementation of quantum enhanced metrology through continuous classical measurements.

Title: Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system II
Authors: Xue-Yi Guo
Abstract: The irreversible entropy increase described by the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally tied to thermalization and the emergence of equilibrium. In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for a typical macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\phi_0\rangle$, the quantum state $|\phi'_0\rangle = \hat{O}(t)|\phi_0\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In typical macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is inevitable.

Title: Macroscopic entanglement of three magnon modes in three cavities via optical parametric amplifier
Authors: Ying Zhou, Guo-Qiang Zhang
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate bipartite and tripartite entanglements of three magnon modes in a three-cavity system using a nonlinear optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The three magnon modes in three YIG spheres are respectively placed inside three cavities near the maximum magnetic fields of the cavities and coupled to cavity modes via linear magnetic dipole interaction. Additionally, linear coupling interaction exists between two cavities. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that OPA can prepare the three magnon modes in a steady-state entangled state, bipartite and tripartite entanglements increase with the nonlinear interaction strength of OPA. An alternative approach to enhance quantum entanglement involves multiplexed OPA inputs. By employing individual OPA for each cavity, we observe a significant improvement in entanglement generation. All the entanglements are robust against bath temperature.

Title: Parallel Repetition for Post-Quantum Arguments
Authors: Andrew Huang, Yael Tauman Kalai
Abstract: In this work, we show that parallel repetition of public-coin interactive arguments reduces the soundness error at an exponential rate even in the post-quantum setting. Moreover, we generalize this result to hold for threshold verifiers, where the parallel repeated verifier accepts if and only if at least $t$ of the executions are accepted (for some threshold $t$). Prior to this work, these results were known only when the cheating prover was assumed to be classical. We also prove a similar result for three-message private-coin arguments. Previously, Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen (STOC 2024) proved such a parallel repetition result in the more general setting of quantum protocols, where the verifier and communication may be quantum. We consider only protocols where the verifier is classical, but obtain a simplified analysis, and for the more general setting of threshold verifiers.

Abstract: We show the application of permutation-invariant quantum circuits to the clique problem. The experiment asks to label a clique through identification of the nodes in a larger subgraph. The permutation-invariant quantum circuit outperforms a cyclic-invariant alternative as well as a standard quantum machine learning ansatz. We explain the behavior through the intrinsic symmetry of the problem, in the sense that the problem is symmetric under permutation of both the feature and the label.

Title: Comment on "Time crystals made of electron-positron pairs"
Authors: Zhen-Hua Feng
Abstract: Direct reproduction of Bialynicki-Birula's quantum solutions using the authors' own equations and initial conditions reveals two fundamental flaws. First, the eigenfunctions exhibit divergence in the region $y<0$, contradicting the claimed decay behavior ($\abs{\phi}\to\infty$ as $y\to -10$) (Figs. 9--11). Second, the apparent parity symmetry displayed in Figures 9--11 is not supported by Equation (21); numerical solutions clearly show asymmetric wavefunctions. Furthermore, all quantum solutions presented in Section IV violate the boundedness requirements of quantum mechanics. These inconsistencies raise serious concerns about the physical validity of the quantum framework underlying the time crystal model.

Title: Delayed Arrow-of-Time Detection in Signed Laplacian Dynamics
Authors: Adam Brandenburger, Pierfrancesco La Mura
Abstract: We study how rapidly the direction of time becomes operationally detectable from mesoscopic data when state-weights may be positive or negative. In contrast with classical Markov processes -- where forward evolution is instantly distinguishable from its reverse -- signed dynamics can render the arrow of time undetectable during an initial interval. Assume the generator of the signed dynamics is a symmetric signed Laplacian with a single linear invariant and a phase-space Second Law holds in the form of non-decreasing Rényi-$2$ entropy. Drawing on recent results on eventual exponential positivity of signed Laplacians (Chen et al., 2021), we define a test that correctly identifies the direction of thermodynamic time if conducted over a time interval of length at least $\tau$. We go on to prove that the test cannot deliver an incorrect conclusion if conducted over a shorter interval. Dropping symmetry, we exhibit a superquantum example where $\tau = +\infty$, so that the arrow of time remains permanently undetectable under our test.

Title: Superactivation of Bell nonlocality in pure anyonic states
Authors: Cheng-Qian Xu, Wenhao Ye, Li You
Abstract: Standard quantum information theory is founded on the assumption that multi-party state space possesses a tensor product structure. Anyons, as quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems, exhibit unique entanglement properties that differ from the conventional quantum systems, resulting from the absence of a tensor product structure in their state spaces. This motivates us to investigate the relationship between Bell nonlocality and entanglement in anyonic states. Specifically, we find that certain pure anyonic states with non-zero anyonic entanglement entropy (AEE) are local, yet exhibit nonlocality when subjected to collective measurements on multiple copies-a phenomenon known as superactivation of nonlocality, which is typically observed in conventional mixed states. To analyze this, we decompose the total entanglement of anyonic states into two components: one from the tensor product structure and the other representing residual contributions. By studying their asymptotic behavior, we find that the former gradually increases and approaches the AEE while the latter diminishes with the number of copies. Crucially, the entanglement component associated with the tensor product structure demonstrates a significant correlation with nonlocality, which explains the observed superactivation of nonlocality. Our findings provide new insights into the connection between entanglement and nonlocality in anyonic systems.

Abstract: Developing sensors with large particle numbers $N$ that can resolve subtle physical effects is a central goal in precision measurement science. Entangled quantum sensors can surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), where the signal variance scales as $1/N$, and approach the Heisenberg limit (HL) with variance scaling as $1/N^2$. However, entangled states are typically more sensitive to noise, especially common-mode noise such as magnetic field fluctuations, control phase noise, or vibrations in atomic interferometers. We propose a two-node entanglement-enhanced quantum sensor network for differential signal estimation that intrinsically rejects common-mode noise while remaining robust against local, uncorrelated noise. This architecture enables sensitivities approaching the Heisenberg limit. We investigate two state preparation strategies: (i) unitary entanglement generation analogous to bosonic two-mode squeezing, yielding Heisenberg scaling; and (ii) dissipative preparation via collective emission into a shared cavity mode, offering a $\sqrt{N}$ improvement over the SQL. Numerical simulations confirm that both protocols remain effective under realistic conditions, supporting scalable quantum-enhanced sensing in the presence of dominant common-mode noise.

Title: On a dynamic ontic wave model of quantum collapse and measurement
Authors: Jason D. Runyan
Abstract: This work introduces a novel model of quantum entities as physical, spatially extended wavefields, forming the basis for a realist framework for quantum measurement and collapse. Unlike interpretations that postulate hidden variables, observer-induced effects, ad hoc stochastic elements, or multiverse branching, this model derives the Born rule as a consequence of local physical interactions - involving kinetic energy transfer at or above a threshold - acting on an extended wavefield. Central to the model is a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle - not as a statistical or epistemic limitation, but as a dynamical relation between kinetic energy transfer and wavefield contraction. This framework yields testable predictions about how weak, intermediate, and strong quantum interactions modulate spatial localization - predictions consistent with existing experimental findings. The upshot is a unified, falsifiable alternative to prevailing interpretations, and a foundation for a broader research program in wavefield interaction mechanics.

Title: Homogeneous Free-Standing Nanostructures from Bulk Diamond over Millimeter Scales for Quantum Technologies
Authors: Andrea Corazza, Silvia Ruffieux, Yuchun Zhu, Claudio A. Jaramillo Concha, Yannik Fontana, Christophe Galland, Richard J. Warburton, Patrick Maletinsky
Abstract: Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (< 0.35 nm/$\mathrm{\mu m}$}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ < 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.

Title: Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
Authors: Baptiste Claudon, Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pierre Monmarché
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.

Title: Universal cooling of quantum systems via randomized measurements
Authors: Josias Langbehn, George Mouloudakis, Emma King, Raphaël Menu, Igor Gornyi, Giovanna Morigi, Yuval Gefen, Christiane P. Koch
Abstract: It is generally believed that the design of cooling protocols requires knowledge of the system's spectrum. In contrast, cooling processes in nature occur whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. But how does nature know how to cool quantum systems? Here we address this question by mimicking a natural cold bath with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state and interact with the system sequentially for a specified time before being discarded. This protocol is equivalent to quantum measurements without keeping the measurement readouts. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without prior knowledge of the system's details when the interactions between the system and the meters, as well as the level splittings of the meters, are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the rotating-wave approximation becomes valid, ensuring that resonant energy-exchange processes, which lead to cooling, dominate over heating. This demonstrates that robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems can be achieved through generic, structure-independent protocols. Our findings thus offer a versatile universal framework for engineering, controlling, and manipulating quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for the purposes of quantum information processing and quantum simulations.

Title: Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder
Authors: Aitijhya Saha, Debraj Rakshit
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.

Our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations generate spin currents above a critical velocity threshold, while no spin currents occur below this threshold at low temperatures. The critical velocity depends on magnon stiffness and Zeeman energy. Approaching the threshold, the spin current becomes divergent, linked to the $PT$-symmetry-breaking transition. This enhanced behavior could offer high-sensitivity measurements and efficient spin current generation in magnon-based quantum technology.

Title: Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System
Authors: Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Yuki Haruna, Yusuke Nishida, Yoshiro Takahashi
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.

Title: Quantum concentration inequalities and equivalence of the thermodynamical ensembles: an optimal mass transport approach
Authors: Giacomo De Palma, Davide Pastorello
Abstract: We prove new concentration inequalities for quantum spin systems which apply to any local observable measured on any product state or on any state with exponentially decaying correlations. Our results do not require the spins to be arranged in a regular lattice, and cover the case of observables that contain terms acting on spins at arbitrary distance. Moreover, we introduce a local W1 distance, which quantifies the distinguishability of two states with respect to local observables. We prove a transportation-cost inequality stating that the local W1 distance between a generic state and a state with exponentially decaying correlations is upper bounded by a function of their relative entropy. Finally, we apply such inequality to prove the equivalence between the canonical and microcanonical ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics and the weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for the Hamiltonians whose Gibbs states have exponentially decaying correlations.

Title: Entanglement and Bell nonlocality with bottom-quark pairs at hadron colliders
Authors: Yoav Afik, Yevgeny Kats, Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova, Abner Soffer, David Uzan
Abstract: It has been shown that entanglement and Bell nonlocality, which are key concepts in Quantum Mechanics, can be probed in high-energy colliders via processes of fundamental particle scattering. In fact, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have measured entanglement using top-quark pairs produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Recently, it was shown that spin correlations can be measured in pairs of bottom quarks at the LHC, despite the fact that bottom quarks, unlike top quarks, hadronize before decaying. Here, we demonstrate that quantum correlations can also be studied using bottom-quark pairs, and analyze the feasibility of the observation of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in several collider experiments. Given the low mass of the bottom quark relative to typical energies accessible at the LHC, many of the bottom-quark pairs are in the ultrarelativistic regime, where they can exhibit strong spin entanglement. We find that entanglement of bottom-quark pairs may be measurable even with the LHC Run 2 data, especially with the CMS $B$ parking dataset, while observation of Bell nonlocality may become feasible at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC.

Title: Quantum Mechanics in Curved Space(time) with a Noncommutative Geometric Perspective
Authors: Otto C.W. Kong (Nat'l Central U, Taiwan)
Abstract: We have previously presented a version of the Weak Equivalence Principle for a quantum particle as an exact analog of the classical case, based on the Heisenberg picture analysis of free particle motion. Here, we take that to a full formalism of quantum mechanics in a generic curved space(time). Our basic perspective is to take seriously the noncommutative symplectic geometry corresponding to the quantum observable algebra. Particle position coordinate transformations and a nontrivial metric assigning an invariant inner product to vectors, and covectors, are implemented accordingly. That allows an analog to the classical picture of the phase space as the cotangent bundle. The mass-independent quantum geodesic equations as equations of free particle motion under a generic metric as a quantum observable are obtained from an invariant Hamiltonian. Hermiticity of momentum observables is to be taken as reference frame dependent. Our results have a big contrast to the alternative obtained based on the Schrödinger wavefunction representation which we argue to be less appealing. Hence, the work points to a very different approach to quantum gravity, plausibly with a quantum Einstein equation suggested.

Title: Tracking the variation of entanglement Rényi negativity: a quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: Yi-Ming Ding, Yin Tang, Zhe Wang, Zhiyan Wang, Bin-Bin Mao, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has been a powerful tool for analyzing phases and criticality in pure ground states via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement Rényi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.

Title: Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances
Authors: Caterina Zerba, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Léo Mangeolle, Michael Knap
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.

Title: Emergent Fracton Hydrodynamics of Ultracold Atoms in Partially Filled Landau Levels
Authors: Caterina Zerba, Alexander Seidel, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: The realization of synthetic gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold atoms and the simulation of quantum Hall physics has witnessed remarkable experimental progress. Here, we establish key signatures of fractional quantum Hall systems in their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that in the lowest Landau level the system generically relaxes this http URL slow relaxation is understood from emergent conservation laws of the total charge and the associated dipole moment that arise from the effective Hamiltonian projected onto the lowest Landau level, leading to subdiffusive fracton hydrodynamics. We discuss the prospect of rotating quantum gases as well as ultracold atoms in optical lattices for observing this unconventional relaxation dynamics.

Title: Long-time Freeness in the Kicked Top
Authors: Elisa Vallini, Silvia Pappalardi
Abstract: Recent work highlighted the importance of higher-order correlations in quantum dynamics for a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization. The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.

Title: Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison to quantum and classical Ising machines
Authors: Anna Maria Dziubyna, Tomasz Śmierzchalski, Bartłomiej Gardas, Marek M. Rams, Masoud Mohseni
Abstract: Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.

Title: Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime
Authors: Pasquale Marra
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-André model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-André) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. This work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new venues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.

Title: Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal
Authors: Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.

Title: Improving Student Self-Confidence in Quantum Computing with the Qubit Touchdown Board Game
Authors: Kristina Armbruster, Gintaras Duda, Thomas G. Wong
Abstract: Qubit Touchdown is a two-player, competitive board game that was developed to introduce students to quantum computing. A quantum computer is a new kind of computer that is based on the laws of quantum physics, and it can solve certain problems faster than normal computers because it follows a different set of rules. Qubit Touchdown's game play mirrors the rules of (American) football, with players taking turns moving the football to score the most touchdowns, and no knowledge of quantum computing is needed to play the game. We evaluated the game with 107 public high school students in Precalculus, Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics, and/or AP Physics 1 courses, assessing whether their interest in and self-confidence in their ability to learn quantum computing changed as a result of playing the game and learning about its connections to quantum computing. We also assessed whether the game was easy to learn and enjoyable. We found that students' interest in quantum computing increased slightly ($p<0.05$), but students' self-confidence in their ability to learn quantum computing saw greater gains ($p<0.001$); students also widely considered the game accessible and fun. Thus, Qubit Touchdown could be an effective resource to introduce students to Quantum Computing and boost their confidence in learning about the field. Free printables of the game are available, and professionally produced copies can be purchased on demand.

Title: Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling
Authors: Tomohiro Hattori, Hirotaka Irie, Tadashi Kadowaki, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the square lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the triangular lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansätze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.

Title: Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition
Authors: Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.

Title: Nuclear Electric Quadrupole Moment-Induced Parity Doubling in Molecules for Symmetry-Violation Searches
Authors: Xing Fan, Lan Cheng
Abstract: Searches for the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM) and nuclear Schiff moment (NSM) have high discovery potential for violations of time ($T$) and parity ($P$) reversal symmetries beyond the Standard Model. Molecules containing heavy nuclei are typically used to enhance the sensitivity to MQMs and NSMs due to their strong internal electric fields and potential octupole deformation. To extract these effects in the laboratory frame, a bias electric field is required to polarize the molecule by mixing states of opposite parity (parity doublets). Typical heavy nuclei that are sensitive to symmetry-violation also possess large nuclear electric quadrupole moments (EQMs) when its nuclear spin is $I\geq1$. We show that EQMs can significantly modify the energy splitting between parity doublet states and thus change the required polarizing electric field. As a result, the EQM-induced energy splitting must be taken into account in designing such experiments. We provide qualitative estimates of parity doubling from EQMs and supporting \textit{ab initio} calculations, along with implications for candidate molecules in symmetry-violation searches.
