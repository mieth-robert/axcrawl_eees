Title: Causal Interventions Beyond Time: A CP-do(C)-Calculus for Indefinite Quantum Order
Authors: Jordi Vallverdu
Abstract: We reformulate Pearl's three rules of do-calculus in the language of completely positive (CP) trace-preserving maps, thereby extending them to quantum systems with entanglement. We prove that Rule~2 fails whenever the underlying process admits indefinite causal order, and we demonstrate this failure in a three-qubit ``quantum switch'' circuit. Our analysis clarifies why the classical notions of surgical intervention, faithfulness, and counterfactual dependence must be revised in quantum information science. The CP-do($C$)-calculus introduced here provides a common syntax for causal modelling across classical, definite-order quantum, and indefinite-order quantum regimes.

Title: Comment on "Energy-speed relationship of quantum particles challenges Bohmian mechanics"
Authors: Aurélien Drezet, Dustin Lazarovici, Bernard Michael Nabet
Abstract: In their recent paper [Nature 643, 67 (2025)], Sharaglazova et al. report an optical microcavity experiment yielding an "energy-speed relationship" for quantum particles in evanescent states, which they infer from the observed population transfer between two coupled waveguides. The authors argue that their findings challenge the validity of Bohmian particle dynamics because, according to the Bohmian guiding equation, the velocities in the classically forbidden region would be zero. In this note, we explain why this claim is false and the experimental findings are in perfect agreement with Bohmian mechanics. We also clarify why the operationally defined speeds reported in the paper are unrelated to particle velocities in the sense described by Bohmian mechanics. In contrast to other recent replies, our analysis relies solely on the standard Bohmian guidance equation for single particles.

Title: Power and Limitations of Linear Programming Decoder for Quantum LDPC Codes
Authors: Shouzhen Gu, Mehdi Soleimanifar
Abstract: Decoding quantum error-correcting codes is a key challenge in enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In the classical setting, linear programming (LP) decoders offer provable performance guarantees and can leverage fast practical optimization algorithms. Although LP decoders have been proposed for quantum codes, their performance and limitations remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we uncover a key limitation of LP decoding for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes: certain constant-weight error patterns lead to ambiguous fractional solutions that cannot be resolved through independent rounding. To address this issue, we incorporate a post-processing technique known as ordered statistics decoding (OSD), which significantly enhances LP decoding performance in practice. Our results show that LP decoding, when augmented with OSD, can outperform belief propagation with the same post-processing for intermediate code sizes of up to hundreds of qubits. These findings suggest that LP-based decoders, equipped with effective post-processing, offer a promising approach for decoding near-term quantum LDPC codes.

Title: Ergotopy transport in a one dimensional spin chain
Authors: Dara Murphy, Anthony Kiely, Irene D'Amico, Steve Campbell
Abstract: We examine the transport of useful energy, i.e. extractable work as quantified by the ergotropy, along a spin chain with tuneable exchange couplings between the sites. We focus on, and interpolate between, the two physically relevant limits of uniform interaction strengths and engineered couplings which achieve perfect state transfer (PST). By modelling the individual constituents as quantum batteries, we consider how the manner in which the extractable work appears in the initial state of the first site impacts the chain's ability to transport ergotropy to the final site. For non-PST couplings, we establish that there is a clear quantum advantage when the ergotropy is initially endowed in quantum coherences and demonstrate that this ergotropy is more efficiently transferred. For extractable work encoded in a population inverted state, we show that this considerably limits the length of chain over which any ergotropy can be faithfully transported. For PST couplings, we consider the robustness to disorder and again demonstrate a quantum advantage for coherently endowed ergotropy. Finally, we examine the work probability distribution associated with quenching on the interactions which provides insight into the work cost in switching on the couplings. We show that PST couplings lead to smaller fluctuations in this work cost, indicating that they are more stable.

Title: Universal quantum phase classification on quantum computers from machine learning
Authors: Weicheng Ye, Shuwei Liu, Shiyu Zhou, Yijian Zou
Abstract: The classification of quantum phases of matter remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. We present a novel framework that combines shadow tomography with modern time-series machine learning models to enable efficient and practical quantum phase classification. Our approach leverages the definition of quantum phases based on connectivity through finite-depth local unitary circuits, generating abundant training data by applying Haar random evolution to representative quantum states for a given phase. In this way, the training data can be efficiently obtained from a quantum simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that advanced time-series models can be used to process the training data and achieve universal quantum phase classification that does not rely on local order parameters. To validate the universality and versatility of our method, we test the model against one-dimensional quantum spin chains such as the Ising model and the axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, showing excellent agreement with known phase boundaries.

Title: Absolutely maximally entangled pure states of multipartite quantum systems
Authors: Grzegorz Rajchel-Mieldzioć, Rafał Bistroń, Albert Rico, Arul Lakshminarayan, Karol Życzkowski
Abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled (AME) pure states of a system composed of $N$ parties are distinguished by the property that for any splitting at least one partial trace is maximally mixed. Due to maximal possible correlations between any two selected subsystems these states have numerous applications in various fields of quantum information processing including multi-user teleportation, quantum error correction and secret sharing. We present an updated survey of various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square representation of the "golden" AME state and an updated summary of the number of local unitary equivalence classes.

Title: Excising dead components in the surface code using minimally invasive alterations: A performance study
Authors: Ryan V. Mishmash, Vadym Kliuchnikov, Juan Bello-Rivas, Adam Paetznick, David Aasen, Christina Knapp, Yue Wu, Bela Bauer, Marcus P. da Silva, Parsa Bonderson
Abstract: The physical implementation of a large-scale error-corrected quantum processor will necessarily need to mitigate the presence of defective (thereby "dead") physical components in its operation, for example, identified during bring-up of the device or detected in the middle of a computation. In the context of solid-state qubits, the quantum error correcting protocol operating in the presence of dead components should ideally (i) use the same native operation set as that without dead components, (ii) maximize salvaging of functional components, and (iii) use a consistent global operating schedule which optimizes logical qubit performance and is compatible with the control requirements of the system. The scheme proposed by Grans-Samuelsson et al. [Quantum 8, 1429 (2024)] satisfies all three of these criteria: it effectively excises (cuts out) dead components from the surface code using minimally invasive alterations (MIA). We conduct extensive numerical simulations of this proposal for the pairwise-measurement-based surface code protocol in the presence of dead components under circuit-level noise. To that end, we also describe techniques to automatically construct performant check (detector) bases directly from circuits without manual circuit annotation, which may be of independent interest. Both the MIA scheme and this automated check basis computation can be readily used with measurement-based as well as CNOT-based circuits, and the results presented here demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Automorphism gadgets in homological product codes
Authors: Noah Berthusen, Michael J. Gullans, Yifan Hong, Maryam Mudassar, Shi Jie Samuel Tan
Abstract: The homological product is a general-purpose recipe that forges new quantum codes from arbitrary classical or quantum input codes, often providing enhanced error-correcting properties. When the input codes are classical linear codes, it is also known as the hypergraph product. We investigate structured homological product codes that admit logical operations arising from permutation symmetries in their input codes. We present a broad theoretical framework that characterizes the logical operations resulting from these underlying automorphisms. In general, these logical operations can be performed by a combination of physical qubit permutations and a subsystem circuit. In special cases related to symmetries of the input Tanner graphs, logical operations can be performed solely through qubit permutations. We further demonstrate that these "automorphism gadgets" can possess inherent fault-tolerant properties such as effective distance preservation, assuming physical permutations are free. Finally, we survey the literature of classical linear codes with rich automorphism structures and show how various classical code families fit into our framework. Complementary to other fault-tolerant gadgets for homological product codes, our results further advance the search for practical fault tolerance beyond topological codes in platforms capable of long-range connectivity.

Title: Dissipative Dynamics and Symmetry Breaking in Bosonic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Lindbladian
Authors: Yifei Liu, Anish Kulkarni, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: We investigate a bosonic variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model coupled to a Lindbladian environment, focusing on the interplay between quantum many-body dynamics and dissipation. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism in the large-N limit, we uncover a rich phase structure, including symmetry breaking and phase transitions. Our results suggest that the dissipation can partially tame the instability of the inverted potential, leading to novel steady-state phases. We also identify regimes with multiple competing saddle points and discuss potential implications for the landscape of metastable states.

Title: Non-Hermitian Quantum Metrology Enhancement and Skin Effect Suppression in PT-Symmetric Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Chains
Authors: Harshank Matkar
Abstract: We outline a theoretical framework for quantum metrology in non-Hermitian systems, demonstrating both significant failure and exceptional regimes in PT-symmetric Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer chains. Through biorthogonal quantum Fisher information analysis, we identify two distinct regimes: exponential sensitivity suppression in the non-Hermitian skin effect phase ($F_Q \propto N^3 e^{-2\kappa N}$) where eigenstates localize exponentially, and quadratic enhancement near PT-breaking exceptional points [1-4] ($F_Q \propto N^2/\delta$) achieving Heisenberg scaling. Our multiparameter analysis establishes optimal simultaneous estimation of chemical potential, Peierls phase, and gain/loss strength with quantum Fisher information matrix scaling as $N^2$, surpassing the standard quantum limit by factors exceeding $10^2$. For realistic parameters ($t/2\pi=10$ MHz, $\Delta/2\pi=1$ MHz, $N=50$), we predict enhancement factors $\eta_\mu \approx 20\sqrt{N}=141$ for chemical potential estimation and $\eta_\phi \approx t^2 \sqrt{3N/2}=100\sqrt{N}$ over classical sensing. These results are validated through exact finite-size calculations and provide concrete protocols for superconducting circuit this http URL reveal a core dichotomy in non-Hermitian quantum metrology: NHSE suppresses sensitivity exponentially, while $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry enables Heisenberg-limited enhancement -- each arising from distinct spectral and localization topologies.

Title: Hybrid oscillator-qudit quantum processors: stabilizer states and symplectic operations
Authors: Sayan Chakraborty, Victor V. Albert
Abstract: We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states. We construct general hybrid error-correcting codes by relating stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori and obtaining logical operators via Morita equivalence. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.

Title: Exact Solutions of the Schrödinger-Dunkl Equation for a Free Particle in a Finite and Infinite Cylindrical Well
Authors: R. D. Mota, D. Ojeda-Guillén, M. Salazar-Ramírez
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schrödinger equation with Dunkl derivative for a free particle confined in a cylindrical potential well. We consider both the finite and infinite height cases. The Dunkl formalism introduces reflection operators that modify the structure of the Hamiltonian and affect the parity of the solutions. By working in cylindrical coordinates, we obtain exact analytical expressions for the radial and axial wavefunctions in terms of Bessel functions. The energy spectrum and the solutions are classified according to the eigenvalues of the reflection operators in the three coordinates. We analyze in detail the conditions under which the wavefunctions acquire definite parity and discuss the resulting constraints on the Dunkl parameters.

Title: Noisy Quantum Simulation Using Tracking, Uncomputation and Sampling
Authors: Siddharth Dangwal, Tina Oberoi, Ajay Sailopal, Dhirpal Shah, Frederic T. Chong
Abstract: Quantum computers have grown in size and qubit quality in recent years, enabling the execution of complex quantum circuits. However, for most researchers, access to compute time on quantum hardware is limited. This necessitates the need to build simulators that mimic the execution of quantum circuits on noisy quantum hardware accurately and scalably. In this work, we propose TUSQ - Tracking, Uncomputation, and Sampling for Noisy Quantum Simulation. To represent the stochastic noisy channels accurately, we average the output of multiple quantum circuits with fixed noisy gates sampled from the channels. However, this leads to a substantial increase in circuit overhead, which slows down the simulation. To eliminate this overhead, TUSQ uses two modules: the Error Characterization Module (ECM), and the Tree-based Execution Module (TEM). The ECM tracks the number of unique circuit executions needed to accurately represent the noise. That is, if initially we needed $n_{1}$ circuit executions, ECM reduces that number to $n_{2}$ by eliminating redundancies so that $n_{2} < n_{1}$. This is followed by the TEM, which reuses computation across these $n_{2}$ circuits. This computational reuse is facilitated by representing all $n_{2}$ circuits as a tree. We sample the significant leaf nodes of this tree and prune the remaining ones. We traverse this tree using depth-first search. We use uncomputation to perform rollback-recovery at several stages which reduces simulation time. We evaluate TUSQ for a total of 186 benchmarks and report an average speedup of $52.5\times$ and $12.53\times$ over Qiskit and CUDA-Q, which goes up to $7878.03\times$ and $439.38\times$ respectively. For larger benchmarks (more than than 15 qubits), the average speedup is $55.42\times$ and $23.03\times$ over Qiskit and CUDA-Q respectively

Title: Fault-Tolerant Universal Quantum Computing in the Presence of Anisotropic Noise
Authors: Yang-Yang Xie, Zhao-Ming Wang, Lian-Ao Wu
Abstract: We propose a universal gate set for quantum computing that operates in the presence of decoherence without requiring the overhead of quantum error correction. Inspired by recent advances in noise manipulation technologies, we demonstrate that a broad class of anisotropic qubit-bath couplings can be decoupled via a dressing transformation, which generates a system-bath entangled resource basis. When initialized in this basis, the computation evolves as if decoherence is absent. Our proposal offers a flexible alternative to systems requiring quantum error correction by utilizing partially tunable system-bath couplings.

Title: Taming coherent noise with teleportation
Authors: Kathleen Chang, Qile Su, Shruti Puri
Abstract: Compared to the more widely studied Pauli errors, coherent errors present several new challenges in quantum computing and quantum error correction (QEC). For example, coherent errors may interfere constructively over a long circuit and significantly increase the overall failure rate compared to Pauli noise. Additionally, there is so far no analytical proof for a topological code threshold under coherent errors. Moreover, it is hard to even numerically estimate the performance of QEC under coherent errors as their effect in a Clifford circuit cannot be efficiently classically simulated. In this work, we demonstrate that teleportation effectively tailors coherent errors into Pauli errors, for which analytical and numerical results are abundant. We first show that repeated teleportation of a single qubit decoheres errors, and the average infidelity grows at worst linearly with the number of teleportations, similar to Pauli errors. We then analyze a physically motivated pure $Z$-coherent error model for teleported CSS codes in which over-rotation errors accompany every gate, and find that such an error model is equivalent to a Pauli error model. Our result implies that the performance of a CSS code implemented via teleportation-based error correction or measurement-based error correction with such coherent noise can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer and has an analytically provable threshold. The intrinsic noise-tailoring property of teleportation may ultimately remove the need for randomized compiling in teleportation-based quantum computing schemes.

Title: A Design for an Early Quantum Network
Authors: Yuan Li, Chen Zhang, Hao Zhang, Tao Huang, Yunjie Liu
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of quantum information technology, quantum networks have become essential for supporting diverse applications, which often have stringent demands for key metrics such as fidelity and request completion time. In this work, we propose a design for early-stage quantum networks that is compatible with the three existing quantum repeater technologies. The design aims to maximize the ability of the network to accommodate the diverse needs of quantum applications, even under conditions of limited quantum resources and suboptimal network performance. We have also described the required identifiers in the quantum network and the specific process for implementing quantum requests. To assess the feasibility of our design, we conduct simulations based on discrete-event modeling of quantum networks. The simulations consider various types of noise and imperfect parameters that might exist in early-stage networks. We analyze the impact of these parameters on the fidelity of the generated entangled states and the request completion time. Furthermore, we investigated additional decisions that the central controller can make beyond path selection, such as the choice of cutoff time and the allocation of network resources to requests.

Title: Minimum-Weight Parity Factor Decoder for Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Yue Wu, Binghong Li, Kathleen Chang, Shruti Puri, Lin Zhong
Abstract: Fast and accurate quantum error correction (QEC) decoding is crucial for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoding, while being near-optimal, is intractable on general quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes and typically relies on approximation and heuristics. We propose HyperBlossom, a unified framework that formulates MLE decoding as a Minimum-Weight Parity Factor (MWPF) problem and generalizes the blossom algorithm to hypergraphs via a similar primal-dual linear programming model with certifiable proximity bounds. HyperBlossom unifies all the existing graph-based decoders like (Hypergraph) Union-Find decoders and Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder, thus bridging the gap between heuristic and certifying decoders. We implement HyperBlossom in software, namely Hyperion. Hyperion achieves a 4.8x lower logical error rate compared to the MWPM decoder on the distance-11 surface code and 1.6x lower logical error rate compared to a fine-tuned BPOSD decoder on the $[[90, 8, 10]]$ bivariate bicycle code under code-capacity noise. It also achieves an almost-linear average runtime scaling on both the surface code and the color code, with numerical results up to sufficiently large code distances of 99 and 31 for code-capacity noise and circuit-level noise, respectively.

Title: QFOR: A Fidelity-aware Orchestrator for Quantum Computing Environments using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Hoa T. Nguyen, Muhammad Usman, Rajkumar Buyya
Abstract: Quantum cloud computing enables remote access to quantum processors, yet the heterogeneity and noise of available quantum hardware create significant challenges for efficient resource orchestration. These issues complicate the optimization of quantum task allocation and scheduling, as existing heuristic methods fall short in adapting to dynamic conditions or effectively balancing execution fidelity and time. Here, we propose QFOR, a Quantum Fidelity-aware Orchestration of tasks across heterogeneous quantum nodes in cloud-based environments using Deep Reinforcement learning. We model the quantum task orchestration as a Markov Decision Process and employ the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to learn adaptive scheduling policies, using IBM quantum processor calibration data for noise-aware performance estimation. Our configurable framework balances overall quantum task execution fidelity and time, enabling adaptation to different operational priorities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that QFOR is adaptive and achieves significant performance with 29.5-84% improvements in relative fidelity performance over heuristic baselines. Furthermore, it maintains comparable quantum execution times, contributing to cost-efficient use of quantum computation resources.

Title: Corner functions from entanglement indices of harmonic lattices
Authors: Masafumi Shimojo, Satoshi Ishihara, Hironobu Kataoka, Atsuko Matsukawa
Abstract: We study the entanglement indices such as logarithmic negativities (LNs) and mutual informations (MIs) between two adjacent subsets in a isolated universal set $U$ of harmonic oscillators arranged on a two dimensional lattice within a sufficiently large square. First, we verify the values of the corner functions of angle $\pi/2, \pi/4, 3\pi/4$ presented in the previous study which adopts periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for the $U$. The values of each corner function obtained from LNs are nearly equal to those in the previous ones, while those of $3\pi/4$ from MIs are not sufficiently consistent with those computed from LNs. Next, for the case where the universal system $U$ satisfies the fixed end boundary conditions(FBCs), we calculate LNs, MIs at several locations in $U$, compare them, especially corner functions with the values obtained in the PBCs case, and examine the effect of the fixed ends. In addition, we examine Renyi entropies for sets of three dimensional lattice sites, the corner functions and the edge terms with solid angles and dihedral angles $\pi/2,\pi/4$, respectively.

Title: Q-DPTS: Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting via Variational Quantum Circuits
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen
Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.

Title: Optimal Qubit Purification and Unitary Schur Sampling via Random SWAP Tests
Authors: Shrigyan Brahmachari, Austin Hulse, Henry D. Pfister, Iman Marvian
Abstract: The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.

Title: Factorizability of multi-party quantum sequence discrimination under local operations and classical communication
Authors: Donghoon Ha, Jeong San Kim
Abstract: We consider multi-party quantum sequence discrimination under local operations and classical communication(LOCC), and provide conditions under which the optimal LOCC discrimination of a multi-party quantum sequence ensemble can be factorized into that of each individual ensemble. In other words, the optimal LOCC discrimination of a multi-party quantum sequence ensemble can be achieved just by performing optimal LOCC discrimination independently at each step of the quantum sequence. We also illustrate through examples of multi-party quantum states that such factorizability of optimal LOCC discrimination is possible. We further establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the optimal LOCC discrimination of a multi-party quantum state ensemble can be realized just by guessing the state with the largest probability. Our results can provide a useful application to investigate the fundamental limits of quantum data hiding.

Title: Quantum State Preparation for Medical Data: Comprehensive Methods, Implementation Challenges, and Clinical Prospects
Authors: Nikhil Kumar Rajput, Riya Bansal
Abstract: Quantum computing holds transformative potential for medical applications, yet efficiently preparing quantum states from complex medical data remains a fundamental challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of current approaches for encoding medical information into quantum systems, analyzing theoretical principles, algorithmic advancements, and practical limitations. It discusses tensor network decomposition, variational quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning techniques, and specialized error mitigation strategies for medical computing. The findings indicate that quantum advantages in medicine rely on leveraging inherent data structures such as spatial correlations in imaging, temporal patterns in physiological signals, and hierarchical biological organization. While current hardware restricts implementations to small-scale problems, emerging methods show potential for near-term use. The study provides a structured framework for assessing when quantum state preparation outperforms classical approaches in medicine, along with implementation guidelines and performance benchmarks.

Title: One-sided composite cavity on an optical nanocapillary fiber
Authors: Srinu Gadde, Jelba John, Ramachandrarao Yalla
Abstract: We numerically report a one-sided cavity on an optical nanocapillary fiber (NCF) using a composite cavity. The composite cavity is formed by combining an optical NCF and an asymmetric defect mode grating. We design the cavity to realize the maximum channeling efficiency of up to 80% into one-sided NCF-guided modes while operating from under- to critical- and overcoupling regimes. For the maximum channeling efficiency case, we found the best quality factor, finesse, and one-pass loss of the cavity are 19354, 240, and 1.3%, respectively. The present platform may open a novel route for designing fiber-based deterministic single-photon sources in quantum technologies.

Title: Explicit Instances of Quantum Tanner Codes
Authors: Rebecca Katharina Radebold, Stephen D. Bartlett, Andrew C. Doherty
Abstract: We construct several explicit instances of quantum Tanner codes, a class of asymptotically good quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes. The codes are constructed using dihedral groups and random pairs of classical codes and exhibit high encoding rates, relative distances, and pseudo-thresholds. Using the BP+OSD decoder, we demonstrate good performance in the phenomenological and circuit-level noise settings, comparable to the surface code with similar distances. Finally, we conduct an analysis of the space-time overhead incurred by these codes.

Title: Quantum Path Signatures
Authors: Samuel Crew, Cristopher Salvi, William F. Turner, Thomas Cass, Antoine Jacquier
Abstract: We elucidate physical aspects of path signatures by formulating randomised path developments within the framework of matrix models in quantum field theory. Using tools from physics, we introduce a new family of randomised path developments and derive corresponding loop equations. We then interpret unitary randomised path developments as time evolution operators on a Hilbert space of qubits. This leads to a definition of a quantum path signature feature map and associated quantum signature kernel through a quantum circuit construction. In the case of the Gaussian matrix model, we study a random ensemble of Pauli strings and formulate a quantum algorithm to compute such kernel.

Title: Current comparator for both AC and DC ratio measurements with 10-8-level accuracy

Abstract: Accurate measurements of alternating current (AC) and direct current(DC) ratios are fundamental to electric power metrology. However, conventional current comparators for AC and DC typically rely on distinct technologies-electromagnetic induction for AC and superconducting quantum interference devices for DC. This technological divide leads to a fragmented and complex traceability system. Bridging this gap is critical for developing unified current standards that meet the demands of emerging power technologies. In this work, we present a compact, room-temperature AC/DC current comparator that integrates a diamond-based magnetometer using nitrogen-vacancy centers. The device achieves an accuracy of 10-8 for both AC and DC signals and supports a system bandwidth up to 300 Hz, without the need for cryogenics. It surpasses the performance of typical AC comparators, offering ten-fold higher accuracy, and matches that of state-of-the-art DC comparators. This unified, cryogenics-free solution not only enhances precision and versatility but also expands the applicability of the system to DC resistance bridges in quantum electrical standards.

Title: Hybrid quantum tensor networks for aeroelastic applications

Abstract: We investigate the application of hybrid quantum tensor networks to aeroelastic problems, harnessing the power of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.

Title: Exploring Satellite Quantum Key Distribution under Atmospheric Constraints
Authors: Aditya Ajith, S. Saravana Veni
Abstract: Satellite Quantum Key Distribution creates a pathway for secure global communication with a level of security that is peerless. However, ground-to-satellite Quantum Key Distribution links are degraded due to the atmospheric turbulence. This paper gives a numerical framework using angular spectrum propagation, Hufnagel-Valley model of turbulence and Von Karman phase screens and takes into account the static losses introduced due to the absorption of the beam by the different elements and compounds in the atmosphere like O2, CO2 and H2O. This simulation propagates a Gaussian beam step by step through the atmosphere, where we incorporate the phase distortions using phase screens based on standard Cn2 profiles which take into account losses such as scintillation and beam wander. We simulate the BB84 protocol with decoy states for added security. The results of the simulation quantify the expected link budget and Secure key rates over a range of distances to measure the viability of Free Space Optical Quantum Key Distribution links at different distances.

Abstract: Quantum networks will rely on photons entangled to robust, local quantum registers for computation and error correction. We demonstrate control of and entanglement in a fully connected three-qubit $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spin register in diamond. The register is coupled to a quasi-free electron spin-1/2 of a silicon-vacancy center (SiV). High strain decouples the SiVs electron spin from spin-orbit interaction reducing the susceptibility to phonons at liquid helium temperature. As a result, the electron spin lifetime of hundreds of milli seconds enables sensing of nuclear-nuclear couplings down to few hertz. To detect and control the register we leverage continuous decoupling using shaped, low-power microwave and direct radio frequency driving. Furthermore, we implement a nuclear spin conditional phase-gate on the electron spin to mediate bipartite entanglement. This approach presents an alternative to dynamically decoupled nuclear spin entanglement, not limited by the electron spin's 1/2 nature, opening up new avenues to an optically-accessible, solid-state quantum register.

Title: Towards integrated sensors for optimized OCT with undetected photons
Authors: Franz Roeder, René Pollmann, Viktor Quiring, Christof Eigner, Benjamin Brecht, Christine Silberhorn
Abstract: The development of practical sensors for optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons requires miniaturization via integration. To be practical, these sensors must exhibit a large spectral bandwidth and a high brightness, which are linked to a high axial resolution and a sufficient signal to noise ratio, respectively. Here, we combine these requirements in a scheme for OCT-measurements with undetected photons based on nonlinear Ti:LiNbO$_3$ waveguides. We investigate the performance benchmarks of the commonly used SU(1,1) scheme in comparison to an induced coherence scheme and find that the latter is actually better suited when implementing measurements with undetected photons in integrated systems. In both schemes, we perform pump gain optimization and OCT measurements with undetected photons with an axial resolution as low as 28 $\mathrm{\mu}$m.

Title: Material-Driven Optimization of Transmon Qubits for Scalable and Efficient Quantum Architectures
Authors: Jonnalagadda Gayatri, S.Saravana Veni
Abstract: One of the most crucial steps in creating practical quantum computers is designing scalable and efficient superconducting qubits. Coherence times, connections between individual qubits, and reduction of environmental noise are critical factors in the success of these qubits. Because they can be lithographically fabricated and are less sensitive to charge noise, superconducting qubits, especially those based on the Transmon architecture, have emerged as top contenders for scalable platforms. In this work, we use a combination of design iteration, material analysis, and simulation to tackle the superconducting qubit optimization challenge. We created transmon-based layouts for 4 qubits and 8 qubits using Qiskit Metal and conducted an individual analysis for each qubit. We investigated anharmonicity and extracted eigenfrequencies, computing participation ratios across several design passes, and identifying the top five energy eigenstates using Ansys HFSS. We then created a 2D cross section of a single qubit design in COMSOL Multiphysics to evaluate how different materials affect performance. This enables us to assign various superconducting materials and substrates and investigate their effects on energy loss and electromagnetic properties. Qubit coherence and overall device quality are significantly influenced by the materials chosen. This integrated framework of material based simulation and circuit design offers a workable way to create reliable superconducting qubit systems and supports continued attempts to create scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: Geometric quantum encoding of a turbulent field
Authors: Zhaoyuan Meng, Yue Yang
Abstract: The chaotic structure of multiscale systems presents a formidable challenge to their quantum encoding. We propose a three-stage hyperspherical encoding method for turbulent fields. This method comprises a symmetry-preserving perturbation of the ground state, a measurement-specific convolution, and a final deconvolution of observables. The latter two stages employ the Hopf fibration to map quantum observables onto vortex tubes, the building blocks of fluid turbulence. Using 27 qubits, we generate an instantaneous turbulent field at a Reynolds number of $\mathit{Re} = 13900$ that reproduces the energy spectrum with Kolmogorov's five-thirds scaling, tangled vortex structures, and strong intermittency. The method only requires $\mathcal{O}(\log_2\mathit{Re})$ qubits, which is asymptotically optimal for turbulent-field encoding. This yields an exponential memory reduction over classical methods, and enables state preparation for large-scale quantum simulation of multiscale systems.

Title: Secure and practical Quantum Digital Signatures
Authors: Federico Grasselli, Gaetano Russo, Massimiliano Proietti
Abstract: Digital signatures represent a crucial cryptographic asset that must be protected against quantum adversaries. Quantum Digital Signatures (QDS) can offer solutions that are information-theoretically (IT) secure and thus immune to quantum attacks. In this work, we analyze three existing practical QDS protocols based on preshared secure keys (e.g., established with quantum key distribution) and universal hashing families. For each protocol, we make amendments to close potential loopholes and prove their IT security while accounting for the failure of IT-secure authenticated communication. We then numerically optimize the protocol parameters to improve efficiency in terms of preshared bit consumption and signature length, allowing us to identify the most efficient protocol.

Title: Resource-Efficient Synthesis of Sparse Quantum States
Authors: Renaud Vilmart, Sunheang Ty, Chetra Mang
Abstract: Preparing a quantum circuit that implements a given sparse state is an important building block that is necessary for many different quantum algorithms. In the context of fault-tolerant quantum computing, the so-called non-Clifford gates are much more expensive to perform than the Clifford ones. We hence provide an algorithm for synthesizing sparse quantum states with a special care for quantum resources. The circuit depth, ancilla count, and crucially non-Clifford count of the circuit produced by the algorithm are all linear in the sparsity. We conjecture that the non-Clifford count complexity is tight, and show a weakened version of this claim. The first key component of the algorithm is the synthesis of a generalized W-state. We provide a tree-based circuit construction approach, and the relationship between the tree's structure and the circuit's complexity. The second key component is a classical reversible circuit implementing a permutation that maps the basis states of the W-state to those of the sparse quantum state. We reduce this problem to the diagonalization of a binary matrix, using a specific set of elementary matrix operations corresponding to the classical reversible gates. We then solve this problem using a new version of Gauss-Jordan elimination, that minimizes the circuit complexities including circuit depth using parallel elimination steps.

Title: Quantum State Preparation Of Multiconfigurational States For Quantum Chemistry
Authors: Gabriel Greene-Diniz, Georgia Prokopiou, David Zsolt Manrique, David Muñoz Ramo
Abstract: The ability to prepare states for quantum chemistry is a promising feature of quantum computers, and efficient techniques for chemical state preparation is an active area of research. In this paper, we implement and investigate two methods of quantum circuit preparation for multiconfigurational states for quantum chemical applications. It has previously been shown that controlled Givens rotations are universal for quantum chemistry. To prepare a selected linear combination of Slater determinants (represented as occupation number configurations) using Givens rotations, the gates that rotate between the reference and excited determinants need to be controlled on qubits outside the excitation (external controls), in general. We implement a method to automatically find the external controls required for utilizing Givens rotations to prepare multiconfigurational states on a quantum circuit. We compare this approach to an alternative technique that exploits the sparsity of the chemical state vector and find that the latter can outperform the method of externally controlled Givens rotations; highly reduced circuits can be obtained by taking advantage of the sparse nature (where the number of basis states is significantly less than 2$^{n_q}$ for $n_q$ qubits) of chemical wavefunctions. We demonstrate the benefits of these techniques in a range of applications, including the ground states of a strongly correlated molecule, matrix elements of the Q-SCEOM algorithm for excited states, as well as correlated initial states for a quantum subspace method based on quantum computed moments and quantum phase estimation.

Title: LLM-based Multi-Agent Copilot for Quantum Sensor
Authors: Rong Sha, Binglin Wang, Jun Yang, Xiaoxiao Ma, Chengkun Wu, Liang Yan, Chao Zhou, Jixun Liu, Guochao Wang, Shuhua Yan, Lingxiao Zhu
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active learning, and uncertainty quantification for quantum sensor design and diagnosis. Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated 10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation. Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in multi-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale quantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information systems.

Title: Block entanglement bounds distribution of regionally localized entanglement
Authors: Jithin G. Krishnan, Aditi Sen De, Amit Kumar Pal
Abstract: In quantum networks, eliminating connections between nodes is crucial to mitigate the effects of decoherence, often achieved by performing measurements on nodes that are idle, or vulnerable to noise. To characterize the entanglement content of the resulting smaller network, we introduce the notion of ``regionally localized entanglement", defined as the average entanglement concentrated over a two-qubit region in a multi-qubit system. Hence, the total regionally localized entanglement can be obtained by considering all two-qubit regions sharing a common qubit, referred to as the ``hub". We prove that the total regionally localized entanglement corresponding to a specific hub is bounded above and below via the localizable block entanglement shared between the hub and the rest of the multi-qubit system for a number of paradigmatic pure quantum states, including permutation-symmetric states and arbitrary superposition of states from a specific magnetization sector. Numerical simulations confirm that the bounds for permutation-symmetric pure states remain valid even for Haar-uniformly generated pure states, and when each of the qubits is sent through local phase-flip channels of Markovian and non-Markovian types, except when the system-size is small. On the other hand, arbitrary states from a particular magnetization sector yield bounds on total regionally localized entanglement that are distinct from the permutation-symmetric states, highlighting the structurally unique entanglement properties of the former.

Title: Efficient certification of high-dimensional entanglement
Authors: Yiwen Wu, Zihao Li, Huangjun Zhu
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement (HDE) is a valuable resource in quantum information processing, and efficient certification of HDE is crucial to many applications. In this work, we propose a simple and general framework for certifying HDE in general bipartite pure states under restricted operations, such as local operations and classical communication (LOCC). On this basis we show that HDE in general bipartite pure states can be certified efficiently. Moreover, the sample cost for certifying a given degree of HDE even decreases monotonically with the local dimensions. In addition, for a general two-qubit pure state, we construct an optimal entanglement certification strategy based on separable operations, which can be realized by LOCC when the target state has sufficiently high entanglement. The core concept of our framework is versatile and can be extended to certify a wide range of critical resources under restricted operations.

Title: Efficient Mediated Multiparty Semi-Quantum Secret Sharing Protocol Based on Single-Qubit Reordering
Authors: Mustapha Anis Younes, Sofia Zebboudj, Abdelhakim Gharbi
Abstract: Typical multiparty semi-quantum secret sharing (MSQSS) protocols require the dealer to possess full quantum capabilities, while the classical users usually need to perform three operations. To address this practical limitation, this paper introduces a new mediated MSQSS protocol that enables Alice, a classical user, to share a secret with $M$ classical Bobs, with the assistance of an untrusted third party (TP) who may attempt any possible attack to steal Alice's secret. Furthermore, the classical participants require only two capabilities instead of three, namely: (a) performing measurements in the $Z$ basis; and (b) reordering qubits. The proposed scheme offers significant advantages over existing mediated QSS protocols: (1) it is the first mediated SQSS protocol to adopt single qubits, instead of entangled states, as the quantum resource, which makes it more practical and easier to implement; (2) It achieves higher qubit efficiency. Security analysis also demonstrates that the protocol is secure against well-known attacks.

Title: $Λ$-Type Giant Atom Mediated Controllable Single-Photon Transport in a One-Dimensional Chiral Waveguide
Authors: Yimei Wang, Jing Li, Jing Lu, Lan Zhou
Abstract: We investigate the single-photon scattering spectrum of a driven $\Lambda$-type giant atom system chirally coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide. By employing a real-space scattering approach, we obtain analytical solutions for the scattering amplitudes that remain valid in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. We observe that an external driving field induces a splitting of the transmission spectrum's dip into double dips, with the distance between the two dips increasing as the strength of the driving field increases. The chiral nature of the coupling allows for controlled switching between complete transmission and perfect reflection of incident photons. In the Markovian limit, we predict robust perfect transmission at specific phase values, independent of the driving field this http URL, in the non-Markovian regime, as the size of the giant atom increases, the oscillatory behavior of the scattering spectrum becomes more pronounced. Adjusting the giant atom size enables control over the number of decoupling points as well as the number of complete reflection points.

Title: Logical accreditation: a framework for efficient certification of fault-tolerant computations
Authors: James Mills, Adithya Sireesh, Dominik Leichtle, Joschka Roffe, Elham Kashefi
Abstract: As fault-tolerant quantum computers scale, certifying the accuracy of computations performed with encoded logical qubits will soon become classically intractable. This creates a critical need for scalable, device-independent certification methods. In this work, we introduce logical accreditation, a framework for efficiently certifying quantum computations performed on logical qubits. Our protocol is robust against general noise models, far beyond those typically considered in performance analyses of quantum error-correcting codes. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that logical accreditation can scalably certify quantum advantage experiments and indicate the crossover point where encoded computations begin to outperform physical computations. Logical accreditation can also find application in evaluating whether logical circuit error rates are sufficiently low that error mitigation can be efficiently performed, extending the entropy benchmarking method to the regime of fault-tolerant computation, and upper-bounding the infidelity of the logical output state. Underpinning the framework is a novel randomised compiling scheme that converts arbitrary logical circuit noise into stochastic Pauli noise. This scheme includes a method for twirling non-transversal logical gates beyond the standard T-gate, resolving an open problem posed by Piveteau et al. [Piveteau et al. PRL 127, 200505 (2001)]. By bridging fault-tolerant computation and computational certification, logical accreditation offers a practical tool to assess the quality of computations performed on quantum hardware using encoded logical qubits.

Title: Model-based framework for automated quantification of error sources in quantum state tomography
Authors: Junpei Oba, Hsin-Pin Lo, Yasuhiro Yamada, Takayuki Matsui, Takuya Ikuta, Yuya Yonezu, Toshimori Honjo, Seiji Kajita, Hiroki Takesue
Abstract: High-quality quantum state generation is essential for advanced quantum information processing, including quantum communication, quantum sensing, and quantum computing. In practice, various error sources degrade the quality of quantum states, and quantum state tomography (QST) is a standard diagnostic tool. However, in QST, multiple error sources gather in a single density matrix, making it difficult to identify individual error sources. To address this problem, we propose an automated method for quantifying error sources by combining simulation and parameter optimization to reproduce the experimental density matrix. We focus on the experimental generation of time-bin entangled photon pairs, for which we model the relevant error sources and simulate the density matrix with adjustable model parameters, thereby optimizing the parameters and minimizing the trace distance to the experimental data. Optimization of the parameters reduced the trace distance from 0.177 to 0.024, indicating that our modeled error sources explain 86% of the errors. Reducing the predicted error sources improves the state quality, consistent with our predictions and thus validating the proposed method. In addition, the modular structure of this framework makes it applicable to other quantum platforms, such as superconducting qubits, atoms, and solid-state spins.

Title: Joint parameter estimation and multidimensional reconciliation for CV-QKD
Authors: Jisheng Dai, Xue-Qin Jiang, Peng Huang, Tao Wang, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: Accurate quantum channel parameter estimation is essential for effective information reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators rely on a large amount of discarded data (or pilot symbols), leading to a significant loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.

Title: On the Design of Expressive and Trainable Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning Models
Authors: Han-Xiao Tao, Xin Wang, Re-Bing Wu
Abstract: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that has no barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving trainability. We present a necessary condition pertaining to the system's initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings establish a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that balance expressivity and trainability.

Title: Quench dynamics of entanglement entropy under projective charge measurements: the free fermion case
Authors: Riccardo Travaglino, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: We consider the effect of projective measurements on the quench dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy in one dimensional free fermionic systems. In our protocol, we consider projective measurements of a $U(1)$ conserved charge, the particle number, on some large subsystem, and study the entanglement entropies between the same subsystem and its complement. We compare the dynamics emanating from two classes of initial states, one which is an eigenstate of the charge and another which is not. Moreover, we consider the effects of a single measurement as well as multiple which are periodically performed. Using the quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytic expressions for the behaviour of the entanglement which admit a transparent physical interpretation. In general, we find that measurements introduce two distinct types of corrections to the entanglement, which can be interpreted separately as classical and quantum contributions. The classical contribution is independent of the measurement outcome and scales logarithmically with variance of the charge distribution. In contrast, the quantum contribution depends on the specific measurement outcome and can be significant for individual realizations; however, it becomes negligible when averaged over all possible outcomes. Our expressions reduce to previously known results for symmetry resolved entanglement and full counting statistics in some relevant limits, and are confirmed by an exact calculation performed on the Néel initial state.

Title: Secure Quantum Key Distribution via Entangled Quantum Walkers
Authors: Chia-Tso Lai
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an emerging cryptographic method designed for secure key sharing. Its security is theoretically guaranteed by fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, making it a leading candidate for future communication protocols. Quantum Random Walks (QRWs), on the other hand, are quantum processes that exhibit intriguing phenomena such as interference and superposition, enabling the generation of decentralized and asymmetric probability distributions. Inspired by both fields of study, we propose a novel QKD protocol based on two entangled quantum walkers. Our protocol exploits the unique correlations between the walkers at extremal positions of the walk to establish secret keys shared exclusively by the two parties. The security of the protocol is augmented by analyzing the joint probability distributions of the walkers' measured positions and their associated coin states.

Title: Ultra-Large-Scale Compilation and Manipulation of Quantum Circuits with Pandora
Authors: Ioana Moflic, Alexandru Paler
Abstract: There is an enormous gap between what quantum circuit sizes can be compiled and manipulated with the current generation of quantum software and the sizes required by practical applications such as quantum chemistry or Shor's algorithm. We present Pandora, an efficient, open-source, multithreaded, high-performance-computing-enabled tool based on circuit rewrites. Pandora can be used for quantum circuit equivalence checking, full compilations of large circuits, and scalable, streaming quantum resource estimation frameworks. Pandora can easily handle billions of gates and can stream circuit partitions in resource estimation pipelines at very high rates. We utilized Pandora for full compilations of Fermi-Hubbard 100x100 and 1024-bit Shor's algorithm circuits. Compared to TKET and Qiskit, we determine a performance advantage for manipulating circuits of more than 10000 gates. For equivalence checking tasks, Pandora outperforms this http URL on specific circuits that have more than 32 qubits. The performance and versatility of Pandora open novel paths in quantum software.

Title: Partial projected ensembles and spatiotemporal structure of information scrambling
Authors: Saptarshi Mandal, Pieter W. Claeys, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.

Title: Quantum panprotopsychism and a consciousness-centered universe
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini
Abstract: In previous publications, we have argued that a form of panprotopsychism based on quantum states and events offers a solution to the combination problem. This framework explains the emergence of complex phenomenal qualities and conscious subjects. Furthermore, the inherent openness of quantum mechanics allows consciousness and, more generally, phenomenal properties to exert a causal influence. If the view proposed by quantum panprotopsychism is valid, it suggests that we inhabit a consciousness-centered universe. A world whose fundamental nature is phenomenal. This is at odds with the current view about the human condition that was strongly influenced by a science based on classical mechanicism, and led to nihilism and existentialism in late 19th-century Europe, and more recently to the rise of anti-foundationalists perspectives. The centrality of consciousness resulting from the incorporation of a quantum ontology into our worldview leads us to reconsider the nihilistic view and conclude that we live in a world in which a precise physical order leads to people capable of accessing a transcendent phenomenal realm.

Title: Alz-QNet: A Quantum Regression Network for Studying Alzheimer's Gene Interactions
Authors: Debanjan Konar, Neerav Sreekumar, Richard Jiang, Vaneet Aggarwal
Abstract: Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease (AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge. Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1 ($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$, $FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database $GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions, shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or regulators for theranostics.

Title: Unstable periodic orbits galore and quantum hyperscarring in highly frustrated magnets
Authors: Andrea Pizzi, Claudio Castelnovo, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Highly frustrated magnets, with their macroscopically-degenerate classical ground states and massively-entangled quantum spin liquid phases, have been pivotal to the development of modern condensed matter concepts such as emergent symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. The effects of frustration and massive degeneracies at high energy, where the many-body dynamics becomes chaotic, have hitherto been far less explored. Here, we identify a high-energy dynamical analog of highly-frustrated magnetism, in the form of an extensive manifold of classical ''interaction-suppressing'' configurations giving rise to unstable periodic orbits. These are in general neither protected by symmetry nor integrability, and emerge from a set of dynamical local constraints that effectively nullify the interactions while allowing extensively many local degrees of freedom. The proliferation of unstable periodic orbits corresponds in the quantum case to ''hyperscarring'', that is, quantum scarring on exponentially many unstable periodic orbits. On the product states associated to the latter, the amplitudes of the mid-spectrum thermal eigenstates exhibit a power-law distribution, in stark contrast to the expected exponential Porter-Thomas distribution that holds for generic product states. Our results reveal a new constrained dynamical regime where many-body quantum chaos coexists with structured manifolds of coherent dynamics, and establishes a mechanism for hitherto elusive extensive scarring.

Title: Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions in Large $N$ Matrix Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Minjae Cho
Abstract: It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence, uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.

Title: Quantum-impurity sensing of altermagnetic order
Authors: V.A.S.V. Bittencourt, H. Hosseinabadi, J. Sinova, L. Šmejkal, J. Marino
Abstract: Quantum sensing with individual spin defects has emerged as a versatile platform to probe microscopic properties of condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate that quantum relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can reveal the anisotropic spin dynamics of altermagnetic insulators together with their characteristic spin polarised bands. We show that the distance and orientation dependent relaxation rate of a nearby quantum impurity encodes signatures of momentum space anisotropy in the spin diffusion response, a hallmark of altermagnetic order. This directional sensitivity is unprecedented in the landscape of quantum materials sensing, and it enables the distinction of altermagnets from conventional antiferromagnets via local, noninvasive measurements. Our results could spark new NV-sensing experiments on spin transport and symmetry breaking in altermagnets, and highlight the role of NV orientation to probe anisotropic phenomena in condensed matter systems.

Title: Scalar and spinor fields in gravitating cosmic string spacetimes
Authors: Marcos Silva, Azadeh Mohammadi
Abstract: We study the scattering behavior of scalar and spinor fields in the background of a gravitating cosmic string spacetime. The model explored here for the background vortex is non-abelian, becoming abelian in an appropriate limiting case. We adopted the formalism we developed in \cite{silva2021scattering}, modifying the standard partial wave approach. We apply the method for a scalar and also a fermion field interacting with the background spacetime with a nontrivial asymptotic structure. The spacetime metric, obtained numerically in \cite{de2015gravitating}, forms the basis of our state-of-the-art numerical study. We make an exhaustive analysis and compare all the results in the non-abelian model with the corresponding abelian one for both massless and massive fields. We analyze the field configuration's total cross-section and angular profile at small and large distances from the core. We show that the total cross-section oscillates with the incident momentum of the wave, as anticipated in \cite{silva2021scattering}, and also, the angular profile can be explained reasonably well with a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, especially for the scalar field scattering.

Title: Chern junctions in Moiré-Patterned Graphene/PbI2
Authors: Sun Yan, M. Monteverde, V. Derkach, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, F. Chiodi, H. Bouchiat, A.D. Chepelianskii
Abstract: Expanding the moiré material library continues to unlock novel quantum phases and emergent electronic behaviors. In this work, we introduce PbI2 into the moiré family and investigate the magnetotransport properties of moiré superlattice in a hexagonal boron nitride/graphene/PbI2 heterostructures. In high-field quantum Hall regime, we observe a robust dissipationless transport at charge neutrality point, indicative of incompressible states stabilized at the filling factor vh = 0. Additionally, a fractional conductance plateau at 2/3 e2/h emerges, which we attribute to a Chern junction between domains with distinct Chern numbers originating from moiré-modulated and conventional integer quantum Hall states. The moiré Hofstadter spectrum displays an unconventional flavor sequence, likely influenced by proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling from the PbI2 layer. We also see coherent electronic interference along lines with Chern number vm = -2. These findings position PbI2-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for realizing spin-orbit-enhanced moiré phenomena and engineering coherent edge transport in two-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Generalized Wigner-Smith theory for perturbations at exceptional and diabolic point degeneracies
Authors: Kaiyuan Wang, Niall Byrnes, Matthew R. Foreman
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies, including diabolic (DP) and exceptional (EP) points, exhibit unique sensitivity to external perturbations, enabling powerful control and engineering of wave phenomena. We present a residue-based perturbation theory that quantifies complex resonance splitting of DP and EP type spectral degeneracies using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We validate our theory using both analytic Hamiltonian models and numerical electromagnetic simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement across a range of cases. Our approach accurately predicts degenerate resonance splitting using only scattering data, offering a powerful framework for precision tuning, inverse design, and practical exploitation of non-Hermitian phenomena.

Title: Entanglement measures for causally connected subregions and holography
Authors: XiangKun Gong, Wu-zhong Guo, Jin Xu
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate entanglement for causally connected subregions $A$ and $B$ in quantum field theory and holography. Recent developments have established that a transition operator $T_{AB}$ can be well-defined for such subregions, which is generally non-Hermitian. By employing the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and the real-time replica method, we show how to construct $T_{AB}$ and compute associated entanglement measures. In certain configurations, this leads to a notion of timelike entanglement entropy, for which we provide explicit quantum field theory computations and propose a holographic dual via analytic continuation from the Euclidean setup. Both analytical and numerical results are compared and found consistent. If entanglement between causally connected subregions is to be meaningful, it should also be able to define other entanglement measures. Motivated by the spacelike case, we propose a timelike extension of the entanglement wedge cross section, though we do not expect it to carry the same physical interpretation. In AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we compute explicit examples and find that the timelike entanglement wedge cross section is generally positive. Furthermore, we show that the reflected entropy for timelike intervals -- obtained via analytic continuation of twist correlators -- coincides with twice the timelike entanglement wedge cross section at leading order in $G$, supporting a holographic duality in the timelike case. We also discuss the extension of other entanglement measures, such as logarithmic negativity, to timelike separated regions using replica methods. We highlight conceptual challenges in defining reflected entropy via canonical purification for non-Hermitian operators.

Title: Observe novel tricritical phenomena in self-organized Fermi gas induced by higher order Fermi surface nesting
Authors: Yilun Xu, Feng-Xiao Sun, Qiongyi He
Abstract: Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.

Title: Third harmonic-mediated amplification in TWPA
Authors: E. Rizvanov, S. Kern, P. Neilinger, M. Grajcar
Abstract: In Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers, higher-order harmonics of the pump tone and its sidebands are commonly present and typically regarded as parasitic. Consequently, most design efforts have focused on suppressing these harmonics. In spite of that, motivated by transient simulations, we extend the coupled-mode theory and demonstrate that, contrary to conventional belief, the third harmonic can enhance amplifier performance, improving both gain and bandwidth. We show that the recently developed plasma oscillation-based amplifier is particularly well-suited for exploiting this effect. Their dispersion relation enables us to observe the phenomenon in transient numerical simulations using JoSIM and WRspice. These simulations reveal improvement of the amplifier's performance, specifically the doubling of the bandwidth and an increase in the gain.

Title: Quantum many-body scarring from Kramers-Wannier duality
Authors: Weslei B. Fontana, Fabrizio G. Oliviero, Yi-Ping Huang
Abstract: Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding conditions for scarring. This is supported by striking agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra. Our results suggest that non-invertible dualities provide both a generative mechanism for new QMBS and a diagnostic for their stability.

Title: Krylov exponents and power spectra for maximal quantum chaos: an EFT approach
Authors: Saskia Demulder, Maria Knysh, Andrew Rolph
Abstract: We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.

Title: Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing
Authors: Yan Xi Foo, Aisha Kermiche, Farhan T. Chowdhury, Clarice D. Aiello, Luke D. Smith
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.

Title: A streamlined quantum algorithm for topological data analysis with exponentially fewer qubits
Authors: Sam McArdle, András Gilyén, Mario Berta
Abstract: Topological invariants of a dataset, such as the number of holes that survive from one length scale to another (persistent Betti numbers) can be used to analyze and classify data in machine learning applications. We present an improved quantum algorithm for computing persistent Betti numbers, and provide an end-to-end complexity analysis. Our approach provides large polynomial time improvements, and an exponential space saving, over existing quantum algorithms. Subject to gap dependencies, our algorithm obtains an almost quintic speedup in the number of datapoints over previously known rigorous classical algorithms for computing the persistent Betti numbers to constant additive error - the salient task for applications. However, we also introduce a quantum-inspired classical power method with provable scaling only quadratically worse than the quantum algorithm. This gives a provable classical algorithm with scaling comparable to existing classical heuristics. We discuss whether quantum algorithms can achieve an exponential speedup for tasks of practical interest, as claimed previously. We conclude that there is currently no evidence for this being the case.

Title: Quantum Sensing with Topological-Paired Bound States
Authors: Tao Zhang, Peng Xu, Jiazhong Hu, Xingze Qiu
Abstract: We present an efficient and robust protocol for quantum-enhanced sensing using a single qubit in the topological waveguide system. Our method relies on the topological-paired bound states, which are localized near the qubit and can be effectively regarded as a two-level system. Through the lens of Bayesian inference theory, we show that the sensitivity can reach the Heisenberg limit across a large field range. Inheriting from the topological robustness of the waveguide, our sensing protocol is robust against local perturbations. Besides, our sensing protocol utilizes a product state as the initial state, which can be easily prepared in experiments. We expect this approach would pave the way toward robust topological quantum sensors based on near-term quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits and Rydberg arrays.

Title: Leveraging commuting groups for an efficient variational Hamiltonian ansatz
Authors: Abhinav Anand, Kenneth R. Brown
Abstract: Efficiently calculating the low-lying eigenvalues of Hamiltonians, written as sums of Pauli operators, is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. While various methods have been proposed to reduce the complexity of quantum circuits for this task, there remains room for further improvement. In this article, we introduce a new circuit design using commuting groups within the Hamiltonian to further reduce the circuit complexity of Hamiltonian-based quantum circuits. Our approach involves partitioning the Pauli operators into mutually commuting clusters and finding Clifford unitaries that diagonalize each cluster. We then design an ansatz that uses these Clifford unitaries for efficient switching between the clusters, complemented by a layer of parameterized single qubit rotations for each individual cluster. By conducting numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurately determining the ground state energy of different quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. Our results highlight the applicability and potential of our approach for designing problem-inspired ansatz for various quantum computing applications.

Title: Quantifying information flow in quantum processes
Authors: Leonardo S. V. Santos, Zhen-Peng Xu, Jyrki Piilo, Otfried Gühne
Abstract: We present a framework for quantifying information flow within general quantum processes. For this purpose, we introduce the signaling power of quantum channels and discuss its relevant operational properties. This function supports extensions to higher-order maps, enabling the evaluation of information flow in general quantum causal networks and also processes with indefinite causal order. Furthermore, our results offer a rigorous approach to information dynamics in open systems that applies also in the presence of initial system-environment correlations, and allows for the distinction between classical and quantum information backflow.

Title: Dynamical Logical Qubits in the Bacon-Shor Code
Authors: M. Sohaib Alam, Eleanor Rieffel
Abstract: The Bacon-Shor code is a quantum error correcting subsystem code composed of weight 2 check operators that admits a single logical qubit, and has distance $d$ on a $d \times d$ square lattice. We show that when viewed as a Floquet code, by choosing an appropriate measurement schedule of the check operators, it can additionally host several dynamical logical qubits. Specifically, we identify a period 4 measurement schedule of the check operators that preserves logical information between the instantaneous stabilizer groups. Such a schedule measures not only the usual stabilizers of the Bacon-Shor code, but also additional stabilizers that protect the dynamical logical qubits against errors. We show that the code distance of these Floquet-Bacon-Shor codes scales as $\Theta(d/\sqrt{k})$ on an $n = d \times d$ lattice with $k$ dynamical logical qubits, along with the logical qubit of the parent subsystem code. Unlike the usual Bacon-Shor code, the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code family introduced here can therefore saturate the subsystem bound $kd = O(n)$. Moreover, several errors are shown to be self-corrected purely by the measurement schedule itself. This work provides insights into the design space for dynamical codes and expands the known approaches for constructing Floquet codes.

Title: Conditional disclosure of secrets with quantum resources
Authors: Vahid R. Asadi, Kohdai Kuroiwa, Debbie Leung, Alex May, Sabrina Pasterski, Chris Waddell
Abstract: The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive is among the simplest cryptographic settings in which to study the relationship between communication, randomness, and security. CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret $z$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function $f$ has $f(x,y)=1$. Alice knows $x,z$, Bob knows $y$, and the referee knows $x,y$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to $f$-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. We begin by looking for quantum analogues of results already established in the classical CDS literature. Doing so we establish a number of basic properties of CDQS, including lower bounds on entanglement and communication stated in terms of measures of communication complexity. Because of the close relationship to the $f$-routing position-verification scheme, our results have relevance to the security of these schemes.

Title: An Early Investigation of the HHL Quantum Linear Solver for Scientific Applications
Authors: Muqing Zheng, Chenxu Liu, Samuel Stein, Xiangyu Li, Johannes Mülmenstädt, Yousu Chen, Ang Li
Abstract: In this paper, we explore using the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm to address scientific and engineering problems through quantum computing, utilizing the NWQSim simulation package on a high-performance computing platform. Focusing on domains such as power-grid management and climate projection, we demonstrate the correlations of the accuracy of quantum phase estimation, along with various properties of coefficient matrices, on the final solution and quantum resource cost in iterative and non-iterative numerical methods such as the Newton--Raphson method and finite difference method, as well as their impacts on quantum error correction costs using the Microsoft Azure Quantum resource estimator. We summarize the exponential resource cost from quantum phase estimation before and after quantum error correction and illustrate a potential way to reduce the demands on physical qubits. This work lays down a preliminary step for future investigations, urging a closer examination of quantum algorithms' scalability and efficiency in domain applications.

Title: Analyzing negativity criterion in qubit-qutrit system located in external magnetic fields with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
Authors: Seyed Mohsen Moosavi Khansari, Fazlollah Kazemi Hasanvand
Abstract: This investigation delves into the intricate entanglement dynamics exhibited by qubit-qutrit systems when subjected to the intricate dynamics of both the XXX isotropic Heisenberg model and the anisotropic XYZ model. These models are enriched by the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions and external magnetic fields, creating a complex interplay of quantum phenomena. The exploration commences by initializing the system in a superposition of spin-coherent states, setting the stage for a nuanced analysis of entanglement evolution over time. By employing the negativity metric as the pivotal criterion for assessing entanglement, we gain insights into the subtle relationships between DM interactions, external magnetic fields, and the entanglement dynamics within this composite system. Through this comprehensive investigation, we aim to unravel the intricate dynamics and behaviors that emerge from the interplay of these fundamental elements, shedding light on the underlying principles governing quantum entanglement in this context.

Title: Physically constrained quantum clock-driven dynamics
Authors: Lea Lautenbacher, Giovanni Spaventa, Dario Cilluffo, Susana F. Huelga, Martin B. Plenio
Abstract: Thermal machines are physical systems designed to convert thermal energy into practical work through cyclic state transformations. A key component in such a machine is a clock-equipped control element that dictates which interaction Hamiltonian governs the system-reservoir interactions at specific times, while itself remaining unaffected. However, in the context of quantum dynamics, it is well known that maintaining perfect isolation is practically impossible, except under highly idealized conditions. In this study, we begin with such an idealized model for a clock and systematically relax its main assumptions to develop a more realistic framework. Our approach yields a simplified yet physically consistent description of clock dynamics, enabling the analysis of deviations from ideal time-keeping, which we interpret as clock degradation. We introduce a continuous time operator to derive a lower bound on this degradation, grounded in a generalized time-energy uncertainty relation. These results highlight trade-offs between clock performance and energy uncertainty in physically realizable control schemes.

We show a scaling property of quantum dynamics on curved space-time where gravity plays an essential role. We derive system parameters which realize speed-controlled dynamics. Moreover, we consider spatial scaling and derive system parameters which realize spatially-scaled quantum dynamics.

Title: Quantifying the rotating-wave approximation of the Dicke model
Authors: Leonhard Richter, Daniel Burgarth, Davide Lonigro
Abstract: We analytically find quantitative, non-perturbative bounds to the validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) for the multi-atom generalization of the quantum Rabi model: the Dicke model. Precisely, we bound the norm of the difference between the evolutions of states generated by the Dicke model and its rotating-wave approximated counterpart, that is, the Tavis-Cummings model. The intricate role of the parameters of the model in determining the bounds is discussed and compared with numerical results. Our bounds are intrinsically state-dependent and, in particular, capture a nontrivial dependence on the total angular momentum of the initial state; this behaviour also seems to be confirmed by accompanying numerical results.

Title: Input-Output Optics as a Causal Time Series Mapping: A Generative Machine Learning Solution
Authors: Abhijit Sen, Bikram Keshari Parida, Kurt Jacobs, Denys I. Bondar
Abstract: The response of many-body quantum systems to an optical pulse can be extremely challenging to model. Here we explore the use of neural networks, both traditional and generative, to learn and thus simulate the response of such a system from data. The quantum system can be viewed as performing a complex mapping from an input time-series (the optical pulse) to an output time-series (the systems response) which is often also an optical pulse. Using both the transverse and non-integrable Ising models as examples, we show that not only can temporal convolutional networks capture the input/output mapping generated by the system but can also be used to characterize the complexity of the mapping. This measure of complexity is provided by the size of the smallest latent space that is able to accurately model the mapping. We further find that a generative model, in particular a variational auto-encoder, significantly outperforms traditional auto-encoders at learning the complex response of many-body quantum systems. For the example that generated the most complex mapping, the variational auto-encoder produces outputs that have less than 10% error for more than 90% of inputs across our test data.

Authors: Alasdair I. Fletcher, Cillian Harney, Masoud Ghalaii, Panagiotis Papanastasiou, Alexandros Mountogiannakis, Gaetana Spedalieri, Adnan A. E. Hajomer, Tobias Gehring, Stefano Pirandola
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.

Title: Dissipative quantum phase transitions monitored by current fluctuations
Authors: Masataka Matsumoto, Zi Cai, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions (DPT) are defined by sudden changes in the physical properties of nonequilibrium open quantum systems and they present characteristics that have no analog in closed and thermal systems. Several methods to detect and characterize DPT have been suggested in the literature, the most famous of which -- the $\textit{Liouvillian gap}$ -- can be derived from a spectral analysis of the Liouvillian super-operator that governs the complex interplay between coherent and dissipative dynamics. Here, we consider the $\textit{output current}$, defined as the average total quantum jumps per unit time between the open quantum system and the environment. We propose that output current fluctuations, and in particular their dynamical correlations, their power spectrum, and their characteristic timescale can provide valuable information about DPT, confirming a dramatic change of behavior at the critical point. We validate our proposal using the dissipative XYZ model and the nonlinear driven-dissipative Kerr model, showing good agreement with previous estimates of the location of the critical point. Compared to previous approaches, our proposal could be already experimentally tested in optical systems, providing a practical method to detect criticality in quantum open systems.

Title: Fidelity-Aware Multipath Routing for Multipartite State Distribution in Quantum Networks
Authors: Evan Sutcliffe, Alejandra Beghelli
Abstract: We consider the problem of distributing entangled multipartite states across a quantum network with improved distribution rate and fidelity. For this, we propose fidelity-aware multi-path routing protocols, assess their performance in terms of the rate and fidelity of the distributed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and compare such performance against that of single-path routing. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-path routing protocols select routes that require more Bell states compared to single-path routing, but also require fewer rounds of Bell state generation. We also optimised the trade-off between distribution rate and fidelity by selecting an appropriate cutoff to the quantum memory storage time. Using such a cutoff technique, the proposed multi-path protocols can achieve up to an 8.3 times higher distribution rate and up to a 28% improvement in GHZ state fidelity compared to single-path routing. These results show that multi-path routing both improves the distribution rates and enhances fidelity for multipartite state distribution.

Title: Tesseract: A Search-Based Decoder for Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Laleh Aghababaie Beni, Oscar Higgott, Noah Shutty
Abstract: Tesseract is a Most-Likely Error decoder designed for low-density-parity-check quantum error-correcting codes. Tesseract conducts a search through a graph on the set of all subsets of errors to find the lowest cost subset of errors consistent with the input syndrome. Although this graph is exponentially large, the search can be made efficient in practice for random errors using $A^*$ search technique along with a few pruning heuristics. We show through benchmark circuits for surface, color, and bivariate-bicycle codes that Tesseract is significantly faster than integer programming-based decoders while retaining comparable accuracy at moderate physical error rates. We also find that Tesseract can decode transversal CNOT protocols for surface codes on neutral atom quantum computers. Finally, we compare surface code and bivariate bicycle code circuits, finding that the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code is $14\times$ to $19\times$ more efficient than surface codes using our most-likely error decoding, whereas using correlated matching and BP+OSD decoders would have implied only a $10\times$ improvement. Assuming instead that long-range couplers are $10\times$ noisier, the improvement drops to around $4\times$ using Tesseract or $2\times$ using correlated matching and BP+OSD.

Title: Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics
Authors: Yu-Min Hu, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate that the crucial issue of diverging timescales in dissipative state preparation is largely tantamount to an asymptotic approach towards the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. With case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Formally treating the weight $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.

Title: An Adaptive Weighted QITE-VQE Algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization Problems
Authors: Ningyi Xie, Xinwei Lee, Tiejin Chen, Yoshiyuki Saito, Nobuyoshi Asai, Dongsheng Cai
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is an algorithm for finding the ground states of a given Hamiltonian. Its application to binary-formulated combinatorial optimization (CO) has been widely studied in recent years. However, typical VQE approaches for CO problems often suffer from local minima or barren plateaus, limiting their ability to achieve optimal solutions. The quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) offers an alternative approach for effective ground-state preparation but requires large circuits to approximate non-unitary operations. Although compressed QITE (cQITE) reduces circuit depth, accumulated errors eventually cause energy increases. To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Weighted QITE-VQE (AWQV) algorithm that integrates the VQE gradients with the cQITE updates through an adaptive weighting scheme during optimization. In numerical simulations for MaxCut on unweighted regular graphs, AWQV achieves near-optimal approximation ratios, while for weighted Erdős-Rényi instances, it outperforms the classical Goemans-Williamson algorithm.

Title: Simultaneous sweet-spot locking of gradiometric fluxonium qubits
Authors: Denis Bénâtre, Mathieu Féchant, Nicolas Zapata, Nicolas Gosling, Patrick Paluch, Thomas Reisinger, Ioan M. Pop
Abstract: Efforts to scale up superconducting processors that employ flux-qubits face numerous challenges, among which is the crosstalk created by neighboring flux lines, which are necessary to bias the qubits at the zero-field and $\Phi_0/2$ sweet spots. A solution to this problem is to use symmetric gradiometric loops, which incorporate a flux locking mechanism that, once a fluxon is trapped during cooldown, holds the device at the sweet spot and limits the need for active biasing. We demonstrate this technique by simultaneously locking multiple gradiometric fluxonium qubits in which an aluminum loop retains the trapped fluxon indefinitely. By compensating the inductive asymmetry between the two loops of the design, we are able to lock the effective flux-bias within $\Phi_{eff} = -3 \times 10^{-4} \Phi_0$ from the target, corresponding to only 15 % degradation in $T_{2,E}$ when operated in zero external field. The design strategy demonstrated here reduces integration complexity for flux qubits by minimizing cross-talk and potentially eliminating the need for local flux bias.

Title: Adam assisted Fully informed Particle Swarm Optimization ( Adam-FIPSO ) based Parameter Prediction for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
Authors: Shashank Sanjay Bhat, Peiyong Wang, Udaya Parampalli
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent variational algorithm used for solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the Max-Cut problem. A key challenge in QAOA lies in efficiently identifying suitable parameters (gamma, beta) that lead to high-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) with adaptive gradient correction using the Adam Optimizer to navigate the QAOA parameter space. This approach aims to avoid issues such as barren plateaus and convergence to local minima. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against two classes of graph instances, Erdos Renyi and Watts-Strogatz. Experimental results across multiple QAOA depths consistently demonstrate superior performance compared to random initialization, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization framework.

Title: A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit
Authors: T. H. Swift, F. Olivieri, G. Aizpurua-Iraola, J. Kirkman, G. M. Noah, M. de Kruijf, F. E. von Horstig, A. Gomez-Saiz, J. J. L. Morton, M. F. Gonzalez-Zalba
Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.

Title: Resource-Free Quantum Hamiltonian Learning Below the Standard Quantum Limit
Authors: Bora Baran, Timothy Heightman
Abstract: Accurate and resource-efficient estimation of quantum Hamiltonians is crucial for developing practical quantum technologies, yet current methods typically demand entanglement resources or dynamical control. Here, we demonstrate a method that surpasses the standard quantum limit without requiring entanglement resources, coherent measurements, or dynamical control. Our method relies on trajectory-based Hamiltonian learning, in which we apply local, randomized pre-processing to probe states and apply maximum-likelihood estimation to optimally scheduled Pauli measurements. Analytically, we establish the emergence of a transient Heisenberg-limited regime for short-time probes for our procedure. Furthermore, we outline how to estimate all Hamiltonian parameters in parallel using ensembles of probe states, removing the need for parameter isolation and structural priors. Finally, we supplement our findings with a numerical study, learning multiple disordered, anisotropic Heisenberg models for a 1D chain of spin-1/2 particles, featuring local transverse fields with both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbour interactions, as well as a gapless XXZ Hamiltonian. Our numerics show that our method needs only one shot per Pauli measurement, making it well-suited for experimental scenarios. The code for our method is available online and open-source.

Compared to a rigid baseline implementation, our approach yields a clear reduction in quantum resource requirements.

Title: Probing and Enhancing the Robustness of GNN-based QEC Decoders with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ryota Ikeda
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: Fault-tolerant Fusion-based Quantum Computing with the Four-legged Cat Code
Authors: Harshvardhan K. Babla, James D. Teoh, Jahan Claes, Daniel K. Weiss, Shraddha Singh, Robert J. Schoelkopf, Shruti Puri
Abstract: The four-legged cat code is a quantum error-correcting code designed to address the predominant error in bosonic modes: single-photon loss. It was the first such code to surpass the break-even point, thereby demonstrating the practical utility of quantum error correction. In this work, we propose a planar fault-tolerant architecture for this code by concatenating it with the XZZX code via fusion-based error-correction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 2D nearest-neighbor architecture for fault-tolerant fusion-based error-correction. We demonstrate how all the required operations, namely resource state preparation and Bell measurements, can be carried out using standard circuit-QED techniques, such as intercavity beam-splitter coupling, cavity displacements, cavity-transmon dispersive coupling, and transmon drives. We show analytically and numerically that all dominant hardware errors in the bosonic modes and control ancillae are corrected, to first-order, at the hardware level. Consequently, the outer XZZX code only needs to address smaller residual errors, which are quadratically suppressed, effectively doubling the architecture's fault-distance. Moreover, the performance of our architecture is not limited by unwanted nonlinearities such as cavity self-Kerr, and it avoids demanding coupling techniques like $\chi$-matching or high-order coupling. Overall, our architecture substantially reduces the hardware complexity needed to achieve fault tolerance with the four-legged cat code.

Title: A full dichotomy for Holant$^c$, inspired by quantum computation
Authors: Miriam Backens
Abstract: Holant problems are a family of counting problems parameterised by sets of algebraic-complex valued constraint functions, and defined on graphs. They arise from the theory of holographic algorithms, which was originally inspired by concepts from quantum computation. Here, we employ quantum information theory to explain existing results about holant problems in a concise way and to derive two new dichotomies: one for a new family of problems, which we call Holant$^+$, and, building on this, a full dichotomy for Holant$^c$. These two families of holant problems assume the availability of certain unary constraint functions -- the two pinning functions in the case of Holant$^c$, and four functions in the case of Holant$^+$ -- and allow arbitrary sets of algebraic-complex valued constraint functions otherwise. The dichotomy for Holant$^+$ also applies when inputs are restricted to instances defined on planar graphs. In proving these complexity classifications, we derive an original result about entangled quantum states.

Title: Qunity: A Unified Language for Quantum and Classical Computing (Extended Version)
Authors: Finn Voichick, Liyi Li, Robert Rand, Michael Hicks
Abstract: We introduce Qunity, a new quantum programming language designed to treat quantum computing as a natural generalization of classical computing. Qunity presents a unified syntax where familiar programming constructs can have both quantum and classical effects. For example, one can use sum types to implement the direct sum of linear operators, exception-handling syntax to implement projective measurements, and aliasing to induce entanglement. Further, Qunity takes advantage of the overlooked BQP subroutine theorem, allowing one to construct reversible subroutines from irreversible quantum algorithms through the uncomputation of "garbage" outputs. Unlike existing languages that enable quantum aspects with separate add-ons (like a classical language with quantum gates bolted on), Qunity provides a unified syntax and a novel denotational semantics that guarantees that programs are quantum mechanically valid. We present Qunity's syntax, type system, and denotational semantics, showing how it can cleanly express several quantum algorithms. We also detail how Qunity can be compiled into a low-level qubit circuit language like OpenQASM, proving the realizability of our design.

Title: Scaling of diffusion constants in perturbed easy-axis Heisenberg spin chains
Authors: Markus Kraft, Mariel Kempa, Jiaozi Wang, Sourav Nandy, Robin Steinigeweg
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the integrable spin-1/2 XXZ chain has witnessed substantial progress, due to the development and application of sophisticated analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, infinite-temperature magnetization transport has turned out to range from ballistic, over superdiffusive, to diffusive behavior in different parameter regimes of the anisotropy. Since integrability is rather the exception than the rule, a crucial question is the change of transport under integrability-breaking perturbations. This question includes the stability of superdiffusion at the isotropic point and the change of diffusion constants in the easy-axis regime. In our work, we study this change of diffusion constants by a variety of methods and cover both, linear response theory in the closed system and the Lindblad equation in the open system, where we throughout focus on periodic boundary conditions. In the closed system, we compare results from the recursion method to calculations for finite systems and find evidence for a continuous change of diffusion constants over the full range of perturbation strengths. In the open system weakly coupled to baths, we find diffusion constants in quantitative agreement with the ones in the closed system in a range of nonweak perturbations, but disagreement in the limit of weak perturbations. Using a simple model in this limit, we point out the possibility of a diverging diffusion constant in such an open system.

Title: Dirac-von Neumann Type Axiomatic Structure for Classical Electromagnetism
Authors: Daniel W. Piasecki
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a complex Hilbert Space with Hermitian operators for calculations in \textit{classical} electromagnetism that parallels the Hilbert Space of quantum mechanics. The axioms of this classical theory are the so-called Dirac-von Neumann axioms, however, with classical potentials in place of the wavefunction and the indeterministic collapse postulate removed. This approach lets us derive a variety of fundamental expressions for electromagnetism using minimal mathematics and a calculation sequence well-known for traditional quantum mechanics. We also demonstrate the existence of the wave commutation relationship $[\hat{x},\hat{k}]=i$, which is a unique classical analogue to the canonical commutator $[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$. The difference between classical and quantum mechanics lies in the presence of $\hbar$. The noncommutativity of observables for a classical theory simply reflects its wavenature. A classical analogue of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is developed for electromagnetic waves, and its implications discussed. Further comparisons between electromagnetism, Koopman-von Neumann-Sudarshan (KvNS) classical mechanics (for point particles), and quantum mechanics are made. Finally, supplementing the analysis presented, we additionally demonstrate an elegant, completely relativistic version of Feynman's proof of Maxwell's equations \citep{Dyson}. Unlike what \citet{Dyson} indicated, there is no need for Galilean relativity for the proof to work. This fits parsimoniously with our usage of classical Lie commutators for electromagnetism.

Title: Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires
Authors: Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. adding charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.

Title: Simulating Hawking radiation in quantum many-body systems: deviations from the thermal spectrum
Authors: Gokhan Alkac, Ege Özgün
Abstract: We investigate a recently proposed one-to-one correspondence between quantum field theories in two-dimensional curved spacetime and quantum many-body systems, which enables the simulation of Hawking radiation in static background spacetimes. In particular, we demonstrate that deviations from the thermal spectrum, as predicted by the well-known tunneling method, can be observed in many-body simulations.

Title: Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz and immiscible to miscible quenching instabilities in binary Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: R. Kishor Kumar, S. Sabari, Arnaldo Gammal, Lauro Tomio
Abstract: We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible to miscible quenching transition (IMQT), under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex productions and sound-wave (phonon) propagations. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number $k$. The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$, for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals. Deviating from the classical scaling, a kind of ``Bottleneck effect" is noticed in the IMQT spectra.

Title: Quantum hydrodynamics of a polariton fluid: pure energy relaxation terms
Authors: D. A. Saltykova, A. V. Yulin, I. A. Shelykh
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of Bose-Einstein condensate and superfluidity at remarkably high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.

Title: Self-consistent GW via conservation of spectral moments
Authors: Oliver J. Backhouse, Marcus K. Allen, Charles C. J. Scott, George H. Booth
Abstract: We expand on a recently introduced alternate framework for $GW$ simulation of charged excitations [Scott et. al., J. Chem. Phys., 158, 124102 (2023)], based around the conservation of directly computed spectral moments of the GW self-energy. Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other implementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism strategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to an established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in cost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$ variants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of all dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic continuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating a range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we find that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler coupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate self-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed evidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to higher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over these molecular test cases. Finally, we consider the Chlorophyll A molecule, finding agreement with experiment within the experimental uncertainty, and a description of the full-frequency spectrum of charged excitations.

Title: A note on Hall conductance and Hall conductivity in interacting Fermion systems
Authors: Stefan Teufel, Marius Wesle
Abstract: In this note we consider lattice fermions on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with a gapped ground state and show how to apply the NEASS approach to linear response to derive a formula for the Hall conductance in terms of the ground state expectation of a commutator of modified step functions. This formula is usually derived by a charge pumping argument going back to Laughlin. Here we show that it can also be obtained as the linear response coefficient of the microscopic current response to an adiabatic increase of the chemical potential on a half plane (or more generally on any cone-like region). Indeed, in a manner reminiscent of the bulk-boundary correspondence, we show that raising the chemical potential in any cone-like region gives rise to a current that flows along its boundary and is nearly linear in the increase in chemical potential. We also discuss the connection with the double commutator formula with modified position operators for the Hall conductivity derived in arXiv:2411.06967 as the linear response coefficient of the macroscopic current response to the adiabatic application of a constant electric field.

Title: Quantum-inspired algorithm for simulating viral response
Authors: Daria O. Konina, Dmitry I. Korbashov, Ilya V. Kovalchuk, Aygul A. Nizamieva, Dmitry A. Chermoshentsev, Aleksey K. Fedorov
Abstract: Understanding the properties of biological systems is an exciting avenue for applying advanced approaches to solving corresponding computational tasks. A specific class of problems that arises in the resolution of biological challenges is optimization. In this work, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study that applies a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to simulate a viral response. We formulate an Ising-type model to describe the patterns of gene activity in host responses. Reducing the problem to the Ising form allows the use of available quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools. We demonstrate the application of a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to this problem. Our study paves the way for exploring the full potential of quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools in biological applications.

Title: Enantioselective radical reactions can be induced by electron spin polarization: A quantum mechanism for Nature's emergent homochirality?
Authors: Thomas P Fay
Abstract: Biomolecules that constitute life on Earth are chiral, but the precise mechanism by which homochirality emerged remains a mystery. In this work it is demonstrated that reactions of radical pairs, where one of the radical electron spins is polarised, can be enantioselective. This phenomenon arises from transient coherent quantum dynamics of the radical pair electron spins, which is known to occur even in warm and noisy condensed phase environments, where energetic perturbations much smaller than thermal energy can have large effects on reactivity. A quantitative theory is presented based on the molecular theory of chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS), where electron exchange interactions and chirality-dependent spin-orbit coupling effects control enantioselectivity. This theory provides useful bounds on the maximum enantiomeric excess for these reactions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments. The enantioseletive radical pair mechanism presented here provides an alternative mechanistic basis to a recent proposal that spin-polarised photoelectrons from magnetite provided the initial chiral symmetry breaking necessary for the inception of homochirality in Nature, as well as suggests a new strategy for asymmetric synthesis using spin-polarised electrons.

Title: Automorphic equivalence within gapped phases of infinitely extended fermion systems
Authors: Lennart Becker, Stefan Teufel, Marius Wesle
Abstract: We prove automorphic equivalence within gapped phases of infinitely extended lattice fermion systems (as well as spin systems) with super-polynomially decaying interactions. As a simple application, we prove a version of Goldstone's theorem for such systems: if an infinite volume interaction is invariant under a continuous symmetry, then any gapped ground state is also invariant under that symmetry.

Title: Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice
Authors: Mahiro Futami
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.

Title: Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice
Authors: Yi-Ting Tu, David M. Long, Dominic V. Else
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.

Title: Quantum interferometry in external gravitational fields
Authors: Thomas B. Mieling, Thomas Morling, Christopher Hilweg, Philip Walther
Abstract: Current models of quantum interference experiments in external gravitational fields lack a common framework: while matter-wave interferometers are commonly described using the Schrödinger equation with a Newtonian potential, gravitational effects in quantum optics are modeled using either post-Newtonian metrics or highly symmetric exact solutions to Einstein's field equations such as those of Schwarzschild and Kerr. To coherently describe both kinds of experiments, this paper develops a unified framework for modeling quantum interferometers in general stationary space-times. This model provides a rigorous description and coherent interpretation of the effects of classical gravity on quantum probes.

Title: Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators
Authors: Masaya Kunimi, Takafumi Tomita
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the Förster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.
