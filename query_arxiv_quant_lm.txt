Title: Isoperimetric Inequalities in Quantum Geometry
Authors: Praveen Pai, Fan Zhang
Abstract: We reveal strong and weak inequalities relating two fundamental macroscopic quantum geometric quantities, the quantum distance and Berry phase, for closed paths in the Hilbert space of wavefunctions. We recount the role of quantum geometry in various quantum problems and show that our findings place new bounds on important physical quantities.

Title: Emission photon statistics in collectively interacting dipole atom arrays in the low-intensity limit
Authors: Deepak A. Suresh, F. Robicheaux
Abstract: We investigate the photon statistics of light emitted from a system of collectively interacting dipoles in the low-intensity regime, incorporating double-excitation states to capture beyond-single-excitation effects. By analyzing the eigenstates of the double-excitation manifold, we establish their connection to the accessible single-excitation eigenmodes and investigate the role of decay rates in shaping the initial-time photon correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau = 0)$ under different detection schemes. By interfering two beams of light that selectively address orthogonal eigenmodes, the photon emission statistics can be arbitrarily controlled. This can act as a tunable nonlinearity that enables both the enhancement and suppression of photon correlations, extending the operational intensity range for single-photon applications.

Title: Thermodynamic Constraints on Information Transmission in Quantum Ensembles
Authors: André T. Cesário, Tiago Debarba
Abstract: Quantum mechanics involves two primary factors that dictate the limitations and potential for information encoding and decoding: coherence and overlap. The first factor imposes constraints on the amount of information that can be copied from one system to another, as governed by the no-cloning theorem, which forbids the perfect replication of unknown quantum states. The second limits the accessibility of information encoded in a physical system due to the indistinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states. This work addresses these constraints and introduces a third factor: the limitations imposed by the laws of thermodynamics. We demonstrate that the preparation of the system for encoding and measuring information constrains the ability to distinguish among states of the resulting ensemble and influences the purity of these states. Furthermore, we explore a noisy communication channel and propose an optimal protocol for encoding and decoding the transmitted information. Based on this protocol, we highlight the thermodynamic interplay between heat and Holevo information, which quantifies the capacity of the transmitted information and establishes a fundamental limit on its retrieval in thermodynamically constrained scenarios.

Title: Local models and Bell inequalities for the minimal triangle network
Authors: José Mário da Silva, Alejandro Pozas-Kerstjens, Fernando Parisio
Abstract: Nonlocal correlations created in networks with multiple independent sources enable surprising phenomena in quantum information and quantum foundations. The presence of independent sources, however, makes the analysis of network nonlocality challenging, and even in the simplest nontrivial scenarios a complete characterization is lacking. In this work we study one of the simplest of these scenarios, namely that of distributions invariant under permutations of parties in the minimal triangle network, which features no inputs and binary outcomes. We perform an exhaustive search for triangle-local models, and from it we infer analytic expressions for the boundaries of the set of distributions that admit such models, which we conjecture to be all the tight Bell inequalities for the scenario. Armed with them and with improved outer approximations of the set, we provide new insights on the existence of a classical-quantum gap in the triangle network with binary outcomes.

Title: Gadgets for simulating a non-native $XX$ interaction in quantum annealing
Authors: Robert J. Banks, Natasha Feinstein, Roopayan Ghosh, Sougato Bose, P.A. Warburton
Abstract: In certain scenarios, quantum annealing can be made more efficient by additional $XX$ interactions. It has been shown that the additional interactions can reduce the scaling of perturbative crossings. In traditional annealing devices these couplings do not exist natively. In this work, we develop two gadgets to achieve this: a three-body gadget that requires a strong $ZZZ$ interaction; and a one-hot gadget that uses only local $X$ drives and two-body $ZZ$ interactions. The gadgets partition the Hilbert space to effectively generate a limited number of $XX$ interactions in the low-energy subspace. We numerically verify that the one-hot gadget can mitigate a perturbative crossing on a toy problem. These gadgets establish new pathways for implementing and exploiting $XX$ interactions, enabling faster and more robust quantum annealing.

Title: QCPINN: Quantum Classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs
Authors: Afrah Farea, Saiful Khan, Mustafa Serdar Celebi
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical neural network methods represent an emerging approach to solving computational challenges by leveraging advantages from both paradigms. As physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have successfully applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical constraints into neural architectures, this work investigates whether quantum-classical physics-informed neural networks (QCPINNs) can efficiently solve PDEs with reduced parameter counts compared to classical approaches. We evaluate two quantum circuit paradigms: continuous-variable (CV) and qubit-based discrete-variable (DV) across multiple circuit ansatze (Alternate, Cascade, Cross mesh, and Layered). Benchmarking across five challenging PDEs (Helmholtz, Cavity, Wave, Klein-Gordon, and Convection-Diffusion equations) demonstrates that our hybrid approaches achieve comparable accuracy to classical PINNs while requiring up to 89% fewer trainable parameters. DV-based implementations, particularly those with angle encoding and cascade circuit configurations, exhibit better stability and convergence properties across all problem types. For the Convection-Diffusion equation, our angle-cascade QCPINN achieves parameter efficiency and a 37% reduction in relative L2 error compared to classical counterparts. Our findings highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced architectures for physics-informed learning, establishing parameter efficiency as a quantifiable quantum advantage while providing a foundation for future quantum-classical hybrid systems solving complex physical models.

Title: Tight-Binding Energy-Phase Calculation for Topological Josephson Junction Nanowire Architecture
Authors: Adrian D. Scheppe, Michael V. Pak
Abstract: The current state of Quantum computing (QC) is extremely optimistic, and we are at a point where researchers have produced highly sophisticated quantum algorithms to address far reaching problems. However, it is equally apparent that the noisy quantum environment is a larger threat than many may realize. The noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era can be viewed as an inflection point for the enterprise of QC where decoherence could stagnate progress if left unaddressed. One tactic for handling decoherence is to address the problem from a hardware level by implementing topological materials into the design. In this work, we model several Josephson junctions that are modified by the presence of topological superconducting nanowires in between the host superconductors. Our primary result is a numerical calculation of the energy-phase relationship for topological nanowire junctions which are a key parameter of interest for the dynamics of qubit circuits. In addition to this, we report on the qualitative physical behavior of the bound states as a function of superconducting phase. These results can be used to further develop and inform the construction of more complicated systems, and it is hopeful that these types of designs could manifest as a fault tolerant qubit.

Title: Two-Photon Resonance Fluorescence in a Three-Level Ladder-Type Atom
Authors: Jacob Ngaha, Scott Parkins, Howard J. Carmichael
Abstract: In this work, we consider a three-level ladder-type atom driven by a coherent field, inspired by the experimental work of Gasparinetti et al. [Phys. Rev. A 100, 033802 (2019)]. When driven on two-photon resonance, the atom is excited into its highest energy state $| f \rangle$ by absorbing two photons simultaneously. The atom then de-excites via a cascaded decay $| f \rangle \rightarrow | e \rangle \rightarrow | g \rangle$. Here we present a theoretical study of the atomic fluorescence spectrum where, upon strong coherent driving, the spectrum exhibits seven distinct frequencies corresponding to transitions amongst the atomic dressed states. We characterize the quantum statistics of the emitted photons by investigating the second-order correlation functions of the emitted field. We do so by considering the total field emitted by the atom and focusing on each of the dressed-state components, taking in particular a secular-approximation and deriving straightforward, transparent analytic expressions for the second-order auto- and cross-correlations.

Title: Development of High-Quality $α$-Ta Film at Room Temperature via Seed Layer Engineering
Authors: Senthil Kumar Karuppannan, Naga Manikanta Kommanaboina, Hui Hui Kim, Nelson Lim Chee Beng, Yap Lee Koon Sherry, Yan Guangxu, Manas Mukherjee
Abstract: The growth of high-quality superconducting thin film on silicon substrates is essential for quantum computing, and low signal interconnects with industrial compatibility. Recently, the growth of $\alpha$-Ta (alpha-phase tantalum) thin films has gained attention over conventional superconductors like Nb and Al due to their high-density native oxide ($Ta_2O_5$), which offers excellent chemical resistance, superior dielectric properties, and mechanical robustness. The growth of $\alpha$-Ta thin films can be achieved through high-temperature/cryogenic growth, ultra-thin seed layers, or thick films (>300 nm). While high-temperature deposition produces high-quality films, it can cause thermal stress, silicide formation at the interface, and defects due to substrate-film mismatch. Room-temperature deposition minimizes these issues, benefiting heat-sensitive substrates and device fabrication. Low-temperature growth using amorphous (defective) seed layers such as TaN and TiN has shown promise for phase stabilization. However, nitrogen gas, used as a source of metallic nitride, can introduce defects and lead to the formation of amorphous seed layers. This study explores using crystalline seed layers to optimize $\alpha$-Ta thin films, demonstrating improved film quality, including reduced surface roughness, enhanced phase orientation, and higher transition temperatures compared to amorphous seed layers like metal nitrides. These advancements could interest the superconducting materials community for fabricating high-quality quantum devices.

Title: Recoil-induced errors and their correction in photon-mediated entanglement between atom qubits
Authors: Jan Apolín, David P. Nadlinger
Abstract: Photonically-interconnected matter qubit systems have wide-ranging applications across quantum science and technology, with entanglement between distant qubits serving as a universal resource. While state-of-the-art heralded entanglement generation performance thus far has been achieved in trapped atomic systems modelled as stationary emitters, the improvements to fidelities and generation rates demanded by large-scale applications require taking into account their motional degrees of freedom. Here, we derive the effects of atomic motion on spontaneous emission coupled into arbitrary optical modes, and study the implications for commonly-used atom-atom entanglement protocols. We arrive at a coherent physical picture in the form of "kick operators" associated with each instant in the photonic wavepackets, which also suggests a method to mitigate motional errors by disentangling qubit and motion post-herald. This proposed correction technique removes overheads associated with the thermal motion of atoms, and may greatly increase entanglement rates in long-distance quantum network links by allowing single-photon-based protocols to be used in the high-fidelity regime.

Title: Dynamics of atom-field interaction inside a nonlinear Kerr-like medium filled optical cavity
Authors: Naveen Kumar, Arpita Chatterjee
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of two two-level atoms interacting with a two-mode field inside an optical cavity, in presence of a nonlinear Kerr-like medium as well as the Stark shift. We derive the exact analytical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation that provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the system's quantum properties. To characterize the nonclassical features of the radiation field, we examine photon number distribution, second-order correlation function $g^2(0)$, squeezing properties, and Mandel's $Q_M$ parameter. These properties reveal significant insights into the quantum statistical behaviour of the field and its deviation from classicality under different interaction regimes. In addition, we quantify the atom-atom entanglement using linear entropy which captures the mixedness of the atomic subsystem and elucidates the interplay between atom-atom interactions. The results highlight the crucial role of nonlinear interactions and the Stark shift in shaping the quantum correlations and nonclassical phenomena of the system.

Title: Simulation of Quantum Entanglement and Quantum Teleportation for Advanced Networks
Authors: Sahana Dermal, Asvija Balasubramanyam, Gudapati Naresh Raghava
Abstract: This paper introduces the indigenous Quantum Network Simulator developed to simulate various quantum network protocols on classical machines. The paper specifically focuses on the simulation of entanglement generation between two quantum memories using the Barrett-Kok protocol, as well as the teleportation of a single qubit utilizing the produced entangled states. Additionally, the impact of error manipulation and other factors on the fidelity of the teleported states is analyzed, revealing strategies for enhancing teleported state fidelity. The existing few quantum network simulators, allow the simulation of teleportation protocol, but they do not account for the experimental aspects of entanglement generation and distribution, which are crucial for achieving any practical implementation. This work aims to bridge this gap and provide a realistic fidelity of the teleported states.

Title: Operational equivalence and causal structure
Authors: Gábor Hofer-Szabó
Abstract: In operational quantum mechanics two measurements are called operationally equivalent if they yield the same distribution of outcomes in every quantum state and hence are represented by the same operator. In this paper, I will show that the ontological models for quantum mechanics and, more generally, for any operational theory sensitively depend on which measurement we choose from the class of operationally equivalent measurements, or more precisely, which of the chosen measurements can be performed simultaneously. To this goal, I will take first three examples -- a classical theory, the EPR-Bell scenario and the Popescu-Rochlich box; then realize each example by two operationally equivalent but different operational theories -- one with a trivial and another with a non-trivial compatibility structure; and finally show that the ontological models for the different theories will be different with respect to their causal structure, contextuality, and fine-tuning.

Title: Parallel splitting method for large-scale quadratic programs
Authors: Matteo Vandelli, Francesco Ferrari, Daniele Dragoni
Abstract: Current algorithms for large-scale industrial optimization problems typically face a trade-off: they either require exponential time to reach optimal solutions, or employ problem-specific heuristics. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPLIT, a general-purpose quantum-inspired framework for decomposing large-scale quadratic programs into smaller subproblems, which are then solved in parallel. SPLIT accounts for cross-interactions between subproblems, which are usually neglected in other decomposition techniques. The SPLIT framework can integrate generic subproblem solvers, ranging from standard branch-and-bound methods to quantum optimization algorithms. We demonstrate its effectiveness through comparisons with commercial solvers on the MaxCut and Antenna Placement Problems, with up to 20,000 decision variables. Our results show that SPLIT is capable of providing drastic reductions in computational time, while delivering high-quality solutions. In these regards, the proposed method is particularly suited for near real-time applications that require a solution within a strict time frame, or when the problem size exceeds the hardware limitations of dedicated devices, such as current quantum computers.

Title: Benign Overfitting with Quantum Kernels
Authors: Joachim Tomasi, Sandrine Anthoine, Hachem Kadri
Abstract: Quantum kernels quantify similarity between data points by measuring the inner product between quantum states, computed through quantum circuit measurements. By embedding data into quantum systems, quantum kernel feature maps, that may be classically intractable to compute, could efficiently exploit high-dimensional Hilbert spaces to capture complex patterns. However, designing effective quantum feature maps remains a major challenge. Many quantum kernels, such as the fidelity kernel, suffer from exponential concentration, leading to near-identity kernel matrices that fail to capture meaningful data correlations and lead to overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for constructing quantum kernels that achieve good generalization performance, drawing inspiration from benign overfitting in classical machine learning. Our approach introduces the concept of local-global quantum kernels, which combine two complementary components: a local quantum kernel based on measurements of small subsystems and a global quantum kernel derived from full-system measurements. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that local-global quantum kernels exhibit benign overfitting, supporting the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing quantum kernel methods.

Title: Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz and Column Generation
Authors: Wei-hao Huang, Hiromichi Matsuyama, Yu Yamashiro
Abstract: This study proposes a hybrid quantum-classical approach to solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by integrating the Column Generation (CG) method with the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOAnsatz). The CG method divides the CVRP into the reduced master problem, which finds the best combination of the routes under the route set, and one or more subproblems, which generate the routes that would be beneficial to add to the route set. This method is iteratively refined by adding new routes identified via subproblems and continues until no improving route can be found. We leverage the QAOAnsatz to solve the subproblems. Our algorithm restricts the search space by designing the QAOAnsatz mixer Hamiltonian to enforce one-hot constraints. Moreover, to handle capacity constraints in QAOAnsatz, we employ an Augmented Lagrangian-inspired method that obviates the need for additional slack variables, reducing the required number of qubits. Experimental results on small-scale CVRP instances (up to 6 customers) show that QAOAnsatz converges more quickly to optimal routes than the standard QAOA approach, demonstrating the potential of this hybrid framework in tackling real-world logistical optimization problems on near-term quantum hardware.

Title: Controllable Single Photon Scattering via Coupling of Driven $Λ$ System with Topological Waveguide
Authors: Gunjan Yadav, Madan Mohan Mahana, Tarak Nath Dey
Abstract: We investigate the coherent single photon scattering process in a topological waveguide coupled with a driven $\Lambda$ system. We derive an analytical expression for transmittance by using the scattering formalism for three different sublattice sites (A, B, and AB), which couples to the $\Lambda$ system. We have demonstrated that the system's response is topology-independent for A and B sublattice-site coupling and becomes topology-dependent for AB sublattice-site coupling. In a weak control field regime, the system behaves as a perfect mirror in all of these configurations. Upon the control field strength enhancement, the transmission spectrum evolves from Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) to Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) in A and B sublattice-site coupling. The manipulation of transmission from opaque to transparent holds the key mechanism of a single photon switch. Further, the topology-dependent AB sublattice configuration allows the sharper Fano line shape that is absent in topology-independent A and B sublattice configurations. This characteristic of the Fano line can be used as a tunable single-photon switch and for sensing external perturbations. Furthermore, our study paves the way for the robustness and tunability of systems with applications in quantum technologies such as quantum switches, sensors, and communication devices.

Title: Unitary operator bases as universal averaging sets
Authors: Marcin Markiewicz, Konrad Schlichtholz
Abstract: We provide a generalization of the idea of unitary designs to cover finite averaging over much more general operations on quantum states. Namely, we construct finite averaging sets for averaging quantum states over arbitrary reductive Lie groups, on condition that the averaging is performed uniformly over the compact component of the group. Our construction comprises probabilistic mixtures of unitary 1-designs on specific operator subspaces. Provided construction is very general, competitive in the size of the averaging set when compared to other known constructions, and can be efficiently implemented in the quantum circuit model of computation.

Title: Fast Quantum Amplitude Encoding of Typical Classical Data
Authors: Vittorio Pagni, Sigurd Huber, Michael Epping, Michael Felderer
Abstract: We present an improved version of a quantum amplitude encoding scheme that encodes the $N$ entries of a unit classical vector $\vec{v}=(v_1,..,v_N)$ into the amplitudes of a quantum state. Our approach has a quadratic speed-up with respect to the original one. We also describe several generalizations, including to complex entries of the input vector and a parameter $M$ that determines the parallelization. The number of qubits required for the state preparation scales as $\mathcal{O}(M\log N)$. The runtime, which depends on the data density $\rho$ and on the parallelization paramater $M$, scales as $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}\frac{N}{M}\log (M+1))$, which in the most parallel version ($M=N$) is always less than $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}\log N)$. By analysing the data density, we prove that the average runtime is $\mathcal{O}(\log^{1.5} N)$ for uniformly random inputs. We present numerical evidence that this favourable runtime behaviour also holds for real-world data, such as radar satellite images. This is promising as it allows for an input-to-output advantage of the quantum Fourier transform.

Title: A quantum wire approach to weighted combinatorial graph optimisation problems
Authors: Johannes Kombe, Gerard Pelegrí, Andrew J. Daley, Jonathan D. Pritchard
Abstract: Neutral-atom arrays have recently attracted attention as a versatile platform to implement coherent quantum annealing as an approach to hard problems, including combinatorial optimisation. Here we present an efficient scheme based on chains of Rydberg-blockaded atoms, which we call quantum wires, to embed certain weighted optimisation problems into a layout compatible with the neutral atom architecture. For graphs with quasi-unit-disk connectivity, in which only a few non-native long-range interactions are present, our approach requires a significantly lower overhead in the number of ancilla qubits than previous proposals, facilitating the implementation in currently available hardware. We perform simulations of realistic annealing ramps to find the solution of combinatorial optimisation problems within our scheme, demonstrating high success probability for problems of moderate size. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of a favourable scaling of the minimum gap along the annealing path with increasing wire length and of the robustness of the encoding to experimental imperfections. Our work expands the existing toolkit to explore the potential use of neutral atom arrays to solve large scale optimisation problems.

Title: Topological order in symmetric blockade structures
Authors: Tobias F. Maier, Hans Peter Büchler, Nicolai Lang
Abstract: The bottom-up design of strongly interacting quantum materials with prescribed ground state properties is a highly nontrivial task, especially if only simple constituents with realistic two-body interactions are available on the microscopic level. Here we study two- and three-dimensional structures of two-level systems that interact via a simple blockade potential in the presence of a coherent coupling between the two states. For such strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, we introduce the concept of blockade graph automorphisms to construct symmetric blockade structures with strong quantum fluctuations that lead to equal-weight superpositions of tailored states. Drawing from these results, we design a quasi-two-dimensional periodic quantum system that - as we show rigorously - features a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid as its ground state. Our construction is based on the implementation of a local symmetry on the microscopic level in a system with only two-body interactions.

Title: Conversion of photon temporal shape using single gradient metasurface
Authors: Zhaohua Tian, Qi Liu, Yu Tian, Ying Gu
Abstract: By applying phase modulation across different frequencies, metasurfaces possess the ability to manipulate the temporal dimension of photons at the femtosecond scale. However, there remains a fundamental challenge to shape the single wavepacket at the nanosecond scale by using of metasurfaces. Here, we propose that the single photon temporal shape can be converted through the multi-photon wavepacket interference on a single metasurface. By selecting appropriate input single-photon temporal shapes and metasurfaces beam splitting ratio, controllable photon shape conversion can be achieved with high fidelity. For examples, photons with an exponentially decaying profile can be shaped into a Gaussian profile; by tuning the relative time delays of input photons, Gaussian-shaped photons can be transformed into exponentially decaying or rising profiles through the same metasurface. The proposed mechanism provides a compact way for solving the temporal shape mismatch issues in quantum networks, facilitating the realization of high-fidelity on-chip quantum information processing.

Title: Adiabatic Fine-Tuning of Neural Quantum States Enables Detection of Phase Transitions in Weight Space
Authors: Vinicius Hernandes, Thomas Spriggs, Saqar Khaleefah, Eliska Greplova
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful tool for approximating quantum wavefunctions using deep learning. While these models achieve remarkable accuracy, understanding how they encode physical information remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce adiabatic fine-tuning, a scheme that trains NQS across a phase diagram, leading to strongly correlated weight representations across different models. This correlation in weight space enables the detection of phase transitions in quantum systems by analyzing the trained network weights alone. We validate our approach on the transverse field Ising model and the J1-J2 Heisenberg model, demonstrating that phase transitions manifest as distinct structures in weight space. Our results establish a connection between physical phase transitions and the geometry of neural network parameters, opening new directions for the interpretability of machine learning models in physics.

Title: Jitter in photon-number-resolved detection by superconducting nanowires
Authors: Mariia Sidorova, Timon Schapeler, Alexej D. Semenov, Fabian Schlue, Michael Stefszky, Benjamin Brecht, Christine Silberhorn, Tim J. Bartley
Abstract: By analyzing the physics of multi-photon absorption in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), we identify physical components of jitter. From this, we formulate a quantitative physical model of the multi-photon detector response which combines local detection mechanism and local fluctuations (hotspot formation and intrinsic jitter) with thermoelectric dynamics of resistive domains. Our model provides an excellent description of the arrival-time histogram of a commercial SNSPD across several orders of magnitude, both in arrival-time probability and across mean photon number. This is achieved with just three fitting parameters: the scaling of the mean arrival time of voltage response pulses, as well as the Gaussian and exponential jitter components. Our findings have important implications for photon-number-resolving detector design, as well as applications requiring low jitter such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR).

Title: Suppression of coherent errors during entangling operations in NV centers in diamond
Authors: Regina Finsterhoelzl, Guido Burkard
Abstract: We consider entangling operations in a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond where the hyperfine-coupled nuclear spin qubits are addressed with radio-frequency (rf) pulses conditioned on the state of the central electron spin. Limiting factors for the gate fidelity are coherent errors due to off-resonant driving of neighboring transitions in the dense, hyperfine-split energy spectrum of the defect and non-negligible perpendicular hyperfine tensor components that narrow the choice of $^{13}\rm C$ nuclear spin qubits. We address these issues by presenting protocols based on synchronization effects that allow for a complete suppression of both error sources in state-of-the-art CNOT gate schemes. This is possible by a suitable choice of parameter sets that incorporate the error into the scheme instead of avoiding it. These results contribute to the recent progress toward scalable quantum computation with defects in solids.

Title: Nonadiabatic master equation for a linearly driven harmonic oscillator
Authors: Sinan Altinisik, Eric Lutz
Abstract: We derive a Markovian master equation for a linearly driven dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator, valid for generic driving beyond the adiabatic limit. We solve this quantum master equation for arbitrary Gaussian initial states and investigate its departure from the adiabatic master equation in the regime of fast driving. We concretely examine the behavior of dynamical variables, such as position and momentum, as well as of thermodynamic quantities, such as energy and entropy. We additionally study the influence of the nonequilibrium driving on the quantum coherence of the oscillator in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis. We further analyze the approach to the adiabatic limit and the relaxation to the instantaneous steady state as a function of the driving speed.

Title: Tensor Cross Interpolation of Purities in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Dmytro Kolisnyk, Raimel A. Medina, Romain Vasseur, Maksym Serbyn
Abstract: A defining feature of quantum many-body systems is the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with the number of degrees of freedom. This exponential complexity naïvely renders a complete state characterization, for instance via the complete set of bipartite Renyi entropies for all disjoint regions, a challenging task. Recently, a compact way of storing subregions' purities by encoding them as amplitudes of a fictitious quantum wave function, known as entanglement feature, was proposed. Notably, the entanglement feature can be a simple object even for highly entangled quantum states. However the complexity and practical usage of the entanglement feature for general quantum states has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the entanglement feature can be efficiently learned using only a polynomial amount of samples in the number of degrees of freedom through the so-called tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm, assuming it is expressible as a finite bond dimension MPS. We benchmark this learning process on Haar and random MPS states, confirming analytic expectations. Applying the TCI algorithm to quantum eigenstates of various one dimensional quantum systems, we identify cases where eigenstates have entanglement feature learnable with TCI. We conclude with possible applications of the learned entanglement feature, such as quantifying the distance between different entanglement patterns and finding the optimal one-dimensional ordering of physical indices in a given state, highlighting the potential utility of the proposed purity interpolation method.

Title: Infinite-fold Quantum Advantage in Classical Correlation Sensing
Authors: Janis Nötzel, Pere Munar-Vallespir
Abstract: We study the hypothesis testing problem of detecting the presence of a thermal source emitting coherent quantum states towards an arbitrary but fixed number $K$ of detectors versus the situation where the detectors are presented uncorrelated thermal noise of the same average energy in the setting of asymmetric hypothesis testing. We compare two variations of this theme: In the first one the detectors perform heterodyne or homodyne detection and then transmit their measured results to a central processing unit with unlimited computational resources. In the second one the detectors are able to teleport the quantum states to the central unit, which acts on the received quantum states with unlimited quantum computational resources. We find that when the average received energy per detector goes to zero, the ratio of the error exponents goes to infinity, indicating an infinite-fold quantum advantage.

Title: On the Importance of Error Mitigation for Quantum Computation
Authors: Dorit Aharonov, Ori Alberton, Itai Arad, Yosi Atia, Eyal Bairey, Zvika Brakerski, Itsik Cohen, Omri Golan, Ilya Gurwich, Oded Kenneth, Eyal Leviatan, Netanel H. Lindner, Ron Aharon Melcer, Adiel Meyer, Gili Schul, Maor Shutman
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (EM) is a family of hybrid quantum-classical methods for eliminating or reducing the effect of noise and decoherence on quantum algorithms run on quantum hardware, without applying quantum error correction (EC). While EM has many benefits compared to EC, specifically that it requires no (or little) qubit overhead, this benefit comes with a painful price: EM seems to necessitate an overhead in quantum run time which grows as a (mild) exponent. Accordingly, recent results show that EM alone cannot enable exponential quantum advantages (QAs), for an average variant of the expectation value estimation problem. These works raised concerns regarding the role of EM in the road map towards QAs. We aim to demystify the discussion and provide a clear picture of the role of EM in achieving QAs, both in the near and long term. We first propose a clear distinction between finite QA and asymptotic QA, which is crucial to the understanding of the question, and present the notion of circuit volume boost, which we claim is an adequate way to quantify the benefits of EM. Using these notions, we can argue straightforwardly that EM is expected to have a significant role in achieving QAs. Specifically, that EM is likely to be the first error reduction method for useful finite QAs, before EC; that the first such QAs are expected to be achieved using EM in the very near future; and that EM is expected to maintain its important role in quantum computation even when EC will be routinely used - for as long as high-quality qubits remain a scarce resource.

Title: Practical Criteria for Entanglement and Nonlocality in Systems with Additive Observables
Authors: Alexander Bernal, J. Alberto Casas, Juan Falceto
Abstract: For general bipartite mixed states, a sufficient and necessary mathematical condition for certifying entanglement and/or (Bell) non-locality remains unknown. In this paper, we examine this question for a broad and physically relevant class of bipartite systems, specifically those possessing an additive observable with a definite value. Such systems include, for example, final states of particle decays or bipartitions of spin chains with well-defined magnetization. We derive very simple, handy criteria for detecting entanglement or non-locality in many cases. For instance, if $\rho_{\left( m p\right)\left( nq\right)} \neq 0$, where the eigenstates $|np\rangle$ or $|mq\rangle$ do not correspond to the given definite value of the additive observable, then the state is necessarily entangled-this condition is very easy to check in practice. If, in addition, the partitioned Hilbert space has dimension 2xd, the condition becomes necessary. Furthermore, if the sectors associated with the eigenstates $|mp\rangle$ or $|nq\rangle$ are non-degenerate, there exists a CHSH inequality that is violated. We illustrate these results by analyzing the potential detection of entanglement and nonlocality in Higgs to ZZ decays at the LHC.

Title: Determining the N-representability of a reduced density matrix via unitary evolution and stochastic sampling

Abstract: The N-representability problem consists in determining whether, for a given p-body matrix, there exists at least one N-body density matrix from which the p-body matrix can be obtained by contraction, that is, if the given matrix is a p-body reduced density matrix (p-RDM). The knowledge of all necessary and sufficient conditions for a p-body matrix to be N-representable allows the constrained minimization of a many-body Hamiltonian expectation value with respect to the p-body density matrix and, thus, the determination of its exact ground state. However, the number of constraints that complete the N-representability conditions grows exponentially with system size, and hence the procedure quickly becomes intractable in practice. This work introduces a hybrid quantum-stochastic algorithm to effectively replace the N-representability conditions. The algorithm consists of applying to an initial N-body density matrix a sequence of unitary evolution operators constructed from a stochastic process that successively approaches the reduced state of the density matrix on a p-body subsystem, represented by a p-RDM, to a target p-body matrix, potentially a p-RDM. The generators of the evolution operators follow the adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter method (ADAPT), while the stochastic component is implemented using a simulated annealing process. The resulting algorithm is independent of any underlying Hamiltonian, and it can be used to decide if a given p-body matrix is N-representable, establishing a criterion to determine its quality and correcting it. We apply this hybrid ADAPT algorithm to alleged reduced density matrices from a quantum chemistry electronic Hamiltonian, the reduced BCS model with constant pairing, and the Heisenberg XXZ spin model. In all cases, the proposed method behaves as expected for 1-RDMs and 2-RDMs, evolving the initial matrices towards different targets.

Title: Quantum mechanics based on real numbers: A consistent description
Authors: Pedro Barrios Hita, Anton Trushechkin, Hermann Kampermann, Michael Epping, Dagmar Bruß
Abstract: Complex numbers play a crucial role in quantum mechanics. However, their necessity remains debated: whether they are fundamental or merely convenient. Recently, it was claimed that quantum mechanics based on real numbers can be experimentally falsified in the sense that any real-number formulation of quantum mechanics either becomes inconsistent with multipartite experiments or violates certain postulates. In this article we show that a physically motivated postulate about composite quantum systems allows to construct quantum mechanics based on real numbers that reproduces predictions for all multipartite quantum experiments. Thus, we argue that real-valued quantum mechanics cannot be falsified, and therefore the use of complex numbers is a matter of convenience.

Title: On Quantum Perceptron Learning via Quantum Search
Authors: Xiaoyu Sun (1), Mathieu Roget (1), Giuseppe Di Molfetta (1), Hachem Kadri (1) ((1) Aix-Marseille Université, CNRS, LIS, Marseille, France.)
Abstract: With the growing interest in quantum machine learning, the perceptron -- a fundamental building block in traditional machine learning -- has emerged as a valuable model for exploring quantum advantages. Two quantum perceptron algorithms based on Grover's search, were developed in arXiv:1602.04799 to accelerate training and improve statistical efficiency in perceptron learning. This paper points out and corrects a mistake in the proof of Theorem 2 in arXiv:1602.04799. Specifically, we show that the probability of sampling from a normal distribution for a $D$-dimensional hyperplane that perfectly classifies the data scales as $\Omega(\gamma^{D})$ instead of $\Theta({\gamma})$, where $\gamma$ is the margin. We then revisit two well-established linear programming algorithms -- the ellipsoid method and the cutting plane random walk algorithm -- in the context of perceptron learning, and show how quantum search algorithms can be leveraged to enhance the overall complexity. Specifically, both algorithms gain a sub-linear speed-up $O(\sqrt{N})$ in the number of data points $N$ as a result of Grover's algorithm and an additional $O(D^{1.5})$ speed-up is possible for cutting plane random walk algorithm employing quantum walk search.

Title: Fast Convex Optimization with Quantum Gradient Methods
Authors: Brandon Augustino, Dylan Herman, Enrico Fontana, Junhyung Lyle Kim, Jacob Watkins, Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Marco Pistoia
Abstract: We study quantum algorithms based on quantum (sub)gradient estimation using noisy evaluation oracles, and demonstrate the first dimension independent query complexities (up to poly-logarithmic factors) for zeroth-order convex optimization in both smooth and nonsmooth settings. We match the first-order query complexities of classical gradient descent, using only noisy evaluation oracles, thereby exhibiting exponential separation between quantum and classical zeroth-order optimization. Specifically, for the smooth case, zeroth-order quantum gradient descent achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(LR^2/\varepsilon)$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \kappa \log(1/\varepsilon \right))$ query complexities, for the convex and strongly convex case respectively; for the nonsmooth case, the zeroth-order quantum subgradient method attains a query complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}((GR/\varepsilon)^2 )$. We then generalize these algorithms to work in non-Euclidean settings by using quantum (sub)gradient estimation to instantiate mirror descent, dual averaging and mirror prox. We demonstrate how our algorithm for nonsmooth optimization can be applied to solve an SDP involving $m$ constraints and $n \times n$ matrices to additive error $\varepsilon$ using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} ((mn^2+n^{\omega})(Rr/\varepsilon)^2)$ gates, where $\omega \in [2,2.38)$ is the exponent of matrix-multiplication time and $R$ and $r$ are bounds on the primal and dual optimal solutions, respectively. Specializing to linear programs, we obtain a quantum LP solver with complexity $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}}((m+\sqrt{n}) (Rr/\varepsilon)^2).$ For zero-sum games we achieve the best quantum runtimes for any $\varepsilon > 0$ when $m = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$. We obtain the best algorithm overall (quantum or classical) whenever we further impose $\varepsilon=\Omega((m+n)^{-1/4})$.

Title: Criteria for unbiased estimation: applications to noise-agnostic sensing and learnability of quantum channel
Authors: Hyukgun Kwon, Kento Tsubouchi, Chia-Tung Chu, Liang Jiang
Abstract: We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for unbiased estimation in multi-parameter estimation tasks. More specifically, we first consider quantum state estimation, where multiple parameters are encoded in a quantum state, and derive two equivalent necessary and sufficient conditions for an unbiased estimation: one formulated in terms of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) and the other based on the derivatives of the encoded state. Furthermore, we introduce a generalized quantum Cramér-Rao bound, which provides a fundamental achievable lower bound on the estimation error even when the QFIM is non-invertible. To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we consider phase estimation under unknown Pauli noise. We show that while unbiased phase estimation is infeasible with a naive scheme, employing an entangled probe with a noiseless ancilla enables unbiased estimation. Next, we extend our analysis to quantum channel estimation (equivalently, quantum channel learning), where the goal is to estimate parameters characterizing an unknown quantum channel. We establish the necessary and sufficient condition for unbiased estimation of these parameters. Notably, by interpreting unbiased estimation as learnability, our result applies to the fundamental learnability of parameters in general quantum channels. As a concrete application, we investigate the learnability of noise affecting non-Clifford gates via cycle benchmarking.

Title: Efficient use of quantum computers for collider physics
Authors: Christian W. Bauer
Abstract: Most observables at particle colliders involve physics at a wide variety of distance scales. Due to asymptotic freedom of the strong interaction, the physics at short distances can be calculated reliably using perturbative techniques, while long distance physics is non-perturbative in nature. Factorization theorems separate the contributions from different scales scales, allowing to identify the pieces that can be determined perturbatively from those that require non-perturbative information, and if the non-perturbative pieces can be reliably determined, one can use experimental measurements to extract the short distance effects, sensitive to possible new physics. Without the ability to compute the non-perturbative ingredients from first principles one typically identifies observables for which the non-perturbative information is universal in the sense that it can be extracted from some experimental observables and then used to predict other observables. In this paper we argue that the future ability to use quantum computers to calculate non-perturbative matrix elements from first principles will allow to make predictions for observables with non-universal non-perturbative long-distance physics.

Title: Stabilizing open photon condensates by ghost-attractor dynamics
Authors: Aya Abouelela, Michael Turaev, Roman Kramer, Moritz Janning, Michael Kajan, Sayak Ray, Johann Kroha
Abstract: We study the temporal, driven-dissipative dynamics of open photon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a dye-filled microcavity, taking the condensate amplitude and the noncondensed fluctuations into account on the same footing by means of a cumulant expansion within the Lindblad formalism. The fluctuations fundamentally alter the dynamics in that the BEC always dephases to zero for sufficiently long time. However, a ghost-attractor, although it is outside of the physically accessible configuration space, attracts the dynamics and leads to a plateau-like stabilization of the BEC for an exponentially long time, consistent with experiments. We also show that the photon BEC and the lasing state are separated by a true phase transition, since they are characterized by different fixed points. The ghost-attractor nonequilibrium stabilization mechanism is alternative to prethermalization and may possibly be realized on other dynamical platforms as well.

Title: Dual-type dual-element atom arrays for quantum information processing
Authors: Zhanchuan Zhang, Jeth Arunseangroj, Wenchao Xu
Abstract: Neutral-atom arrays are a leading platform for quantum technologies, offering a promising route toward large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing. We propose a novel quantum processing architecture based on dual-type, dual-element atom arrays, where individually trapped atoms serve as data qubits, and small atomic ensembles enable ancillary operations. By leveraging the selective initialization, coherent control, and collective optical response of atomic ensembles, we demonstrate ensemble-assisted quantum operations that enable reconfigurable, high-speed control of individual data qubits and rapid mid-circuit readout, including both projective single-qubit and joint multi-qubit measurements. The hybrid approach of this architecture combines the long coherence times of single-atom qubits with the enhanced controllability of atomic ensembles, achieving high-fidelity state manipulation and detection with minimal crosstalk. Numerical simulations indicate that our scheme supports individually addressable single- and multi-qubit operations with fidelities of 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively, as well as fast single- and multi-qubit state readout with fidelities exceeding 99% within tens of microseconds. These capabilities open new pathways toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation, enabling repetitive error syndrome detection and efficient generation of long-range entangled many-body states, thereby expanding the quantum information toolbox beyond existing platforms.

Title: Quantum geometric tensors from sub-bundle geometry
Authors: Marius A. Oancea, Thomas B. Mieling, Giandomenico Palumbo
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states are crucial for understanding many physical phenomena in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and optics. The central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor, which unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use the differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the properties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum geometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on an arbitrary connection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum state transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which constrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle geometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is described by a generalization of the Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This leads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor, which contains an additional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the sub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields propagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with its additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete example, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and demonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry. This work sets the stage for further exploration of quantum systems in curved geometries, with applications in both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems.

Title: Einstein's Cat -- A Thought Experiment Against Anti-Relativist Claims
Authors: Val G. Rousseau
Abstract: When faced with overwhelming evidence supporting the reality of time dilation, confirmed in particular by the Hafele-Keating experiment, some anti-relativists reluctantly concede that time dilation applies to light clocks. However, they argue that the Theory of Relativity remains flawed, claiming that time dilation applies to light clocks only, not to massive objects. They assert that atomic clocks, which operate based on microwave radiation, merely create the illusion that the Hafele-Keating experiment confirms the theory. To refute this misconception, we introduce a thought experiment inspired by Schrodinger's cat, in which the fate of Einstein's cat depends on a "Sync-or-Die clock", an imaginary device that tests the synchronization between a light clock and a mechanical clock, potentially triggering the release of poison. By analyzing this scenario from both the inertial frame where the device is at rest and another in which it moves at constant velocity, we demonstrate that time dilation must apply to the mechanical clock in exactly the same way as it does to the light clock, highlighting the universality of relativistic time dilation.

Title: Controlled Floquet Dynamics and Topological Bound States in Continuum via Colored Quantum Random Walks
Authors: Zahra Jalali-Mola, Ortwin Hess
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence and control of Floquet states and topological bound states in the continuum (TBICs) in a two-dimensional colored quantum random walk (cQRW) on a square lattice. By introducing three internal degrees of freedom-termed "colors"-and leveraging SU(3) group representations, we realize dispersive TBICs and intrinsic Floquet dynamics without the need for external periodic driving. Through Chern number calculations, we identify three distinct topological bands, revealing color-induced band mixing as a key mechanism underlying the natural formation of Floquet states. The cQRW framework enables precise tuning of quasi-energy spectra, supporting the emergence of localized edge states in topological band gaps and dispersive TBICs embedded within the bulk of other bands. These TBICs exhibit tunable group velocity, controllable excitation across energy regimes, and robustness, providing theoretical validation for their existence in a first-order Floquet system. Our findings position cQRWs as a powerful platform for investigating and harnessing TBICs and Floquet states, with potential applications in quantum information and communication technologies.

Title: Full Microscopic Simulations Uncover Persistent Quantum Effects in Primary Photosynthesis
Authors: Nicola Lorenzoni, Thibaut Lacroix, James Lim, Dario Tamascelli, Susana F. Huelga, Martin B. Plenio
Abstract: The presence of quantum effects in photosynthetic excitation energy transfer has been intensely debated over the past decade. Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot unambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped vibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic models have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the first non-perturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 K and room temperature, which persist on picosecond time scales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry emergence in a Hermitian system of coupled oscillators without symmetry
Authors: T. T. Sergeev, E. S. Andrianov, A. A. Zyablovsky
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in systems with symmetry is a cornerstone phenomenon accompanying second-order phase transitions. Here, we predict the opposite phenomenon, namely, spontaneous symmetry emergence in a system that lacks symmetry. In the example of two coupled oscillators interacting non-symmetrically with a set of oscillators whose frequencies uniformly fill a finite frequency range, we demonstrate that the system state can acquire symmetry that is not inherent in the system Hamiltonian. The emergence of symmetry is manifested as a change in the system dynamics, which can be interpreted as a phase transition in a Hermitian system that lacks symmetry.

Title: Absence of barren plateaus and scaling of gradients in the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states
Authors: Thomas Barthel, Qiang Miao
Abstract: Vanishing gradients can pose substantial obstacles for high-dimensional optimization problems. Here we consider energy minimization problems for quantum many-body systems with extensive Hamiltonians and finite-range interactions, which can be studied on classical computers or in the form of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum computers. Barren plateaus correspond to scenarios where the average amplitude of the energy gradient decreases exponentially with increasing system size. This occurs, for example, for quantum neural networks and for brickwall quantum circuits when the depth increases polynomially in the system size. Here we prove that the variational optimization problems for matrix product states, tree tensor networks, and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz are free of barren plateaus. The derived scaling properties for the gradient variance provide an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized tensor network states (TNS) and motivate certain initialization schemes. In a suitable representation, unitary tensors that parametrize the TNS are sampled according to the uniform Haar measure. We employ a Riemannian formulation of the gradient based optimizations which simplifies the analytical evaluation.

Title: Super-exponential behaviors of out-of-time ordered correlators and Loschmidt echo in a non-Hermitian interacting system
Authors: Wen-Lei Zhao, Chao Han, Han Ke, Jie Liu
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-time ordered correlators and Loschmidt echo in a non-Hermitian interacting system governed by a Gross-Pitaevskii map model, which incorporates a periodically modulated complex strength of the nonlinear interaction as delta kicks. We uncover that the time evolutions of the out-of-time ordered correlators follow that of the Loschmidt echo in certain situations. In particular, we find that both of them can exhibit a super-exponential growth with time, indicating the emergence of super-exponential scrambling and instability. Interestingly, after a proper scaling scheme, we find that all the super-exponential behaviors approximately collapse on a scaling-law curve that is independent on the non-Hermitian parameter as well as the effective Planck constant. The underlying mechanism is rooted in the super-exponentially fast diffusion of energy as well as the norm of quantum states. Our findings suggest a kind of fastest divergence of two nearby quantum states, which has implication in information scrambling.

Title: Digital-analog quantum computing of fermion-boson models in superconducting circuits
Authors: Shubham Kumar, Narendra N. Hegade, Anne-Maria Visuri, B. A. Bhargava, Juan F. R. Hernandez, Enrique Solano, Francisco Albarrán-Arriagada, Gabriel Alvarado Barrios
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum simulations demand hardware-software co-design architectures, which are crucial for adapting to complex problems such as strongly correlated dynamics in condensed matter. By leveraging co-design strategies, we can enhance the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices in the noisy intermediate quantum (NISQ) and early error-correction regimes. In this direction, we propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly-correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models, including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filled two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In this example, we obtain time-dependent state fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable for studying the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.

Title: The classical limit of Quantum Max-Cut
Authors: Vir B. Bulchandani, Stephen Piddock
Abstract: It is well-known in physics that the limit of large quantum spin $S$ should be understood as a semiclassical limit. This raises the question of whether such emergent classicality facilitates the approximation of computationally hard quantum optimization problems, such as the local Hamiltonian problem. We demonstrate this explicitly for spin-$S$ generalizations of Quantum Max-Cut ($\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$), equivalent to the problem of finding the ground state energy of an arbitrary spin-$S$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet ($\mathrm{QHA}_S$). We prove that approximating the value of $\mathrm{QHA}_S$ to inverse polynomial accuracy is QMA-complete for all $S$, extending previous results for $S=1/2$. We also present two distinct families of classical approximation algorithms for $\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$ based on rounding the output of a semidefinite program to a product of Bloch coherent states. The approximation ratios for both our proposed algorithms strictly increase with $S$ and converge to the Briët-Oliveira-Vallentin approximation ratio $\alpha_{\mathrm{BOV}} \approx 0.956$ from below as $S \to \infty$.

Title: Continuous spontaneous localization as the white-noise limit of spontaneous unitarity violation
Authors: Aritro Mukherjee, Jasper van Wezel
Abstract: Objective collapse theories propose modifications to Schrödinger's equation that solve the quantum measurement problem by interpolating between microscopic quantum dynamics and projective evolution of macroscopic objects. Colored-noise driven collapse theories extending the equilibrium description of spontaneous symmetry breaking to spontaneous violations of unitarity (SUV) in quantum dynamics were recently shown to possess a Markovian white noise limit when applied to initial two-state superpositions. Here, we show that this limit coincides with a subclass of continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) models collapsing in a basis of spatially localised energy eigenstates. We show that the energy expectation value remains conserved throughout this process, and we also extend the model to a form that can be applied to any initial state. We furthermore show that, as for the SUV models, the emergence of Born rule statistics in the Markovian limit is enforced by a fluctuation-dissipation relation which results in ensemble averaged probability densities following a linear quantum semi-group guaranteeing the absence of superluminal signaling.

Title: Kolmogorovian Censorship, Predictive Incompleteness, and the locality loophole in Bell experiments
Authors: Philippe Grangier
Abstract: In previous articles we argued that if both influence at a distance and super-determinism are considered unacceptable to explain the results of loophole-free Bell tests, a third way is available, called 'predictive incompleteness': it tells that the usual quantum state $\psi$ is incomplete, as long as the measurement context has not been specified. This is in agreement with the general quantum framework called CSM (Contexts, Systems and Modalities), which provides a unified approach for considering quantum systems within classical contexts. In this article we further illustrate how predictive incompleteness is working, by looking at other ideas based on either the Kolmogorovian Censorship (KC), or on superdeterminism and supermeasurements. We show that these possibilities are very advantageously replaced by the use of predictive incompleteness.

Title: Tunable non-Markovian dynamics in a collision model: an application to coherent transport
Authors: Simone Rijavec, Giuseppe Di Pietra
Abstract: We propose a collision model to investigate the information dynamics of a system coupled to an environment with varying degrees of non-Markovianity. We control the degree of non-Markovianity by applying a depolarising channel to a fixed and rigid reservoir of qubits. We characterise the effect of the depolarising channel and apply the model to study the coherent transport of information on a chain of three interacting qubits. We show how the system-environment coupling probability and the degree of non-Markovianity affect the process. Interestingly, in some cases a Markovian environment is preferable to reduce information loss and enhance the coherent transport.

Title: Continuous-time quantum optimisation without the adiabatic principle
Authors: Robert J. Banks, Georgios S. Raftis, Dan E. Browne, P. A. Warburton
Abstract: Continuous-time quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimisation problems, such as quantum annealing, have previously been motivated by the adiabatic principle. A number of continuous-time approaches exploit dynamics, however, and therefore are no longer physically motivated by the adiabatic principle. In this work, we take Planck's principle as the underlying physical motivation for continuous-time quantum algorithms. Planck's principle states that the energy of an isolated system cannot decrease as the result of a cyclic process. We use this principle to justify monotonic schedules in quantum annealing, which are not adiabatic. This approach also highlights the limitations of reverse quantum annealing in an isolated system.

Title: Thermalization in Trapped Bosonic Systems With Disorder
Authors: Javier de la Cruz, Carlos Diaz-Mejia, Sergio Lerma-Hernandez, Jorge G. Hirsch
Abstract: A detailed study of thermalization is conducted on experimentally accessible states in a system of bosonic atoms trapped in an open linear chain with disorder. When the disorder parameter is large, the system exhibits regularity and localization. In contrast, weak disorder introduces chaos and raises questions about the validity of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), especially for states at the extremes of the energy spectrum which remain regular and non-thermalizing. The validity of ETH is assessed by examining the dispersion of entanglement entropy and the number of bosons on the first site across various dimensions, while maintaining a constant particle density of one. Experimentally accessible states in the occupation basis are categorized using a crowding parameter that linearly correlates with their mean energy. Using full exact diagonalization to simulate temporal evolution, we study the equilibration of entanglement entropy, the number of bosons, and the reduced density matrix of the first site for all states in the occupation basis. Comparing equilibrium values of these observables with those predicted by microcanonical ensembles, we find that, within certain tolerances, most states in the chaotic region thermalize. However, states with low participation ratios in the energy eigenstate basis show greater deviations from thermal equilibrium values.

Title: Persistent oscillation of a Cooper-pair condensate of topological defects in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain
Authors: Francis A. Bayocboc Jr., Jacek Dziarmaga, Marek M. Rams, Wojciech H. Zurek
Abstract: We identify persistent oscillations in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain. In the integrable chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, the nature, origin, and decay of post-transition oscillations are tied to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Remarkably, when coupling to the next-nearest neighbor is added, the resulting nonintegrable ''zigzag'' chain (still in the quantum Ising universality class) supports persistent oscillation: Topological defects (kinks) appear as a result of the quantum phase transition. However, in a ''zigzag'' Ising chain defects can form Cooper pairs. The oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate has a frequency that depends on the binding energy gap between the paired and the unpaired defects, so it can be excited by resonant driving. While one might have expected that the integrability-breaking ''zigzag'' coupling causes relaxation, the oscillations we identify are persistent: Their longevity in our simulations is likely limited only by numerical accuracy. This oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate of kinks is a manifestation of quantum coherence and should be experimentally accessible.

Title: An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states
Authors: Ting-Tung Wang, Menghan Song, Zi Yang Meng, Tarun Grover
Abstract: We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of topological order in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the Rényi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.

Title: Slow approach to adiabaticity in many-body non-Hermitian systems: the Hatano-Nelson Model
Authors: Léonce Dupays, Adolfo del Campo, Balázs Dóra
Abstract: We explore the near adiabatic dynamics in a non-Hermitian quantum many-body system by investigating a finite-time ramp of the imaginary vector potential in the interacting Hatano-Nelson model. The excess energy, the Loschmidt echo, and the density imbalance are analyzed using bosonization and exact diagonalization. The energy becomes complex valued, despite the instantaneous Hamiltonian having the same real spectrum throughout. The adiabatic limit is approached very slowly through damped oscillations. The decay scales with $\tau^{-1}$ with $\tau$ the ramp duration, while the oscillation period is $2L/v$ with $v$ the Fermi velocity and $L$ the system length. Yet, without the need for auxiliary controls, a shortcut to adiabaticity is found for ramp times commensurate with the period. Our work highlights the intricate interplay of adiabaticity and non-Hermitian many-body physics.

Title: Low-overhead magic state distillation with color codes
Authors: Seok-Hyung Lee, Felix Thomsen, Nicholas Fazio, Benjamin J. Brown, Stephen D. Bartlett
Abstract: Fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates is a major challenge for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with quantum error-correcting codes. Magic state distillation is the most well-studied method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two carefully designed distillation schemes based on the 15-to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, differing in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme employs faulty T-measurement, achieving infidelities of $O(p^3)$ for physical noise strength $p$. To achieve lower infidelities, our second scheme integrates distillation with `cultivation' (a distillation-free approach to fault-tolerantly prepare magic states through transversal Clifford measurements). Our second scheme achieves significantly lower infidelities (e.g., $\sim 2 \times 10^{-16}$ at $p = 10^{-3}$), surpassing the capabilities of both cultivation and single-level distillation. Notably, to reach a given target infidelity, our schemes require approximately two orders of magnitude fewer resources than the previous best magic state distillation schemes for color codes.

Title: Mode hitching in traveling-wave optical parametric amplification
Authors: Joseph Kelly, Eleanor Fradgley, Lida Zhang, Vincent Boyer
Abstract: Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) in traveling wave configuration can generate localized spatial quantum correlations between a signal and an idler beam, a useful resource for quantum imaging. This study focuses on the classical transverse dynamics of the signal and idler beams when they propagate in a generic thick OPA at a nominally small angle. It shows that the beams tend to copropagate while maintaining a fixed separation, a phenomenon that we term hitching. We provide a model for hitching, validated by a numerical simulation, and we provide an experimental demonstration using four-wave mixing (4WM) in a hot atomic vapor. It shows that the OPA gain is the primary influence on the final hitching distance. These results have implications for the generation of multi-spatial-mode squeezed light for quantum imaging applications, where the exact spatial correspondence between the quantum fluctuations of the signal and the idler is of prime importance.

Title: Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits
Authors: Menghan Song, Zhaoyi Zeng, Ting-Tung Wang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zi Yang Meng, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.

Title: Near-field dynamical Casimir effect
Authors: Renwen Yu, Shanhui Fan
Abstract: We propose the dynamical Casimir effect in a time-modulated near-field system at finite temperatures. The system consists of two bodies made of polaritonic materials, that are brought in close proximity to each other, and the modulation frequency is approximately twice the relevant resonance frequencies of the system. We develop a rigorous fluctuational electrodynamics formalism to explore the produced Casimir flux, associated with the degenerate as well as non-degenerate two-polariton emission processes. We have identified flux contributions from both quantum and thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures, with a dominant quantum contribution even at room temperature under the presence of a strong near-field effect. We have found that the Casimir flux can be generated with a smaller modulation frequency through higher-order dynamical Casimir effect. We have conducted a nonclassicality test for the total radiative flux at finite temperatures, and shown that nonclassical states of emitted photons can be obtained for a high temperature up to $\sim 250\,$K. Our findings open an avenue for the exploration of dynamical Casimir effect beyond cryogenic temperatures, and may be useful for creating tunable nanoscale nonclassical thermal states.

Title: Designing Robust Quantum Neural Networks via Optimized Circuit Metrics
Authors: Walid El Maouaki, Alberto Marchisio, Taoufik Said, Muhammad Shafique, Mohamed Bennai
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the robustness of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) in comparison to their classical counterparts, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), against two adversarial attacks: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), for the image classification task on both Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST) datasets. To enhance the robustness of QuNNs, we developed a novel methodology that utilizes three quantum circuit metrics: expressibility, entanglement capability, and controlled rotation gate selection. Our analysis shows that these metrics significantly influence data representation within the Hilbert space, thereby directly affecting QuNN robustness. We rigorously established that circuits with higher expressibility and lower entanglement capability generally exhibit enhanced robustness under adversarial conditions, particularly at low-spectrum perturbation strengths where most attacks occur. Furthermore, our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that expressibility alone dictates circuit robustness; instead, we demonstrate that the inclusion of controlled rotation gates around the Z-axis generally enhances the resilience of QuNNs. Our results demonstrate that QuNNs exhibit up to 60% greater robustness on the MNIST dataset and 40% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset compared to CNNs. Collectively, our work elucidates the relationship between quantum circuit metrics and robust data feature extraction, advancing the field by improving the adversarial robustness of QuNNs.

Title: Solving Drone Routing Problems with Quantum Computing: A Hybrid Approach Combining Quantum Annealing and Gate-Based Paradigms
Authors: Eneko Osaba, Pablo Miranda-Rodriguez, Andreas Oikonomakis, Matic Petrič, Alejandra Ruiz, Sebastian Bock, Michail-Alexandros Kourtis
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach to solving real-world drone routing problems by leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing. The proposed method, coined Quantum for Drone Routing (Q4DR), integrates the two most prominent paradigms in the field: quantum gate-based computing, through the Eclipse Qrisp programming language; and quantum annealers, by means of D-Wave System's devices. The algorithm is divided into two different phases: an initial clustering phase executed using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and a routing phase employing quantum annealers. The efficacy of Q4DR is demonstrated through three use cases of increasing complexity, each incorporating real-world constraints such as asymmetric costs, forbidden paths, and itinerant charging points. This research contributes to the growing body of work in quantum optimization, showcasing the practical applications of quantum computing in logistics and route planning.

Title: Theoretical Limits of Protocols for Distinguishing Different Unravelings
Authors: J. L. Gaona-Reyes, D. G. A. Altamura, A. Bassi
Abstract: The evolution of an open quantum system is often described by a master equation, which governs the dynamics of the statistical operator. The dynamics of a master equation can be expressed as an ensemble average over stochastic trajectories, known as stochastic unravelings, which correspond to different measurement schemes and provide a wavefunction-level description of the system's evolution. The fact that a given master equation admits multiple unravelings raises the question of whether these different stochastic descriptions can be operationally distinguished, as recently suggested. We analyze this possibility: we show that while unraveling-dependent quantities indeed differ at the mathematical level, as already known in the literature, they can only be computed once the measurement procedure implementing the unraveling is already given, rendering them inaccessible when the procedure is unknown.

Title: Bypassing orthogonalization in the quantum DPP sampler
Authors: Michaël Fanuel, Rémi Bardenet
Abstract: Given an $n\times r$ matrix $X$ of rank $r$, consider the problem of sampling $r$ integers $\mathtt{C}\subset \{1, \dots, n\}$ with probability proportional to the squared determinant of the rows of $X$ indexed by $\mathtt{C}$. The distribution of $\mathtt{C}$ is called a projection determinantal point process (DPP). The vanilla classical algorithm to sample a DPP works in two steps, an orthogonalization in $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ and a sampling step of the same cost. The bottleneck of recent quantum approaches to DPP sampling remains that preliminary orthogonalization step. For instance, (Kerenidis and Prakash, 2022) proposed an algorithm with the same $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization, followed by a $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ classical step to find the gates in a quantum circuit. The classical $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization thus still dominates the cost. Our first contribution is to reduce preprocessing to normalizing the columns of $X$, obtaining $\mathsf{X}$ in $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ classical operations. We show that a simple circuit inspired by the formalism of Kerenidis et al., 2022 samples a DPP of a type we had never encountered in applications, which is different from our target DPP. Plugging this circuit into a rejection sampling routine, we recover our target DPP after an expected $1/\det \mathsf{X}^\top\mathsf{X} = 1/a$ preparations of the quantum circuit. Using amplitude amplification, our second contribution is to boost the acceptance probability from $a$ to $1-a$ at the price of a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(r\log n/\sqrt{a})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ extra qubits. Prepending a fast, sketching-based classical approximation of $a$, we obtain a pipeline to sample a projection DPP on a quantum computer, where the former $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ preprocessing bottleneck has been replaced by the $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ cost of normalizing the columns and the cost of our approximation of $a$.

Title: The study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective
Authors: Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.

Title: Observation of the acoustic Purcell effect with a color-center and a nanomechanical resonator
Authors: Graham Joe, Michael Haas, Kazuhiro Kuruma, Chang Jin, Dongyeon Daniel Kang, Sophie Ding, Cleaven Chia, Hana Warner, Benjamin Pingault, Bartholomeus Machielse, Srujan Meesala, Marko Loncar
Abstract: The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.

Title: Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures
Authors: D. Bafia, B. Abdisatarov, R. Pilipenko, Y. Lu, G. Eremeev, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10 mK and at 6 GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6 GHz niobium cavity at 10 mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $>$100 mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$ 10 mG limits $Q_0\sim$ 10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$ 350 ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1>$ 1 s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.

Title: Enhanced quantum sensing in time-modulated non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Qi-Cheng Wu, Yan-Hui Zhou, Tong Liu, Yi-Hao Kang, Qi-Ping Su, Chui-Ping Yang, Zheng-Wei Zhou
Abstract: Enhancing the sensitivity of quantum sensing near an exceptional point represents a significant phenomenon in non-Hermitian (NH) systems. However, the application of this property in time-modulated NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose two theoretical schemes to achieve enhanced quantum sensing in time-modulated NH systems by leveraging the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenstates. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the full energy spectrum, including both real and imaginary components, the population distribution of eigenstates, and various characteristics associated with optimal conditions for sensitivity enhancement. Numerical simulations confirm that eigenvalue-based quantum sensors exhibit a 9.21-fold improvement compared to conventional Hermitian sensors, aligning with the performance of existing time-independent NH sensors. Conversely, for eigenstate-based quantum sensors, the enhancement reaches up to 50 times that of conventional Hermitian sensors, surpassing the results of existing time-independent NH sensors. Moreover, the eigenstate-based sensor exhibits divergent susceptibility even when not close to an exceptional point. Our findings pave the way for advanced sensing in time-sensitive contexts, thereby complementing existing efforts aimed at harnessing the unique properties of open systems.

Title: Stochastic inflation and entropy bound in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Hiromasa Tajima, Yasusada Nambu
Abstract: We investigate the entropy dynamics of de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. The cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime, which limits the causally accessible region for an observer, exhibits thermal properties similar to a black hole event horizon. According to holographic principles, the entropy within a causally connected region is bounded by its surface area. However, this entropy bound is violated during the eternal phase of inflation. To address these violations from a quantum information perspective, we adopt a stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. Specifically, we analyze the Shannon entropy of the inflaton field's probability distribution, which mirrors the behavior of the entanglement entropy of a Hubble-sized region in stochastic inflation. Using the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we demonstrate a significant entropy behavior in de Sitter spacetime.

Title: Ballistic Entanglement Cloud after a Boundary Quench
Authors: Bedoor Alkurtass, Abolfazl Bayat, Pasquale Sodano, Sougato Bose, Henrik Johannesson
Abstract: Entanglement has been extensively used to characterize the structure of strongly correlated many-body systems. Most of these analyses focus on either spatial properties of entanglement or its temporal behavior. Negativity, as an entanglement measure, quantifies entanglement between different non-complementary blocks of a many-body system. Here, we consider a combined spatial-temporal analysis of entanglement negativity in a strongly correlated many-body system to characterize complex formation of correlations through non-equilibrium dynamics of such systems. A bond defect is introduced through a local quench at one of the boundaries of a uniform Heisenberg spin chain. Using negativity and entanglement entropy, computed by the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group, we analyze the extension of entanglement in the model as a function of time. We find that an entanglement cloud is formed, detached from the boundary spin and composed of spins with which it is highly entangled. The cloud travels ballistically in the chain until it reaches the other end where it reflects back and the cycle repeats. The revival dynamics exhibits an intriguing contraction (expansion) of the cloud as it moves away from (towards) the boundary spin.

Title: Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputing Architecture
Authors: Seongmin Kim, Vincent R. Pascuzzi, Zhihao Xu, Tengfei Luo, Eungkyu Lee, In-Saeng Suh
Abstract: Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems by providing quantum speedup on near-term gate-based quantum computing systems. However, QAOA faces challenges for high-dimensional problems due to the large number of qubits required and the complexity of deep circuits, limiting its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we present a distributed QAOA (DQAOA), which leverages distributed computing strategies to decompose a large computational workload into smaller tasks that require fewer qubits and shallower circuits than necessitated to solve the original problem. These sub-problems are processed using a combination of high-performance and quantum computing resources. The global solution is iteratively updated by aggregating sub-solutions, allowing convergence toward the optimal solution. We demonstrate that DQAOA can handle considerably large-scale optimization problems (e.g., 1,000-bit problem) achieving a high approximation ratio ($\sim$99%) and short time-to-solution ($\sim$276 s), outperforming existing strategies. Furthermore, we realize DQAOA on a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, paving the way for practical applications of gate-based quantum computers in real-world optimization tasks. To extend DQAOA's applicability to materials science, we further develop an active learning algorithm integrated with our DQAOA (AL-DQAOA), which involves machine learning, DQAOA, and active data production in an iterative loop. We successfully optimize photonic structures using AL-DQAOA, indicating that solving real-world optimization problems using gate-based quantum computing is feasible. We expect the proposed DQAOA to be applicable to a wide range of optimization problems and AL-DQAOA to find broader applications in material design.

Title: Dual-Mode Calorimetric Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors

Abstract: A dual-operation mode SNSPD is proposed. In the conventional Geiger mode, the sensor operates at temperatures well below the critical temperature, Tc, working as an event counter without sensitivity to the number of photons impinging the sensor. In the calorimetric mode, the detector is operated at temperatures just below TC and displays calorimetric sensitivity in the range of 15 to 250 absorbed-photon energy equivalent for a photon beam with a wavelength of 515 nm. In this energy sensitive mode, photon absorption causes Joule heating of the SNSPD that becomes partially resistive without the presence of latching. Depending on the application, by tuning the sample temperature and bias current using the same readout system, the SNSPD can readily switch between the two modes. In the calorimetric mode, SNSPD recovery times shorter than the ones in the Geiger mode are observed, reaching values as low as 560 ps. Dual-mode SNSPDs may provide significant advancements in spectroscopy and calorimetry, where precise timing, photon counting and energy resolution are required.

Title: Benchmarking quantum chaos from geometric complexity
Authors: Arpan Bhattacharyya, Suddhasattwa Brahma, Satyaki Chowdhury, Xiancong Luo
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that there is a strong interplay between quantum complexity and quantum chaos. In this work, we consider a new method to study geometric complexity for interacting non-Gaussian quantum mechanical systems to benchmark the quantum chaos in a well-known oscillator model. In particular, we study the circuit complexity for the unitary time-evolution operator of a non-Gaussian bosonic quantum mechanical system. Our results indicate that, within some limitations, geometric complexity can indeed be a good indicator of quantum chaos.

Title: Quantum States Imaging of Magnetic Field Contours based on Autler-Townes Effect in Yb Atoms
Authors: Tanaporn Na Narong, Hongquan Li, Joshua Tong, Mario Dueñas, Leo Hollberg
Abstract: An inter-combination transition in Yb enables a novel approach for rapidly imaging magnetic field variations with excellent spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy. This quantum imaging magnetometer reveals "dark stripes" that are contours of constant magnetic field visible by eye or capturable by standard cameras. These dark lines result from a combination of Autler-Townes splitting and the spatial Hanle effect in the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition of Yb when driven by multiple strong coherent laser fields (carrier and AM/FM modulation sidebands of a single-mode 556 nm laser). We show good agreement between experimental data and our theoretical model for the closed, 4-level Zeeman shifted V-system and demonstrate scalar and vector magnetic fields measurements at video frame rates over spatial dimensions of 5 cm with 0.1 mm resolution. Additionally, the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition allows for $\sim\mu$s response time and a large dynamic range (from microtesla to many tesla).

Title: Achievable Rate Regions for Multi-terminal Quantum Channels via Coset Codes
Authors: Fatma Gouiaa, Arun Padakandla
Abstract: We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating classical information over (i) a $3-$user quantum interference channel (QIC) and (ii) a $3-$user quantum broadcast channel (QBC). Our focus is on characterizing inner bounds. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that coding strategies based on coset codes can yield strictly larger inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of \textit{tilting}, \textit{smoothing} and \textit{augmentation} discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of both the $3-$user QIC and $3-$user QBC. The derived inner bound subsumes all current known bounds.
