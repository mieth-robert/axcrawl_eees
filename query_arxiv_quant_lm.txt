Title: An entanglement protocol to measure atomic parity violation at sub 0.1% precision
Authors: Diana P. L. Aude Craik
Abstract: This paper proposes a scheme to measure atomic parity violation (APV) in barium ions at <0.1% precision. The scheme is based on using multi-ion entangled states to common-mode reject parity-conserving systematic shifts and selectively detect a parity-violating vector light shift. This measurement protocol eliminates the need to suppress a leading systematic by 11 orders of magnitude, as is required in the single-ion measurement scheme [N. Fortson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2383 (1993)]. Furthermore, the protocol can be combined with the use of integrated photonic waveguides in an architecture that is scalable to large ion numbers, with a proportional increase in measurement precision.

Title: Warm Start Adaptive-Bias Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
Authors: Yunlong Yu, Xiang-Bin Wang, Nic Shannon, Robert Joynt
Abstract: In the search for quantum advantage in real--world problems, one promising avenue is to use a quantum algorithm to improve on the solution found using an efficient classical algorithm. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is particularly well adapted for such a "warm start" approach, and can be combined with the powerful classical Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithms based on semi-definite programming. Nonetheless, the best way to leverage the power of the QAOA remains an open question. Here we propose a general model that describes a class of QAOA variants, and use it to explore routes to quantum advantages in a canonical optimization problem, MaxCut. For these algorithms we derive analytic expectation values of the cost Hamiltonian for the MaxCut problem in the level-1 case. Using these analytic results we obtain reliable averages over many instances for fairly large numbers of qubits. We find that the warm start adaptive-bias QAOA (WS-ab-QAOA) initialized by the GW algorithm outperforms previously proposed warm start variants on problems with $40$ to $180$ qubits. To assess whether a quantum advantage exists with this algorithm, we did numerical simulations with up to $1000$ qubits to see whether the level-1 WS-ab-QAOA can improve the GW solution for 3-regular graphs. In fact the improvement in the $1000$-qubit case even in level 1 can only be matched by the GW algorithm after about $10^{5.5}$ random projections performed after the semi-definite program stage. This work gives evidence that the final stage of optimization after an efficient classical algorithm has produced an approximate solution may be a place where quantum advantages can be realized.

Title: Variational M-Partite Geometric Entanglement Algorithm
Authors: Vahid Azimi-Mousolou, Prashant Singh
Abstract: We propose a variational quantum algorithm to evaluate the $M$-partite geometric entanglement across arbitrary partitions of an $N$-qubit system into $M$ parties. By constructing tailored variational ansatz circuits for both single- and multi-qubit parties, we optimize the overlap between a target quantum state and an $M$-partite variational separable state. This method provides a flexible and scalable approach for characterizing arbitrary $M$-partite entanglement in complex quantum systems of a given dimension. We assess the accuracy of the proposed method by reproducing known analytical results and demonstrate its capability to evaluate entanglement among $M$ parties for any given conventional or unconventional partitions of one- and two-dimensional spin systems, both near and at a quantum critical point. Our results establish the versatility of the variational approach in capturing different types of entanglement in various quantum systems, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. Our approach offers a powerful methodology for advancing research in quantum information science, condensed matter physics, and quantum field theory. Additionally, we discuss its advantages, highlighting its adaptability to diverse system architectures in the context of near-term quantum devices.

Title: Magnon Shake-up: Entanglement Generation and Sensing
Authors: Vahid Azimi-Mousolou, Anna Delin, Erik Sjöqvist, Olle Eriksson
Abstract: Shake-up phenomena, rooted in the sudden approximation and many-body quantum dynamics, unveil critical characteristics of quantum systems, with wide-ranging applications in molecular spectroscopy and electronic structure studies. By extending this principle to magnonics systems, we demonstrate magnonics shake-up structures and their relevance in generating and sensing magnon-magnon entanglement. This not only reveals new insights into shake-up phenomena and quantum magnonics but also paves the way for new opportunities in quantum technologies.

Title: Enhancing wave-particle duality
Authors: Arwa Bukhari, Daniel Hodgson, Sara Kanzi, Robert Purdy, Almut Beige
Abstract: Although wave-particle duality is a cornerstone of quantum physics, standard approaches often treat waves and particles differently. To elevate wave-particle duality, in this paper we quantise mechanical point particles in the same physically-motivated way as we quantise light in quantum electrodynamics. In the approach we present here, instead of starting from Hamilton's equations, we consider Newton's equations of motion, which are mass-independent. In the resulting quantum theory, particles can occupy any position while moving at any velocity. Standard quantum mechanics emerges from our approach when certain semi-classical approximations are imposed.

Title: Relativity of Quantum Correlations: Invariant Quantities and Frame-Dependent Measures
Authors: Michael Suleymanov, Avishy Carmi, Eliahu Cohen
Abstract: Viewing frames of reference as physical systems -- subject to the same laws as the systems they describe -- is central to the relational approach in physics. Under the assumption that quantum mechanics universally governs all physical entities, this perspective naturally leads to the concept of quantum reference frames (QRFs). We investigate the perspective-dependence of position and momentum uncertainties, correlations, covariance matrices and entanglement within the QRF formalism. We show that the Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty relations are frame-dependent, and so are correlations and variances which satisfy various constraints described as inequalities. However, the determinant of the total covariance matrix, linked to the uncertainty volume in phase space, as well as a certain kind of entanglement entropy, remains invariant under changes of reference frame. These invariants suggest fundamental, robust measures of uncertainty and entanglement that persist despite changes in observational perspective, potentially inspiring dedicated quantum information protocols as well as further foundational studies.

Title: High-efficiency vertical emission spin-photon interface for scalable quantum memories
Authors: Siavash Mirzaei-Ghormish, Jeddy Bennet, Ryan M. Camacho
Abstract: We present an efficient spin-photon interface for free-space vertical emission coupling. Using a digital twin approach, we show that our design achieves a far-field collection efficiency of 96\% at the numerical aperture of 0.7 with a 95\% overlap to a Gaussian mode. Our approach is based on a dual perturbation layer design. The first perturbation layer extracts and redirects the resonant mode of a diamond microdisk resonator around the optical axis. The second perturbation layer suppresses side lobes and concentrates most of the light intensity near the center. This dual-layer design enhances control over the farfield pattern and also reduces alignment sensitivity. Additionally, the implemented digital twin performs calculations \( 7 \times 10^6 \) times faster than full-wave FDTD simulations. These features make the design promising for quantum information applications.

Title: Optimal shortcut-to-adiabaticity quantum control
Authors: C. L. Latune, D. Sugny, S. Guérin
Abstract: We introduce a new class of Shortcut-To-Adiabaticity (STA) protocols with minimal energy expenditure. The control process produces the same transformation as a counterdiabatic drive, but at the lowest possible energy cost. We apply optimal control theory to analytically design the latter for a qubit. We discuss the robustness of this control scheme with respect to a standard STA approach.

Title: Quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model
Authors: Hiroo Azuma, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto
Abstract: We explore quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM). Using the mean-field approximation, we show that multiphoton JCHM reveals quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI), superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phases. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. If this conserved quantity diverges to infinity, this system is in the BEC phase. Exploring this system we observe the MI, BEC, and superfluid phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs although the two-photon JCHM MI phases are restricted to the small conserved quantity subspace. Contrastingly, only the superfluid and BEC phases arise in the three- and four-photon JCHMs (the MI phase is not observed).

Title: Synthesis of Single Qutrit Circuits from Clifford+R
Authors: Erik J. Gustafson, Henry Lamm, Diyi Liu, Edison M. Murairi, Shuchen Zhu
Abstract: We present two deterministic algorithms to approximate single-qutrit gates. These algorithms utilize the Clifford + $\mathbf{R}$ group to find the best approximation of diagonal rotations. The first algorithm exhaustively searches over the group; while the second algorithm searches only for Householder reflections. The exhaustive search algorithm yields an average $\mathbf{R}$ count of $2.193(11) + 8.621(7) \log_{10}(1 / \varepsilon)$, albeit with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4.4})$. The Householder search algorithm results in a larger average $\mathbf{R}$ count of $3.20(13) + 10.77(3) \log_{10}(1 / \varepsilon)$ at a reduced time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-0.42})$, greatly extending the reach in $\varepsilon$. These costs correspond asymptotically to 35% and 69% more non-Clifford gates compared to synthesizing the same unitary with two qubits. Such initial results are encouraging for using the $\mathbf{R}$ gate as the non-transversal gate for qutrit-based computation.

Title: Fast and Noise-aware Machine Learning Variational Quantum Eigensolver Optimiser
Authors: Akib Karim, Shaobo Zhang, Muhammad Usman
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for preparing ground states in the current era of noisy devices. The classical component of the algorithm requires a large number of measurements on intermediate parameter values that are typically discarded. However, intermediate steps across many calculations can contain valuable information about the relationship between the quantum circuit parameters, resultant measurements, and noise specific to the device. In this work, we use supervised machine learning on the intermediate parameter and measurement data to predict optimal final parameters. Our technique optimises parameters leading to chemically accurate ground state energies much faster than conventional techniques. It requires significantly fewer iterations and simultaneously shows resilience to coherent errors if trained on noisy devices. We demonstrate this technique on IBM quantum devices by predicting ground state energies of H$_2$ for one and two qubits; H$_3$ for three qubits; and HeH$^+$ for four qubits where it finds optimal angles using only modeled data for training.

Title: Efficient hyperentanglement-based quantum secret sharing protocol
Authors: Cheng Zhang, Fu-Le Hao, Shi-Pu Gu, Xing-Fu Wang, Lan Zhou, Yu-Bo Sheng
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a typical multipartite cryptographic primitive, which is an important part of quantum communication network. Existing QSS protocols generally require basis selection and matching, which would increase the quantum resource consumption and classical communication round, and also face weak random security vulnerabilities. We propose an efficient hyperentanglement-based QSS protocol without the basis selection, in which the dealer and partners share a polarization-momentum hyperentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and encode keys in the polarization degree of freedom (DOF). The dealer decodes the transmitted keys relying on the nonlocal hyperentanglement-assisted polarization GHZ state analysis. Our QSS protocol is unconditionally secure in theory. We develop simulation method to estimate its performance in practical environment. Compared with the QSS based on the GHZ state, our protocol has several advantages. First, it does not require basis selection and can completely distinguish eight polarization GHZ states, which can improve the utilization rate of entanglement resources to 100$\%$ and increase the key generation rate by an order of magnitude. Second, it only requires one round of classical communication, and thus can reduce key generation time by 69.4$\%$. Third, it can eliminate the weak random security vulnerabilities associated with the basis selection. Finally, our protocol only uses linear optical elements, which makes it practically feasible. Our QSS protocol has potential application in future quantum communication network.

Title: Transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in monitored quantum dynamics with homogeneous unitary gates
Authors: Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We explore the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in systems evolved by quantum measurements and spatially homogeneous unitary gates. In models with temporally random and Floquet unitary gates, we find that the Lyapunov exponents typically converge to values independent of measurement outcomes and that spectral transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement transitions of ground states occur at the same measurement thresholds. Our results indicate that (i) randomness due to quantum measurements is enough, or equivalently, randomness of unitary gates is not essential, for the typical convergence of the Lyapunov spectrum and that (ii) the correspondence between the spectral transition and entanglement transition is ubiquitous in a wide range of systems. We also discuss why the typical convergence occurs, in light of the uniqueness and positive definiteness of stationary states in the completely-positive trace-preserving (CPTP) dynamics averaged over random measurement outcomes.

Title: Quantum circuits for simulating neutrino propagation in matter
Authors: Sandeep Joshi, Garima Rajpoot, Prashant Shukla
Abstract: Quantum simulation of particle phenomena is a rapidly advancing field of research. With the widespread availability of quantum simulators, a given quantum system can be simulated in numerous ways, offering flexibility in implementation and exploration. Here, we perform quantum simulation of neutrino propagation in matter, a phenomenon that plays a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. We present quantum circuits with novel gate arrangements to simulate neutrino propagation in both constant and varying matter density profiles. The oscillation probabilities are determined by encoding and measuring the qubit states in the neutrino flavor basis, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.

Title: A Blockchain-based Quantum Binary Voting for Decentralized IoT Towards Industry 5.0
Authors: Utkarsh Azad, Bikash K. Behera, Houbing Song, Ahmed Farouk
Abstract: Industry 5.0 depends on intelligence, automation, and hyperconnectivity operations for effective and sustainable human-machine collaboration. Pivotal technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) enable this by facilitating connectivity and data-driven decision-making between cyber-physical devices. As IoT devices are prone to cyberattacks, they can use blockchain to improve transparency in the network and prevent data tampering. However, in some cases, even blockchain networks are vulnerable to Sybil and 51% attacks. This has motivated the development of quantum blockchains that are more resilient to such attacks as they leverage post-quantum cryptographic protocols and secure quantum communication channels. In this work, we develop a quantum binary voting algorithm for the IoT-quantum blockchain frameworks that enables inter-connected devices to reach a consensus on the validity of transactions, even in the presence of potential faults or malicious actors. The correctness of the voting protocol is provided in detail, and the results show that it guarantees the achievement of a consensus securely against all kinds of significant external and internal attacks concerning quantum bit commitment, quantum blockchain, and quantum Byzantine agreement. We also provide an implementation of the voting algorithm with the quantum circuits simulated on the IBM Quantum platform and Simulaqron library.

Title: Intra-band entanglement-assisted cavity electro-optic quantum transducer
Authors: Yu-Bo Hou, Rui-Zhe You, Di-Jia Zhang, Pengbo Li, Changchun Zhong
Abstract: Quantum transduction is a key technology for connecting different quantum technologies across varied frequencies. However, it remains a major challenge to overcome the high threshold for achieving positive capacity of traditional quantum transduction channels. Recently, an entanglement-assisted transducer was proposed based on a cavity-optic system [Opt. Quantum 2, 475 (2024)], where a modified bosonic loss channel was obtained, and the transduction efficiency can be enhanced by properly tuning the squeezing parameters. In this paper, we further identify three types of quantum channels enabled by this design, offering additional options for implementing the proposed transduction schemes. Compared to the transducers without entanglement assistance, the scheme also shows a great enhancement in the conversion bandwidth for achieving high quantum capacity, further increasing its value in practical applications.

Title: Tunable coherent microwave beam splitter and combiner at the single-photon level
Authors: Y.-H. Huang, K.-M. Hsieh, F. Aziz, Z. Q. Niu, P. Y. Wen, Y.-T. Cheng, Y.-S. Tsai, J. C. Chen, Xin Wang, A. F. Kockum, Z.-R. Lin, Y.-H. Lin, I.-C. Hoi
Abstract: A beam splitter is a key component used to direct and combine light paths in various optical and microwave systems. It plays a crucial role in devices like interferometers, such as the Mach-Zehnder and Hong-Ou-Mandel setups, where it splits light into different paths for interference measurements. These measurements are vital for precise phase and coherence testing in both classical and quantum optical experiments. In this work, we present a nonlinear beam splitter and beam combiner utilizing a frequency-tunable superconducting artificial atom in a one-dimensional open waveguide. This beam splitter is highly versatile, with adjustable transparency ranging from unity to zero for signals at the single-photon level. Additionally, the beam combiner can merge two coherent beams, generating interference fringes as the relative phase between them varies.

Title: Power Networks SCADA Communication Cybersecurity, A Qiskit Implementation
Authors: Hillol Biswas
Abstract: The cyber-physical system of electricity power networks utilizes supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), which are inherently vulnerable to cyber threats if usually connected with the internet technology (IT). Power system operations are conducted through communication systems that are mapped to standards, protocols, ports, and addresses. Real-time situational awareness is a standard term with implications and applications in both power systems and cybersecurity. In the plausible quantum world (Q-world), conventional approaches will likely face new challenges. The unique art of transmitting a quantum state from one place, Alice, to another, Bob, is known as quantum communication. Quantum communication for SCADA communication in a plausible quantum era thus obviously entails wired communication through optical fiber networks complying with the typical cybersecurity criteria of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for classical internet technology unless a quantum internet (qinternet) transpires practically. When combined with the reverse order of AIC for operational technology, the cybersecurity criteria for power networks' critical infrastructure drill down to more specific sub-areas. Unlike other communication modes, such as information technology (IT) in broadband internet connections, SCADA for power networks, one of the critical infrastructures, is intricately intertwined with operations technology (OT), which significantly increases complexity. Though it is desirable to have a barrier called a demilitarized zone (DMZ), some overlap is inevitable. This paper highlights the opportunities and challenges in securing SCADA communication in the plausible quantum computing and communication regime, along with a corresponding integrated Qiskit implementation for possible future framework development.

Title: Electric Field Distortions in Surface Ion Traps with Integrated Nanophotonics
Authors: Guochun Du, Elena Jordan, Tanja E. Mehlstaeubler
Abstract: The integration of photonic components into surface ion traps provides a scalable approach for trapped-ion quantum computing, sensing, and metrology, enabling compact systems with enhanced stability and precision. However, the introduction of optical apertures in the trap electrodes can distort the trapping electric field. This can lead to excess micromotion (EMM) and ion displacement which degrade the performance of quantum logic operations and optical clocks. In this work, we systematically investigate the electric field distortion in a surface ion trap with integrated waveguides and grating couplers using Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We analyze methods to reduce these distortions by exploiting symmetries and transparent conductive oxide materials.

Title: Cavity quantum electrodynamics with single perovskite quantum dots
Authors: Zakaria Said, Marina Cagnon Trouche, Antoine Borel, Mohamed-Raouf Amara, Jakob Reichel, Christophe Voisin, Carole Diederichs, Yannick Chassagneux
Abstract: Quantum emitters of single indistinguishable photons play a key role in quantum technologies. Among condensed matter systems, colloidal perovskite quantum dots have emerged as promising candidates, exhibiting high-purity single photon emission at room temperature and two-photon interference visibilities up to 0.5 at cryogenic temperatures. Achieving deterministic coupling of individual perovskite quantum dots to photonic structures is now a critical step towards harnessing cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) effects, such as the Purcell effect, to enhance single photon emission rate and indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic and reversible coupling of individual CsPbBr$_{3}$ perovskite quantum dots to a tunable, high-quality factor, low mode volume fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity at 10~\si{\kelvin}. By spatially and spectrally tuning the cavity mode in resonance with the quantum dot emission, we observe up to a twofold increase in single photon emission rates. We build on the original multiplet excitonic fine structure to assess the vacuum Rabi coupling strength ($g \simeq$ 40~\si{\micro eV}) from the shaping of the spectral profile of the emission upon increasing the electromagnetic confinement. This approach also made it possible to delineate the contributions of spectral diffusion and pure dephasing to the total linewidth of emission, paving the way to a fully optimized control of the emission properties of cavity coupled perovskite quantum dots.

Title: Charging free fermion quantum batteries
Authors: Riccardo Grazi, Fabio Cavaliere, Maura Sassetti, Dario Ferraro, Niccolò Traverso Ziani
Abstract: The performances of many-body quantum batteries strongly depend on the Hamiltonian of the battery, the initial state, and the charging protocol. In this article we derive an analytical expression for the energy stored via a double sudden quantum quench in a large class of quantum systems whose Hamiltonians can be reduced to 2x2 free fermion problems, whose initial state is thermal. Our results apply to conventional two-band electronic systems across all dimensions and quantum spin chains that can be solved through the Jordan-Wigner transformation. In particular, we apply our analytical relation to the quantum Ising chain, to the quantum XY chain, to the cluster Ising and to the long range SSH models. We obtain several results: (i) The strong dependence of the stored energy on the quantum phase diagram of the charging Hamiltonian persists even when the charging starts from a thermal state. Interestingly, in the thermodynamic limit, such a strong dependence manifests itself as non-analyticities of the stored energy corresponding to the quantum phase transition points of the charging Hamiltonian. (ii) The dependence of the stored energy on the parameters of the Hamiltonian can, in the Ising chain case, be drastically reduced by increasing temperature; (iii) Charging the Ising or the XY chain prepared in the ground state of their classical points leads to an amount of stored energy that, within a large parameter range, does not depend on the charging parameters; (iv) The cluster Ising model and the long range SSH model, despite showing quantum phase transitions (QPTs) between states with orders dominated by different interaction ranges, do not exhibit super-extensive, i.e. more than linear in the number of sites, scaling of the charging power.

Title: Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum control
Authors: Oleksandr Povitchan, Denys I. Bondar, Andrii G. Sotnikov
Abstract: We demonstrate that Lyapunov quantum control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.

Humble, Niraj Kumar, Jeffrey Larson, Danylo Lykov, Michael Mills, Steven A. Moses, Brian Neyenhuis, Shaltiel Eloul, Peter Siegfried, James Walker, Charles Lim, Marco Pistoia
Abstract: While quantum computers have the potential to perform a wide range of practically important tasks beyond the capabilities of classical computers, realizing this potential remains a challenge. One such task is to use an untrusted remote device to generate random bits that can be certified to contain a certain amount of entropy. Certified randomness has many applications but is fundamentally impossible to achieve solely by classical computation. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of certifiably random bits using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the internet. Our protocol leverages the classical hardness of recent random circuit sampling demonstrations: a client generates quantum "challenge" circuits using a small randomness seed, sends them to an untrusted quantum server to execute, and verifies the server's results. We analyze the security of our protocol against a restricted class of realistic near-term adversaries. Using classical verification with measured combined sustained performance of $1.1\times10^{18}$ floating-point operations per second across multiple supercomputers, we certify $71,313$ bits of entropy under this restricted adversary and additional assumptions. Our results demonstrate a step towards the practical applicability of today's quantum computers.

Title: Entanglement routing via passive optics in CV-networks
Authors: David Fainsin, Antoine Debray, Ilya Karuseichyk, Mattia Walschaers, Valentina Parigi
Abstract: Large-scale operations in quantum networks require efficient sorting of desired paths between nodes. In this article, we consider entanglement routing, which involves establishing an entanglement link between specific nodes in a large network of bosonic nodes. The networks are continuous-variable graph states built from finite squeezing and passive linear optics, shaped by complex network structures that mimic real-world networks. We construct a bipartite routing protocol with the specific goal of establishing a teleportation channel between two clients via passive optics operations locally operated by two different providers sharing the network. We provide criteria for extracting the aforementioned channel and, through the use of a derandomised evolutionary algorithm, extend the existing framework to study complex graph topologies.

Title: Measuring Incompatible Observables with Quantum Neural Networks
Authors: Muchun Yang, Yibin Huang, D. L. Zhou
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle imposes a fundamental restriction in quantum mechanics, stipulating that measuring one observable completely erases the information on its conjugate one, thereby preventing simultaneous measurements of incompatible observables. Quantum neural networks (QNNs) is one of the most significant applications on near-term devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we demonstrate that by implementing a multiple-output QNN that emulates a unital quantum channel, one can measure the expectation values of many incompatible observables simultaneously by Pauli-$Z$ measurements on distinct output qubits. We prove the existence of such quantum channel, derive analytical scaling constraints of the measured expectation values, and validate this framework by numerical simulations of observables learning tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals that it requires fewer copies of state when measuring some incompatible observables by the multiple-output QNNs, which demonstrates a resource efficiency advantage compared to separately applying projective measurements.

Title: A decision-theoretic approach to dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics
Authors: Keano De Vos, Gert de Cooman, Alexander Erreygers, Jasper De Bock
Abstract: We provide a decision-theoretic framework for dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics. This uncertainty is two-fold: on the one hand there may be uncertainty about the state the quantum system is in, and on the other hand, as is essential to quantum mechanical uncertainty, even if the quantum state is known, measurements may still produce an uncertain outcome. In our framework, measurements therefore play the role of acts with an uncertain outcome and our simple decision-theoretic postulates ensure that Born's rule is encapsulated in the utility functions associated with such acts. This approach allows us to uncouple (precise) probability theory from quantum mechanics, in the sense that it leaves room for a more general, so-called imprecise probabilities approach. We discuss the mathematical implications of our findings, which allow us to give a decision-theoretic foundation to recent seminal work by Benavoli, Facchini and Zaffalon, and we compare our approach to earlier and different approaches by Deutsch and Wallace.

Title: Filter-enhanced adiabatic quantum computing on a digital quantum processor
Authors: Erenay Karacan, Conor Mc Keever, Michael Foss-Feig, David Hayes, Michael Lubasch
Abstract: Eigenstate filters underpin near-optimal quantum algorithms for ground state preparation. Their realization on current quantum computers, however, poses a challenge as the filters are typically represented by deep quantum circuits. Additionally, since the filters are created probabilistically, their circuits need to be rerun many times when the associated success probability is small. Here we describe a strategy to implement a ground-state filter on quantum hardware in the presence of noise by prepending the filter with digitized adiabatic quantum computing. The adiabatically prepared input state increases the success probability of the filter and also reduces its circuit depth requirements. At the same time, the filter enhances the accuracy of the adiabatically prepared ground state. We compare the approach to the purely adiabatic protocol through numerical simulations and experiments on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. We demonstrate a significant improvement in ground-state accuracies for paradigmatic quantum spin models.

Title: Decoherence time maximization and partial isolation for open quantum harmonic oscillator memory networks
Authors: Igor G. Vladimirov, Ian R. Petersen, Guodong Shi
Abstract: This paper considers a network of open quantum harmonic oscillators which interact with their neighbours through direct energy and field-mediated couplings and also with external quantum fields. The position-momentum dynamic variables of the network are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations associated with the nodes of a graph whose edges specify the interconnection of the component oscillators. Such systems can be employed as Heisenberg picture quantum memories with an engineered ability to approximately retain initial conditions over a bounded time interval. We use the quantum memory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on a weighted mean-square deviation for a subset (or linear combinations) of network variables from their initial values. This approach is applied to maximizing a high-fidelity asymptotic approximation of the decoherence time over the direct energy coupling parameters of the network. The resulting optimality condition is a set of linear equations for blocks of a sparse matrix associated with the edges of the direct energy coupling graph of the network. We also discuss a setting where the quantum network has a subset of dynamic variables which are affected by the external fields only indirectly, through a complementary ``shielding'' system. This holds under a rank condition on the network-field coupling matrix and can be achieved through an appropriate field-mediated coupling between the component oscillators. The partially isolated subnetwork has a longer decoherence time in the high-fidelity limit, thus providing a particularly relevant candidate for a quantum memory.

Title: New perspectives on quantum kernels through the lens of entangled tensor kernels
Authors: Seongwook Shin, Ryan Sweke, Hyunseok Jeong
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are one of the most explored approaches to quantum machine learning. However, the structural properties and inductive bias of quantum kernels are not fully understood. In this work, we introduce the notion of entangled tensor kernels - a generalization of product kernels from classical kernel theory - and show that all embedding quantum kernels can be understood as an entangled tensor kernel. We discuss how this perspective allows one to gain novel insights into both the unique inductive bias of quantum kernels, and potential methods for their dequantization.

Title: Accelerated State Expansion of a Nanoparticle in a Dark Inverted Potential
Authors: Gregoire F. M. Tomassi, Daniel Veldhuizen, Bruno Melo, Davide Candoli, Andreu Riera-Campeny, Oriol Romero-Isart, Nadine Meyer, Romain Quidant
Abstract: While the wave packet of a massive particle grows linearly under free dynamics, it grows exponentially in an inverted harmonic potential, offering a pathway to rapidly increase quantum fluctuations to macroscopic dimensions. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate this principle by expanding the center-of-mass thermal state of a 125nm silica nanoparticle to a position uncertainty of 43.4nm within 260 $\mu$s. This expansion, achieved using an inverted dark potential to minimize decoherence from photon recoil, represents a 952-fold increase, reaching a scale comparable to the nanoparticle's physical size. This work represents a key advancement toward preparing macroscopic quantum superpositions at unprecedented mass and length scales.

Title: New local stabilizer codes from local classical codes
Authors: Lane G. Gunderman
Abstract: Amongst quantum error-correcting codes the surface code has remained of particular promise as it has local and very low-weight checks, even despite only encoding a single logical qubit no matter the lattice size. In this work we discuss new local and low-weight stabilizer codes which are obtained from the recent progress in $2D$ local classical codes. Of note, we construct codes with weight and qubit use count of $5$ while being able to protect the information with high distance, or greater logical count. We also consider the Fibonacci code family which generates weight and qubit use count of $6$ while having parameters $[[O(l^3),O(l),\Omega(l)]]$. While other weight-reduction methods centered on lowering the weight without regard to locality, this work achieves very low-weight and geometric locality. This work is exhaustive over translated classical generators of size $3\times 3$ and up to size $17\times 17$ classical bit grids.

Title: Improving Variational Quantum Circuit Optimization via Hybrid Algorithms and Random Axis Initialization
Authors: Joona V. Pankkonen, Lauri Ylinen, Matti Raasakka, Ilkka Tittonen
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are an essential tool in applying noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers to practical problems. VQCs are used as a central component in many algorithms, for example, in quantum machine learning, optimization, and quantum chemistry. Several methods have been developed to optimize VQCs. In this work, we enhance the performance of the well-known Rotosolve method, a gradient-free optimization algorithm specifically designed for VQCs. We develop two hybrid algorithms that combine an improved version of Rotosolve with the free quaternion selection (FQS) algorithm, which is the main focus of this study. Through numerical simulations, we observe that these hybrid algorithms achieve higher accuracy and better average performance across different ansatz circuit sizes and cost functions. For shallow variational circuits, we identify a trade-off between the expressivity of the variational ansatz and the speed of convergence to the optimum: a more expressive ansatz ultimately reaches a closer approximation to the true minimum, but at the cost of requiring more circuit evaluations for convergence. By combining the less expressive but fast-converging Rotosolve with the more expressive FQS, we construct hybrid algorithms that benefit from the rapid initial convergence of Rotosolve while leveraging the superior expressivity of FQS. As a result, these hybrid approaches outperform either method used independently.

Title: Boundary Time Crystals Induced by Local Dissipation and Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Zhuqing Wang, Ruochen Gao, Xiaoling Wu, Berislav Buča, Klaus Mølmer, Li You, Fan Yang
Abstract: Driven-dissipative many-body system supports nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which inevitably relaxes the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.

Title: The Great Rift in Physics
Authors: Tim Maudlin
Abstract: It is commonly remarked that contemporary physics faces a challenge in reconciling quantum theory with Relativity, specifically General Relativity as a theory of gravity. But "challenge" is too mild a descriptor. Once one understands both what John Bell proved and what Einstein himself demanded of Relativity it becomes clear that the predictions of quantum theory, predictions that have been verified in the lab, are flatly incompatible with what Einstein wanted and built into General Relativity. There is not merely a tension but an incompatibility between the predictions of quantum theory and Relativity, and what has to give way is the Relativistic account of space-time structure and dynamics.

Title: Constraints on Velocity and Spin Dependent Exotic Interaction at the Millimeter Scale with a Diamagnetic-levitated Force Sensor
Authors: Kenan Tian, Yuanji Sheng, Rui Li, Lei Wang, Peiran Yin, Shaochun Lin, Dingjiang Long, Chang-Kui Duan, Xi Kong, Pu Huang, Jiangfeng Du
Abstract: Light bosons, beyond the standard model and as prominent candidates for dark matter, can mediate velocity and spin dependent exotic interaction between electron spins and nucleons. At short ranges, it remains an open challenge to test this exotic interaction with high precision. Here, we present a method based on diamagnetic-levitated force sensor to detect the exotic interaction at the millimeter scale. Improved constraints for the coupling $g_A^e g_V^N$ are established, within the force range spanning from 0.15 mm to 1.5 mm. And the constraint $|g_A^e g_V^N| \leq 4.39 \times10^{-26}$ at $\lambda$ = 0.5 mm at the $95 \%$ confidence level, significantly surpasses previous results by more than three orders of magnitude. The diamagnetic levitation force measurement system developed here can also be repurposed to probe other exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as the exotic spin-spin interaction. This system provides a platform for the exploration of dark matter.

Title: Packaged Quantum States and Symmetry: A Group-Theoretic Framework for Gauge-Invariant Packaged Entanglements
Authors: Rongchao Ma
Abstract: We present a group-theoretic framework showing that any nontrivial representation of a finite or compact group inherently induces packaged entanglement (in which every internal quantum numbers are inseparably entangled) in multiparticle quantum systems.  In this framework, each single-particle excitation carries an inseparable block of internal quantum numbers dictated by its irreducible representation.  The local gauge constraints or superselection rules forbid any partial fractionation of charges or quantum labels.  We illustrate this principle through gauge symmetries ($U(1)$, $SU(2)$, and $SU(3)$), discrete symmetries (charge conjugation $C$, parity $P$, time reversal $T$, and their combinations), and $p$-form symmetries.  In each case, physical requirements (e.g., gauge invariance or superselection) ensure that the resulting states cannot be factorized. These naturally explain phenomena like Bell-type structures, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations.  The packaging principle bridges concepts in gauge theory, quantum information, and topological classifications. Our results may be useful for applications in exotic hadron spectroscopy, the exploration of extended symmetries in field theory, and quantum technologies.

Title: Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes
Authors: Hamid Arian Zad, Michal Jaščur, Nerses Ananikian
Abstract: We investigate tetrapartite and bipartite quantum entanglement in octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ under an external magnetic field using exact diagonalization. These molecular magnets that can be effectively characterized by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two Ni$^\text{2+}_2$Gd$_2^\text{3+}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. We detect that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, reflecting distinct ground states characteristic of Gd-containing compounds. Using negativity as a quantum entanglement measure, we analyze the effects of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite and bipartite entanglements in two families of Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong tetrapartite entanglement, persisting up to $T \approx 2.5$ K and $B \approx 4.0$ T, but considerably weak bipartite entanglement between Ni$\cdots$Ni and Ni$\cdots$Gd links. Conversely, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ shows strong bipartite entanglements but negligible tetrapartite entanglement negativity. These findings highlight the critical role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping entanglement properties in heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ complexes.

Title: Symmetry resolved out-of-time-order correlators of Heisenberg spin chains using projected matrix product operators
Authors: Martina Gisti, David J. Luitz, Maxime Debertolis
Abstract: We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.

Title: Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability
Authors: Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.

Title: Broken symmetry states and Quantum Hall Ferromagnetism in decoupled twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Vineet Pandey, Prasenjit Ghosh, Riju Pal, Sourav Paul, Abhijith M B, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Atindra Nath Pal, Vidya Kochat
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) with large twist angle is a novel 2D bilayer system with strong interlayer Coulomb interactions, whilst suppressed interlayer carrier tunneling due to momentum mismatch between the Dirac cones of individual graphene layers. This interlayer decoherence disentangles the layer degree of freedom from spin-valley space. We demonstrate the role of charge screening effects in electronically decoupled TBLG that determines the Landau level (LL) crossings and multicomponent Quantum Hall (QH) effect resulting from combinations of broken symmetry states with spin and valley flavors of constituent this http URL N = 0 LL at zero filling factor is characterized by a field-induced Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to an ordered ground state, consistent with predictions of intervalley coherent state of Kekulé order. Pronounced hysteresis and electron-hole asymmetry observed in the QH regime suggests pinning of low-energy topological excitations, i.e., skyrmions with spin and valley textures, at charged defects in graphene channel.

Title: An Efficient scaled opposite-spin MP2 method for periodic systems
Authors: Idan Haritan, Xiao Wang, Tamar Goldzak
Abstract: We develop SOS-RILT-MP2, an efficient Gaussian-based periodic scaled opposite-spin second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (SOS-MP2) algorithm that utilizes the resolution-of-the-identity approximation (RI) combined with the Laplace transform technique (LT). In our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 157, 174112 (2022)], we showed that SOS-MP2 yields better predictions of the lattice constant, bulk modulus, and cohesive energy of 12 simple semiconductors and insulators compared to conventional MP2 and some of the leading density functionals. In this work, we present an efficient SOS-MP2 algorithm that has a scaling of O(N4) with the number of atoms N in the unit cell and a reduced scaling with the number of k-points in the Brillouin zone. We implemented and tested our algorithm on both molecular and solid-state systems, confirming the predicted scaling behavior by systematically increasing the number of atoms, the size of the basis set, and the density of k-point sampling. Using the benzene molecular crystal as a case study, we demonstrated that SOS-RILT-MP2 achieves significantly improved efficiency compared to conventional MP2. This efficient algorithm can be used in the future to study complex materials with large unit cells as well as defect structures.

Title: Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D
Authors: Yantao Wu, Wen-Yuan Liu
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.

Title: An electrically controlled single molecule spin switch
Authors: Wantong Huang, Kwan Ho Au-Yeung, Paul Greule, Máté Stark, Christoph Sürgers, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer, Roberto Robles, Nicolas Lorente, Philip Willke
Abstract: Precise control of spin states and spin-spin interactions in atomic-scale magnetic structures is crucial for spin-based quantum technologies. A promising architecture is molecular spin systems, which offer chemical tunability and scalability for larger structures. An essential component, in addition to the qubits themselves, is switchable qubit-qubit interactions that can be individually addressed. In this study, we present an electrically controlled single-molecule spin switch based on a bistable complex adsorbed on an insulating magnesium oxide film. The complex, which consists of an Fe adatom coupled to an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule, can be reversibly switched between two stable states using voltage pulses locally via the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). Inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy (IETS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a distinct change between a paramagnetic and a non-magnetic spin configuration. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of this molecular spin switch by using it to modify the electron spin resonance (ESR) frequency of a nearby target FePc spin within a spin-spin coupled structure. Thus, we showcase how individual molecular machines can be utilized to create scalable and tunable quantum devices.

Title: On light cone bounds in quantum open systems
Authors: Israel Michael Sigal, Xiaoxu Wu
Abstract: We study propagation of quantum information in few-body Markov quantum open systems (MQOS). For a large class of such systems, we prove the existence of an effective light cone with an exponentially small spill-over. We also prove a Lieb-Robinson-type bound and a lower bound on the delivery time of quantum messages. \par Mathematically, we describe space-time behavior of solutions of the von Neumann-Lindblad equation underlying the dynamics of MQOS, which is a natural extension of the Schrödinger equation and is a key example of a non-Abelian PDE of quantum physics.

Title: Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer
Authors: Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.

Title: Prospect for measuring work statistics in quantum coherent systems
Authors: Cheolhee Han, Nadav Katz, Eran Sela
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic thermodynamcis a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities, but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems. Here we discuss the prospect for measuring work statistics in electronic devices, via a study of a transmon-microcavity system. The microwave cavity acts as a work agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics. Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference. Our work opens a way for measuring work statistics in nontrivial quantum systems.

Title: Entropy Gain and Information Loss by Measurements
Authors: Xing M. Wang
Abstract: When the von Neumann entropy (VNE) of a system increases due to measurements, certain information is lost, some of which may be recoverable. We define information retrievability (IR) and information loss (IL) as functions of the density matrix through VNE to illustrate the relationship between gain and loss. We demonstrate that when a pure, unbiased m-qubit state collapses into a maximally mixed state, it experiences the maximal loss of information and the highest gain in entropy, equivalent to the m-bit classical Shannon entropy. We analyze the VNE, IR, and IL of single qubits, entangled photon pairs in Bell tests, three-qubit systems in quantum teleportation, multiple-qubit systems of GHZ and W states, and two-qubit Werner mixed states, emphasizing their IL dependence on parameters such as polarization bias and qubit count. Data exchange between two observers in Bell tests can recover some of the lost quantum information and eliminate the associated quantum entropy, even years later. The need to recover knowledge explains why no spooky action occurs at a distance. We show that measuring the Bell, GHZ, and marginally entangled Werner states yields the same minimum entropy gain (ln2) and equal minimal information loss (50 percent).

Title: Eigenvalue analysis of three-state quantum walks with general coin matrices
Authors: Jirô Akahori, Chusei Kiumi, Norio Konno, Takuya Watanabe
Abstract: Mathematical analysis of the spectral properties of the time evolution operator in quantum walks is crucial for understanding key dynamical behaviors such as localization and gaining insights into the long-term dynamics of quantum walks. Previous studies have shown that eigenvalue analysis using the transfer matrix method is particularly effective for space-inhomogeneous three-state quantum walks with specific classes of coin matrices, including Grover matrices. In this article, we extend these results by developing a more sophisticated transfer matrix framework applicable to three-state quantum walks with general coin matrices, enabling the analysis of a broader class of time evolution operators. Additionally, we perform numerical analyses to derive exact eigenvalues for models that were previously considered intractable, demonstrating the practical usefulness and applicability of our proposed method.

Title: Decomposing the Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Pablo Martinez-Azcona, Ruth Shir, Aurélia Chenu
Abstract: Correlations between the energies of a system's spectrum are one of the defining features of quantum chaos. They can be probed using the Spectral Form Factor (SFF). We investigate how each spectral distance contributes in building this two-point correlation function. Specifically, starting from the spectral distribution of $k$-th neighbor level spacing ($k$nLS), we provide analytical expressions for the $k$-th neighbor Spectral Form Factor ($k$nSFF). We do so for the three Gaussian Random Matrix ensembles and the `Poissonian' ensemble of uncorrelated energy levels. We study the properties of the $k$nSFF, namely its minimum value and the time at which this minimum is reached, as well as the energy spacing with the deepest $k$nSFF. This allows us to quantify the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the SFF ramp, which is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos. In particular, we show how the onset of the ramp, characterized either by the dip or the Thouless time, shifts to shorter times as contributions from longer-range spectral distance are included. Interestingly, the even and odd neighbors contribute quite distinctively, the first being the most important to built the ramp. They respectively yield a resonance or antiresonance in the ramp. All of our analytical results are tested against numerical realizations of random matrices. We complete our analysis and show how the introduced tools help characterize the spectral properties of a physical many-body system by looking at the interacting XXZ Heisenberg model with local on-site disorder that allows transitioning between the chaotic and integrable regimes.

Title: Unleashed from Constrained Optimization: Quantum Computing for Quantum Chemistry Employing Generator Coordinate Inspired Method
Authors: Muqing Zheng, Bo Peng, Ang Li, Xiu Yang, Karol Kowalski
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical approaches offer potential solutions to quantum chemistry problems, yet they often manifest as constrained optimization problems. Here, we explore the interconnection between constrained optimization and generalized eigenvalue problems through the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) excitation generators. Inspired by the generator coordinate method, we employ these UCC excitation generators to construct non-orthogonal, overcomplete many-body bases, projecting the system Hamiltonian into an effective Hamiltonian, which bypasses issues such as barren plateaus that heuristic numerical minimizers often encountered in standard variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Diverging from conventional quantum subspace expansion methods, we introduce an adaptive scheme that robustly constructs the many-body basis sets from a pool of the UCC excitation generators. This scheme supports the development of a hierarchical ADAPT quantum-classical strategy, enabling a balanced interplay between subspace expansion and ansatz optimization to address complex, strongly correlated quantum chemical systems cost-effectively, setting the stage for more advanced quantum simulations in chemistry.

Title: Unveiling the Importance of Nonshortest Paths in Quantum Networks
Authors: Xinqi Hu, Gaogao Dong, Kim Christensen, Hanlin Sun, Jingfang Fan, Zihao Tian, Jianxi Gao, Shlomo Havlin, Renaud Lambiotte, Xiangyi Meng
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) exhibit stronger connectivity than predicted by classical percolation, yet the origin of this phenomenon remains unexplored. We apply a statistical physics model -- concurrence percolation -- to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ($U,V$) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, $U \leq V$. This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they "superpose" parallel, non-shortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to non-shortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free Internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: when non-shortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.

Title: Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials
Authors: Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.

Abstract: As quantum information technologies advance, challenges in scaling and connectivity persist, particularly the need for long-range qubit connectivity and efficient entanglement generation. Perfect State Transfer enables time-optimal state transfer between distant qubits using only nearest-neighbor couplings, enhancing device connectivity. Moreover, the transfer protocol results in effective parity-dependent non-local interactions, extending its utility to entanglement generation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate Perfect State Transfer and multi-qubit entanglement generation on a chain of six superconducting transmon qubits with tunable couplers, controlled via parametric drives. By simultaneously activating and engineering all couplings, we implement the transfer for up to six qubits, verifying single-excitation dynamics for different initial states. Extending the protocol to multiple excitations, we confirm its parity-dependent nature, where excitation number controls the phase of the transferred state. Finally, leveraging this property, we prepare a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state using a single transfer operation, showcasing the potential of Perfect State Transfer for efficient entanglement generation.

Title: Lowering Connectivity Requirements For Bivariate Bicycle Codes Using Morphing Circuits
Authors: Mackenzie H. Shaw, Barbara M. Terhal
Abstract: In Ref. [1], Bravyi et al. found examples of Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes with similar logical performance to the surface code but with an improved encoding rate. In this work, we generalize a novel parity-check circuit design principle called morphing circuits and apply it to BB codes. We define a new family of BB codes whose parity check circuits require a qubit connectivity of degree five instead of six while maintaining their numerical performance. Logical input/output to an ancillary surface code is also possible in a biplanar layout. Finally, we develop a general framework for designing morphing circuits and present a sufficient condition for its applicability to two-block group algebra codes [1] S. Bravyi, A. W. Cross, J. M.

Title: Quantum Algorithms for Representation-Theoretic Multiplicities
Authors: Martin Larocca, Vojtech Havlicek
Abstract: Kostka, Littlewood-Richardson, Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients are the multiplicities of irreducible representations in the decomposition of representations of the symmetric group that play an important role in representation theory, geometric complexity and algebraic combinatorics. We give quantum algorithms for computing these coefficients whenever the ratio of dimensions of the representations is polynomial and study the computational complexity of this problem. We show that there is an efficient classical algorithm for computing the Kostka numbers under this restriction and conjecture the existence of an analogous algorithm for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We argue why such classical algorithm does not straightforwardly work for the Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients and conjecture that our quantum algorithms lead to superpolynomial speedups for these problems. The conjecture about Kronecker coefficients was disproved by Greta Panova in [arXiv:2502.20253] with a classical solution which, if optimal, points to a $\OC(n^{4+2k})$ vs $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{4k^2+1})$ polynomial gap in quantum vs classical computational complexity for an integer parameter $k$.

Title: Time-resolved Stochastic Dynamics of Quantum Thermal Machines
Authors: Abhaya S. Hegde, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.

Title: Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits
Authors: Menghan Song, Zhaoyi Zeng, Ting-Tung Wang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zi Yang Meng, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.

Title: Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders
Authors: Mainak Pal, Madhumita Sarkar, K. Sengupta, Arnab Sen
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both Néel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder-free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display nonzero long-time averages for Néel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain. Finally, we identify additional exact mid-spectrum zero modes that stay unchanged as a function of $\Delta$ and violate ETH.

Abstract: We propose a novel technique for optimizing a modular fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture, taking into account any desired space-time trade-offs between the number of physical qubits and the fault-tolerant execution time of a quantum algorithm. We consider a concept architecture comprising a dedicated zone as a multi-level magic state factory and a core processor for efficient logical operations, forming a supply chain network for production and consumption of magic states. Using a heuristic algorithm, we solve the multi-objective optimization problem of minimizing space and time subject to a user-defined error budget for the success of the computation, taking the performance of various fault-tolerant protocols into account. As an application, we show that physical quantum resource estimation reduces to a simple model involving a small number of key parameters, namely, the circuit volume, the error prefactors ($\mu$) and error suppression rates ($\Lambda$) of the fault-tolerant protocols, the reaction time ($\gamma$), and an allowed slowdown factor ($\beta$).

Title: Equivalence between the second order steady state for the spin-Boson model and its quantum mean force Gibbs state
Authors: Prem Kumar, K. P. Athulya, Sibasish Ghosh
Abstract: When the coupling of a quantum system to its environment is non-negligible, its steady state is known to deviate from the textbook Gibbs state. The Bloch-Redfield quantum master equation, one of the most widely adopted equations to solve the open quantum dynamics, cannot predict all the deviations of the steady state of a quantum system from the Gibbs state. In this paper, for a generic spin-boson model, we use a higher-order quantum master equation (in system environment coupling strength) to analytically calculate all the deviations of the steady state of the quantum system up to second order in the coupling strength. We also show that this steady state is exactly identical to the corresponding generalized Gibbs state, the so-called quantum mean force Gibbs state, at arbitrary temperature. All these calculations are highly general, making them immediately applicable to a wide class of systems well modeled by the spin-Boson model, ranging from various condensed phase processes to quantum thermodynamics. As an example, we use our results to study the dynamics and the steady state of a double quantum dot system under physically relevant choices of parameters.

Title: Aspects of Quantum Energy Teleportation
Authors: Taisanul Haque
Abstract: In this work, we explore quantum energy teleportation (QET) protocols, focusing on their behavior at finite temperatures , in ground and excited states. We analyze the role of entanglement as a resource for QET, particularly in thermal states, and compare the performance of QET across these initial states. We then introduce a method to extract ground-state energy through a protocol that employs only quantum measurements, local operations, and classical communication (LOCC), without requiring the ground state to be quantum correlated either through entanglement or quantum discord. To illustrate this, we propose a minimal model comprising two interacting qubits. These findings indicate that, in addition to the established QET framework where quantum correlation serves as a resource, it is possible to extract energy from an product ground state. This broadens the scope of QET's applicability across diverse quantum systems.

Title: Performance of a Superconducting Quantum Battery
Authors: Samira Elghaayda, Asad Ali, Saif Al-Kuwari, Artur Czerwinski, Mostafa Mansour, Saeed Haddadi
Abstract: Finding a quantum battery model that demonstrates a quantum advantage while remaining feasible for experimental production is a considerable challenge. Here, a superconducting quantum battery (SQB) model that exhibits such an advantage is introduced. The model consists of two coupled superconducting qubits that interact during the unitary charging process while remaining in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. First, the model is described, evidence of the quantum advantage is provided, and then the fabrication process of the battery is discussed using superconducting qubits. Analytical expressions for the ergotropy, instantaneous power, and capacity of the SQB, as well as their connection to quantum coherence are derived. It is demonstrated that leveraging the collective effects of Josephson energies and the coupling energy between qubits allows for optimization, resulting in improved energy redistribution and a significant enhancement in charging efficiency. This work highlights the complexities of tuning system parameters, which increase the potential for work extraction from the SQB, providing a deeper understanding of the charging mechanisms involved. These findings can be applied to superconducting quantum circuit battery architectures, underscoring the feasibility of efficient energy storage in these systems. These results pave the way for proposals of new superconducting devices, emphasizing their potential for efficient energy storage.

Title: Loss tangent fluctuations due to two-level systems in superconducting microwave resonators
Authors: André Vallières, Megan E. Russell, Xinyuan You, David A. Garcia-Wetten, Dominic P. Goronzy, Mitchell J. Walker, Michael J. Bedzyk, Mark C. Hersam, Alexander Romanenko, Yao Lu, Anna Grassellino, Jens Koch, Corey Rae H. McRa
Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators are critical to quantum computing and sensing technologies. Additionally, they are common proxies for superconducting qubits when determining the effects of performance-limiting loss mechanisms such as from two-level systems (TLS). The extraction of these loss mechanisms is often performed by measuring the internal quality factor $Q_i$ as a function of power or temperature. In this work, we investigate large temporal fluctuations of $Q_i$ at low powers over periods of 12 to 16 hours (relative standard deviation $\sigma_{Q_i}/Q_i = 13\%$). These fluctuations are ubiquitous across multiple resonators, chips and cooldowns. We are able to attribute these fluctuations to variations in the TLS loss tangent due to two main indicators. First, measured fluctuations decrease as power and temperature increase. Second, for interleaved measurements, we observe correlations between low- and medium-power $Q_i$ fluctuations and an absence of correlations with high-power fluctuations. Agreement with the TLS loss tangent mean is obtained by performing measurements over a time span of a few hours. We hypothesize that, in addition to decoherence due to coupling to individual near-resonant TLS, superconducting qubits are affected by these observed TLS loss tangent fluctuations.

Title: Quantum beating and cyclic structures in the phase-space dynamics of the Kramers-Henneberger atom
Authors: A. Tasnim Aynul, L. Cruz Rodriguez, C. Figueira de Morisson Faria
Abstract: We investigate the phase-space dynamics of the Kramers Henneberger (KH) atom solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for reduced-dimensionality models and using Wigner quasiprobability distributions. We find that, for the time-averaged KH potential, coherent superpositions of eigenstates perform a cyclic motion confined in momentum space, whose frequency is proportional to the energy difference between the two KH eigenstates. This cyclic motion is also present if the full time dependent dynamics are taken into consideration. However, there are time delays regarding the time-averaged potential, and some tail-shaped spilling of the quasiprobability flow towards higher momentum regions. These tails are signatures of ionization, indicating that, for the potential studied in this work, a small momentum spread is associated with stabilization. A comparison of the quasiprobability flow with classical phase-space constraints shows that, for the KH atom, the momentum must be bounded from above. This is a major difference from a molecule, for which the quasiprobability flow is confined in position space for small internuclear separation. Furthermore, we assess the stability of different propagation strategies and find that the most stable scenario for the full dynamics is obtained if the system is initially prepared in the KH ground state.

Title: Fast mixed-species quantum logic gates for trapped-ion quantum networks
Authors: Zain Mehdi, Varun D. Vaidya, Isabelle Savill-Brown, Phoebe Grosser, Alexander K. Ratcliffe, Haonan Liu, Simon A. Haine, Joseph J. Hope, C. Ricardo Viteri
Abstract: Quantum logic operations between physically distinct qubits is an essential aspect of large-scale quantum information processing. We propose an approach to high-speed mixed-species entangling operations in trapped-ion quantum computers, based on mechanical excitation of spin-dependent ion motion by ultrafast pulsed lasers. We develop the theory and machine-design of pulse sequences that realise MHz-speed `fast gates' between a range of mixed-isotope and mixed-species ion pairings with experimentally-realistic laser controls. We demonstrate the robustness of the gate mechanism against expected experimental errors, and identify errors in ultrafast single-qubit control as the primary technical limitation. The proposed mixed-species gate mechanism can be used for fast transfer of quantum information between specialized qubits and quantum memories, which we show enables the protection of matter-photon interfaces against rapid spin dephasing in optical networks of trapped-ion processors.

Title: Doubly-polylog-time-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation by a polylog-time parallel minimum-weight perfect matching decoder
Authors: Yugo Takada, Hayata Yamasaki
Abstract: Reducing space and time overheads of fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) has been receiving increasing attention as it is crucial for the development of quantum computers and also plays a fundamental role in understanding the feasibility and limitations of realizing quantum advantages. Shorter time overheads are particularly essential for demonstrating quantum computational speedups without compromising runtime advantages. However, surpassing the conventional polylogarithmic (polylog) scaling of time overheads has remained a significant challenge, since it requires addressing all potential bottlenecks, including the nonzero runtime of classical computation for decoding in practical implementations. In this work, we construct a protocol that achieves FTQC with doubly polylog time overhead while maintaining the conventional polylog space overhead. The key to our approach is the development of a highly parallelizable minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, which achieves a polylog parallel runtime in terms of the code size while providing theoretical guarantees on threshold existence and overhead bounds. Our protocol integrates this decoder with a topological-code protocol that incorporates single-shot decoding for efficient syndrome extraction; furthermore, we concatenate this with the concatenated Steane codes to guarantee the existence of the threshold while avoiding a backlog problem, enabling us to achieve doubly polylog time overheads even when accounting for the decoder's runtime. These results suggest the feasibility of surpassing the conventional polylog-time-overhead barrier, opening a new frontier in low-overhead FTQC.

Title: Fault-Tolerant Optical Quantum Computation using 3D Hybrid Cluster States
Authors: Peilin Du
Abstract: Hybridizing different physical systems or degrees of freedom offers significant advantages for realizing practical, universal, scalable, and fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Here, we propose optical FTQC schemes with low squeezing thresholds by leveraging the strengths of both discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) systems while utilizing frequency, time, and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom. First, we design an optical entanglement generator (OEG) capable of producing various types of entangled pairs, including cluster pairs, hybrid entangled pairs, and GKP Bell pairs, which can be flexibly chosen by adjusting the measurement basis. Additionally, the OEG features extra ports for directly inputting (outputting) data (result) states via quantum teleportation, eliminating the need for optical switches. Secondly, large-scale one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional (3D) hybrid cluster states, composed of DV Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits and CV squeezed states, are deterministically generated using the entangled pairs passed through a time-delay system. Moreover, we optimize the surface-GKP code to further reduce logical errors during the stabilizer measurements in the surface code. By combining the 3D cubic hybrid cluster state with the modified surface-GKP code and accounting for full circuit-level noise, FTQC is achieved with a squeezing threshold of 10 dB. Moreover, our method can also generate a 3D macronode Raussendorf-Harrington-Goyal (RHG) cluster state, facilitating an alternative FTQC scheme via the RHG-GKP code. Our work provides a viable pathway toward future optical FTQC architectures.

Title: Matrix product state fixed points of non-Hermitian transfer matrices
Authors: Wei Tang, Frank Verstraete, Jutho Haegeman
Abstract: The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice. Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the boundary matrix product state calculation.

Title: Scalable Pattern Matching in Computation Graphs
Authors: Luca Mondada (University of Oxford), Pablo Andrés-Martínez (Quantinuum Ltd)
Abstract: Graph rewriting is a popular tool for the optimisation and modification of graph expressions in domains such as compilers, machine learning and quantum computing. The underlying data structures are often port graphs - graphs with labels at edge endpoints. A pre-requisite for graph rewriting is the ability to find graph patterns. We propose a new solution to pattern matching in port graphs. Its novelty lies in the use of a pre-computed data structure that makes the pattern matching runtime complexity independent of the number of patterns. This offers a significant advantage over existing solutions for use cases with large sets of small patterns. Our approach is particularly well-suited for quantum superoptimisation. We provide an implementation and benchmarks showing that our algorithm offers a 20x speedup over current implementations on a dataset of 10000 real world patterns describing quantum circuits.

Title: Electrical control of a Kondo spin screening cloud
Authors: Ngoc Han Tu, Donghoon Kim, Minsoo L. Kim, Jeongmin Shim, Ryo Ito, David Pomaranski, Ivan V. Borzenets, Arne Ludwig, Andreas D. Wieck, Heung-Sun Sim, Michihisa Yamamoto
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of quantum many-body systems, consisting of numerous itinerant electrons that interact with localized spins or electrons, is a long-standing issue. The Kondo cloud, a quantum many-body object of conduction electrons that screens a single localized spin, is the building block of such strongly correlated electronic systems. While quantitative analysis of the Kondo cloud associated with a single magnetic impurity is well established for uniform conduction electrons, the fundamental properties of a deformed Kondo cloud influenced by conduction electrons with a modulated density of states remain unsolved. Here we report engineering of the Kondo cloud deformation by confining a part of the cloud into a quantum box called the Kondo box that mimics realistic material systems. We demonstrate quantitative control of the Kondo cloud by developing a way of tuning quantum interference in the box and monitoring the Kondo entanglement. The temperature dependence of the entanglement reveals counterintuitively that the cloud shape is altered mainly outside the box although the quantum interference in the box is tuned. Our work provides a way to simulate various strongly correlated systems by integrating the Kondo cloud, which is not possible in the current theoretical framework.

Title: The quantum Mpemba effect in free-fermionic mixed states
Authors: Filiberto Ares, Vittorio Vitale, Sara Murciano
Abstract: Recently, a novel probe to study symmetry breaking, known as entanglement asymmetry, has emerged and has been utilized to explore how symmetry is dynamically restored following quantum quenches. Interestingly, it has been shown that, in certain scenarios, greater initial symmetry breaking leads to faster restoration, akin to a quantum Mpemba effect. This study focuses on investigating the effect of mixed initial states and non-unitary dynamics on symmetry restoration. The mixedness of a state can arise from different sources. We consider dephasing or dissipative processes affecting initial pure states or unitary dynamics of initially thermal states. In the former case, the stationary state after the quench is independent of the initial configuration, resembling the phenomenology of the classical Mpemba effect. Investigating the XY spin chain model, through a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we identify the conditions for the occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. It turns out that this phenomenon still occurs in the presence of dissipation or at finite temperature, even though it will be eventually suppressed as the state becomes more mixed.

Title: Application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems
Authors: Projesh Kumar Roy
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity in the form of an exponent into the original theory of Haldane. The dependence of the statistical correlation on indistinguishability is highlighted. Using this modified theory, a quasi-classical derivation of intermediate statistics is shown where indistinguishability can be introduced into distinguishable systems in the form of a statistical correlation. The final result is equivalent to the classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES), which was derived earlier using a purely classical route. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.

Title: Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits
Authors: Friedrich Hübner, Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.

Title: Entanglement Witness for Indistinguishable Electrons using Solid-State Spectroscopy
Authors: Tongtong Liu, Luogen Xu, Jiarui Liu, Yao Wang
Abstract: Characterizing entanglement in quantum materials is crucial for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Despite recent strides in witnessing entanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying entanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a formidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix. We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information.

Title: Feynman 1947 letter on path integral for the Dirac equation
Authors: Ted Jacobson
Abstract: In 1947, four months before the famous Shelter Island conference, Richard Feynman wrote a lengthy letter to his former MIT classmate Theodore Welton, reporting on his efforts to develop a path integral describing the propagation of a Dirac particle. While these efforts never came to fruition, and were shortly abandoned in favor of a very different method of dealing with the electron propagator appearing in in QED, the letter is interesting both from the historical viewpoint of revealing what Feynman was thinking about during that period just before the development of QED, and for its scientific ideas. It also contains at the end some philosophical remarks, which Feynman wraps up with the comment, ``Well enough for the baloney.'' In this article I present a transcription of the letter along with editorial notes, and a facsimile of the original handwritten document. I also briefly comment on Feynman's efforts and discuss their relation to some later work.

Title: Phase transition analogs in laser collisions with a dark-field setup
Authors: Holger Gies, Felix Karbstein, Lars Maiwald
Abstract: Laser pulse collisions are a promising tool for the investigation of light-by-light scattering phenomena induced by quantum vacuum fluctuations. Using the numerical code based on the vacuum emission picture and put forward in Blinne et al. (2019), we observe a strong dependence of the signal features on the transverse profiles of the colliding laser pulses in the interaction region. For a probe beam tailored such as to feature an annular far-field profile and a pronounced on-axis focus peak counterpropagating a pump beam at zero impact parameter, the signal's main emission direction can undergo the analog of a phase transition with the beam-waist ratio of the pulses serving as a control parameter. Depending on the pump's beam profile, this phase transition can be first order (e.g., for a pump with a flat-top far-field profile) or second order (e.g., for a Gaussian pump). From the simulation data, we determine the critical point and extract the corresponding critical exponent for the second-order transition of the main emission direction of the signal in the far field. For this, we improve the performance of the above numerical code, using the phase transition analogs as an example to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of the code and current workflows.

Title: Capturing strong correlation effects on a quantum annealer: calculation of avoided crossing in the H$_4$ molecule using the quantum annealer eigensolver
Authors: Aashna Anil Zade, Kenji Sugisaki, Matthias Werner, Ana Palacios, Artur Garcia-Saez, Arnau Riera, V. S. Prasannaa
Abstract: We broaden the scope of the Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm, an underexplored noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era approach for calculating atomic and molecular properties, to predict avoided crossings, where strong correlation effects are at play. For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.2% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).

Abstract: We describe how the annihilation of antiprotons can be utilized to generate highly charged synthetic qubits in an ion-trap setup. We identify the qubit transitions in the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen-like atoms composed of an isomer and a single electron in the ground state. We identify promising candidates in the isomers of Y, Nb, Rh, In, and Sb, for which the hyperfine transition lies in the infrared and whose excited state level lifetime is in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is suitable for metrology applications.

Title: Theory of Two-level Tunneling Systems in Superconductors
Authors: Junguang He, Wei-Ting Lin, J. A. Sauls
Abstract: We develop a field theory formulation for the interaction of an ensemble of two-level tunneling systems (TLS) with the electronic states of a superconductor. Predictions for the impact of two-level tunneling systems on superconductivity are presented, including $T_c$ and spectrum of quasiparticle states for conventional BCS superconductors. We show that non-magnetic TLS impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors can act as pair-breaking or pair-enhancing defects depending on the level population of the distribution of TLS impurities. We present calculations of the enhancement of superconductivity, both $T_c$ and the order parameter, for TLS defects in thermal equilibrium with the electrons and lattice. The scattering of quasiparticles by TLS impurities leads to sub-gap states below the bulk excitation gap, $\Delta$, as well as resonances in the continuum above $\Delta$. The energies and spectral weights of these states depend on the distribution of tunnel splittings, while the spectral weights are particularly sensitive to the level occupation of the TLS impurities. Under microwave excitation, or decoupling from the thermal bath, a nonequilibrium level population of the TLS distribution generates subgap quasiparticle states near the Fermi level which contribute to dissipation and thus degrade the performance of superconducting devices at low temperatures.

Title: Moiré Superradiance in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Quantum Atom Gas
Authors: Lu Zhou, Zheng-Chun Li, Keye Zhang, Zhihao Lan, Alessio Celi, Weiping Zhang
Abstract: As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moiré lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moiré lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moiré effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moiré effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moiré metrology.
