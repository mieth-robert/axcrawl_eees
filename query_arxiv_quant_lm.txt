Title: Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention for Quantum Transformer Models
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, En-Jui Kuo
Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized sequential learning across various domains, yet their self-attention mechanism incurs quadratic computational cost, posing limitations for real-time and resource-constrained tasks. To address this, we propose Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), a novel hybrid architecture that enhances classical Transformer models with a quantum attention mechanism. QASA replaces dot-product attention with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) that adaptively captures inter-token relationships in the quantum Hilbert space. Additionally, a residual quantum projection module is introduced before the feedforward network to further refine temporal features. Our design retains classical efficiency in earlier layers while injecting quantum expressiveness in the final encoder block, ensuring compatibility with current NISQ hardware. Experiments on synthetic time-series tasks demonstrate that QASA achieves faster convergence and superior generalization compared to both standard Transformers and reduced classical variants. Preliminary complexity analysis suggests potential quantum advantages in gradient computation, opening new avenues for efficient quantum deep learning models.

Title: Non-Markovian N-spin chain quantum battery in thermal charging process
Authors: Shun-Cai Zhao, Zi-Ran Zhao, Ni-Ya Zhuang
Abstract: Ergotropy serves as a key indicator for assessing the performance of quantum batteries(QBs). Using the Redfield master equation, we investigate ergotropy dynamics in a non-Markovian QB composed of an N-spin chain embedded in a microcavity. Distinct from Markovian charging process, the thermal charging process exhibits a distinct oscillatory behavior in the extracted ergotropy. We show these oscillations are suppressible via synergistic control of coherent driving, cavity parameters, and spin-spin couplings. In addition, we analyze the influence of various system and environmental parameters on the time evolution of ergotropy, revealing rich dynamical features. Our results offer new insights into the control of energy extraction in QBs and may inform future designs of practical battery architectures.

Title: Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation
Authors: Kazuki Ikeda
Abstract: We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET), designed for transporting quantum energy across space-time. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When both supplier and recipient operate within the same time frame, this is called Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET). A proof-of-concept was performed for the Ising model, utilizing quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3% to around 40%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across space-time.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for One-Dimensional Quantum Well Problems
Authors: Soumyadip Sarkar
Abstract: We implement physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for three canonical one-dimensional quantum potentials: an infinite square well, a finite square well, and a finite barrier. The PINN models incorporate trial wavefunctions that exactly satisfy boundary conditions (Dirichlet zeros at domain boundaries), and they optimize a loss functional combining the PDE residual with a normalization constraint. For the infinite well, the ground-state energy is known (E = pi^2 in dimensionless units) and held fixed in training, whereas for the finite well and barrier, the eigenenergy is treated as a trainable parameter. We use fully-connected neural networks with smooth activation functions to represent the wavefunction and demonstrate that PINNs can learn the ground-state eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for these quantum systems. The results show that the PINN-predicted wavefunctions closely match analytical solutions or expected behaviors, and the learned eigenenergies converge to known values. We present training logs and convergence of the energy parameter, as well as figures comparing the PINN solutions to exact results. The discussion addresses the performance of PINNs relative to traditional numerical methods, highlighting challenges such as convergence to the correct eigenvalue, sensitivity to initialization, and the difficulty of modeling discontinuous potentials. We also discuss the importance of the normalization term to resolve the scaling ambiguity of the wavefunction. Finally, we conclude that PINNs are a viable approach for quantum eigenvalue problems, and we outline future directions including extensions to higher-dimensional and time-dependent Schrödinger equations.

Title: Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing
Authors: Ewan McCulloch, J. Alexander Jacoby, Curt von Keyserlingk, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.

Title: Topologically correlated bound states via a dynamical gauge field
Authors: Zhoutao Lei, Linhu Li
Abstract: Recent advances in topological phases have opened new frontiers in materials science and quantum physics. However, their emergence in strongly correlated systems are less understood due to the complex interplay between particle interactions and band topology. In this work, we consider a cold-atom-based spin-dependent Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with a non-Hermitian dynamical gauge field (DGF), where two kinds of topologically correlated bound states are found to emerge from the DGF. Specifically, edge bound states with co-localization of both spin species arise from the interplay between DGF and nontrivial single-particle topology, and bulk bound states with extended distribution in the lattice emerges from nontrivial topology of inter-species band inversion. These bound states can coexist in same parameter regimes and compete with each other, leading to distinguished dynamical signatures. This work bridges the gap between conventional band topology and strongly correlated physics, establishing a new paradigm for discovering emergent topological phenomena in quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Circuits for High-Dimensional Absolutely Maximally Entangled States
Authors: Berta Casas, Grzegorz Rajchel-Mieldzioć, Suhail Ahmad Rather, Marcin Płodzień, Wojciech Bruzda, Alba Cervera-Lierta, Karol Życzkowski
Abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states of multipartite quantum systems exhibit maximal entanglement across all possible bipartitions. These states lead to teleportation protocols that surpass standard teleportation schemes, determine quantum error correction codes and can be used to test performance of current term quantum processors. Several AME states can be constructed from graph states using minimal quantum resources. However, there exist other constructions that depart from the stabilizer formalism. In this work, we present explicit quantum circuits to generate exemplary non-stabilizer AME states of four subsystems with four, six, and eight levels each and analyze their capabilities to perform quantum information tasks.

Title: Exponential Quantum Speedup for Simulating Classical Lattice Dynamics
Authors: Xiantao Li
Abstract: Simulating large scale lattice dynamics directly is computationally demanding due to the high complexity involved, yet such simulations are crucial for understanding the mechanical and thermal properties of many physical systems. In this work, we introduce a rigorous quantum framework for simulating general harmonic lattice dynamics by reformulating the classical equations as a time dependent Schrödinger equation governed by a sparse Hamiltonian. This transformation allows us to exploit well established quantum Hamiltonian simulation techniques, offering an exponential speedup with respect to the number of atoms $N$. The overall complexity has a logarithmic dependence on $N$, and linear dependence on both the simulation time $T$ and the Debye frequency $\omega_D$. Key to our approach is the application of the matrix valued Fejér Riesz theorem to the phonon dynamical matrix, which facilitates the efficient construction of the underlying Hamiltonian with translational invariance. We demonstrate the applicability of the method across a broad class of lattice models.

Title: Ultrafast all-optical modulation of spatially structured photons
Authors: Alicia Sit, Frédéric Bouchard, Nicolas Couture, Duncan England, Guillaume Thekkadath, Philip J. Bustard, Benjamin Sussman
Abstract: Manipulating the structure of single photons in the ultrafast domain is enabling new quantum information processing technologies. At the picosecond timescale, quantum information can be processed before decoherence can occur. In this work, we study the capabilities of few-mode cross-phase modulation via the optical Kerr effect, using ultrafast pulses. We observe a significant modulation in the spatial mode of structured photons on timescales $\leq 1.3$~ps.

Authors: Vasil Yordanov
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical derivation of the Lamb shift in the hydrogen atom, based solely on fundamental constants and the stochastic (Brownian) motion of the proton. Unlike conventional quantum electrodynamics (QED), the proposed approach introduces no experimentally fitted parameters, offering a fully self-consistent explanation grounded entirely in known physical quantities.

Title: Hybrid Schrödinger-Liouville and projective dynamics
Authors: Kaja Krhac, Frederic P. Schuller, Stefano Stramigioli
Abstract: Quantum dynamics provides the arguably most fundamental example of hybrid dynamics: As long as no measurement takes place, the system state is governed by the Schrödinger-Liouville differential equation, which is however interrupted and replaced by projective dynamics at times when measurements take place. We show how this alternatingly continuous and projective evolution can be cast in form of one single differential equation for a refined state space manifold and thus be made amenable to standard port-theoretic analysis and control techniques.

Title: Group Order is in QCMA
Authors: François Le Gall, Harumichi Nishimura, Dhara Thakkar
Abstract: In this work, we show that verifying the order of a finite group given as a black-box is in the complexity class QCMA. This solves an open problem asked by Watrous in 2000 in his seminal paper on quantum proofs and directly implies that the Group Non-Membership problem is also in the class QCMA, which further proves a conjecture proposed by Aaronson and Kuperberg in 2006. Our techniques also give improved quantum upper bounds on the complexity of many other group-theoretical problems, such as group isomorphism in black-box groups.

Title: Scalable MHz-Rate Entanglement Distribution in Low-Latency Quantum Networks Interconnecting Heterogeneous Quantum Processors
Authors: Jiapeng Zhao, Yang Xu, Xiyuan Lu, Eneet Kaur, Michael Kilzer, Ramana Kompella, Robert W. Boyd, Reza Nejabati
Abstract: Practical distributed quantum computing and error correction require high-qubit-rate, high-fidelity, and low-reconfiguration-latency quantum networks between heterogeneous quantum information processors. Unfortunately, in a quantum network with homogeneous quantum processors, the theoretical entanglement distribution rate for a single channel is limited to the 100-kHz level with a millisecond-level reconfiguration latency, which is not sufficient for error-corrected distributed quantum computing. Here, we propose a quantum network architecture by introducing the concept of a reconfigurable quantum interface. In our protocol, through tuning the frequency and temporal mode of the photonic qubits to dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) channels, a 4.5 MHz Bell pair distribution rate, with a potential of more than 40 MHz Bell pair rate, is achieved. Through the use of reconfigurable quantum interfaces and wavelength-selective switches, a nanosecond network reconfiguration latency can be demonstrated with low-loss, low-infidelity and high-dimensional switches. To the best of our knowledge, our architecture is the first practical solution that can accommodate the entanglement distribution between heterogeneous quantum nodes with a rate and latency that satisfy most distributed quantum circuits and error correction requirements. The proposed architecture is compatible with the industry-standard DWDM infrastructure, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for distributed quantum computing.

Title: Selective Filtering of Photonic Quantum Entanglement via Anti-Parity-Time Symmetry
Authors: Mahmoud A. Selim, Max Ehrhardt, Yuqiang Ding, Hediyeh M. Dinani, Qi Zhong, Armando Perez Leija, Sahin K. Ozdemir, Matthias Heinrich, Alexander Szameit, Demetrios N. Christodoulides, Mercedeh Khajavikhan
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource for quantum computing, sensing, and communication, however it is highly susceptible to decoherence. To address this, quantum optics has explored filtering techniques like photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade to restore entangled states. Here, we introduce a an entirely new approach to entanglement retrieval exploiting non-Hermitian systems. By employing an anti-parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we demonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This filter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network using Lanczos transformations, consistent with Wigner-Weisskopf theory. This scheme achieves near-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to higher photon levels while remaining robust against decoherence during propagation. Our work offers new insights into using non-Hermitian symmetries to address central challenges in quantum technologies.

Title: Assessing Teleportation of Logical Qubits in a Distributed Quantum Architecture under Error Correction
Authors: John Stack, Ming Wang, Frank Mueller
Abstract: Quantum computing is facing challenges in terms of scaling to thousands of qubits and implementing quantum error correction (QEC). Scaling efforts focus on connecting multiple smaller quantum devices in a distributed manner while error correction, as a means to overcome noisy physical qubits, is being addressed by developing denser codes with protocols for logical qubits and logical quantum gates. Teleportation of quantum states becomes an important operation as it transfers states from one node to another node within a distributed device. For physical qubits, today's high quantum network noise rates prevent the teleportation of states with useful accuracy. By employing QEC, we show that logical qubits can be teleported between nodes under Surface Code and qLDPC encodings with very low logical error rates, even with network noise in near-term regimes. We use circuit-level simulations to assess physical and network noise regimes ranging from $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}$. This is a wider range than typically studied in circuit level simulations and understanding the behavior of QEC codes in these regimes is necessary for achieving accurate computation.

Title: Effect of Self-Interaction on Feynman's Interpretation of the Lamb Shift
Authors: Peter W. Milonni, Paul R. Berman, Kanu Sinha
Abstract: We derive Bethe's formula for the Lamb shift by extending Feynman's suggestion that the shift could be interpreted as the change, due to the presence of the atom, in electromagnetic field energy. This approach is based on measurable quantities such as a refractive index but has a contribution from virtual photon absorption which is effectively eliminated by a high-energy cutoff in the nonrelativistic theory. We show that this unphysical contribution is cancelled when a self-interaction energy is included in Feynman's argument.

Title: Binary Tree Block Encoding of Classical Matrix
Authors: Zexian Li, Xiao-Ming Zhang, Chunlin Yang, Guofeng Zhang
Abstract: Block-encoding is a critical subroutine in quantum computing, enabling the transformation of classical data into a matrix representation within a quantum circuit. The resource trade-offs in simulating a block-encoding can be quantified by the circuit size, the normalization factor, and the time and space complexity of parameter computation. Previous studies have primarily focused either on the time and memory complexity of computing the parameters, or on the circuit size and normalization factor in isolation, often neglecting the balance between these trade-offs. In early fault-tolerant quantum computers, the number of qubits is limited. For a classical matrix of size $2^{n}\times 2^{n}$, our approach not only improves the time of decoupling unitary for block-encoding with time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n2^{2n})$ and memory complexity $\Theta(2^{2n})$ using only a few ancilla qubits, but also demonstrates superior resource trade-offs. Our proposed block-encoding protocol is named Binary Tree Block-encoding (\texttt{BITBLE}). Under the benchmark, \textit{size metric}, defined by the product of the number of gates and the normalization factor, numerical experiments demonstrate the improvement of both resource trade-off and classical computing time efficiency of the \texttt{BITBLE} protocol. The algorithms are all open-source.

Title: Entangling quantum memories over 420 km in fiber
Authors: Xi-Yu Luo, Chao-Yang Wang, Ming-Yang Zheng, Bin Wang, Jian-Long Liu, Bo-Feng Gao, Jun Li, Zi Yan, Qiao-Mu Ke, Da Teng, Rui-Chun Wang, Jun Wu, Jia Huang, Hao Li, Li-Xing You, Xiu-Ping Xie, Feihu Xu, Qiang Zhang, Xiao-Hui Bao, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: Long-distance entanglement is pivotal for quantum communication, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Significant progresses have been made in extending the distribution distance of entangled photons, either in free space or fiber. For future quantum network applications, matter-based entanglement is more favorable since the capability of storage is essential for advanced applications. Extending entanglement distance for memory qubits was partially hindered by the mismatch of its photonic emission wavelength with the low-loss transmission window of optical fiber. By incorporating quantum frequency conversion, memory-memory entanglement has been successfully extended to several tens of kilometers. Here, we make a significant step further by reporting the entanglement between two atomic ensemble quantum memories over 420 km. We convert photons emitted from the memories to telecom S-band, which enable us to exploit the significantly low transmission loss in fiber (0.17 dB/km). We employ the DLCZ scheme for remote entanglement generation, and delicately stabilize the relative phase between the two memories by using fulltime far-off-resonant locking to reduce high-frequency noise and intermittent dual-band locking to compensate low-frequency drift jointly. We demonstrate that the memory-memory entangling probability beats the repeaterless channel capacity for direct entanglement distribution. Our experiment provides a testbed of studying quantum network applications from metropolitan scale to intercity scale.

Title: Cryptomania v.s. Minicrypt in a Quantum World
Authors: Longcheng Li, Qian Li, Xingjian Li, Qipeng Liu
Abstract: We prove that it is impossible to construct perfect-complete quantum public-key encryption (QPKE) with classical keys from quantumly secure one-way functions (OWFs) in a black-box manner, resolving a long-standing open question in quantum cryptography. Specifically, in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), no perfect-complete QPKE scheme with classical keys, and classical/quantum ciphertext can be secure. This improves the previous works which require either unproven conjectures or imposed restrictions on key generation algorithms. This impossibility even extends to QPKE with quantum public key if the public key can be uniquely determined by the secret key, and thus is tight to all existing QPKE constructions.

Title: Complete and robust population transfer between the two ground states of a three-state loop quantum system by amplitude composite pulse control
Authors: Peter Chernev, Andon A. Rangelov
Abstract: This work presents a method for achieving complete, robust, and efficient population transfer between the two ground states in a three-level loop quantum system. The approach utilizes composite pulse sequences by effectively mapping the three-state system onto an equivalent two-level system. This transformation allows the use of broadband composite pulses designed initially for conventional two-state quantum systems. Unlike traditional implementations, the composite pulses in the three-level system are not controlled through phase adjustments; instead, they are realized via the amplitude ratio of the Rabi frequencies.

Title: Relativistic limits on the discretization and temporal resolution of a quantum clock
Authors: Tommaso Favalli
Abstract: We provide a brief discussion regarding relativistic limits on the discretization and temporal resolution of time values in a quantum clock. Our clock is characterized by a time observable chosen to be the complement of a bounded and discrete Hamiltonian which can have an equally-spaced or a generic spectrum. In the first case the time observable can be described by an Hermitian operator and we find a limit in the discretization for the time eigenvalues. Nevertheless, in both cases, the time observable can be described by a POVM and, by increasing the number of time states, we can arbitrarily reduce the bound on the minimum time quantum, demonstrating that we can safely take the time values as continuous when the number of time states tends to infinity. Finally, we find a limit for temporal resolution of our time observable when the clock is used (together with light signals) in a relativistic framework for measuring spacetime distances.

Title: Functional matrix product state simulation of continuous variable quantum circuits
Authors: Andreas Bock Michelsen, Frederik K. Marqversen, Michael Kastoryano
Abstract: We introduce a functional matrix product state (FMPS) based method for simulating the real-space representation of continuous-variable (CV) quantum computation. This approach efficiently simulates non-Gaussian CV systems by leveraging their functional form. By addressing scaling bottlenecks, FMPS enables more efficient simulation of shallow, multi-mode CV quantum circuits with non-Gaussian input states. The method is validated by simulating random shallow and cascaded circuits with highly non-Gaussian input states, showing superior performance compared to existing techniques, also in the presence of loss.

Title: Threshold-less and Flexibly Tunable Frequency Comb via Floquet Engineering
Authors: Sihan Wang, Cheng Wang, Matthijs H. J. de Jong, Laure Mercier de Lépinay, Jingwei Zhou, Mika A. Sillanpää, Yulong Liu
Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized communication, metrology and spectroscopy. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated combs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency comb-that does not rely on intrinsic non-linearity. By periodically modulating the resonance frequency of a cavity, a giant-mode cavity with multiple equally spaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the pre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach offers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner, obviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation thresholds. We implement this on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr optomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal far from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection is reduced by approximately a factor of ($10^6$), providing a promising platform for frequency comb generation.

Title: Spatially Resolved Optical Responses of a High-Kinetic-Inductance Microwave Resonator
Authors: R. Hirotsuru, H. Kurokawa, K. Takaki, H. Terai, H. Kosaka
Abstract: Understanding the optical response of a high-kinetic-inductance microwave resonator is crucial for applications ranging from single-photon detection to quantum transduction between microwave and optical domains, which is gaining significant attention for scaling up quantum computers. However, interactions between the pump light and the superconducting resonator often induce unintended resonance frequency shifts and linewidth broadening. In this study, we measure the local optical response of a NbTiN nanowire resonator using a laser-scanning microwave spectroscopy system integrated with a dilution refrigerator. The optical response of the resonator shows correlation with the resonance modes and position, which is attributed to the two-level system around the resonator. These findings not only contribute to the design and understanding of quantum transducers and single-photon detectors, but also to the understandings of catastrophic high-energy particle irradiation events that generate unintended phonons in quantum devices.

Title: Multilevel Quantum Rabi Models
Authors: Tabitha Doicin, Andrew D. Armour, Tommaso Tufarelli
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model, which describes the interaction between a simplified atom and a mode of the electromagnetic field, is a cornerstone of modern quantum optics. One of the key assumptions of the model is that the `atom' is a perfect two-level system. We explore what happens when one generalizes the atom to a multilevel system, with $m$ ground and $n$ excited states coupled to the same field. We focus on the case where the excited and ground states form distinct, well-separated, manifolds of near-degenerate levels (so that the spacing between the excited states on a given manifold is much less than the average spacing between the manifolds) and consider either uniform or random couplings between the individual ground and excited levels. We find that the system reduces approximately to a direct sum of Rabi models with a range of different couplings. Importantly, the strongest coupling is enhanced in a way that depends on the number of levels, for the simple case where $n=m$, the coupling scales with $n$ for uniform couplings and $2\sqrt{n}$ for random couplings (in the limit of large $n$). Our work thus suggests that multilevel Rabi systems could provide an attractive alternative route to accessing regimes of very strong coupling in light-matter systems.

Title: Note on the Universality of Parameterized IQP Circuits with Hidden Units for Generating Probability Distributions
Authors: Andrii Kurkin, Kevin Shen, Susanne Pielawa, Hao Wang, Vedran Dunjko
Abstract: In a series of recent works, an interesting quantum generative model based on parameterized instantaneous polynomial quantum (IQP) circuits has emerged as they can be trained efficiently classically using any loss function that depends only on the expectation values of observables of the model. The model is proven not to be universal for generating arbitrary distributions, but it is suspected that marginals can be - much like Boltzmann machines achieve universality by utilizing hidden (traced-out in quantum jargon) layers. In this short note, we provide two simple proofs of this fact. The first is near-trivial and asymptotic, and the second shows universality can be achieved with a reasonable number of additional qubits.

Title: Can gravity mediate the transmission of quantum information?
Authors: Andrea Mari, Stefano Zippilli, David Vitali
Abstract: We propose an experiment to test the non-classicality of the gravitational interaction. We consider two optomechanical systems that are perfectly isolated, except for a weak gravitational coupling. If a suitable resonance condition is satisfied, an optical signal can be transmitted from one system to the other over a narrow frequency band, a phenomenon that we call gravitationally induced transparency. In this framework, the challenging problem of testing the quantum nature of gravity is mapped to the easier task of determining the non-classicality of the gravitationally-induced optical channel: If the optical channel is not entanglement-breaking, then gravity must have a quantum nature. This approach is applicable without making any assumption on the, currently unknown, correct model of gravity in the quantum regime. In the second part of this work, we model gravity as a quadratic Hamiltonian interaction (e.g. a weak Newtonian force), resulting in a Gaussian thermal attenuator channel between the two systems. Depending on the strength of thermal noise, the system presents a sharp transition from an entanglement-breaking to a non-classical channel capable not only of entanglement preservation but also of asymptotically perfect quantum communication.

Title: Mitigating decoherence in molecular spin qudits
Authors: Leonardo Ratini, Giacomo Sansone, Elena Garlatti, Francesco Petiziol, Stefano Carretta, Paolo Santini
Abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are quantum spin systems potentially serving as qudits for future quantum technologies thanks to their many accessible low-energy states. At low temperatures, the primary source of error in these systems is pure dephasing, caused by their interactions with the bath of surrounding nuclear spins degrees of freedom. Most importantly, as the system's dimensionality grows going from qubits to qudits, the control and mitigation of decoherence becomes more challenging. Here we analyze the characteristics of pure dephasing in molecular qudits under spin-echo sequences. We use a realistic description of their interaction with the bath, whose non-Markovian dynamics is accurately computed by the cluster correlation expansion technique. First, we demonstrate a necessary and sufficient condition to prevent the decay of coherence with time, also introducing a parameter to quantify the deviation from such ideal condition. We illustrate this with two paradigmatic systems: a single giant spin and a composite antiferromagnetic spin system. We then advance a proposal for optimized nanomagnets, identifying key ingredients for engineering robust qudits for quantum technologies.

Title: New designs of linear optical interferometers with minimal depth and component count
Authors: Timothée Goubault de Brugière, Rawad Mezher, Sebastian Currie, Shane Mansfield
Abstract: We adapt an algorithm for CNOT circuits synthesis based on the Bruhat decomposition to the design of linear optical circuits with Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI). The synthesis algorithm reduces to designing sorting networks with nearest neighbor swapping operations as elementary gates. We recover previous designs from the literature but with additional theoretical properties regarding the compiler that implements unitaries on the interferometer. Notably the compiler can always decide whether a unitary can be implemented on a given interferometer and, if so, returns the shallowest possible implementation. We also show natural extensions of our framework for boson sampling experiments and for the coupling of multiple integrated interferometers to design larger linear optical systems. In both cases, the designs are optimal in terms of number of optical components. Finally, we propose a greedy design which exploits the arbritrary-but-fixed coupling of separate integrated interferometers to perform shallow boson sampling. We discuss the optimal interferometer dimensions to maximize the transmission. Beyond boson sampling, our developed framework allows a resource-favourable implemention of any non-adaptive linear optical quantum algorithm, by providing the shallowest possible interferometer for implementing this algorithm.

Title: Fundamental Limits on Clock Precision from Spacetime Uncertainty in Quantum Collapse Models
Authors: Nicola Bortolotti, Catalina Curceanu, Lajos Diósi, Simone Manti, Kristian Piscicchia
Abstract: Models of spontaneous wavefunction collapse explain the quantum-to-classical transition without invoking the von Neumann measurement postulate. Prominent frameworks, such as the Diósi-Penrose (DP) and Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) models, propose a continuous, spontaneous measurement of the mass density field of quantized matter. We show that this mechanism could link both models - not just DP - to fundamental uncertainties in Newtonian gravity. Despite their non-relativistic nature, these models suggest an induced uncertainty in the flow of time due to fluctuations in the Newtonian potential. We calculate the ultimate limit on time uncertainty and demonstrate that the resulting clock-time uncertainty remains negligible for all contemporary time-keeping devices, including atomic clocks.

Title: Equating quantum imaginary time evolution, Riemannian gradient flows, and stochastic implementations
Authors: Nathan A. McMahon, Mahum Pervez, Christian Arenz
Abstract: We identify quantum imaginary time evolution as a Riemannian gradient flow on the unitary group. We develop an upper bound for the error between the two evolutions that can be controlled through the step size of the Riemannian gradient descent which minimizes the energy of the system. We discuss implementations through adaptive quantum algorithms and present a stochastic Riemannian gradient descent algorithm in which each step is efficiently implementable on a quantum computer. We prove that for a sufficiently small step size, the stochastic evolution concentrates around the imaginary time evolution, thereby providing performance guarantees for cooling the system through stochastic Riemannian gradient descent.

Abstract: The study of non-local boxes arose from the study of quantum entanglement and from the question: "why isn't entanglement more non-local?". Correlations stronger than quantum entanglement, but that still do not allow for instantaneous transmission of information have been known to exist. This report from 2011 reviews what was known about these objects at the time.

Title: Symmetry breaking in chaotic many-body quantum systems at finite temperature
Authors: Angelo Russotto, Filiberto Ares, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the entanglement of finite-temperature eigenstates in chaotic quantum many-body local Hamiltonians can be accurately described by an ensemble of random states with an internal $U(1)$ symmetry. We build upon this result to investigate the universal symmetry-breaking properties of such eigenstates. As a probe of symmetry breaking, we employ the entanglement asymmetry, a quantum information observable that quantifies the extent to which symmetry is broken in a subsystem. This measure enables us to explore the finer structure of finite-temperature eigenstates in terms of the $U(1)$-symmetric random state ensemble; in particular, the relation between the Hamiltonian and the effective conserved charge in the ensemble. Our analysis is supported by analytical calculations for the symmetric random states, as well as exact numerical results for the Mixed-Field Ising spin-$1/2$ chain, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaoticity.

Title: Basic distillation with realistic noise
Authors: Vikesh Siddhu, Erick Winston, David C. McKay, Ali Javadi-Abhari
Abstract: Entanglement distillation is a key component of modular quantum computing and long-range quantum communications. However, this powerful tool to reduce noise in entangled states is difficult to realize in practice for two main reasons. First, operations used to carry out distillation inject noise they seek to remove. Second, the extent to which distillation can work under realistic device noise is less well-studied. In this work, we both simulate distillation using a variety of device noise models and perform distillation experiments on fixed-frequency IBM devices. We find reasonable agreement between experimental data and simulation done using Pauli and non-Pauli noise models. In our data we find broad improvement when the metric of success for distillation is to improve average Bell fidelity under effective global depolarizing noise, or remove coherent errors, or improve the Bell fidelity of mildly degraded Bell pairs. We pave the way to obtain broad improvement from distillation under a stricter, but practically relevant, metric: distill non-local Bell pairs with higher fidelity than possible to obtain with other available methods. Our results also help understand metrics and requirements for quantum devices to use entanglement distillation as a primitive for modular computing.

Title: Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. III. The bird and batching algorithms and other parallel implementations on GPUs
Authors: Fouad Afiouni, Remy El Sabeh, Naomi Nishimura, Izzat El Hajj, Amer E. Mouawad, Alexandre Cooper
Abstract: We present efficient implementations of atom reconfiguration algorithms for both CPUs and GPUs, along with a batching routine to merge displacement operations for parallel execution. Leveraging graph-theoretic methods, our approach derives improved algorithms that achieve reduced time complexity and faster operational running times. First, we introduce an enhanced version of the redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm, which offers superior operational and runtime performance. We detail its efficient implementation on a GPU using a parallel approach. Next, we present an optimized version of the assignment-reconfiguration-ordering (aro) algorithm, specifically tailored for unweighted grid graphs. Finally, we introduce the bird algorithm to solve reconfiguration problems on grids, achieving performance gains over both red-rec and aro. These algorithms can be used to prepare defect-free configurations of neutral atoms in arrays of optical traps, serve as subroutines in more complex algorithms, or cross-benchmark the operational and runtime performance of new algorithms. They are suitable for realizing quantum circuits incorporating displacement operations and are optimized for real-time operation on increasingly large system sizes.

Title: Quantum Annealing for Combinatorial Optimization: A Benchmarking Study
Authors: Seongmin Kim, Sang-Woo Ahn, In-Saeng Suh, Alexander W. Dowling, Eungkyu Lee, Tengfei Luo
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) has the potential to significantly improve solution quality and reduce time complexity in solving combinatorial optimization problems compared to classical optimization methods. However, due to the limited number of qubits and their connectivity, the QA hardware did not show such an advantage over classical methods in past benchmarking studies. Recent advancements in QA with more than 5,000 qubits, enhanced qubit connectivity, and the hybrid architecture promise to realize the quantum advantage. Here, we use a quantum annealer with state-of-the-art techniques and benchmark its performance against classical solvers. To compare their performance, we solve over 50 optimization problem instances represented by large and dense Hamiltonian matrices using quantum and classical solvers. The results demonstrate that a state-of-the-art quantum solver has higher accuracy (~0.013%) and a significantly faster problem-solving time (~6,561x) than the best classical solver. Our results highlight the advantages of leveraging QA over classical counterparts, particularly in hybrid configurations, for achieving high accuracy and substantially reduced problem solving time in large-scale real-world optimization problems.

Title: Spin Squeezing via One-Axis Twisting in a Quadrupolar NMR system under relaxation effects
Authors: A. C. L. Auccaise, A. S. M. de Castro
Abstract: This study investigates spin squeezed states in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quadrupolar systems with spins I = 3/2 and I = 7/2 at room temperature, taking into account the effects of relaxation on the dynamics. The origin of spin squeezing is attributed to the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment and the electric field gradients in the molecular environment. The formal description of the nonlinear operators responsible for spin squeezing is achieved using the spin angular momentum representation via the one-axis twisting mechanism. This approach provides a framework for quantum control and metrology over the spin squeezing process while accounting for the influence of relaxation phenomena. Non-Cartesian angular momentum operators are proposed, with their variance products catching the quantum effects during the dynamics. An upper bound for the squeezing parameter and the Heisenberg uncertainty at thermal equilibrium are also predicted for any spin quantum number.

Title: Chernoff Information Bottleneck for Covert Quantum Target Sensing
Authors: Giuseppe Ortolano, Ivano Ruo-Berchera, Leonardo Banchi
Abstract: Target sensing is a fundamental task with many practical applications, e.g.~in LiDaR and radar systems. Quantum strategies with entangled states can achieve better sensing accuracies with the same probe energy, yet it is often simpler to use classical probes with higher energy than to take advantage of the quantum regime. Recently, it has been shown that useful quantum advantage can be achieved in covert situations, where sensing has to be performed while also avoiding detection by an adversary: here increasing energy is not a viable stratagem, as it facilitates the adversary. In this paper we introduce a general framework to assess and quantify quantum advantage in covert situations. This is based on extending the information bottleneck principle, originally developed for communication and machine learning applications, to decision problems via the Chernoff information, with the ultimate goal of quantitatively optimizing the trade-off between covertness and sensing ability. In this context we show how quantum resources, namely entangled photonic probes paired with photon counting, greatly outperform classical coherent transmitters in target detection and ranging, while also maintaining a chosen level of covertness. Our work highlights the great potential of integrating quantum sensing in LiDAR systems to enhance the covert performance.

Title: Continuous-variable spatio-spectral quantum networks in nonlinear photonic lattices
Authors: Natalia Costas, Nadia Belabas, David Barral
Abstract: Multiplexing information in different degrees of freedom and use of integrated and fiber-optic components are natural solutions to the scalability bottleneck in optical quantum communications and computing. However, for bulk-optics systems, where size, cost, stability, and reliability are factors, this remains either impractical or highly challenging to implement. In this paper we present a framework to engineer continuous-variable entanglement produced through nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion in \chi^(2) nonlinear photonic lattices in spatial and spectral degrees of freedom that can solve the scalability challenge. We show how spatio-spectral pump shaping produce cluster states that are naturally distributable in quantum communication networks and a resource for measurement-based quantum computing.

Title: Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut
Authors: Bikrant Bhattachayra, Michael Capriotti, Reuben Tate
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization, especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths. For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly dependent on the problem type.

Title: Realization and Calibration of Continuously Parameterized Two-Qubit Gates on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor
Authors: Christopher G. Yale, Ashlyn D. Burch, Matthew N. H. Chow, Brandon P. Ruzic, Daniel S. Lobser, Brian K. McFarland, Melissa C. Revelle, Susan M. Clark
Abstract: Continuously parameterized two-qubit gates are a key feature of state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum processors as they have favorable error scalings and show distinct improvements in circuit performance over more restricted maximally entangling gatesets. In this work, we provide a comprehensive and pedagogical discussion on how to practically implement these continuously parameterized Mølmer-Sørensen gates on the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT), a low-level trapped-ion processor. To generate the arbitrary entangling angles, $\theta$, we simply scale the amplitude of light used to generate the entanglement. However, doing so requires careful consideration of amplifier saturation as well as the variable light shifts that result. As such, we describe a method to calibrate and cancel the dominant fourth-order effects, followed by a dynamic virtual phase advance during the gate to cancel any residual light shifts, and find a linear scaling between $\theta$ and the residual light shift. Once, we have considered and calibrated these effects, we demonstrate performance improvement with decreasing $\theta$. Finally, we describe nuances of hardware control to transform the XX-type interaction of the arbitrary-angle Mølmer-Sørensen gate into a phase-agnostic and crosstalk-mitigating ZZ interaction.

Title: Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei
Authors: Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage
Abstract: Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the quantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24 qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement ($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell, dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion. These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.

Title: Constrained Search in Imaginary Time
Authors: Markus Penz, Robert van Leeuwen
Abstract: An optimization method for the expectation value of a self-adjoint operator under a finite number of expectation-value constraints based on imaginary-time evolution is introduced. It is formulated for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and uses linearly independent and commuting self-adjoint operators for the constraints. The method is applied to the problem of finding the universal functional of density-functional theory and allows theoretical insights into the density-potential mapping.

Title: Neutrino Oscillations as a Probe of Macrorealism
Authors: Kathrine Mørch Groth, Johann Ioannou-Nikolaides, D. Jason Koskinen, Markus Ahlers
Abstract: The correlations between successive measurements of a quantum system can violate a family of Leggett-Garg Inequalities (LGIs) that are analogous to the violation of Bell's inequalities of measurements performed on spatially separated quantum systems. These LGIs follow from a macrorealistic point of view, imposing that a classical system is at all times in a definite state and that a measurement can, at least in principle, leave this state undisturbed. Violations of LGIs can be probed by neutrino flavour oscillations if the correlators of consecutive flavour measurements are approximately stationary. We discuss here several improvements of the methodology used in previous analyses based on accelerator and reactor neutrino data. We argue that the strong claims of LGI violations made in previous studies are based on an unsuitable modelling of macrorealistic systems in statistical hypothesis tests. We illustrate our improved methodology via the example of the MINOS muon-neutrino survival data, where we find revised statistical evidence for violations of LGIs at the $(2-3)\sigma$ level, depending on macrorealistic background models.

Title: Field-tunable quantum disordered ground state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet TlYbSe2
Authors: Bishnu P. Belbase, Arjun Unnikrishnan, Eun Sang Choi, Arnab Banerjee
Abstract: We introduce the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet TlYbSe2 belonging to the rare-earth delafossite family with a relatively disorder-free frustrated triangular lattice - extending the search for the quintessential chiral quantum spin liquid state. While DC magnetization suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a highly frustrated quantum-disordered ground state. The high-field AC magnetization reveals a phase diagram generally consistent with a large family of Yb delafossites. We observe a spin glass transition around 35 mK at zero field, which we argue is due to free spins. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2 - 5 K - indicative of short-range spin correlations - along with a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and the complete absence of long-range order at low fields, establishes the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime location for exploring field-tunable QSL behavior.

Title: Quantum Mechanics and Neural Networks
Authors: Christian Ferko, James Halverson
Abstract: We demonstrate that any Euclidean-time quantum mechanical theory may be represented as a neural network, ensured by the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève theorem, mean-square path continuity, and finite two-point functions. The additional constraint of reflection positivity, which is related to unitarity, may be achieved by a number of mechanisms, such as imposing neural network parameter space splitting or the Markov property. Non-differentiability of the networks is related to the appearance of non-trivial commutators. Neural networks acting on Markov processes are no longer Markov, but still reflection positive, which facilitates the definition of deep neural network quantum systems. We illustrate these principles in several examples using numerical implementations, recovering classic quantum mechanical results such as Heisenberg uncertainty, non-trivial commutators, and the spectrum.

Title: Photon self-interaction through gravitons and axions
Authors: Ahmad Hoseinpour, Moslem Zarei, Mehdi Abdi
Abstract: In this work, we propose to employ the concept of photon self-interaction for axion detection. In particular, we derive the interaction Hamiltonian for photons via axions in a ring cavity. We show that when the incoming photons are considered in plane-wave basis, the interaction vanishes. However, when the realistic case of photon wavepackets are assumed, a self-interaction whose strength is proportional to the size of the wavepacket and the cavity length exists. Under specific conditions, we find that the axion-mediated interaction dominates the gravitationally induced self-interaction. We discuss the implications of this setup for axion detection, focusing on the range of axion mass, $10^{-10}~\text{eV}<m_a<10^{-4}~\text{eV}$ for which the best accuracy of coupling constants is constrained in some cases to $g_{a\gamma \gamma}> 9 \times 10^{-12}~ \text{GeV}^{-1}$.

Title: Randomly measured quantum particle
Authors: V. Gurarie
Abstract: We consider the motion of a quantum particle whose position is measured in random places at random moments in time. We show that a freely moving particle measured in this way undergoes superdiffusion, while a charged particle moving in a magnetic field confined to the lowest Landau level undergoes conventional diffusion. We also look at a particle moving in one dimensional space in a random time-independent potential, so that it is Anderson localized, which is also measured at random points in space and randomly in time. We find that random measurements break localization and this particle also undergoes diffusion. To address these questions, we develop formalism similar to that employed when studying classical and quantum problems with time-dependent noise.

Title: A rigorous formulation of Density Functional Theory for spinless electrons in one dimension
Authors: Thiago Carvalho Corso
Abstract: In this paper, we present a completely rigorous formulation of Kohn-Sham density functional theory for spinless electrons living in one dimensional space. More precisely, we consider Schrödinger operators of the form $H_N(v,w) = -\Delta + \sum_{i\neq j}^N w(x_i,x_j) + \sum_{j=1}^N v(x_i)$ acting on $\wedge^N \mathrm{L}^2([0,1])$, where the external and interaction potentials $v$ and $w$ belong to a suitable class of distributions. In this setting, we obtain a complete characterization of the set of pure-state $v$-representable densities on the interval. Then, we prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that applies to the class of distributional potentials studied here. Lastly, we establish the differentiability of the exchange-correlation functional and therefore the existence of a unique exchange-correlation potential. We then combine these results to provide a rigorous formulation of the Kohn-Sham scheme. In particular, these results show that the Kohn-Sham scheme is rigorously exact in this setting.

Title: Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect
Authors: Philipp Westhoff, Sebastian Paeckel, Mattia Moroder
Abstract: We present an efficient method for dissipatively preparing a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) directly on a lattice, avoiding the need for a two-staged preparation procedure currently used in ultracold atom platforms. Our protocol is based on driving the lattice-subsystem into a non-equilibrium steady state, which we show to exhibit a lattice analog of a true BEC, where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. Furthermore, exploiting a symmetry-based Mpemba effect, we analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics, quantitatively assessing the speedups yielded by our protocol, as well as the fidelities of the prepared BEC.

Title: Endoscopic fiber-coupled diamond magnetometer for cancer surgery
Authors: A. J. Newman, S. M. Graham, C. J. Stephen, A. M. Edmonds, M. L. Markham, G. W. Morley
Abstract: Interoperative measurements using magnetic sensors is a valuable technique in cancer surgery for finding magnetic tracers. Here we present a fiber-coupled nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center magnetometer capable of detecting iron oxide suspension (MagTrace from Endomagnetics Ltd.) used in breast cancer surgeries. Detection of an iron mass as low as 0.56~mg has been demonstrated, 100 times less than that of a recommended dose at a maximum distance of 5.8~mm. Detection of an iron concentration as low as 2.8 mg/ml has also been demonstrated, 20 times less than a recommended dose. The maximum working distance from the sensor can be as large as 14.6~mm for higher concentrations. The sensor head has a maximum diameter of 10~mm which would allow it to be used for endoscopy, laparoscopy and interoperative surgery.

Title: Thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics at conical intersections: When can a single mean-field trajectory capture internal conversion?
Authors: Alan Scheidegger, Jiří J. L. Vaníček
Abstract: The thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics is a single-trajectory method that partially includes both nuclear quantum and electronically nonadiabatic effects by combining the thawed Gaussian wavepacket dynamics with Ehrenfest dynamics. First, we demonstrate the improvement over the parent methods in a multidimensional system consisting of vertically displaced harmonic potentials with constant diabatic couplings, for which the thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics is exact. Then, we show that single-trajectory mean-field methods completely fail to capture electronic population transfer in the vicinity of conical intersections between potential energy surfaces associated with electronic states of different symmetry (i.e., belonging to different irreducible representations of the molecular point group). The underlying cause of this limitation suggests that the thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics can be useful for studying nonadiabatic dynamics close to conical intersections of electronic states of the same symmetry, which have been understudied owing to the difficulty in locating them. Using a model of this type of intersection, we compare the thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics with exact quantum dynamics and find that the approximate mean-field approach yields a molecular wavefunction that remains qualitatively similar to the exact one even after crossing and recrossing the conical intersection.

Title: The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops
Authors: Lukas J. Fiderer, Paul C. Barth, Isaac D. Smith, Hans J. Briegel
Abstract: Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.

Title: Role of mechanical effects on the excitation spectra of microwave-dressed Rydberg states in a cold atomic cloud
Authors: H. Failache, J.A. Muniz, L. Velazco, D. Talento, A. Lezama
Abstract: We explore the excitation spectra of cold 87Rb atoms to the 55D_3/2 Rydberg state in the presence of microwave (MW) radiation as a function of MW frequency. The spectra reveal several features around the transition-frequencies between adjacent Rydberg states. We argue that some of these features are indicative of variations in the Rydberg excitation probability while others result from the removal of atoms from the cold cloud as a consequence of a MW induced strong dipole-dipole inter-atomic force. Our claim is supported by experimental observations and theoretical modeling.

Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.

Title: Paraxial fluids of light
Authors: Quentin Glorieux, Clara Piekarski, Quentin Schibler, Tangui Aladjidi, Myrann Baker-Rasooli
Abstract: Paraxial fluids of light are a promising platform for exploring collective phenomena in a highly tunable environment. These systems, which map the propagation of light through nonlinear media onto the wavefunction of effective 2D quantum fluids, offer a complementary approach to traditional platforms such as cold atomic gases or superfluid helium. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the theoretical framework underlying paraxial fluids of light, including the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) and its mapping to the 2D+1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). We explore the hydrodynamic formulation of these systems and we provide a comparative analysis of fluids of light and cold atomic gases, examining key parameters and figures of merit. We then review the recent experimental advances and the experimental platforms currently used to realize paraxial fluids of light, including hot atomic vapors, photorefractive crystals, and thermo-optic media. Additionally, we question the geometry of the system extending the analogy from 2D+1 to lower or higher dimensions. Looking forward, we outline the potential future directions for the field, including the use of laser cooled atoms as nonlinear media, the study of two-component mixtures, and the exploration of quantum effects beyond the mean-field approximation. These developments promise to deepen our understanding of quantum fluids and potentially contribute to advances in quantum technologies.

Title: Prethermalization of light and matter in cavity-coupled Rydberg arrays
Authors: Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Hossein Hosseinabadi, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.

Title: Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. I. The redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm
Authors: Barry Cimring, Remy El Sabeh, Marc Bacvanski, Stephanie Maaz, Izzat El Hajj, Naomi Nishimura, Amer E. Mouawad, Alexandre Cooper
Abstract: We propose the redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm to prepare large configurations of atoms using arrays of dynamic optical traps. Red-rec exploits simple heuristics and exact subroutines to solve atom reconfiguration problems on grids. It admits a fast and efficient implementation suitable for real-time operation. We numerically quantify its performance using realistic physical parameters and operational constraints, both in the absence and presence of loss. Red-rec enables assembling large configurations of atoms with high mean success probability. Fast preparation times are achieved by harnessing parallel control operations that actuate multiple traps simultaneously. Faster preparation times are achieved by rejecting configurations of atoms containing fewer atoms than a given threshold. However, the number of traps required to prepare a compact-centered configuration of atoms on a grid with a probability of 0.5 scales as the 3/2 power of the number of desired atoms. This finding highlights some of the challenges associated with scaling up configurations of atoms beyond tens of thousands of atoms.

Title: Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. II. The assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm
Authors: Remy El Sabeh, Jessica Bohm, Zhiqian Ding, Stephanie Maaz, Naomi Nishimura, Izzat El Hajj, Amer E. Mouawad, Alexandre Cooper
Abstract: Programmable arrays of optical traps enable the assembly of configurations of single atoms to perform controlled experiments on quantum many-body systems. Finding the sequence of control operations to transform an arbitrary configuration of atoms into a predetermined one requires solving an atom reconfiguration problem quickly and efficiently. A typical approach to solve atom reconfiguration problems is to use an assignment algorithm to determine which atoms to move to which traps. This approach results in control protocols that exactly minimize the number of displacement operations; however, this approach does not optimize for the number of displaced atoms or the number of times each atom is displaced, resulting in unnecessary control operations that increase the execution time and failure rate of the control protocol. In this work, we propose the assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm to improve the performance of assignment-based algorithms in solving atom reconfiguration problems. The aro algorithm uses an assignment subroutine to minimize the total distance traveled by all atoms, a rerouting subroutine to reduce the number of displaced atoms, and an ordering subroutine to guarantee that each atom is displaced at most once. The ordering subroutine relies on the existence of a partial ordering of moves that can be obtained using a polynomial-time algorithm that we introduce within the formal framework of graph theory. We numerically quantify the performance of the aro algorithm in the presence and in the absence of loss, and show that it outperforms the exact, approximation, and heuristic algorithms that we use as benchmarks. Our results are useful for assembling large configurations of atoms with high success probability and fast preparation time, as well as for designing and benchmarking novel atom reconfiguration algorithms.

Title: Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures
Authors: Mykola Semenyakin, Yevheniia Cheipesh, Yaroslav Herasymenko
Abstract: Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. A condition $\omega_k=0$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, and Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Classes $G_{k=O(1)}$ are shown to be physically relevant, as $\omega_k$ vanishes or nearly vanishes for truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$. Potential applications of this ansatz and its connections to the coupled-cluster wavefunction are discussed.

Title: Tradeoff between noise and banding in a quantum adder with qudits
Authors: Gaurang Agrawal, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Quantum addition based on the quantum Fourier transform can be an integral part of a quantum circuit and proved to be more efficient than the existing classical ripple carry adder. Our study includes identifying the quantum resource required in a quantum adder in any arbitrary dimension and its relationship with the performance indicator in the presence of local noise acting on the circuit and when a limited number of controlled rotation operations is permitted, a procedure known as banding. We analytically prove an upper bound on the number of the controlled rotation gates required to accomplish the quantum addition up to an arbitrary defect in the fidelity between the desired and imperfect output. When the environment interacts with individual qudits, we establish a connection between quantum coherence and fidelity of the output. Interestingly, we demonstrate that when banding is employed in the presence of noise, approximate circuits of constant depth outperform circuits with a higher number of controlled rotations, establishing a complementary relationship between the approximate quantum adder and the strength of the noise. We exhibit that utilizing magnetic fields to prepare an initial state that evolves according to a one-dimensional spin chain for a specific amount of time can be a potential technique to implement quantum addition circuits in many-body systems.

Title: Image Reconstruction from Readout-Multiplexed Single-Photon Detector Arrays
Authors: Shashwath Bharadwaj, Ruangrawee Kitichotkul, Akshay Agarwal, Vivek K Goyal
Abstract: Readout multiplexing is a promising solution to overcome hardware limitations and data bottlenecks in imaging with single-photon detectors. Conventional multiplexed readout processing creates an upper bound on photon counts at a very fine time scale, where frames with multiple detected photons must either be discarded or allowed to introduce significant bias. We formulate multiphoton coincidence resolution as an inverse imaging problem and introduce a solution framework to probabilistically resolve the spatial locations of photon incidences. Specifically, we develop a theoretical abstraction of row--column multiplexing and a model of photon events that make readouts ambiguous. Using this, we propose a novel estimator that spatially resolves up to four coincident photons. Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed method increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of reconstruction by 3 to 4 dB compared to conventional methods under optimal incident flux conditions. Additionally, this method reduces the required number of readout frames to achieve the same mean-squared error as other methods by a factor of ~4. Finally, our method matches the Cramer--Rao bound for detection probability estimation for a wider range of incident flux values compared to conventional methods. While demonstrated for a specific detector type and readout architecture, this method can be extended to more general multiplexing with different detector models.

Title: Chiral Interaction Induced Near-Perfect Photon Blockade
Authors: Zhi-Guang Lu, Ying Wu, Xin-You Lü
Abstract: Based on the scattering matrix method, we theoretically demonstrate that the chiral interaction can induce the almost perfect photon blockade (PB) in the waveguide-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system. The mechanism relies on the multi-photon paths interference within the waveguide, which is clearly shown by the analytic parameter regime for $g^{(2)}(0)\approx0$. When $N$ cavities are introduced into the system, there are $N$ optimal parameter points accordingly for the almost perfect PB, where the required lowest chirality decreases exponentially with increasing $N$, and these optimal points are robust against disorder in the system's frequencies. Under resonant driving and fixed chirality conditions, the output light depends solely on the parity of $N$ ($N\ge2$), with a coherent state emerging for even numbers of cavities and a single-photon state for odd numbers. Our work offers an alternative route for achieving almost perfect PB effects with high single-photon transmission by employing the chirality of system, with potential application in the on-chip single-photon source with integrability.

Title: Non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation in split-index matrix product states
Authors: David T. Stephen
Abstract: We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries including anomalous symmetries, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing quantum teleportation and constrained spin chains.

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are singularities in non-Hermitian systems, where the system transmission spectrum varies significantly at the phase transition point. Here, we propose a practical scheme to study the changes of the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) spectrum on the exceptional surface (ES), which is formed by designing the structure of the waveguide in a non-Hermitian cavity optomechanical system. By comparing the transmission spectra of the system at different normal points, EPs on the same or different ESs, and exceptional derived points, we find that the peak-valley conversion of the system transmission spectra is obtained at the phase transition point and the arbitrary manipulation of the system transmission spectrum can be realized by moving the system on the same or different ESs. Furthermore, the phenomena of conversion and enhancement of the fast-slow light in the system transmission spectra have also been discovered in our researches. Different from the isolated EP, our proposal can discuss the system properties at different EPs, can find a richer transmission spectrum, and can provide more convenient options for experimental implementation, which paves the way for studying the nature of non-Hermitian systems in a higher dimension.

Title: Topological Quantum Batteries
Authors: Zhi-Guang Lu, Guoqing Tian, Xin-You Lü, Cheng Shang
Abstract: We propose an innovative design for quantum batteries (QBs) that involves coupling two-level systems to a topological photonic waveguide. Employing the resolvent method, we analytically explore the thermodynamic performance of QBs. First, we demonstrate that in the long-time limit, only bound states significantly contribute to the stored energy of QBs. We observe that near-perfect energy transfer can occur in the topologically nontrivial phase. Moreover, the maximum stored energy exhibits singular behavior at the phase boundaries, where the number of bound states undergoes a transition. Second, when a quantum charger and a quantum battery are coupled at the same sublattice within a unit cell, the ergotropy becomes immune to dissipation at that location, facilitated by a dark state and a topologically robust dressed bound state. Third, we show that as dissipation intensifies along with the emergence of the quantum Zeno effect, the charging power of QBs experiences a temporary boost. Our findings offer valuable guidance for improving quantum battery performance in realistic conditions through structured reservoir engineering.

Title: Progressive Quantum Algorithm for Maximum Independent Set with Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz
Authors: Xiao-Hui Ni, Ling-Xiao Li, Yan-Qi Song, Zheng-Ping Jin, Su-Juan Qin, Fei Gao
Abstract: Hadfield et al. proposed a novel Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz algorithm (QAOA+), and this algorithm has wide applications in solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs) because of the advantages of QAOA+ ansatz in constructing a feasible solution space. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Quantum Algorithm (PQA) with QAOA+ ansatz to solve the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem using fewer qubits. The core idea of PQA is to construct a subgraph that is likely to contain the MIS solution of the target graph and then solve the MIS problem on this subgraph to obtain an approximate solution. To construct such a subgraph, PQA starts with a small-scale initial subgraph and progressively expands its graph size utilizing heuristic expansion strategies. After each expansion, PQA solves the MIS problem on the newly generated subgraph. In each run, PQA repeats the expansion and solving process until a predefined stopping condition is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that to achieve an approximation ratio of 0.95, PQA requires only $5.565\%$ ($2.170\%$) of the qubits and $17.59\%$ ($6.430\%$) of the runtime compared with directly solving the original problem using QAOA+ on Erdős-Rényi (3-regular) graphs, highlighting the efficiency of PQA.

Title: Dipole-dipole interactions mediated by a photonic flat band
Authors: Enrico Di Benedetto, Alejandro Gonzalez-Tudela, Francesco Ciccarello
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.

Title: Asymmetries of thermal processes in open quantum systems
Authors: Álvaro Tejero, Rafael Sánchez, Laiachi El Kaoutit, Daniel Manzano, Antonio Lasanta
Abstract: An intriguing phenomenon in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is the asymmetry of thermal processes. Relaxation to thermal equilibrium is the most important dissipative process, being a key concept for the design of heat engines and refrigerators, contributing to the study of foundational questions of thermodynamics, and being relevant for quantum computing through the process of algorithmic cooling. Despite their importance, the dynamics of these processes are far from being understood. We show that the free relaxation to thermal equilibrium follows intrinsically different paths depending on whether it involves the temperature of the system to increase or to decrease. Our theory is exemplified using the recently developed thermal kinematics based on information geometry theory, utilizing three prototypical examples: a two-level system, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and a trapped quantum Brownian particle, in all cases showing faster heating than cooling under the appropriate conditions. A general understanding is obtained based on the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian and the spectral gap of reciprocal processes.

Title: Experimentally probing Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime
Authors: Stefan Aimet, Mohammadamin Tajik, Gabrielle Tournaire, Philipp Schüttelkopf, João Sabino, Spyros Sotiriadis, Giacomo Guarnieri, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Jens Eisert
Abstract: Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalised to characterise irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relationship between the entropy change of the system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in relative entropies of the environment. Here we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to massless Klein-Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalised entropy production for various system-environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Local quantum channels giving rise to quasi-local Gibbs states
Authors: Itai Arad, Raz Firanko, Omer Gurevich
Abstract: We study the steady-state properties of quantum channels with local Kraus operators. We consider a large family that consists of general ergodic 1-local (non-interacting) terms and general 2-local (interacting) terms. Physically, a repeated application of these channels can be seen as a simple model for the thermalization process of a many-body system. We study its steady state perturbatively, by interpolating between the 1-local and 2-local channels with a perturbation parameter $\epsilon$. We prove that under very general conditions, these states are Gibbs states of a quasi-local Hamiltonian. Expanding this Hamiltonian as a series in $\epsilon$, we show that the $k$'th order term corresponds to a $(k+1)$-local interaction term in the Hamiltonian, which follows the same interaction graph as the Kraus channel. We also prove a complementary result suggesting the existence of an interaction strength threshold, under which the total weight of the high-order terms in the Hamiltonian decays exponentially fast. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, this implies both exponential decay of local correlation functions and a classical algorithm for computing expectation value of local observables in such steady states. Finally, we present numerical simulations of various channels that support our theoretical results.

Title: Real-time operator evolution in two and three dimensions via sparse Pauli dynamics
Authors: Tomislav Begušić, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: We study real-time operator evolution using sparse Pauli dynamics, a recently developed method for simulating expectation values of quantum circuits. On the examples of energy and charge diffusion in 1D spin chains and sudden quench dynamics in the 2D transverse-field Ising model, it is shown that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art tensor network methods. We further demonstrate the flexibility of the approach by studying quench dynamics in the 3D transverse-field Ising model which is highly challenging for tensor network methods. For the simulation of expectation value dynamics starting in a computational basis state, we introduce an extension of sparse Pauli dynamics that truncates the growing sum of Pauli operators by discarding terms with a large number of X and Y matrices. This is validated by our 2D and 3D simulations. Finally, we argue that sparse Pauli dynamics is not only capable of converging challenging observables to high accuracy, but can also serve as a reliable approximate approach even when given only limited computational resources.

Title: Spectral signatures of the Markovian to Non-Markovian transition in open quantum systems
Authors: Zeng-Zhao Li, Chi-Hang Lam, Cho-Tung Yip, Bo Li
Abstract: We present a new approach for investigating the Markovian to non-Markovian transition in quantum aggregates strongly coupled to a vibrational bath through the analysis of linear absorption spectra. Utilizing hierarchical algebraic equations in the frequency domain, we elucidate how these spectra can effectively reveal transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, driven by the complex interplay of dissipation, aggregate-bath coupling, and intra-aggregate dipole-dipole interactions. Our results demonstrate that reduced dissipation induces spectral peak splitting, signaling the emergence of bath-induced non-Markovian effects. The spectral peak splitting can also be driven by enhanced dipole-dipole interactions, although the underlying mechanism differs from that of dissipation-induced splitting. Additionally, with an increase in aggregate-bath coupling strength, initially symmetric or asymmetric peaks with varying spectral amplitudes may merge under weak dipole-dipole interactions, whereas strong dipole-dipole interactions are more likely to cause peak splitting. Moreover, we find that spectral features serve as highly sensitive indicators for distinguishing the geometric structures of aggregates, while also unveiling the critical role geometry plays in shaping non-Markovian behavior. This study not only deepens our understanding of the Markovian to non-Markovian transition but also provides a robust framework for optimizing and controlling quantum systems.

Title: On the Complexity of Pure-State Consistency of Local Density Matrices
Authors: Jonas Kamminga, Dorian Rudolph
Abstract: In this work we investigate the computational complexity of the pure consistency of local density matrices (PureCLDM) and pure N-representability (Pure-N-Representability; analog of PureCLDM for bosonic or fermionic systems) problems. In these problems the input is a set of reduced density matrices and the task is to determine whether there exists a global pure state consistent with these reduced density matrices. While mixed CLDM, i.e. where the global state can be mixed, was proven to be QMA-complete by Broadbent and Grilo [JoC 2022], almost nothing was known about the complexity of the pure version. Before our work the best upper and lower bounds were QMA(2) and QMA. Our contribution to the understanding of these problems is twofold. Firstly, we define a pure state analogue of the complexity class QMA+ of Aharanov and Regev [FOCS 2003], which we call PureSuperQMA. We prove that both pure-N-Representability and PureCLDM are complete for this new class. Along the way we supplement Broadbent and Grilo by proving hardness for 2-qubit reduced density matrices and showing that mixed N-Representability is QMA-complete. Secondly, we improve the upper bound on PureCLDM. Using methods from algebraic geometry, we prove that PureSuperQMA is in PSPACE. Our methods, and the PSPACE upper bound, are also valid for PureCLDM with exponential or even perfect precision, hence precisePureCLDM is not preciseQMA(2)=NEXP-complete, unless PSPACE=NEXP. We view this as evidence for a negative answer to the longstanding open question whether PureCLDM is QMA(2)-complete. The techniques we develop for our PSPACE upper bound are quite general. We are able to use them for various applications: from proving PSPACE upper bounds on other quantum problems to giving an efficient parallel (NC) algorithm for (non-convex) quadratically constrained quadratic programs with few constraints.

Title: Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Zhao-Fan Cai, Yu-Chun Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.

Title: Quantum trails and memory effects in the phase space of chaotic quantum systems
Authors: Andrea Pizzi
Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are, however, a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wave function elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wave packet in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wave packet, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows us to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.

Title: Genetic algorithm enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm for quantum compiling
Authors: Jiangwei Long, Xuyang Huang, Jianxin Zhong, Lijun Meng
Abstract: Quantum compiling trying to approximate the target qubit gate by finding an optimal sequence (braid word) of basic braid operations is a fundamental problem in quantum computing. We develop a genetic algorithm (GA) enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (SKA) to approximate single qubit gates with four basic braid matrices of Fibonacci anyons. The GA-enhanced SKA demonstrates that the algorithm performs strongly and can easily find the ideal braid word from an exponentially large space. The resulting precision of the approximate single-qubit quantum gate is superior to that of the Monte Carlo (MC) enhanced SKA, as well as comparable to that of the deep reinforcement learning (RL) for the length of braid word greater than 25. The 2(3)-order approximation of GA-enhanced SKA for basic braiding length l0=50(30) leads to an optimal braid word at a distance of 5.9*10^(-7), which is sufficient for most cases of quantum computing. Our work provides an alternative approach to solving and optimizing quantum compilation of non-Abelian anyon quantum gates and is useful for realizing topological quantum computation in the future.

Title: Nonlinear optomechanical systems with quasi-periodic and chaotic dynamics
Authors: A.P. Saiko, G.A. Rusetsky, S.A. Markevich, R. Fedaruk
Abstract: Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated. The dynamics of the mechanical resonator is considered in the presence of (i) only linear interaction, (ii) only quadratic interaction, (iii) both linear and quadratic interactions, and (iv) all three interactions, while other parameters of the optomechanical system, the modulation optical field, and the initial conditions remain fixed. Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.

Title: Chromatic Quantum Contextuality
Authors: Karl Svozil
Abstract: Chromatic quantum contextuality is a criterion of quantum nonclassicality based on (hyper)graph coloring constraints. If a quantum hypergraph requires more colors than the number of outcomes per maximal observable (context), it lacks a classical realization with n-uniform outcomes per context. Consequently, it cannot represent a "completable" non-contextual set of coexisting n-ary outcomes per maximal observable. This result serves as a chromatic analogue of the Kochen-Specker theorem. We present an explicit example of a four-colorable quantum logic in dimension three. Furthermore, chromatic contextuality suggests a novel restriction on classical truth values, thereby excluding two-valued measures that cannot be extended to $n$-ary colorings. Using this framework, we establish new bounds for the house, pentagon, and pentagram hypergraphs, refining previous constraints.

Title: Noise-resilient solid host for electron qubits above 100 mK
Authors: Xinhao Li, Christopher S. Wang, Brennan Dizdar, Yizhong Huang, Yutian Wen, Wei Guo, Xufeng Zhang, Xu Han, Xianjing Zhou, Dafei Jin
Abstract: Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid host for single electron qubits. At ~10 mK temperatures, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have exhibited exceptionally long coherence times and high operation fidelities. To advance this platform towards a scalable quantum information architecture, systematic characterization of its noise feature is imperative. Here, we show the remarkable resilience of solid neon against charge and thermal noises when eNe qubits are operated away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimizing neon growth, the measured charge (voltage) noise on solid neon is already orders of magnitude lower than that in most stringently grown semiconductors, rivaling the best records to date. Up to 400 mK, the eNe charge qubits operated at ~5 GHz can maintain their echo coherence times over 1 microsecond. These observations highlight solid neon as an ideal host for quantum information processing at higher temperatures and larger scales.

Title: The Quantum Wave Function as a Complex Probability Distribution
Authors: Charalampos Antonakos
Abstract: This paper suggests an interpretation for the wave function, based on some elements of Nelson's stochastic mechanics, the time-symmetric laws of quantum theory and complex probabilities. Our main purpose is to demonstrate that the wave function and its complex conjugate can be interpreted as complex probability densities (or quasi-probability distributions) related to non-real forward and backward in time stochastic motion respectively. Those two quasi-Brownian motions serve as mathematical abstracts in order to derive the Born rule using probability theory and the intersection of the two probability sets that describe each of those motions. This proposal is useful also for explaining more about the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics that produces this so-called "wave-like" nature of quantum reality. Our perspective also challenges the notion of physical superposition which is a fundamental concept in the Copenhagen interpretation and some other interpretations of quantum theory. Moreover, it is suggested that, embracing the idea of stochastic processes in quantum theory, may explain the reasons for the appearance of classical behavior in large objects, in contrast to the quantum behavior of small ones. In other words, we claim that a combination of a probabilistic and no-ontic view of the wave function with a stochastic hidden-variables approach, like Nelson's and others', may provide some insight into the quantum physical reality and potentially establish the groundwork for a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Title: Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model
Authors: Sunny Pradhan, Jesús Cobos, Enrique Rico, Germán Sierra
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.

Title: Fast Scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising Model
Authors: Goksu Can Toga, Abhishek Samlodia, Alexander F. Kemper
Abstract: We investigate many-body chaos and scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising model, a mixed-field Ising model living in the background of AdS2. The effect of the curvature is captured by site-dependent couplings obtained from the AdS2 metric applied to a flat nearest neighbor spin chain. We show that this model with only local site-dependent nearest neighbor interactions is maximally chaotic, can be classified as a fast scrambler, and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound on chaos for a certain set of parameters, thus making this model one of the few if not the only example where such fast scrambling behavior has been seen without all-to-all or long-range interactions. Moreover, the modest resources needed to simulate this model make it an ideal test-bed for studying scrambling and chaos on quantum computers.

Title: The Large-Scale Structure of Entanglement in Quantum Many-body Systems
Authors: Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming
Abstract: We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the $\textit{large-scale structure of entanglement}$ of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.

Title: Quantum smoothed particle hydrodynamics algorithm inspired by quantum walks
Authors: R. Au-Yeung, V. M. Kendon, S. J. Lind
Abstract: Recent years have seen great progress in quantum computing, providing opportunities to overcome computational bottlenecks in many scientific applications. In particular, the intersection of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and quantum computing has become an active area of research with exponential computational speedup as an ultimate goal. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for the time-dependent smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Our algorithm uses concepts from discrete-time quantum walks to solve the one-dimensional advection partial differential equation via an SPH formalism. Hence, we construct a quantum circuit to carry out the calculations for a two-particle system over one, two and three timesteps. We compare its outputs with results from the classical SPH algorithm and show there is excellent agreement. The methodology and findings here are a key step towards developing a more general quantum SPH algorithm for solving practical engineering problems on gate-based quantum computers.

Title: Training Hybrid Deep Quantum Neural Network for Reinforcement Learning Efficiently
Authors: Jie Luo, Xueyin Chen
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a new paradigm for computation, exploiting an exponentially growing Hilbert space for data representation and operation. Results are obtained from sampling over qubit state distributions that can have complex correlations from entanglement produced by the quantum computing process. Quantum machine learning (QML) emerged recently as a novel interdisciplinary research direction, developing novel machine learning architectures with quantum blocks. While large-scale fault-tolerant quantum machines are not yet available, recent works on hybrid QML models, compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, have hinted at improved performance. Such hybrid deep quantum neural networks (hDQNNs) integrate GPU/CPU-based deep neural networks (DNNs) with parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) that can be straightforwardly executed on quantum processors. However, efficiently training hDQNNs using quantum hardware compatible batch backpropagation through PQCs was unavailable, limiting hDQNNs' scalability and usefulness for complex modern machine-learning tasks. Here, we present a scalable QML architecture that overcomes these challenges and demonstrates efficient batch optimization through PQC blocks to update associated model DNNs, enabling scalable hDQNN training compatible with physical quantum computers. Applied to the high-dimensional complex reinforcement learning benchmark, Humanoid-v4, successfully for the first time, our method highlights that hDQNN can deliver improved performance over models based on widely used state-of-the-art classical architectures. These findings offer a pathway toward leveraging near-term hybrid quantum-classical (hQC) computing systems for large-scale machine learning and underscore the potential of hQC architectures in advancing reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence.

Title: Coherent manipulation of interacting electron qubits on solid neon
Authors: Xinhao Li, Yizhong Huang, Xu Han, Xianjing Zhou, Dafei Jin
Abstract: Solid neon has emerged as a pristine material host for electron qubits. Single electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have shown extraordinarily long coherence times and high operation fidelities. Realizing two-qubit gates in this platform is the next major step for realistic quantum information processing. In this work, we demonstrate frequency- and time-domain coherent manipulation of multiple eNe charge qubits that are coupled by charge interactions. Cross-resonance and bSWAP two-qubit gates are implemented, laying the foundation for universal quantum computing. An inter-qubit coupling strength exceeding 60~MHz has been observed, promising fast gate speed and suppressed infidelity. These results highlight the potential to scale up the eNe qubit platform toward universal quantum computing.

Title: Dynamically near-stable two-mode squeezing in optomechanical systems
Authors: Shi-fan Qi
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme within a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, wherein a mechanical resonator is coupled to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the open-quantum-system framework. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unstable system dynamics. Moreover, the squeezing level can surpass the maximum achievable under stable system conditions. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.

Title: Direct Measurement of the Singlet Lifetime and Photoexcitation Behavior of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Richard A. Escalante, Andrew J. Beling, Niko Reed, Justin Welter, John Blanchard, Daniel G. Ang, Cecilia Campos, Edwin Coronel, Klaus Krambrock, Alexandre S. Leal, Paras N. Prasad, Ronald L. Walsworth
Abstract: Optically active electronic spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a promising platform for quantum sensing, as they can enable shorter standoff distances compared to defects in diamond, leading to sensitivity advantages. Perhaps the most studied defect in a vdW material is the negatively charged boron vacancy center ($V^{-}_{B}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, many of the $V^{-}_{B}$ electronic and spin transition rates and branching ratios are not fully known. Here, we use time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements with a nanosecond rise-time 515 nm laser to determine directly the singlet state lifetime of a $V^{-}_{B}$ ensemble in neutron-irradiated, sub-micron-size flakes of hBN. We perform this measurement on 16 different hBN flakes at room temperature and obtain an average lifetime of 15(3) ns. Additionally, we probe the PL dynamics of thermal and optically polarized electronic spin distributions of the $V^{-}_{B}$ ensemble in a single sub-micron hBN flake, and fit our results to a 9-level model to extract the electronic transition rates. Lastly, we present PL measurements that potentially indicate optically-induced conversion of $V^{-}_{B}$ to another electronic state, or possibly the neutral charge state (V$^{0}_{B}$), in neutron-irradiated hBN flakes of size $>$ 1 $\mu$m.

Title: Engineering active motion in quantum matter
Authors: Yuanjian Zheng, Alexander P. Antonov, Benno Liebchen, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: We introduce a framework for engineering active quantum matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that are of quantum origin. These quantum-active features are revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short timescales.

Title: Photovoltaic power forecasting using quantum machine learning
Authors: Asel Sagingalieva, Stefan Komornyik, Ayush Joshi, Christopher Mansell, Karan Pinto, Markus Pflitsch, Alexey Melnikov
Abstract: Predicting solar panel power output is crucial for advancing the transition to renewable energy but is complicated by the variable and non-linear nature of solar energy. This is influenced by numerous meteorological factors, geographical positioning, and photovoltaic cell properties, posing significant challenges to forecasting accuracy and grid stability. Our study introduces a suite of solutions centered around hybrid quantum neural networks designed to tackle these complexities. The first proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory, surpasses all tested models by achieving mean absolute errors and mean squared errors that are more than 40% lower. The second proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence neural network, once trained, predicts photovoltaic power with 16% lower mean absolute error for arbitrary time intervals without the need for prior meteorological data, highlighting its versatility. Moreover, our hybrid models perform better even when trained on limited datasets, underlining their potential utility in data-scarce scenarios. These findings represent progress towards resolving time series prediction challenges in energy forecasting through hybrid quantum models, showcasing the transformative potential of quantum machine learning in catalyzing the renewable energy transition.

Title: Universal quantum dynamics of Bose polarons
Authors: Jiří Etrych, Gevorg Martirosyan, Alec Cao, Christopher J. Ho, Zoran Hadzibabic, Christoph Eigen
Abstract: Predicting the emergent properties of impurities immersed in a quantum bath is a fundamental challenge that can defy quasiparticle treatments. Here, we measure the spectral properties and real-time dynamics of mobile impurities injected into a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, using two broad Feshbach resonances to tune both the impurity-bath and intrabath interactions. For attractive impurity-bath interactions, the impurity spectrum features a single branch, which away from the resonance corresponds to a well-defined attractive polaron; near the resonance we observe dramatic broadening of this branch, suggesting a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture. For repulsive impurity-bath interactions, the spectrum features two branches: the attractive branch that is dominated by excitations with energy close to that of the Feshbach dimer, but has a many-body character, and the repulsive polaron branch. Our measurements show that the behavior of impurities in weakly interacting baths is remarkably universal, controlled only by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction parameter.

Authors: Yannick Deller, Martin Gärttner, Tobias Haas, Markus K. Oberthaler, Moritz Reh, Helmut Strobel
Abstract: We investigate the information extractable from measurement distributions of two non-commuting spin observables in a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We provide a variety of analytic and numerical evidence that suitably chosen classical entropies and classical mutual informations thereof contain the typical feature of quantum entropies known in quantum field theories, that is, the area law, even in the non-Gaussian regime and for a non-zero temperature. Towards a feasible experimental implementation, we estimate entropic quantities from a finite number of samples without any additional assumptions on the underlying quantum state using k-nearest neighbor estimators.

Abstract: In state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET), information about annihilation photon polarization is unavailable. Here, we present a PET scanner built from plastic scintillators, where annihilation photons primarily interact via the Compton effect, providing information about both photon polarization and propagation direction. Using this plastic-based PET, we determined the distribution of the relative angle between polarization planes of photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. The amplitude of the observed distribution is smaller than predicted for maximally quantum-entangled two-photon states but larger than expected for separable photons. This result can be well explained by assuming that photons from pick-off annihilation are not entangled, while photons from direct and para-positronium annihilations are maximally entangled. Our result indicates that the degree of entanglement depends on the annihilation mechanism in matter, opening new avenues for exploring polarization correlations in PET as a diagnostic indicator.

Title: Dual-Space Invariance as a Definitive Signature of Critical States in Anderson Localization
Authors: Tong Liu
Abstract: Critical states represent a fundamental and fascinating research frontier in Anderson localization physics, known for their non-ergodic properties, including multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge up to now. In this work, we establish a universal mechanism demonstrating that critical states must maintain dual-space invariance in both position and momentum representations, leading to delocalized dynamics in both spaces. Therefore, our discovery soundly answers this long-standing unsolved puzzle regarding the definition of the critical state and its rigorous characterization. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we prove rigorously that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces as expected. Subsequent numerical simulations provide the smoking gun for the correctness of the dual-space invariance, thereby not only highlighting the universality of the rigorous mechanism, but also establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.

Title: Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the \textit{chiral anomaly}. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting Berry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\chi$, or (2) two distinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.

Title: Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes
Authors: Goncalo Araujo-Regado, Philipp A. Hoehn, Francesco Sartini, Bilyana Tomova
Abstract: Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Due to their structural similarities, it is often held that soft modes are some kind of asymptotic limit of edge modes. Here, we show in Maxwell theory that there is an arguably more interesting relationship between the asymptotic symmetries and their charges, on one hand, and their finite-distance counterparts, on the other, without the need of a limit. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical $\rm{U}(1)$-reference frames for dressing subregion variables. Distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic frames, according to whether they are built from field content in- or outside the region, we find that non-trivial corner symmetries arise only for extrinsic frames. Further, the asymptotic-to-finite relation requires asymptotically charged ones (like Wilson lines). Such frames, called soft edges, extend to asymptotia and, in fact, realize the corner charge algebra in multiple ways, for example, by "pulling in" the asymptotic one from infinity, or physically through the addition of asymptotic soft and hard radiation. Realizing an infinite-dimensional algebra requires a new set of soft boundary conditions, relying on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic data. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We also connect the asymptotic memory effect with a more operational quasi-local one. A main conclusion is that the relationship between asymptotia and finite distance is frame-dependent; each choice of soft edge mode probes distinct cross-boundary data of the global theory.

Title: From black hole interior to quantum complexity through operator rank
Authors: Alexey Milekhin
Abstract: It has been conjectured that the size of the black hole interior captures the quantum gate complexity of the underlying boundary evolution. In this short note we aim to provide a further microscopic evidence for this by directly relating the area of a certain codimension-two surface traversing the interior to the depth of the quantum circuit. Our arguments are based on establishing such relation rigorously at early times using the notion of operator Schmidt rank and then extrapolating it to later times by mapping bulk surfaces to cuts in the circuit representation.

Title: Lattice T-duality from non-invertible symmetries in quantum spin chains
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Arkya Chatterjee, Shu-Heng Shao
Abstract: Dualities of quantum field theories are challenging to realize in lattice models of qubits. In this work, we explore one of the simplest dualities, T-duality of the compact boson CFT, and its realization in quantum spin chains. In the special case of the XX model, we uncover an exact lattice T-duality, which is associated with a non-invertible symmetry that exchanges two lattice U(1) symmetries. The latter symmetries flow to the momentum and winding U(1) symmetries with a mixed anomaly in the CFT. However, the charge operators of the two U(1) symmetries do not commute on the lattice and instead generate the Onsager algebra. We discuss how some of the anomalies in the CFT are nonetheless still exactly realized on the lattice and how the lattice U(1) symmetries enforce gaplessness. We further explore lattice deformations preserving both U(1) symmetries and find a rich gapless phase diagram with special $\mathrm{Spin}(2k)_1$ WZW model points and whose phase transitions all have dynamical exponent ${z>1}$.

Title: The Smearing of Quasi-Particles: Signatures in the Entanglement Entropy of Excited Many-Particle Systems
Authors: Jagannath Sutradhar, Jonathan Ruhman, Avraham Klein, Dimitri Gutman, Richard Berkovits
Abstract: The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.

Title: Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams
Authors: Huan Wang, Shangguo Zhu, Yun Long, Mingbo Pu, Xiangang Luo
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.

Title: Non-self-adjoint Dirac operators on graphs
Authors: Markus Holzmann, Václav Růžek, Matěj Tušek
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study generally non-self-adjoint realizations of the Dirac operator on an arbitrary finite metric graph. Employing the robust boundary triple framework, we derive, in particular, a variant of the Birman Schwinger principle for its eigenvalues, and with an example of a star shaped graph we show that the point spectrum may exhibit diverse behaviour. Subsequently, we find sufficient and necessary conditions on transmission conditions at the graph's vertices under which the Dirac operator on the graph is symmetric with respect to the parity, the time reversal, or the charge conjugation transformation.

Title: Tunable pairing with local spin-dependent Rydberg molecule potentials in an atomic Fermi superfluid
Authors: Chih-Chun Chien, Seth T. Rittenhouse, S. I. Mistakidis, H. R. Sadeghpour
Abstract: We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.

Title: Universality of Rényi Entropy in Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Yuya Kusuki, Hirosi Ooguri, Sridip Pal
Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th Rényi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.

Title: Harvesting Information Across the Horizon
Authors: S. Wang, M. R. Preciado Rivas, R. B. Mann
Abstract: The effect of black holes on entanglement harvesting has been of considerable interest over the past decade. Research involving stationary Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors near a (2+1)-dimensional Bañados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has uncovered phenomena such as entanglement shadows, entanglement amplification through black hole rotation, and differences between bipartite and tripartite entanglement. For a (1+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, it has been shown that two infalling UDW detectors can harvest entanglement from the scalar quantum vacuum even when separated by an event horizon. In this paper, we calculate the mutual information between two UDW detectors coupled to a massless quantum scalar field, with the detectors starting at rest and falling radially into a non-rotating (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. The trajectory of the detectors includes regions where both detectors are switched on outside of the horizon; where one detector is switched on inside of the horizon while the other switches on outside; and where both detectors switch on inside of the horizon. We investigate different black hole masses, detector energy gaps, widths and temporal separations of the detector switching functions, and field boundary conditions. We find that black holes--even the simplest kind having constant curvature--significantly affect the correlation properties of quantum fields in the vacuum state. These correlations, both outside and inside the horizon, can be mapped out by infalling detectors.

Title: Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors

Abstract: SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the electron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K. TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.
