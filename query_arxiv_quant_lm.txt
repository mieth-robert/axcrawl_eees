Title: A Generalization of the Parametric Amplifier with Dunkl Derivative: Spectral and Statistical Properties
Authors: D. Ojeda Guillén, R. D. Mota, J. C. Vega
Abstract: We study the parametric amplifier Hamiltonian within the framework of the Dunkl formalism. We introduce the Dunkl creation and annihilation operators and show that their quadratic combinations generate an $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. The spectral problem is solved exactly using two algebraic methods: the $su(1,1)$ tilting transformation and the generalized Bogoliubov transformation. The exact energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of the Dunkl number coherent states. Furthermore, we compute the Mandel $Q$ parameter and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ to analyze the statistical properties of the Dunkl squeezed states. We show that, for the squeezed vacuum, the Mandel parameter remains independent of the Dunkl deformation, whereas the correlation function exhibits an explicit dependence on the Dunkl parameter $\mu$, which modifies the photon bunching effects. Finally, we show that our results reduce to the standard parametric amplifier case in the limit of vanishing Dunkl deformation parameter.

Title: Finite-Temperature Dynamical Phase Diagram of the $2+1$D Quantum Ising Model
Authors: Lucas Katschke, Roland C. Farrell, Umberto Borla, Lode Pollet, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Mapping finite-temperature dynamical phase diagrams of quantum many-body models is a necessary step towards establishing a framework of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body universality. However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation.

Title: Entropic Barriers and the Kinetic Suppression of Topological Defects
Authors: Yi-Lin Tsao, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: Many quantum phases, from topological orders to superfluids, are destabilized at finite temperature by the proliferation and motion of topological defects such as anyons or vortices. Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing.

Title: Controlling energy spectra and skin effect via boundary conditions in non-Hermitian lattices
Authors: S Rahul, Pasquale Marra
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique spectral properties, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, often influenced by boundary conditions. The modulation of these phenomena by generalized boundary conditions remains unexplored and not understood. Here, we analyze the Hatano-Nelson model with generalized boundary conditions induced by complex hopping amplitudes at the boundary. Using similarity transformations, we determine the conditions yielding real energy spectra and skin effect, and identify the emergence of exceptional points where spectra transition from real to complex. We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges. These findings reveal the sensitivity of spectral and localization properties to boundary conditions, providing a framework for engineering quantum lattice models with tailored spectral and localization features, with potential applications in quantum devices.

Title: Quantum Circuits as a Dynamical Resource to Learn Nonequilibrium Long-Range Order
Authors: Fabian Ballar Trigueros, Markus Heyl
Abstract: Equilibrium statistical ensembles impose stringent constraints on phases of quantum matter. For example, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits long-range order in low-dimensional systems beyond the ground state. Here, we show that quantum circuits can learn states of matter with long-range order that are inaccessible in equilibrium. We construct variational quantum circuits that generate symmetry-broken and symmetry-protected topological states with long-range order in one-dimensional systems at finite energy density, where equilibrium states are typically featureless. Importantly, the learned states can exhibit unconventional features with enhanced metrological properties such as a quantum Fisher information close to a GHZ state, but robust against local measurements. Our work establishes coherent quantum dynamics as a powerful resource for engineering nonequilibrium phases of matter, opening a path toward a broader dynamical scope of quantum order beyond the constraints of equilibrium ensembles.

Title: Neural Network Discovery of Paired Wigner Crystals in Artificial Graphene
Authors: Conor Smith, Yubo Yang, Zhou-Quan Wan, Yixiao Chen, Miguel A. Morales, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: Moiré systems have emerged as an exciting tunable platform for engineering and probing quantum matter. A large number of exotic states have been observed, stimulating intense efforts in experiment, theory, and simulation. Utilizing a neural-network-based quantum Monte Carlo approach, we discover a new ground state of the two-dimensional electron gas in a honeycomb moire potential at a filling factor of $\nu_m =1/4$ (one electron every four moiré minima). In this state, two opposite-spin electrons pair to form a singlet-like valence bond state which restores local $C_6$ symmetry in hexagonal molecules each spanning $6$ moiré minima. These molecules of pairs then form a molecular Wigner crystal, leaving one quarter of the moiré minima mostly depleted. The formation of such a paired Wigner crystal, absent any confining potential or attractive interaction to facilitate "pre-assembling" the molecule, provides a fascinating case of collective phenomena in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, and opportunities to engineer exotic properties.

Title: Dissipation as a Resource: Synchronization, Coherence Recovery, and Chaos Control
Authors: Debabrata Mondal, Lea F. Santos, S. Sinha
Abstract: Dissipation is commonly regarded as an obstacle to quantum control, as it induces decoherence and irreversibility. Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling.

Title: When Does Quantum Annealing Outperform Classical Methods? A Gradient Variance Framework
Authors: Vishwajeet Ohal, Pierre Boulanger
Abstract: Based on our experimental findings, we propose the following decision framework for practitioners. Quantum annealing is recommended when the problem formulation QUBO exhibits a high gradient variance (greater than 0.3) and the energy landscape contains numerous thin barriers characterized by sharp peaks and narrow valleys. Additionally, quantum approaches are particularly suitable when classical methods are observed to get trapped in local minima, the problem size is manageable given hardware constraints (less than 5000 variables for pure quantum annealing), and the time overhead of approximately 10 seconds is acceptable for the application. In contrast, classical methods are recommended when the gradient variance is low (less than 0.2), indicating smooth landscapes where quantum tunneling provides little advantage. Classical approaches are also preferable when the problem size is small and classical solvers can provide nearly instantaneous results, when solution quality requirements are modest and local optima suffice, or when hardware access or cost is a limiting factor. For problems that exceed pure quantum capacity but possess a favorable landscape structure, hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical techniques are recommended. Such hybrid methods are particularly effective when decomposition quality can be verified and both solution quality and scalability are important considerations.

Title: In situ calibration of microwave attenuation and gain using a cryogenic on-chip attenuator
Authors: Thomas Descamps, Linus Andersson, Vittorio Buccheri, Simon Sundelin, Mohammed Ali Aamir, Simone Gasparinetti
Abstract: Accurate in situ calibration of microwave attenuation and amplification-chain noise is essential for superconducting quantum circuits. We demonstrate a compact, self-calibrating cryogenic noise source based on an on-chip chromium attenuator that can be resistively heated with nanowatt-level power and directly integrated into a coaxial microwave line at the mixing-chamber stage. By comparing Johnson-Nyquist noise generated by Joule and microwave heating, measured through the amplification chain, the attenuation of the input line, and hence the gain of the chain, is determined without requiring knowledge of the attenuator temperature. The device exhibits millisecond-scale response times and negligible heating of the cryostat base plate. Using this approach, we determine the gain and added noise of a cryogenic amplification chain over the 4-8 GHz band. Our results provide a simple and accurate method to characterize near-quantum-limited parametric amplifiers used in superconducting-qubit readout.

Title: From superradiance to collective EIT in three-level ensembles
Authors: Hugo Sanchez, Luis F. A. da Silva, Mickel A. Ponte, Miled H. Y. Moussa, Norton G. de Almeida
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of a three-level ensemble under the Dicke limit, revealing a unified connection between superradiant emission and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Our results show that the transient superradiant burst exhibits the expected peak intensity scaling $I_{\max}\!\sim\! N^2$, with a universal finite-size correction $|\xi(N)-2|\!\sim\! 1/\ln N$ that governs the apparent scaling exponent in realistic ensembles. In the stationary regime, collective broadening modifies the EIT response: although it typically enhances absorption, it counterintuitively increases the group velocity, leading to a relative scaling $v_g\!\propto\! N^2$, even while $v_g\!\ll\! c$. This effect suggests that cooperative interactions fundamentally limit the achievable slow-light delay in dense media. To achieve these results, we derive a representative-atom master equation that quantitatively reproduces both the superradiant and EIT regimes, in excellent agreement with the exact symmetric-subspace dynamics and correctly incorporating collective feedback and $N$-dependent broadening. This unified framework bridges transient superradiant emission and steady-state quantum interference, with direct implications for slow light, quantum memories, and precision metrology.

Title: Free Quantum Computing
Authors: Jacques Carette, Chris Heunen, Robin Kaarsgaard, Neil J. Ross, Amr Sabry
Abstract: Quantum computing improves substantially on known classical algorithms for various important problems, but the nature of the relationship between quantum and classical computing is not yet fully understood. This relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing and no more. Here we develop an axiomatisation of quantum computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimisation, including brute force computer search, to optimise quantum computations. The free model may be interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model, but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning.

Title: Adaptive Aborting Schemes for Quantum Error Correction Decoding
Authors: Sanidhay Bhambay, Prakash Murali, Neil Walton, Thirupathaiah Vasantam
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Current QEC controllers execute all scheduled syndrome (parity-bit) measurement rounds before decoding, even when early syndrome data indicates that the run will result in an error. The resulting excess measurements increase the decoder's workload and system latency. To address this, we introduce an adaptive abort module that simultaneously reduces decoder overhead and suppresses logical error rates in surface codes and color codes under an existing QEC controller. The key idea is that initial syndrome information allows the controller to terminate risky shots early before additional resources are spent. An effective scheme balances the cost of further measurement against the restart cost and thus increases decoder efficiency. Adaptive abort schemes dynamically adjust the number of syndrome measurement rounds per shot using real-time syndrome information. We consider three schemes: fixed-depth (FD) decoding (the standard non-adaptive approach used in current state-of-the-art QEC controllers), and two adaptive schemes, AdAbort and One-Step Lookahead (OSLA) decoding. For surface and color codes under a realistic circuit-level depolarizing noise model, AdAbort substantially outperforms both OSLA and FD, yielding higher decoder efficiency across a broad range of code distances. Numerically, as the code distance increases from 5 to 15, AdAbort yields an improvement that increases from 5% to 35% for surface codes and from 7% to 60% for color codes. To our knowledge, these are the first adaptive abort schemes considered for QEC. Our results highlight the potential importance of abort rules for increasing efficiency as we scale to large, resource-intensive quantum architectures.

Title: Fault-tolerant interfaces for quantum LDPC codes
Authors: Matthias Christandl, Omar Fawzi, Ashutosh Goswami
Abstract: The preparation of a quantum state using a noisy quantum computer (gate noise strength $\delta$), will necessarily affect an O($\delta$)-fraction of the qubits, no matter which protocol is used. Here, we show that fault-tolerant quantum state preparation can be achieved with constant space overhead improving on previous constructions requiring polylogarithmic overhead. To achieve this, we add to the toolbox of fault-tolerant schemes for circuits with quantum input and output. More specifically, we construct fault-tolerant interfaces that decrease the level of protection for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. When information is encoded in multiple code blocks, our interfaces have constant space overhead. In our decoder construction that change the level of protection by an arbitrary amount, we circumvent bottlenecks to error pileup and overhead by gradual lowering of the level of encoding at the same time as we increase the number of blocks on which decoding is carried out simultaneously.

Title: Retrieving the Baby: Reichenbach's Principle, Bell Locality, and Selection Bias
Authors: Huw Price
Abstract: In his late piece 'La nouvelle cuisine' (Bell 1990), John Bell describes the steps from an intuitive, informal principle of locality to a mathematical rule called Factorizability. This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias.

Title: Weak-Value Amplification for Longitudinal Phase Measurements Approaching the Shot-Noise Limit Characterized by Allan Variance
Authors: Jing-Hui Huang, Xiang-Yun Hu
Abstract: We report a quantitative evaluation of weak-value amplification (WVA) for longitudinal phase measurements using Allan variance analysis. Building on a recent double-slit interferometry experiment with real weak values [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 080802 (2025)], our Allan variance analysis demonstrates measurement of a few attosecond time delay approaching the shot noise limit at short averaging intervals of $T$ = $0.01-0.1$ s, representing two orders of magnitude variance reduction compared to the $T=300$ s operating point in prior implementations. We demonstrate that the Allan-variance noise floor scales with the inverse of the detected photon number $1/N_r$, confirming shot-noise-limited operation with WVA. Furthermore, this $1/N_r$ scaling experimentally validates that WVA can outperform conventional measurement under fixed detected photon number and detector saturation, in the presence of technical noise, as theoretically predicted [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 070802 (2017)]. Our results provide rigorous, quantitative evidence of the near-optimal noise performance achievable with WVA, establishing a new benchmark for precision optical metrology. This advancement is particularly relevant to applications such as gravitational-wave detection, where signals predominantly occupy the high-frequency regime ($>10$ Hz).

Title: Quantum-Channel Matrix Optimization for Holevo Bound Enhancement
Authors: Hong Niu, Chau Yuen, Alexei Ashikhmin, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Quantum communication holds the potential to revolutionize information transmission by enabling secure data exchange that exceeds the limits of classical systems. One of the key performance metrics in quantum information theory, namely the Holevo bound, quantifies the amount of classical information that can be transmitted reliably over a quantum channel. However, computing and optimizing the Holevo bound remains a challenging task due to its dependence on both the quantum input ensemble and the quantum channel. In order to maximize the Holevo bound, we propose a unified projected gradient ascent algorithm to optimize the quantum channel given a fixed input ensemble. We provide a detailed complexity analysis for the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantum channel optimization yields higher Holevo bounds than input ensemble optimization.

Title: Mesoscopic Spin Coherence in a Disordered Dark Electron Spin Ensemble
Authors: Taewoong Yoon, Sangwon Oh, Junghyun Lee, Hyunyong Choi
Abstract: Harnessing dipolar spin environments as controllable quantum resources is a central challenge in solid-state quantum technologies. Here, we report the observation of a coherent mesoscopic spin state in a disordered ensemble of substitutional nitrogen (P1) centers in diamond. An iterative Hartmann-Hahn protocol transfers polarization from dense nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to a P1 ensemble, yielding a 740-fold enhancement over room-temperature thermal equilibrium as revealed by differential readout. The resulting mesoscopic P1 spin ensemble exhibits collective Rabi oscillations and long-lived spin-lock and Hahn-echo coherences. We identify a crossover in the saturation polarization arising from the competition between coherent driving and local disorder, providing a quantitative measure of the system's intrinsic disorder. These results establish a foundation for utilizing dark electron spin ensembles as robust resources for quantum sensing and quantum many-body simulation.

Title: Boosting the Performance of a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Quantum Battery via Symmetry-Breaking Quenches and Bosonic Baths
Authors: Le Bin Ho, Duc Tuan Hoang, Tran Duong Anh-Tai, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty
Abstract: We explore the operation of quantum batteries in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, when they are charged either through a sudden quench in the magnetic field strength or by coupling them to a bosonic oscillator bath. Through initializing the battery in either the symmetric or broken symmetry phases of the LMG model we analyze how the different spectral properties can affect the performance of both the charging and discharging of the battery. In particular, we show that by quenching the magnetic field strength from the symmetric phase to the broken phase, we can achieve a significant enhancement in stored energy, as well as stable and efficient ergotropy extraction. Similar observations can be made when introducing weak coupling between the battery with the bosonic bath, while the amount of stored work and ergotropy saturate at strong coupling. These findings emphasize the importance of the magnetic field dynamics and environmental coupling in optimizing charging performance, which could lead to practical applications in quantum energy storage.

Title: Phonon-enhanced strain sensitivity of quantum dots in two-dimensional semiconductors
Authors: Sumitra Shit, Yunus Waheed, Jithin Thoppil Surendran, Indrajeet Dhananjay Prasad, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Santosh Kumar
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors have attracted considerable interest for integration into emerging quantum photonic networks. Strain engineering of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) enables the tuning of light-matter interactions and associated optoelectronic properties, and generates new functionalities, including the formation of quantum dots (QDs). Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($\mu$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device. Compared with delocalized excitons, QDs in both materials exhibit enhanced strain sensitivities of their emission energies $-$ approximately fourfold in WS$_2$ and twofold in WSe$_2$ $-$ leading to pronounced broadening of the ensemble emission linewidth. Temperature-dependent $\mu$-PL spectroscopy combined with dynamic strain tuning experiments further reveal that the enhanced strain sensitivity of individual QDs originates from strengthened interactions with low-energy phonons induced by quantum confinement. Our results demonstrate a versatile strain-engineering approach with potential for spectral matching across solid-state, atomic, and hybrid quantum photonic networks, and provide new insights into phonon-QD interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors.

Title: Extending quantum theory with AI-assisted deterministic game theory
Authors: Florian Pauschitz, Ben Moseley, Ghislain Fourny
Abstract: We present an AI-assisted framework for predicting individual runs of complex quantum experiments, including contextuality and causality (adaptive measurements), within our long-term programme of discovering a local hidden-variable theory that extends quantum theory. In order to circumvent impossibility theorems, we replace the assumption of free choice (measurement independence and parameter independence) with a weaker, compatibilistic version called contingent free choice. Our framework is based on interpreting complex quantum experiments as a Chess-like game between observers and the universe, which is seen as an economic agent minimizing action. The game structures corresponding to generic experiments such as fixed-causal-order process matrices or causal contextuality scenarios, together with a deterministic non-Nashian resolution algorithm that abandons unilateral deviation assumptions (free choice) and assumes Perfect Prediction instead, were described in previous work. In this new research, we learn the reward functions of the game, which contain a hidden variable, using neural networks. The cost function is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the frequency histograms obtained through many deterministic runs of the game and the predictions of the extended Born rule. Using our framework on the specific case of the EPR 2-2-2 experiment acts as a proof-of-concept and a toy local-realist hidden-variable model that non-Nashian quantum theory is a promising avenue towards a local hidden-variable theory. Our framework constitutes a solid foundation, which can be further expanded in order to fully discover a complete quantum theory.

Title: Quantum key distribution over a metropolitan network using an integrated photonics based prototype
Authors: Maria Ana Pereira, Giulio Gualandi, Rebecka Sax, Alberto Boaron, Raphaël Houlmann, Roberto Osellame, Rob Thew, Hugo Zbinden
Abstract: An industrial-scale adoption of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) requires the development of practical, stable, resilient and cost-effective hardware that can be manufactured at large scales. In this work we present a high-speed (1.25GHz), field-deployable QKD prototype based on integrated photonics, that is consolidated into standard 19-inch rack compatible units. Through integrated photonics, the system prioritizes autonomous long-term stability in metropolitan settings. The architecture is further simplified by removing the need for chromatic dispersion compensation over metropolitan distances (below 100km). We demonstrate continuous key exchange over more than 4 km of metropolitan optical fiber, where the prototype maintained stable, uninterrupted operation across a measurement spanning more than 12 day-night cycles without manual intervention.

Title: Near-single-domain superconducting aluminum films on GaAs(111)A with exceptional crystalline quality for scalable quantum circuits
Authors: Hsien-Wen Wan, Yi-Ting Cheng, Chao-Kai Cheng, Jui-Min Chia, Chien-Ting Wu, Sheng-Shiuan Yeh, Chia-Hung Hsu, Jueinai Kwo, Minghwei Hong
Abstract: We have reproducibly grown near-single-domain superconducting aluminum (Al) films on GaAs(111)A wafers using molecular beam epitaxy. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed twin-domain ratios of 0.00005 and 0.0003 for 19.4-nm- and 9.6-nm-thick films, respectively-the lowest reported for Al on any substrate and long considered unattainable for practical device platforms. Azimuthal scans across off-normal Al{$11\bar{1}$} reflections exhibit narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values down to $0.55^\circ$, unmatched by epi-Al grown by any other method. Normal scans showed a well-defined (111) orientation with pronounced Pendellösung fringes, and $\theta$-rocking-curve FWHM values down to $0.018^\circ$; the former indicates abrupt film-substrate and oxide-film interfaces. Electron backscatter diffraction mapping confirms macroscopic in-plane uniformity and the absence of $\Sigma$3 twin domains. Atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed atomically smooth surfaces and abrupt heterointerfaces. The films exhibit critical temperatures approaching bulk values, establishing a materials platform for scalable, high-coherence superconducting qubits.

Title: Quantum Scrambling Born Machine
Authors: Marcin Płodzień
Abstract: Quantum generative modeling, where the Born rule naturally defines probability distributions through measurement of parameterized quantum states, is a promising near-term application of quantum computing. We propose a Quantum Scrambling Born Machine in which a fixed entangling unitary -- acting as a scrambling reservoir -- provides multi-qubit entanglement, while only single-qubit rotations are optimized. We consider three entangling unitaries -- a Haar random unitary and two physically realizable approximations, a finite-depth brickwork random circuit and analog time evolution under nearest-neighbor spin-chain Hamiltonians -- and show that, for the benchmark distributions and system sizes considered, once the entangler produces near-Haar-typical entanglement the model learns the target distribution with weak sensitivity to the scrambler's microscopic origin. Finally, promoting the Hamiltonian couplings to trainable parameters casts the generative task as a variational Hamiltonian problem, with performance competitive with representative classical generative models at matched parameter count.

Title: A rigorous hybridization of variational quantum eigensolver and classical neural network
Authors: Minwoo Kim, Kyoung Keun Park, Kyungmin Lee, Jeongho Bang, Taehyun Kim
Abstract: Neural post-processing has been proposed as a lightweight route to enhance variational quantum eigensolvers by learning how to reweight measurement outcomes. In this work, we identify three general desiderata for such data-driven neural post-processing -- (i) self-contained training without prior knowledge, (ii) polynomial resources, and (iii) variational consistency -- and show that current approaches, such as diagonal non-unitary post-processing (DNP), cannot satisfy these requirements simultaneously. The obstruction is intrinsic: with finite sampling, normalization becomes a statistical bottleneck, and support mismatch between numerator and denominator estimators can render the empirical objective ill-conditioned and even sub-variational. Moreover, to reproduce the ground state with constant-depth ansatzes or with linear-depth circuits forming unitary 2-designs, the required reweighting range (and hence the sampling cost) grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Motivated by this no-go result, we develop a normalization-free alternative, the unitary variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (U-VQNHE). U-VQNHE retains the practical appeal of a learnable diagonal post-processing layer while guaranteeing variational safety, and numerical experiments on transverse-field Ising models demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness over both VQE and DNP-based variants.

Title: Optimal speed-up of multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols
Authors: Marco Peluso, Reinhold Egger, Andrea Nava
Abstract: The classical Mpemba effect is the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter water freezes faster than colder water due to the breakdown of Newton's law of cooling after a sudden temperature quench. The genuine nonequilibrium post-quench dynamics allows the system to evolve along effective shortcuts absent in the quasi-static regime. When the time needed for preparing the (classical or quantum) system in the hotter initial state is included, we encounter so-called Pontus-Mpemba effects. We here investigate multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols for open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by time-inhomogeneous Lindblad master equations. In the limit of infinitely many steps, one arrives at continuous Pontus-Mpemba protocols. We study the crossover between the quasi-static and the sudden-quench regime, showing the presence of dynamically generated shortcuts achieved for time-dependent dissipation rates. Time-dependent rates can also cause non-Markovian behavior, highlighting the existence of rich dynamical regimes accessible beyond the Markovian framework.

Title: Two-dimensional quantum lattice gas algorithm for anisotropic Burger-like equations
Authors: Niccoló Fonio, Pierre Sagaut, Giuseppe Di Molfetta
Abstract: Building on hybrid quantum lattice gas algorithm, we revisit the possibilities of this quantum lattice model. By deriving a correction to the predicted viscosity, we provide analytical and numerical results that refine original formulation. We introduce a minimal 2D generalization of the algorithm, which allows to simulate anisotropic Burgerlike equations while retaining only two lattice velocities. This approach opens a promising route toward embedding momentum conservation and advancing toward NavierStokes dynamics in 2D, going beyond Frisch, Hasslacher and Pomeau (FHP) with a quantum native model.

Title: Near-perfect quantum teleportation between continuous and discrete encodings
Authors: Ravi Kamal Pandey, Shraddha Singh, Dhiraj Yadav, Devendra Kumar Mishra
Abstract: Quantum teleportation between polarized single-photon and phase-opposite coherent states is studied using a hybrid entangled resource and entangled coherent states. The polarized single-photon qubit represents a discrete-variable (DV) quantum system, whereas the phase-opposite coherent-state qubit constitutes a continuous-variable (CV) system. While teleportation from CV to DV can be achieved with near-unit success probability, the reverse process is usually limited to a maximum success probability of $1/2$. We demonstrate that, by employing cross-Kerr nonlinearity together with passive linear optical components such as polarizing beam splitters, beam splitters, and phase shifters, almost perfect teleportation from DV to CV encodings can also be achieved.

Title: Dissipative charging of tight-binding quantum batteries
Authors: Mingdi Xu, Yiming Liu, Yefeng Song, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan
Abstract: We investigate autonomous dissipative charging mechanisms for lattice quantum batteries within the framework of open quantum systems. Focusing on engineered Markovian dissipation, we show that appropriately designed Lindblad jump operators can drive tight-binding systems into highly excited band-edge states, resulting in steady states with large ergotropy. We illustrate this mechanism in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain and in a two-dimensional graphene lattice. We find that disorder enhances the charging power, indicating that dissipation-assisted localization effects can be beneficial for energy storage. Moreover, the dissipative charging process remains robust against additional local dephasing noise. Our results establish bond dissipation as an effective and physically transparent mechanism for charging lattice quantum batteries in realistic open-system settings.

Abstract: The characterization of collective behavior and nonequilibrium phase transitions in quantum systems is typically rooted in the analysis of suitable system observables, so-called order parameters. These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system. Experimentally, this can be particularly demanding as estimating quantum states and expectation values of quantum observables requires a large number of projective measurements. However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems. We benchmark our method using the quantum contact process, a model featuring an absorbing-state phase transition, which constitutes a particularly challenging test case for the quantum simulation of nonequilibrium processes.

Title: Superiority of Krylov shadow tomography in estimating quantum Fisher information: From bounds to exactness
Authors: Yuan-Hao Wang, Da-Jian Zhang
Abstract: Estimating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a crucial yet challenging task with widespread applications across quantum science and technologies. The recently proposed Krylov shadow tomography (KST) opens a new avenue for this task by introducing a series of Krylov bounds on the QFI. In this work, we address the practical applicability of the KST, unveiling that the Krylov bounds of low orders already enable efficient and accurate estimation of the QFI. We show that the Krylov bounds converge to the QFI exponentially fast with increasing order and can surpass the state-of-the-art polynomial lower bounds known to date. Moreover, we show that certain low-order Krylov bound can already match the QFI exactly for low-rank states prevalent in practical settings. Such exact match is beyond the reach of polynomial lower bounds proposed previously. These theoretical findings, solidified by extensive numerical simulations, demonstrate practical advantages over existing polynomial approaches, holding promise for fully unlocking the effectiveness of QFI-based applications.

Title: Experimental certification of ensembles of high-dimensional quantum states with independent quantum devices
Authors: Yong-Nan Sun, Meng-Yun Ma, Qi-Ping Su, Zhe Sun, Chui-Ping Yang, Franco Nori
Abstract: When increasing the dimensionality of quantum systems, high-dimensional quantum state certification becomes important in quantum information science and technology. However, how to certify ensembles of high-dimensional quantum states in a black-box scenario remains a challenging task. In this work, we report an experimental test of certifying ensembles of high-dimensional quantum states based on prepare-and-measure experiments with \textit{independent devices}, where the state preparation device and the measurement device have no shared randomness. In our experiment, the prepared quantum states are high-dimensional orbital angular momentum states of single photons, and both the preparation fidelity and the measurement fidelity are about 99.0$\%$ for the six-dimensional quantum states. We also measure the crosstalk matrices and calculate the similarity parameter for up to ten dimensions. We not only experimentally certify the ensemble of high-dimensional quantum states in a semi-device-independent manner, but also experimentally investigate the effect of atmospheric turbulent noise on high-dimensional quantum state certification. Our experimental results clearly show that the certification of high-dimensional quantum states can still be achieved even under the influence of atmospheric turbulent noise. Our findings have potential implications in quantum certification and quantum random number generation.

Title: Organic molecules as single-photon sources
Authors: Alexey Shkarin, Stephan Götzinger
Abstract: The development of single-photon sources has been nothing but rapid in recent years, with quantum emitter-based systems showing especially impressive progress. In this article, we give an overview of the developments in single-photon sources based on single molecules. We will introduce polycyclic hydrocarbons as the most commonly used emitter systems for the realization of an organic solid-state single-photon source. At cryogenic temperatures this special class of fluorescent molecules demonstrates remarkable optical properties such as negligible dephasing, indefinite photostability, and high photon rates, which make them attractive as fundamental building blocks in emerging quantum technologies. To better understand the general properties and limitations of these molecules, we discuss sample preparation, light collection strategies and relevant emitter parameters such as absorption and emission spectra, lifetime, and dephasing. We will also give an overview of light extraction strategies as a crucial part of a single-photon source. Finally, we conclude with a look into the future, displaying current challenges and possible solutions.

Title: Tight any-shot quantum decoupling
Authors: Mario Berta, Hao-Chung Cheng, Yongsheng Yao
Abstract: Quantum information decoupling is a fundamental primitive in quantum information theory, underlying various applications in quantum physics. We prove a novel one-shot decoupling theorem formulated in terms of quantum relative entropy distance, with the decoupling error bounded by two sandwiched Rényi conditional entropies. In the asymptotic i.i.d. setting of standard information decoupling via partial trace, we show that this bound is ensemble-tight in quantum relative entropy distance and thereby yields a characterization of the associated decoupling error exponent in the low-cost-rate regime. Leveraging this framework, we derive several operational applications formulated in terms of purified distance: (i) a single-letter expression for the exact error exponent of quantum state merging in terms of Petz-Rényi conditional entropies, and (ii) regularized expressions for the achievable error exponent of entanglement distillation and quantum channel coding in terms of Petz-Rényi coherent informations. We further prove that these achievable bounds are tight for maximally correlated states and generalized dephasing channels, respectively, for the high distillation-rate/coding-rate regimes.

Title: Fault-tolerant preparation of arbitrary logical states in the cat code
Authors: Zi-Jie Chen, Weizhou Cai, Liang-Xu Xie, Qing-Xuan Jie, Xu-Bo Zou, Guang-Can Guo, Luyan Sun, Chang-Ling Zou
Abstract: Preparing high-fidelity logical states is a central challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing, yet existing approaches struggle to balance control complexity against resource overhead. Here, we present a complete framework for the fault-tolerant preparation of arbitrary logical states encoded in the four-legged cat code. This framework is engineered to suppress the dominant incoherent errors, including excitation decay and dephasing in both the bosonic mode and the ancilla via error detection. Numerical simulations with experimentally realistic parameters on a 3D superconducting cavity platform yield logical infidelities on the order of $10^{-4}$. A scaling analysis confirms that the logical error rate grows nearly quadratically with the physical error rate, confirming that all first-order errors are fully suppressed. Our protocol is compatible with current hardware and is scalable to multiple bosonic modes, providing a resource-efficient foundation for magic state preparation and higher-level concatenated quantum error correction.

Title: Global bifurcations and basin geometry of the nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect
Authors: Heng Lin, Yunyao Qi, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: We study a continuum Hatano--Nelson model with a saturating nonlinear nonreciprocity and analyze its stationary states via the associated phase-space flow. We uncover a global scenario controlled by a subcritical Hopf bifurcation and a saddle-node of limit cycles, which together generate a finite coexistence window. In this window, skin modes and extended states are both stable at a fixed energy $E$, separated by a nonlinear basin separatrix in phase space rather than a spectral (mobility-edge) mechanism in a linear system. An averaged amplitude equation yields closed-form predictions for the limit-cycle branches and the SNLC threshold. Building on the basin geometry, we introduce a basin-fraction order parameter that exhibits a first-order-like jump at SNLC. Intriguing physical phenomena in the coexistence window are also revealed, such as separatrix-induced long-lived spatial transients and hysteresis. Overall, our findings highlight that, beyond linear spectral concepts, global attractor-basin geometry provides a powerful and complementary lens for understanding stationary states in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.

Title: A Programmable Linear Optical Quantum Reservoir with Measurement Feedback for Time Series Analysis
Authors: Çağın Ekici
Abstract: Feedback-driven quantum reservoir computing has so far been studied primarily in gate-based architectures, motivating alternative scalable, hardware-friendly physical platforms. Here we investigate a linear-optical quantum reservoir architecture for time-series processing based on multiphoton interference in a reconfigurable interferometer network equipped with threshold detectors and measurement-conditioned feedback. The reservoir state is constructed from coarse-grained coincidence features, and the feedback updates only a structured, budgeted subset of programmable phases, enabling recurrence without training internal weights. By sweeping the feedback strength, we identify three dynamical regimes and find that memory performance peaks near the stability boundary. We quantify temporal processing via linear memory capacity and validate nonlinear forecasting on benchmarks, namely Mackey-Glass series, NARMA$-n$ and non-integrable Ising dynamics. The proposed architecture is compatible with current photonic technology and lowers the experimental barrier to feedback-driven QRC for time-series analysis with competitive accuracy.

Title: Single-Photon Motion in a Two-Dimensional Plane: Confinement and Boundary Escape
Authors: Hui-hui Miao
Abstract: This paper investigates the motion of a single photon in a two-dimensional plane under closed and open boundary conditions. We employ two methods to construct the Hilbert space: Method A, based on the standard second-quantization formalism, and Method B, based on a non-standard approach. By eliminating redundant quantum states, we obtain a reduced Hilbert space with significantly lower dimensionality, thereby improving the efficiency of numerical simulations. In a closed system, the two methods are equivalent, and their unitary evolution results are identical. The probability distribution diffuses outward from the center and exhibits a significant rebound after reaching the boundary. In an open system, Method B, by incorporating more dissipation channels, provides a more accurate description of the photon escape process at the boundary. The probability curves obtained from the two methods completely overlap before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, a slight difference appears, but this difference does not amplify with evolution and tends to converge in the later stage. Method B yields a slightly higher dissipative-state probability, indicating that the photon escapes faster. Visualization of the two-dimensional probability distribution shows that the three scenarios (closed system, open system with Method A, and open system with Method B) exhibit identical probability distributions before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, the open systems exhibit significant probability loss, which increases rapidly with evolution. The probability distribution patterns of the two open systems are highly similar, exhibiting synchronized evolution.

Title: Modelling quantum measurements without superposition
Authors: Gabriele Cobucci, Alexander Bernal, Roope Uola, Armin Tavakoli
Abstract: Superposition is the core feature that sets quantum theory apart from classical physics. Here, we investigate whether sets of quantum measurements can be modelled by using only devices that are operationally classical, in the sense that they have no superposition properties. This leads us to propose classical measurement models, which we show to be stronger than commutative measurements but weaker than joint measurability. We determine both the exact depolarisation noise rate and the measurement loss rate at which the all projective measurements in $d$-dimensional quantum theory admit a classical model. For finite sets of quantum measurements we develop methods both for constructing classical models and for falsifying the existence of such model via prepare-and-measure setups. Furthermore, we show that this concept also has operational implications. For that, we consider whether quantum measurements with classical side-information can be implemented in sequence without causing a disturbance and we show that classical models imply an affirmative answer. Our work sheds light on superposition as a resource for quantum measurement devices.

Title: Pauli Correlation Encoding for Budget-Contraint Optimization
Authors: Jacobo Padín Martínez, Vicente P. Soloviev, Alejandro Borrallo Rentero, Antón Rodríguez Otero, Raquel Alfonso Rodríguez, Michal Krompiec
Abstract: Quantum optimization has gained increasing attention as advances in quantum hardware enable the exploration of problem instances approaching real-world scale. Among existing approaches, variational quantum algorithms and quantum annealing dominate current research; however, both typically rely on one-hot encodings that severely limit scalability. Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) was recently introduced as an alternative paradigm that reduces qubit requirements by embedding problem variables into Pauli correlations. Despite its promise, PCE has not yet been studied in the context of constrained optimization. In this work, we extend the PCE framework to constrained combinatorial optimization problems and evaluate its performance across multiple problem sizes. Our results show that the standard PCE formulation struggles to reliably enforce constraints, which motivates the introduction of the Iterative-$\alpha$ PCE. This iterative strategy significantly improves solution quality, achieving consistent constraint satisfaction while yielding better cut sizes across a wide range of instances. These findings highlight both the limitations of current PCE formulations for constrained problems and the effectiveness of iterative strategies for advancing quantum optimization in the NISQ era.

Title: Phase transitions in quasi-Hermitian quantum models at exceptional points of order four
Authors: Miloslav Znojil
Abstract: Quantum phase transition is interpreted as an evolution, at the end of which a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian $H(g)$ loses its observability. In the language of mathematics, such a quantum catastrophe occurs at an exceptional point of order $N$ (EPN). Although the Hamiltonian $H(g)$ itself becomes unphysical in the limit of $g \to g^{EPN}$, it is shown that it can play the role of an unperturbed operator in a perturbation-approximation analysis of the vicinity of the EPN singularity. Such an analysis is elementary at $N\leq 3$ and numerical at $N\geq 5$, so we pick up $N=4$. We demonstrate that the specific EP4 degeneracy becomes accessible via a unitary evolution process realizable inside a parametric domain ${\cal D}_{\rm physical}$, the boundaries of which are determined non-numerically. Possible relevance of such a mathematical result in the context of non-Hermitian photonics is emphasized.

Title: Efficiency of classical simulations of a noisy Grover algorithm
Authors: Raphaël Menu, Johannes Schachenmayer
Abstract: We analyze the modification of entanglement dynamics in the Grover algorithm when the qubits are subjected to single-qubit amplitude-damping or phase-flip noise. We compare quantum trajectories with full density-matrix simulations, analyzing the dynamics of averaged trajectory entanglement (TE) and operator entanglement (OE), in the respective state representation. Although not a genuine entanglement measure, both TE and OE are connected to the efficiency of matrix product state simulations and thus of fundamental interest. As in many quantum algorithms, at the end of the Grover circuit entanglement decreases as the system converges towards the target product state. While we find that this is well captured in the OE dynamics, quantum trajectories rarely follow paths of reducing entanglement. Optimized unraveling schemes can lower TE slightly, however we show that deep in the circuit OE is generally smaller than TE. This implies that matrix product density operator (MPDO) simulations of quantum circuits can in general be more efficient than quantum trajectories. In addition, we investigate the noise-rate scaling of success probabilities for both amplitude-damping and phase-flip noise in Grover's algorithm.

Title: Subluminal and superluminal velocities of free-space photons
Authors: Konstantin Y. Bliokh
Abstract: We consider rectilinear free-space propagation of electromagnetic wavepackets using electromagnetic field theory, scalar wavepacket propagation, and quantum-mechanical formalism. We demonstrate that spatially localized wavepackets are inherently characterized by a subluminal group velocity and a superluminal phase velocity, whose product equals $c^2$. These velocities are also known as the 'energy' and 'momentum' velocities, introduced by K. Milton and J. Schwinger. We illustrate general conclusions by explicit calculations for Gaussian beams and wavepackets, and also highlight subtleties of the quantum-mechanical description based on the 'photon wavefunction'.

Title: States that grow linearly in time, exceptional points, and zero norm states in the simple harmonic oscillator
Authors: Philip D. Mannheim
Abstract: The simple harmonic oscillator has a well-known normalizable, positive energy, bound state spectrum. We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector. This thus not quite so simple harmonic oscillator provides an explicit realization of our general contention that antilinearity is more basic to quantum theory than Hermiticity.

Title: Quantum Advantage for Sensing Properties of Classical Fields
Authors: Jordan Cotler, Daine L. Danielson, Ishaan Kannan
Abstract: Modern precision experiments often probe unknown classical fields with bosonic sensors in quantum-noise-limited regimes where vacuum fluctuations limit conventional readout. We introduce Quantum Signal Learning (QSL), a sensing framework that extends metrology to a broader property-learning setting, and propose a quantum-enhanced protocol that simultaneously estimates many properties of a classical signal with shot noise suppressed below the vacuum level. Our scheme requires only two-mode squeezing, passive optics, and static homodyne measurements, and enables post-hoc classical estimation of many properties from the same experimental dataset. We prove that our protocol enables a quantum speedup for common classical sensing tasks, including measuring electromagnetic correlations, real-time feedback control of interferometric cavities, and Fourier-domain matched filtering. To establish these separations, we introduce an optimal-transport conditioning method, and show both worst-case exponential separations from all entanglement-free strategies and practical speedups over homodyne and heterodyne baselines. We further show that when squeezing is treated as a resource, a protocol with squeezed light can sense a structured classical background exponentially faster than any coherent classical probe.

Title: Phase-sensitive representation of Majorana stabilizer states
Authors: Tomislav Begušić, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: Stabilizer states hold a special place in quantum information science due to their connection with quantum error correction and quantum circuit simulation. In the context of classical simulations of many-body physics, they are an example of states that can be both highly entangled and efficiently represented and transformed under Clifford operators. Recently, Clifford operators have been discussed in the context of fermionic quantum computation through their extension, the Majorana Clifford group. Here, we document the phase-sensitive form of the corresponding Majorana stabilizer states, as well as the algorithms for computing their amplitudes, their inner products, and update rules for transforming Majorana stabilizer states under Majorana Clifford gates.

Title: Scalable, self-verifying variational quantum eigensolver using adiabatic warm starts
Authors: Bojan Žunkovič, Marco Ballarin, Lewis Wright, Michael Lubasch
Abstract: We study an adiabatic variant of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) in which VQE is performed iteratively for a sequence of Hamiltonians along an adiabatic path. We derive the conditions under which gradient-based optimization successfully prepares the adiabatic ground states. These conditions show that the barren plateau problem and local optima can be avoided. Additionally, we propose using energy-standard-deviation measurements at runtime to certify eigenstate accuracy and verify convergence to the global optimum.

Title: A Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Jona Erle, Balint Koczor
Abstract: While ground-state preparation is expected to be a primary application of quantum computers, it is also an essential subroutine for many fault-tolerant algorithms. In early fault-tolerant regimes, logical measurements remain costly, motivating adaptive, shot-frugal state-preparation strategies that efficiently utilize each measurement. We introduce the Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver (SEGQE) as a greedy, shadow-assisted framework for measurement-efficient ground-state preparation. SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates. Together, our empirical scaling laws and rigorous per-iteration guarantees establish SEGQE as a measurement-efficient state-preparation primitive well suited to early fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures.

Title: The Hidden Nature of Non-Markovianity
Authors: Jihong Cai, Advith Govindarajan, Marius Junge
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems served as a tool to prepare entanglement at the beginning stage of quantum technology and more recently provides an important tool for state preparation. Dynamics given by time dependent Lindbladians are Markovian and lead to decoherence, decay of correlation and convergence to equilibrium. In contrast Non-Markovian evolutions can outperform their Markovian counterparts by enhancing memory. In this letter we compare the trajectories of Markovian and Non-Markovian evolutions starting from a fixed initial value. It turns out that under mild assumptions every trajectory can be obtained from a family of time dependent Lindbladians. Hence Non-Markovianity is invisible if single trajectories are concerned.

Title: Pseudo-deterministic Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Hugo Aaronson, Tom Gur, Jiawei Li
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms. These are quantum algorithms that, for any input, output a canonical solution with high probability. Focusing on the query complexity model, our main contributions include the following complexity separations, which require new lower bound techniques specifically tailored to pseudo-determinism: - We exhibit a problem, Avoid One Encrypted String (AOES), whose classical randomized query complexity is $O(1)$ but is maximally hard for pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms ($\Omega(N)$ query complexity). - We exhibit a problem, Quantum-Locked Estimation (QL-Estimation), for which pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms admit an exponential speed-up over classical pseudo-deterministic algorithms ($O(\log(N))$ vs. $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$), while the randomized query complexity is $O(1)$. Complementing these separations, we show that for any total problem $R$, pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms admit at most a quintic advantage over deterministic algorithms, i.e., $D(R) = \tilde O(psQ(R)^5)$. On the algorithmic side, we identify a class of quantum search problems that can be made pseudo-deterministic with small overhead, including Grover search, element distinctness, triangle finding, $k$-sum, and graph collision.

Title: Approaching the Limit in Multiparameter AC Magnetometry with Quantum Control
Authors: Takuya Isogawa, Zhiyao Hu, Ayumi Kanamoto, Nutdech Phadetsuwannukun, Shilin Wang, Shunsuke Nishimura, Boning Li, Liang Jiang, Zain H. Saleem, Guoqing Wang, Haidong Yuan, Paola Cappellaro
Abstract: Simultaneously estimating multiple parameters at the ultimate limit is a central challenge in quantum metrology, often hindered by inherent incompatibilities in optimal estimation strategies. At its most extreme, this incompatibility culminates in a fundamental impossibility when the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) becomes singular, rendering joint estimation unattainable. This is the case for a canonical problem: estimating the amplitude and frequency of an AC magnetic field, where the generators are parallel to each other. Here, we introduce a quantum control protocol that resolves this singularity. Our control protocol strategically engineers the sensor's time evolution so the generators for the two parameters become orthogonal. It not only removes the singularity but also restores the optimal scaling of precision with interrogation time for both parameters simultaneously. We experimentally validate this protocol using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at room temperature, demonstrating the concurrent achievement of the optimal scaling for both parameters under realistic conditions.

Title: Benchmarking quantum phase-space methods for near-resonant light propagation
Authors: Mojdeh S.Najafabadi, Joel F. Corney, Luis Sanchez Soto, Gerd Leuchs
Abstract: We study the dynamics of light interacting with a near-resonant atomic medium using the truncated Wigner and positive P phase-space representations. The atomic degrees of freedom are described using the Jordan-Schwinger mapping. The dynamics is first analyzed under unitary evolution and subsequently in the presence of an optical reservoir. While both approaches capture the main features of the light-matter dynamics, we find that the truncated Wigner approximation exhibits noticeable deviations for stronger interaction strengths and when reservoir-induced noise becomes significant.

Title: A Study of Entanglement and Ansatz Expressivity for the Transverse-Field Ising Model using Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Ashutosh P. Tripathi, Nilmani Mathur, Vikram Tripathi
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for simulating many-body systems in the NISQ era. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the faithful preparation of eigenstates, which becomes challenging in degenerate and strongly entangled regimes. We study this problem using the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with periodic boundary conditions in one, two, and three dimensions, considering systems of up to 27 qubits. We employ different ansatzes: the hardware-efficient EfficientSU2 from Qiskit, the physics-inspired Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and HVA with symmetry breaking, and benchmark their performance using energy variance, entanglement entropy, spin correlations, and magnetization.

Title: From Multipartite Entanglement to TQFT
Authors: Michele Del Zotto, Abhijit Gadde, Pavel Putrov
Abstract: At long distances, a gapped phase of matter is described by a topological quantum field theory (TQFT). We conjecture a tight and concrete relationship between the genuine $(d+1)$-partite entanglement -- labelled by a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ -- in the ground state of a $(d-1)+1$-dimensional gapped theory and the partition function of the low energy TQFT on $M$. In particular, the conjecture implies that for $d=3$, the ground state wavefunction can determine the modular tensor category description of the low energy TQFT. We verify our conjecture for general (2+1)-dimensional Levin-Wen string-net models.

Title: Singular three-point density correlations in two-dimensional Fermi liquids
Authors: Pok Man Tam, Charles L. Kane
Abstract: We characterize a singularity in the equal-time three-point density correlations that is generic to two-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids. In momentum space where the three-point correlation is determined by two wavevectors $\mathbf{q}_1$ and $\mathbf{q}_2$, the singularity takes the form $|\mathbf{q}_1\times\mathbf{q}_2|$. We explain how this singularity is sharply defined in a long-wavelength collinear limit. For a non-interacting Fermi gas, the coefficient of this singularity is given by the quantized Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea, and it implies a long-range real space correlation favoring collinear configurations. We show that this singularity persists in interacting Fermi liquids, and express the renormalization of the coefficient of singularity in terms of Landau parameters, for both spinless and spinful Fermi liquids. Implications for quantum gas experiments are discussed.

Title: The empirical laws for Majorana fields in a curved spacetime
Authors: Hideyasu Yamashita
Abstract: This article is a sequel to our previous paper (arXiv:2511.12311), where we considered the conceptual problem on the empirical laws for the Klein\textendash Gordon quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS), and we will consider the similar problems for the Majorana field on curved spacetime here. A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws.

Title: Multi-objective optimization and quantum hybridization of equivariant deep learning interatomic potentials on organic and inorganic compounds
Authors: G. Laskaris, D. Morozov, D. Tarpanov, A. Seth, J. Procelewska, G. Sai Gautam, A. Sagingalieva, R. Brasher, A. Melnikov
Abstract: Allegro is a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) model designed to predict atomic properties in molecules using E(3) equivariant neural networks. When training this model, there tends to be a trade-off between accuracy and inference time. For this reason we apply multi-objective hyperparameter optimization to the two objectives. Additionally, we experiment with modified architectures by making variants of Allegro some by adding strictly classical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers and some by adding quantum-classical hybrid layers. We compare the results from QM9, rMD17-aspirin, rMD17-benzene and our own proprietary dataset consisting of copper and lithium atoms. As results, we have a list of variants that surpass the Allegro in accuracy and also results which demonstrate the trade-off with inference times.

Title: Power attenuation in millimeter-wave and terahertz superconducting rectangular waveguides: linear response, TLS loss, and Higgs-mode nonlinearity
Authors: Takayuki Kubo
Abstract: Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $\alpha$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\ll\xi_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\gg\xi_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $\alpha$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 \Delta/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsim\xi_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $\alpha$ near $f\simeq \Delta/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.

Title: Formation of Hydroxyl Anion via a 2-Particle 1-Hole Feshbach Resonance in DEA to 2-Propanol: A Joint Experimental and Theoretical Study
Authors: Siddique Ali, Meeneskhi Rana, Soumya Ghosh, Narayan Kundu, Aryya Ghosh, Dhananjay Nandi
Abstract: Absolute cross sections for the formation of OH- from 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3) via dissociative electron attachment (DEA) are reported in the incident electron energy range of 3.5-13 eV. Four fragment anions are observed: OH-, C2H2O-, C2H4O-, and C3H7O-. The OH- yield exhibits a pronounced resonance centered at 8.2 eV together with a broader structure extending over the 8-10 eV region. Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster (electron attached) calculations with Singles and Doubles combined with a Complex Absorbing Potential (CAP/EOM-EA-CCSD) assign this feature to a two-particle-one-hole (2p-1h) core-excited Feshbach resonance. Potential energy curves along the C-OH dissociation coordinate reveal that core-excited anion states in this energy range promote efficient cleavage of the hydroxyl group. Analysis of Dyson orbitals and resonance widths demonstrates that only states with repulsive antibonding sigma(C-OH) character and sufficiently long lifetimes contribute significantly to the observed OH- production. These results provide fundamental insight into the DEA dynamics of secondary alcohols and highlight the role of multi-electron-attached resonances in site-specific bond rupture induced by low-energy electrons.

Title: Quantifying non-Markovianity in magnetization dynamics via entropy production rates
Authors: Felix Hartmann, Finja Tietjen, R. Matthias Geilhufe, Janet Anders
Abstract: Magnetization dynamics is commonly described by the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. On picosecond timescales, inertial and open-system extensions of the LLG equation are necessary to interpret recent experiments. We show analytically and numerically that the standard LLG equation exhibits strictly positive entropy production rates, while inertial and open-system LLG dynamics display temporarily negative entropy production rates indicating non-Markovianity. Here we quantify the degree of non-Markovianity using established measures. Our numerical calculations show that the open-system LLG equation consistently exhibits the highest magnitude of non-Markovianity for different initial conditions and magnetic field orientations.

Title: Mott-insulating phases of the Bose-Hubbard model on quasi-1D ladder lattices
Authors: Lorenzo Carfora, Callum W. Duncan, Stefan Kuhr, Peter Kirton
Abstract: We calculate the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model on a half-filled ladder lattice including the effect of finite on-site interactions. This shows that the rung-Mott insulator (RMI) phase persists to finite interaction strength, and we calculate the RMI-superfluid phase boundary in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the phases can still be distinguished using the number and parity variances, which are observables accessible in a quantum-gas microscope. Phases analogous to the RMI were found to exist in other quasi-1D lattice structures, with the lattice connectivity modifying the phase boundaries. This shows that the the presence of these phases is the result of states with one-dimensional structures being mapped onto higher dimensional systems, driven by the reduction of hopping rates along different directions.

Title: Matrix-product operator dualities in integrable lattice models
Authors: Yuan Miao, Andras Molnar, Nick G. Jones
Abstract: Matrix-product operators (MPOs) appear throughout the study of integrable lattice models, notably as the transfer matrices. They can also be used as transformations to construct dualities between such models, both invertible (including unitary) and non-invertible (including discrete gauging). We analyse how the local Yang--Baxter integrable structures are modified under such dualities. We see that the $\check{R}$-matrix, that appears in the baxterization approach to integrability, transforms in a simple manner. We further show for a broad class of MPOs that the usual Yang--Baxter $R$-matrix satisfies a modified algebra, previously identified in the unitary case, that gives a local integrable structure underlying the commuting transfer matrices of the dual model. We illustrate these results with two case studies, analysing an invertible unitary MPO and a non-invertible MPO both applied to the canonical XXZ spin chain. The former is the cluster entangler, arising in the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, while the latter is the Kramers--Wannier duality. We show several results for MPOs with exact MPO inverses that are of independent interest.

Title: Measuring spectral functions of doped magnets with Rydberg tweezer arrays
Authors: Romain Martin, Mu Qiao, Ivan Morera, Lukas Homeier, Bastien Gély, Lukas Klein, Yuki Torii Chew, Daniel Barredo, Thierry Lahaye, Eugene Demler, Antoine Browaeys
Abstract: Spectroscopic measurements of single-particle spectral functions provide crucial insight into strongly correlated quantum matter by resolving the energy and spatial structure of elementary excitations. Here we introduce a spectroscopic protocol for single-charge injection with simultaneous spatial and energy resolution in a Rydberg tweezer array, effectively emulating scanning tunneling microscopy. By combining this protocol with single-atom-resolved imaging, we go beyond conventional spectroscopy by not only measuring the single-particle spectral function but also directly imaging the microscopic structure of the excitations underlying spectral resonances in frustrated $tJ$ Hamiltonians. We reveal resonances associated with the formation of bound magnetic polarons -- composite quasiparticles consisting of a mobile hole bound to a magnon -- and directly extract their binding energy, spatial extent, and spin character. Finally, by exploiting the spatial tunability of our platform, we measure the local density of states across different lattice geometries. Our work establishes Rydberg tweezer arrays as a powerful platform for spectroscopic studies of strongly correlated models, offering microscopic control and direct real-space access to emergent quasiparticles in engineered quantum matter.

Title: Exotic critical states as fractional Fermi seas in the one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Alvise Bastianello, Yi Zeng, Sudipta Dhar, Zekui Wang, Xudong Yu, Milena Horvath, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Yanliang Guo, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl, Manuele Landini
Abstract: Critical quantum field theories occupy a central position in modern theoretical physics for their inherent universality stemming from long-range correlations. As an example, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) describes a wealth of one-dimensional quantum systems at low temperatures. Its behavior is deeply rooted in the emergence of an effective Fermi sea, leading to power-law correlations and Friedel oscillations. A promising direction to realize systems exhibiting novel universal behavior beyond TLL is through the generalization of the underlying Fermi sea. In this Letter, we show that fractional Fermi seas with reduced occupancy arise in an integrable Bose gas driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in interactions from repulsive to attractive. The correlation functions feature signatures of criticality incompatible with a conventional TLL, suggesting a novel critical phase. Our predictions, based on Generalized Hydrodynamics, are directly relevant to cold atoms.

Title: Exploiting many-body localization for scalable variational quantum simulation
Authors: Chenfeng Cao, Yeqing Zhou, Swamit Tannu, Nic Shannon, Robert Joynt
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a promising pathway toward achieving practical quantum advantage on near-term hardware. Despite this promise, for generic, expressive ansätze, their scalability is critically hindered by barren plateaus--regimes of exponentially vanishing gradients. We demonstrate that initializing a hardware-efficient, Floquet-structured ansatz within the many-body localized (MBL) phase mitigates barren plateaus and enhances algorithmic trainability. Through analysis of the inverse participation ratio, entanglement entropy, and a novel low-weight stabilizer Rényi entropy, we characterize a distinct MBL-thermalization transition. Below a critical kick strength, the circuit avoids forming a unitary 2-design, exhibits robust area-law entanglement, and maintains non-vanishing gradients. Leveraging this MBL regime facilitates the efficient variational preparation of ground states for several model Hamiltonians with significantly reduced computational resources. Crucially, experiments on a 127-qubit superconducting processor provide evidence for the preservation of trainable gradients in the MBL phase for a kicked Heisenberg chain, validating our approach on contemporary noisy hardware. Our findings position MBL-based initialization as a viable strategy for developing scalable VQAs and motivate broader integration of localization into quantum algorithm design.

Title: Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order
Authors: Carolyn Zhang, Yichen Xu, Jian-Hao Zhang, Cenke Xu, Zhen Bi, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a Rényi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, & Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite Rényi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.

Title: Optimal quantum (tensor product) expanders from unitary designs
Authors: Cécilia Lancien
Abstract: In this work we investigate how quantum expanders (i.e. quantum channels with few Kraus operators but a large spectral gap) can be constructed from unitary designs. Concretely, we prove that a random quantum channel whose Kraus operators are independent unitaries sampled from a $2$-design measure is with high probability an optimal expander (in the sense that its spectral gap is as large as possible). More generally, we show that, if these Kraus operators are independent unitaries of the form $U^{\otimes k}$, with $U$ sampled from a $2k$-design measure, then the corresponding random quantum channel is typically an optimal $k$-copy tensor product expander, a concept introduced by Harrow and Hastings (Quant. Inf. Comput. 2009).

Title: Quantum-Inspired Weight-Constrained Neural Network: Reducing Variable Numbers by 100x Compared to Standard Neural Networks
Authors: Shaozhi Li, M Sabbir Salek, Mashrur Chowdhury, Yao Wang
Abstract: Although quantum machine learning has shown great promise, the practical application of quantum computers remains constrained in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. To take advantage of quantum machine learning, we investigate the underlying mathematical principles of these quantum models and find that the quantum neural network with amplitude encoding is equivalent to a weight-constrained neural network. Motived by this discovery, we develop a classical weight-constrained neural network. We find that this approach can reduce the number of variables in a classical neural network by a factor of 135 while preserving its accuracy. In addition, we develop a dropout method to enhance the robustness of quantum machine learning models, which are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. This technique can also be applied to improve the adversarial robustness of the classical weight-constrained neural network, which is essential for industry applications, such as self-driving vehicles. Our work offers a novel approach to reduce the complexity of large classical neural networks, addressing a critical challenge in machine learning.

Title: Nonclassical nullifiers for quantum hypergraph states
Authors: Abhijith Ravikumar, Darren W. Moore, Radim Filip
Abstract: Quantum hypergraph states form a generalisation of the graph state formalism that goes beyond the pairwise (dyadic) interactions imposed by remaining inside the Gaussian approximation. Networks of such states are able to achieve universality for continuous variable measurement based quantum computation with only Gaussian measurements. For normalised states, the simplest hypergraph states are formed from $k$-adic interactions among a collection of $k$ harmonic oscillator ground states. However such powerful resources have not yet been observed in experiments and their robustness and scalability have not been tested. Here we develop and analyse necessary criteria for hypergraph nonclassicality based on simultaneous nonlinear squeezing in the nullifiers of hypergraph states. We put forward an essential analysis of their robustness to realistic scenarios involving thermalisation or loss and suggest several basic proof-of-principle options for experiments to observe nonclassicality in hypergraph states.

Title: Arbitrary state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators using neural networks
Authors: Nicolas Parra-A, Vladimir Vargas-Calderón, Herbert Vinck-Posada
Abstract: Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.

Title: Cross-Platform Benchmarking of Near-Term Quantum Optimisation Algorithms
Authors: Kieran McDowall, Theodoros Kapourniotis, Christopher Oliver, Phalgun Lolur, Konstantinos Georgopoulos
Abstract: Quantum computers show potential for achieving computational advantage over classical computers, with many candidate applications in combinatorial optimisation. We present an application level benchmarking framework for near-term quantum optimisation algorithms using a dense Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) materials science problem as a representative test-case. To solve this problem, we implement two methods, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Annealing (QA), on commercially-available gate-based and quantum annealing devices that are accessible via Quantum-Computing-as-a-Service (QCaaS) models. To analyse the performance of these algorithms, we use a toolbox of relevant metrics and compare performance against three classical algorithms. We employ quantum methods to solve fully-connected QUBOs of up to $72$ variables, and find that algorithm performance beyond this is restricted by device connectivity, noise and classical computation time overheads. The applicability of our approach goes beyond the selected configurational analysis test-case, and we anticipate that our approach will be of use for optimisation problems in general.

Title: Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots
Authors: Gaurav Hajong, Ranjan Modak, Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.

Title: The Quantum Formalism Revisited
Authors: Hajo Leschke
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle confined to a straight line, I compile, initially in a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics and contrast them with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, resulting from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. The latter was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.

Title: Entanglement growth and information capacity in a quasiperiodic system with a single-particle mobility edge
Authors: Yuqi Qing, Yu-Qin Chen, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system featuring a single-particle mobility edge (SPME), described by the generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model. This model offers a unique platform to study the consequences of coexisting localized and extended eigenstates, which contrasts sharply with the abrupt localization transition in the standard Aubry-André model. We analyze the system's response to a quantum quench through two complementary probes: entanglement entropy (EE) and subsystem information capacity (SIC). We find that the SPME induces a smooth crossover in all dynamical signatures. The EE saturation value exhibits a persistent volume-law scaling in the mobility-edge phase, with an entropy density that continuously decreases as the number of available extended states decreases. Complementing this, the SIC profile interpolates between the linear ramp characteristic of extended systems and the information trapping behavior of localized ones, directly visualizing the mixed nature of the underlying spectrum. Our results establish unambiguous dynamical fingerprints of a mobility edge, providing a crucial non-interacting benchmark for understanding information and entanglement dynamics in more complex systems with mixed phases.

Title: Analytical solution of boundary time crystals via the superspin basis
Authors: Dominik Nemeth, Alessandro Principi, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in dissipative collective spin systems have been extensively studied using numerical, mean-field, and perturbative approaches. However, an explicit Liouvillian description governing the long-time dynamics deep within the time crystal phase has remained elusive. Here, we derive an effective Liouvillian that analytically captures the extreme BTC regime, where dissipation is parametrically weak and oscillatory order is maximally robust. By introducing a superspin representation of Liouville space, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Liouvillian eigenvalues to first order in the dissipation strength, providing direct access to decay rates, oscillation frequencies, and their thermodynamic scaling. Applying this framework to the canonical BTC model we analytically recover spontaneous breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry and persistent oscillations in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, we show that other dissipative spin models exhibit only single-frequency oscillatory dynamics and therefore do not support genuine BTC phases. Our results establish a controlled analytical framework for the long-time dynamics in the extreme BTC regime.

Title: Comment on "Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states"
Authors: Rubén Gordillo-Hachuel, Ricardo Puebla
Abstract: A recent article [S. Ashhab and M. Ayyash, New J. Phys. 27, 054104 (2025)] has reported unexpected oscillatory dynamics in generalized squeezed states of order higher than two as their squeezing parameter increases. This behaviour, observed through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and creation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including their average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect a genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed oscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical analysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation of the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported by a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number, suggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after a finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical proof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a non-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the reported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with high-order squeezing states.

Title: Cybersecurity of Quantum Key Distribution Implementations
Authors: Ittay Alfassi, Ran Gelles, Rotem Liss, Tal Mor
Abstract: Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) often deviate from the theoretical protocols, exposing the implementations to various attacks even when the underlying (ideal) protocol is proven secure. We present new analysis tools and methodologies for quantum cybersecurity, adapting the concepts of vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and exploits from classical cybersecurity to QKD implementation attacks. We also present three additional concepts, derived from the connection between classical and quantum cybersecurity: "Quantum Fuzzing", which is the first tool for black-box vulnerability research on QKD implementations; "Reversed-Space Attacks", which are a generic exploit method using the attack surface of imperfect receivers; and concrete quantum-mechanical definitions of "Quantum Side-Channel Attacks" and "Quantum State-Channel Attacks", meaningfully distinguishing them from each other and from other attacks. Using our tools, we analyze multiple existing QKD attacks and show that the "Bright Illumination" attack could have been found even with minimal knowledge of the device implementation. This work begins to bridge the gap between current analysis methods for experimental attacks on QKD implementations and the decades-long research in the field of classical cybersecurity, improving the practical security of QKD products and enhancing their usefulness in real-world systems.

Title: Classical Feedback in a Quantum Network
Authors: Elina Levi, Uzi Pereg
Abstract: Communication over a quantum multiple access channel (MAC) is considered with classical feedback. Since the no-cloning prohibits universal copying of arbitrary quantum states, classical feedback is generated through measurement. An achievable rate region is derived using partial information decoding at each transmitter. Our region generalizes both the classical Cover-Leung region and the generalized feedback region. As an example, we show that the qubit SWAP channel can benefit from feedback.

Title: Quantum Gates via Dynamical Decoupling of Central Qubit on IBMQ and 15NV Center in Diamond
Authors: Lucas Tsunaki, Michael Dotan, Kseniia Volkova, Boris Naydenov
Abstract: We demonstrate a hardware-agnostic protocol for realizing fast, high-fidelity gates through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to a central qubit coupled to target qubits. The target qubits are controlled by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow, error-prone direct control. We develop and implement the DD-gate protocol within two distinct frameworks: a general model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked on a gate-based digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with a nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Using IBMQ, we are able to elucidate the underlying quantum dynamics of the DD-gates and test them, independently of experimental constraints. For $^{15}$NV, we realize the protocol considering system-specific properties, which could represent a significant reduction in gate duration and improved technological scalability compared with current dynamical-decoupling-based control. We also propose a simple application for high-efficiency polarization of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin that could potentially be less technically demanding than current methods. Altogether, this work provides a robust strategy for quantum control that can be implemented in arbitrary systems fitting the central-target qubit architecture. Beyond these results, our open-source simulations and implementations for both platforms provide a practical framework for simulating time-dependent qubit dynamics on NISQ-era gate-based quantum processors.

Title: Explicitly Quantum-parallel Computation by Displacements
Authors: Uchenna Chukwu, Mohammad-Ali Miri, Nicholas Chancellor
Abstract: We introduce an encoding of information in the relative displacement or photon number of different optical modes. Since the loss rate to interference is insensitive to squeezing and many non-Gaussian fluctuations, such a space is relatively protected from imperfections. We show that photon subtraction protocols can be used to create high-quality quantum superpositions of squeezed states with much higher fidelity than when the protocol is restricted to producing only cat states (superpositions of coherent states). We also show that the amount of squeezing and anti-squeezing introduced is moderate, and unlikely to dominate the photon number. This parallel processing allows for explicit use of non-Gaussian interference as opposed to the more incidental role played by non-Gaussianity in all-optical coherent Ising machines. A key observation we make is that displacements of optical states provide a convenient degree of freedom to encode information for quantum parallel processing. Furthermore, we discuss important considerations for realizing an optical quantum annealer based on differential photon number encoding. In particular, we discuss the need to perform quantum erasure on loss channels from interference, as well as the ability to correct degrees of freedom not used for the encoding without disrupting the processed quantum information.

Title: A Sub-kHz Mechanical Resonator Passively Cooled to 6 mK
Authors: Loek van Everdingen, Jaimy Plugge, Tim Fuchs, Guido van de Stolpe, Dalal Benali, Thijmen de Jong, Jasper Bijl, Wim Bosch, Tjerk Oosterkamp
Abstract: Highly coherent mechanical resonators are invaluable to ultrasensitive detection techniques by enabling detection of small forces. Studying mechanical resonators in a thermal equilibrium state at millikelvin temperatures provides a promising path to increase their coherence time. Here, we passively cool a 700 Hz massive (1.5 ng) mechanical cantilever down to 6.1(4) mK by means of nuclear demagnetization, as confirmed by detecting its thermal motion via a lock-in based detection scheme. At the lowest temperatures the thermal motion of the resonator is still clearly distinguishable from the background noise. Our data analysis confirms that at these temperatures the motion is still thermally distributed. These results pave the way for passive cooling low-frequency resonators to the sub-millikelvin regime, which would enable new tests of quantum mechanics and advances in ultrasensitive force detection.

Title: Symbolic Quantum-Trajectory Method for Multichannel Dicke Superradiance
Authors: Raphael Holzinger, Nico S. Bassler, Julian Lyne, Susanne F. Yelin, Claudiu Genes
Abstract: We develop and solve a Dicke superradiant model with two or more competing collective decay channels of tunable rates. Recent work analyzed stationary properties of multichannel Dicke superradiance using hydrodynamic mean-field approximations as shown by Mok et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L022015 (2025)]. We extend this with a symbolic quantum-trajectory method, providing a simple route to analytic solutions. For two channels, the behavior of the stationary ground-state distribution resembles a first-order phase transition at the point where the channel-rate ratio is equal to unity. For $d$ competing channels, we obtain scaling laws for the superradiant peak time and intensity. These results unify and extend single-channel Dicke dynamics to multilevel emitters and provide a compact tool for cavity and waveguide experiments, where permutation-symmetric reservoirs engineer multiple collective decay paths.

Title: An approach to study the adiabaticity and irreversibility in the TDHO
Authors: Salvador J. Robles-Perez, Salvador Castillo-Rivera
Abstract: This work studies the relationship between parametric amplification (or particle creation), adiabaticity and irreversibility in the non-quasi-static regime of a time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillator (TDHO) that evolves unitarily. We provide analytical results for the evolution of the TDHO valid for any functional value of the frequency, which enables us to monitor the behavior of the thermodynamical magnitudes in the non-quasi-static regime. In the latter, the largest modes of the energy eigenstates commonly undergo a process of spontaneous thermalization, where the concept of temperature naturally arises from the unitary evolution of the oscillator, i.e. without relation to any external source of temperature or thermal bath. As the evolution is unitary, this thermalization process can be reversible, facilitating the monitoring of an unexpected \emph{classical-to-quantum} transition that might entail a quantum violation of the third principle of classical thermodynamics. We adapt the standard definitions of quantum heat and work to account for the change in the populations of the energy levels in the non-quasi-static evolution of the TDHO.

Title: Many-body symmetry-protected zero boundary modes of synthetic photo-magnonic crystals
Authors: Alan Gardin, Emilio Cobanera, Giuseppe C. Tettamanzi
Abstract: The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.

Title: Reply to Comment on "Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states"
Authors: Sahel Ashhab, Mohammad Ayyash
Abstract: In our paper [1], our numerical simulations showed that, unlike displacement and conventional squeezing, higher-order squeezing exhibits oscillatory dynamics. Subsequently, Gordillo and Puebla pointed out that simulation results depend on whether the size of the state space in the simulations is even or odd [2]. Using additional derivations, they argued that the oscillatory dynamics is unphysical and that the photon number must increase monotonically as a function of the squeezing parameter $r$. We agree with the observation of an even-odd parity dependence in the simulations. We independently noticed the same feature in our simulations after the publication of Ref. [1]. This observation led us to perform a more detailed investigation of the numerical simulation and mathematical aspects of the generalized squeezing problem. Our new findings were reported in Ref. [3]. Further analysis was reported in Ref. [4]. Our conclusion is that the generalized squeezing operator is physically not well defined but can be made well defined when combined with additional information about the physical system under study. We demonstrated this point in the case where we include an additional nonlinear interaction term in the Hamiltonian. We disagree with the claim that the photon number must be a monotonically increasing function of $r$. This claim contradicts the mathematically rigorous results of Ref. [4]. Furthermore, we show that the oscillatory behaviour persists in two closely related, well-behaved models.

Title: Quantum metrology enhanced by effective time reversal
Authors: Yu-Xin Wang, Flavio Salvati, David R. M. Arvidsson-Shukur, William F. Braasch Jr., Kater Murch, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: Quantum metrology involves the application of quantum resources to enhance measurements. Several communities have developed quantum-metrology strategies that leverage effective time reversals. These strategies, we posit, form four classes. First, echo metrology begins with a preparatory unitary and ends with that unitary's time-reverse. The protocol amplifies the visibility of a small parameter to be sensed. Similarly, weak-value amplification enhances a weak coupling's detectability. The technique exhibits counterintuitive properties captured by a retrocausal model. Using the third strategy, one simulates closed timelike curves, worldlines that loop back on themselves in time. The fourth strategy involves indefinite causal order, which characterises channels applied in a superposition of orderings. We review these four strategies, which we unify under the heading of time-reverse metrology. We also outline opportunities for this toolkit in quantum metrology; quantum information science; quantum foundations; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; and solid-state physics.

Title: QCL-IDS: Quantum Continual Learning for Intrusion Detection with Fidelity-Anchored Stability and Generative Replay
Authors: Zirui Zhu, Xiangyang Li
Abstract: Continual intrusion detection must absorb newly emerging attack stages while retaining legacy detection capability under strict operational constraints, including bounded compute and qubit budgets and privacy rules that preclude long-term storage of raw telemetry. We propose QCL-IDS, a quantum-centric continual-learning framework that co-designs stability and privacy-governed rehearsal for NISQ-era pipelines. Its core component, Q-FISH (Quantum Fisher Anchors), enforces retention using a compact anchor coreset through (i) sensitivity-weighted parameter constraints and (ii) a fidelity-based functional anchoring term that directly limits decision drift on representative historical traffic. To regain plasticity without retaining sensitive flows, QCL-IDS further introduces privacy-preserved quantum generative replay (QGR) via frozen, task-conditioned generator snapshots that synthesize bounded rehearsal samples. Across a three-stage attack stream on UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017, QCL-IDS consistently attains the best retention-adaptation trade-off: the gradient-anchor configuration achieves mean Attack-F1 = 0.941 with forgetting = 0.005 on UNSW-NB15 and mean Attack-F1 = 0.944 with forgetting = 0.004 on CICIDS2017, versus 0.800/0.138 and 0.803/0.128 for sequential fine-tuning, respectively.

Title: Enhanced Phase Estimation via Photon-Added Two-Mode Squeezed States and Kerr Nonlinearity
Authors: Zekun Zhao, Qingqian Kang, Teng Zhao, Cunjin Liu, Xin Su, Liyun Hu
Abstract: Quantum metrology employs quantum resources to achieve measurement precision beyond classical limits. This work investigates a Mach--Zehnder interferometer incorporating a Kerr nonlinear phase shifter, with photon-added two-mode squeezed coherent states generated via four-wave mixing as input. We demonstrate that increasing both the photon-addition order and the input resource strength systematically enhances phase sensitivity, quantum Fisher information, and the corresponding quantum Cramér--Rao bound. The proposed system not only surpasses the standard quantum limit but also approaches or exceeds the Heisenberg limit for linear phase shifts, while Kerr nonlinearity enables surpassing the super-Heisenberg limit. Furthermore, the scheme exhibits enhanced robustness against photon loss, providing a promising pathway toward practical high-precision quantum metrology applications.

Title: Locally Gentle State Certification for High Dimensional Quantum Systems
Authors: Cristina Butucea, Jan Johannes, Henning Stein
Abstract: Standard approaches to quantum statistical inference rely on measurements that induce a collapse of the wave function, effectively consuming the quantum state to extract information. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of \emph{locally-gentle} quantum state certification, where the learning algorithm is constrained to perturb the state by at most $\alpha$ in trace norm, thereby allowing for the reuse of samples. We analyze the hypothesis testing problem of distinguishing whether an unknown state $\rho$ is equal to a reference $\rho_0$ or $\epsilon$-far from it. We derive the minimax sample complexity for this problem, quantifying the information-theoretic price of non-destructive measurements. Specifically, by constructing explicit measurement operators, we show that the constraint of $\alpha$-gentleness imposes a sample size penalty of $\frac{d}{\alpha^2}$, yielding a total sample complexity of $n = \Theta(\frac{d^3}{\epsilon^2 \alpha^2})$. Our results clarify the trade-off between information extraction and state disturbance, and highlight deep connections between physical measurement constraints and privacy mechanisms in quantum learning. Crucially, we find that the sample size penalty incurred by enforcing $\alpha$-gentleness scales linearly with the Hilbert-space dimension $d$ rather than the number of parameters $d^2-1$ typical for high-dimensional private estimation.

Title: Higher-Order Corrections to Scrambling Dynamics in Brownian Spin SYK Models

Abstract: We investigate operator growth in a Brownian spin Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model with random all-to-all interactions, focusing on the full operator-size distribution. For Hamiltonians containing interactions of order two up to $L$, we derive a closed master equation for the Pauli-string expansion coefficients and recast their dynamics into a generating-function formulation suitable for the large-$N$ limit. This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems.

Title: Long-Range Pairing in the Kitaev Model: Krylov Subspace Signatures
Authors: Rishabh Jha, Heiko Georg Menzler
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods quantify operator growth in quantum many-body systems through Lanczos coefficients that encode how operators spread under time evolution. While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce $Krylov$ $staggering$ $parameter$, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators.

Title: Towards Trapped-Ion Thermometry Using Cavity-Based EIT
Authors: Abhijit Kundu, Vijay Bhatt, Arijit Sharma
Abstract: We present a technique for measuring ion temperature using cavity-based electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) applicable for cavity-qed systems in the strong coupling regime. This method enables efficient extraction of the ion's phonon occupation number following sub-Doppler cooling close to the motional ground state. The proposed method relies on monitoring the cavity probe transmission while scanning the probe laser frequency once cavity EIT is established using the control beam, significantly simplifying the measurement procedure. We theoretically establish a model that demonstrates the influence of the thermal state of the trapped ion vis-a-vis the EIT linewidth measured. We show how the cavity EIT transmission may be used as a thermometry tool to deduce the ion temperature as well as the motional state for an ion in the sub-Doppler cooling regime, even for systems that are in the weak coupling regime. The current method can only be used for operation in the resolved-sideband regime, where individual motional states can be selectively addressed for all relevant transitions either by selecting appropriate energy levels for the three-level system or by employing strong confinement with high secular frequencies ($\sim 10 MHz$).

Title: GKP-inspired high-dimensional superdense coding with energy-time entanglement
Authors: Kai-Chi Chang, Arjun Mirani, Murat Can Sarihan, Xiang Cheng, Michelle Harasimowicz, Patrick Hayden, Chee Wei Wong
Abstract: Superdense coding, the application of entanglement to boost classical communication capacity, is a cornerstone of quantum communication. In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states. These states are biphoton frequency combs, an example of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. Inspired by GKP codes, our protocol involves discretizing the continuous time and frequency degrees of freedom and encoding information by time-frequency displacements. This approach leverages the inherently large Hilbert space found in quantum frequency combs, with resilience against both temporal and spectral errors. In addition to describing the theoretical structure of the protocol, we propose an experimental implementation using standard telecommunication components, time-resolving single-photon detectors and a frequency beamsplitter. We also analyze the effect of experimental noise and errors on the channel capacity of the protocol. We demonstrate that for realistic experimental parameters, contemporary technologies satisfy the prerequisites for superdense coding with biphoton frequency combs, achieving a transmission rate of approximately 8.91 bits per transmitted photon (equivalent to 481 distinguishable messages with asymptotically vanishing errors). This more than doubles the previously highest transmission rate of 4 bits achieved by the Kwiat-Weinfurter scheme, while also having competitive optical loss. Furthermore, our results beat the rate achievable using a single-photon frequency comb with identical parameters by 4.6 times. Our protocol thus represents an experimentally feasible application of time-frequency grid states to entanglement-assisted communication, contributing to the active fields of continuous-variable and high-dimensional quantum information.

Title: Observing quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved spacetime using programmable quantum processors
Authors: Brendan Rhyno, Bastien Lapierre, Smitha Vishveshwara, Khadijeh Najafi, Ramasubramanian Chitra
Abstract: We digitally simulate quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved backgrounds using 80 superconducting qubits on IBM Heron processors. By engineering spatially varying couplings in the spin-$\frac12$ XXZ chain, consistent with the low-energy description of the model in terms of an inhomogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, we realize excitations that follow geodesics of an effective metric inherited from the underlying spatial deformation. Following quenches from Néel and few-spin-flip states, we observe curved light-cone propagation, horizon-induced freezing in the local magnetization, and position-dependent oscillation frequencies set by the engineered spatial deformation. Despite strong spatial inhomogeneity, unequal-time correlators reveal ballistic quasiparticle propagation in the spin chain. These results establish large-scale digital quantum processors as a flexible platform for detailed and controlled exploration of many-body dynamics in tunable and synthetic curved spacetimes.

Title: Predicted third-order sweet spots for phi-junction Josephson parametric amplifiers
Authors: Tasnum Reza, Sergey M. Frolov
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions exhibit skewed and phi-shifted current phase relations when an in-plane magnetic field is applied along the weak link's spin-orbit effective field direction. These junctions can have an asymmetric Josephson potential with odd-order nonlinearities. A dominant third-order nonlinearity can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field to a sweet spot. Sweet spots persist when higher order Josephson harmonics are included. This makes it possible to have a single Josephson junction dipole element with three-wave mixing capability, which is favorable for pump-efficient amplification. Electrostatic gate tunability of the semiconductor weak link can make it operable within an extended range of working frequencies, and the inclusion of micromagnets can facilitate near-zero magnetic field operation.

Title: Refinement orders for quantum programs
Authors: Yuan Feng, Li Zhou
Abstract: Refinement is a fundamental technique in the verification and systematic development of computer programs. It supports a disciplined approach to software construction through stepwise refinement, whereby an abstract specification is gradually transformed into a concrete implementation that satisfies the desired requirements. Central to this methodology is the notion of a refinement order, which guarantees that each refinement step preserves program correctness. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of refinement orders for quantum programs, covering both deterministic and nondeterministic settings under total and partial correctness criteria. We investigate three natural classes of quantum predicates: projectors, representing qualitative properties; effects, capturing quantitative properties; and sets of effects, modeling demonic nondeterminism. For deterministic quantum programs, we show that refinement with respect to effect-based and set-of-effects based specifications coincides with the standard complete-positivity order on superoperators, whereas refinement induced by projector-based specifications can be characterized by the linear span of Kraus operators. For nondeterministic quantum programs with set-of-effects based specifications, we establish precise correspondences with classical domain-theoretic notions: the Smyth order characterizes refinement under total correctness, while the Hoare order characterizes refinement under partial correctness. Moreover, effect-based and projector-based specifications lead to strictly weaker refinement orders.

Title: Wigner's friend's black hole adventure: an argument for complementarity?
Authors: Laurens Walleghem
Abstract: At the heart of both black hole physics and Wigner's friend scenarios lies the question of unitarity. In Wigner's friend setups, sealed-lab measurements are modeled unitarily, probing the measurement this http URL black hole physics, the unitarity problem concerns information preservation in evaporation. We extend a recent analogy between these two puzzles exposed by Hausmann and Renner [arXiv:2504.03835v1] by constructing new paradoxes that merge black hole physics with extensions of the Wigner's friend scenario into a unified argument. This unified construction allows us to sharpen the cloning and firewall paradoxes, which leave room for a post-quantum theory to consistently describe the physics of black holes. We close this loophole, showing that no such theory exists if no observer can experimentally falsify quantum theory's predictions. We conclude by briefly highlighting subtleties in assumptions commonly used in black hole puzzles.

Title: Krylov complexity, path integrals, and instantons
Authors: Cameron Beetar, Eric L Graef, Jeff Murugan, Horatiu Nastase, Hendrik J R Van Zyl
Abstract: Krylov complexity has emerged as an important tool in the description of quantum information and, in particular, quantum chaos. Here we formulate Krylov complexity $K(t)$ for quantum mechanical systems as a path integral, and argue that at large times, for classical chaotic systems with at least two minima of the potential, that have a plateau for $K(t)$, the value of the plateau is described by quantum mechanical instantons, as is the case for standard transition amplitudes. We explain and test these ideas in a simple toy model.

Title: Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement
Authors: Xuhao Jiang, Jad C. Halimeh, N. S. Srivatsa
Abstract: In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.

Title: SeQuant Framework for Symbolic and Numerical Tensor Algebra. I. Core Capabilities
Authors: Bimal Gaudel, Robert G. Adam, Ajay Melekamburath, Conner Masteran, Nakul Teke, Azam Besharatnik, Andreas Köhn, Edward F. Valeev
Abstract: SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks. The SeQuant source code is available at this https URL.

Title: Global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories
Authors: Yuanran Zhu, Yang Yu, Efekan Kökcü, Emanuel Gull, Chao Yang
Abstract: We introduce a method for constructing global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories, starting from perturbative results. The key idea is to employ interpolation method, such as the two-point Padé expansion, to interpolate the weak and strong coupling expansions of correlation function. We benchmark this many-body interpolation approach on two prototypical models: the lattice $\phi^4$ field theory and the 2D Hubbard model. For the $\phi^4$ theory, the resulting two point Padé approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Padé appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we offer a heuristic explanation for these convergence properties based on analytic function theory.
