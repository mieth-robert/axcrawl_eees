Title: A Proof of Generalized Kramers-Pasternack Relation using Hyper-Radial Equation
Authors: Avoy Jana
Abstract: We present a proof of the generalized Kramers-Pasternack relation using the hyper-radial equation approach. Following Kramers' method, we manipulate the radial equation by multiplying it with an expression closely related to terms in the hyper-virial theorem. Through successive integrations by parts, we systematically derive the second Pasternack formula, extending its validity to arbitrary dimensions. This approach provides deeper insights into the algebraic structure of recurrence relations for diagonal radial matrix elements in quantum mechanics.

Title: Thermal Entanglement in Disordered Spin Chains: Localization, Thresholds, and the Quantum-to-Classical Crossover
Authors: Dihang Sun, Zhigang Hu, Biao Wu
Abstract: We investigate the mixed-state entanglement between two spins embedded in the XXZ Heisenberg chain under thermal equilibrium. By deriving an analytical expression for the entanglement of two-spin thermal states and extending this analysis to larger spin chains, we demonstrate that mixed-state entanglement is profoundly shaped by both disorder and temperature. Our results reveal a sharp distinction between many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic phases, with entanglement vanishing above different finite temperature thresholds. Furthermore, by analyzing non-adjacent spins, we uncover an approximate exponential decay of entanglement with separation. This work advances the understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition by linking the entanglement properties of small subsystems to the broader thermal environment, offering a explanation for the absence of entanglement in macroscopic systems. These findings provide critical insights into quantum many-body physics, bridging concepts from thermalization, localization, and quantum information theory.

Title: Three-Body Non-Locality in Particle Decays
Authors: Pawe≈Ç Horodecki, Kazuki Sakurai, Abhyoudai S. Shaleena, Michael Spannowsky
Abstract: The exploration of entanglement and Bell non-locality among multi-particle quantum systems offers a profound avenue for testing and understanding the limits of quantum mechanics and local real hidden variable theories. In this work, we examine non-local correlations among three massless spin-1/2 particles generated from the three-body decay of a massive particle, utilizing a framework based on general four-fermion interactions. By analyzing several inequalities, we address the detection of deviations from quantum mechanics as well as violations of two key hidden variable theories: fully local-real and bipartite local-real theories. Our approach encompasses the standard Mermin inequality and the tight $4 \times 4 \times 2$ inequality introduced by Laskowski et al., providing a comprehensive framework for probing three-partite non-local correlations. Our findings provide deeper insights into the boundaries of classical and quantum theories in three-particle systems, advancing the understanding of non-locality in particle decays and its relevance to particle physics and quantum foundations.

Title: Quantum natural gradient with thermal-state initialization
Authors: Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are central to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), yet their performance is hindered by complex loss landscapes that make their trainability challenging. Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parameterized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed in [Stokes et al., Quantum 4, 269 (2020)], by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix-the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices-for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state.

Title: Long-range nonstabilizerness and phases of matter
Authors: David Aram Korbany, Michael J. Gullans, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: Long-range nonstabilizerness can be defined as the amount of nonstabilizerness which cannot be removed by shallow local quantum circuits. In this work, we study long-range nonstabilizerness in the context of many-body quantum physics, a task with possible implications for quantum-state preparation protocols and implementation of quantum-error correcting codes. After presenting a simple argument showing that long-range nonstabilizerness is a generic property of many-body states, we restrict to the class of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. We focus on one-dimensional systems and present rigorous results in the context of translation-invariant matrix product states (MPSs). By analyzing the fixed points of the MPS renormalization-group flow, we provide a sufficient condition for long-range nonstabilizerness, which depends entirely on the local MPS tensors. Physically, our condition captures the fact that the mutual information between distant regions of stabilizer fixed points is quantized, and this fact is not changed after applying shallow quantum circuits. We also discuss possible ramifications in the classification of phases of matter and quantum error correction.

Title: Measurement-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect
Authors: Giuseppe Di Giulio, Xhek Turkeshi, Sara Murciano
Abstract: Monitoring a quantum system can profoundly alter its dynamical properties, leading to nontrivial emergent phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate that dynamical measurements strongly influence the evolution of symmetry in many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that monitored systems governed by non-Hermitian dynamics exhibit a quantum Mpemba effect, where systems with stronger initial asymmetry relax faster to a symmetric state. Crucially, this phenomenon is purely measurement-induced: in the absence of measurements, we find states where the corresponding unitary evolution does not display any Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we uncover a novel measurement-induced symmetry restoration mechanism: below a critical measurement rate, the symmetry remains broken, but beyond a threshold, it is fully restored in the thermodynamic limit--along with the emergence of the quantum Mpemba effect.

Title: Generalized Uncertainty Principle For Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Tarek Yehia
Abstract: We introduce an extension of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that broadens the traditional limits by incorporating the dynamical evolution of the observables. We establish a bound on the simultaneous precision of observables and their rate of change. The relation is derived from established and fundamental uncertainty principles and Heisenberg's equation of motion, we will show that it recovers standard uncertainty limits when applied to well-known cases. We will show its implications through analytical and numerical studies in many quantum systems. These include 1D harmonic oscillator and free particle, relativistic Dirac particle, spin-1/2 particle, Jaynes-Cummings model, QFT, and QED. This relation offers new insights into quantum dynamics and speed limits.

Title: A Hybrid Measurement Scheme for Generating nonGaussian Spin States
Authors: Andrew Kolmer Forbes, Ivan H. Deutsch
Abstract: We present a protocol for generating nonclassical states of atomic spin ensembles through the backaction induced by a hybrid measurement of light that is entangled with atoms, combining both homodyne and single photon detection. In phase-I of the protocol we create a spin squeezed state by measuring the light's polarization rotation due to the Faraday effect in a balanced polarimeter, equivalent to a homodyne measurement. In phase-II we send a second probe beam through the sample and detect single photons scattered into the signal mode. Before doing so, we rotate the uncertainty bubble to increase the projection fluctuations of the measured spin component. This increases the coupling strength between the atoms and photons and thus the rate of scattering of single photons into the signal mode. In the ideal case, the result is a squeezed Dicke state, with substantial quantum advantage for sensing spin rotations. We benchmark the protocol's utility in the presence of inevitable decoherence due to optical pumping using the Fisher information as a measure of quantum advantage. We show that in the presence of decoherence, the quantum Fisher information associated with the nonGaussian mixed state we prepare is substantially larger than the classical Fisher information obtained from the standard measurement of spin rotations. We deduce a measurement basis that is close to optimal for achieving the quantum Cram√©r Rao bound in the presence of decoherence.

Title: State-Agnostic Approach to Certifying Electron-Photon Entanglement in Electron Microscopy
Authors: Phila Rembold, Santiago Beltr√°n-Romero, Alexander Preimesberger, Sergei Bogdanov, Isobel C. Bicket, Nicolai Friis, Elizabeth Agudelo, Dennis R√§tzel, Philipp Haslinger
Abstract: Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) enable atomic-scale imaging and characterisation, driving advances across fields from materials science to biology. Quantum correlations, specifically entanglement, may provide a basis for novel hybrid sensing techniques to make TEMs compatible with sensitive samples prone to radiation damage. We present a protocol to certify entanglement between electrons and photons naturally arising from certain coherent cathodoluminescence processes. Using mutually unbiased bases in position and momentum, our method allows robust, state-agnostic entanglement verification and provides a lower bound on the entanglement of formation, enabling quantitative comparisons across platforms. Simulations under experiment-inspired conditions and preliminary experimental data highlight the feasibility of implementing this approach in modern TEM systems with optical specimen access. Our work integrates photonic quantum information techniques with electron microscopy. It establishes a foundation for entanglement-based imaging at the atomic scale, offering a potential pathway to reduce radiation exposure.

Title: Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains
Authors: Dragan Markoviƒá, Mihailo ƒåubroviƒá
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.

Title: A diagrammatic formulation of local realism
Authors: James Fullwood
Abstract: Given two parties performing experiments in separate laboratories, we provide a diagrammatic formulation of what it means for the joint statistics of their experiments to satisfy local realism. In particular, we show that the principles of locality and realism are both captured by a single commutative diagram in the category of probability-preserving maps between finite probability spaces, and we also show that an assumption of such a diagrammatic formulation of local realism implies the standard CHSH inequality associated with dichotomic random variables. As quantum theory is known not to satisfy local realism, our formulation of local realism in terms of commutative diagrams provides yet another way in which the notion of non-commutativity plays a fundamental role in quantum theory. We note that we do not assume any prior knowledge of category theory or quantum theory, as this work is intended for philosophers, mathematicians and physicists alike.

Title: Optimizing confidence in negative-partial-transpose-based entanglement criteria
Authors: Lydia A. Kanari-Naish, Jack Clarke, Sofia Qvarfort, Michael R. Vanner
Abstract: A key requirement of any separable quantum state is that its density matrix has a positive partial transpose. For continuous bipartite quantum states, violation of this condition may be tested via the hierarchy of negative-partial-transpose (NPT) based entanglement criteria introduced by Shchukin and Vogel [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 230502 (2005)]. However, a procedure for selecting the optimal NPT-based criterion is currently lacking. Here, we develop a framework to select the optimal criterion by determining the level of confidence of criteria within the Shchukin and Vogel hierarchy for finite measurement number, environmental noise, and the optimal allocation of measurement resources. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply our statistical framework to prominent example Gaussian and non-Gaussian states, including the two-mode squeezed vacuum state, the quanta-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacuum state, and the two-mode Schr√∂dinger-cat state. Beyond bipartite inseparability tests, our framework can be applied to any Hermitian matrix constructed of observable moments and thus can be utilized for a wide variety of other nonclassicality criteria and multi-mode entanglement tests.

Title: Thermodynamic speed limit for non-adiabatic work and its classical-quantum decomposition
Authors: Aoi Yamauchi, Rihito Nagase, Kaixin Li, Takahiro Sagawa, Ken Funo
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental constraint on work far beyond the adiabatic regime is crucial to investigating fast and efficient energy extraction or consumption processes. In this study, we derive thermodynamic speed limits for non-adiabatic work and quantify the fundamental costs of non-adiabatic work extraction or consumption processes in open quantum systems, where the costs are quantified by geometric and thermodynamic quantities. We further decompose the non-adiabatic work into classical and quantum contributions and derive their thermodynamic speed limits, clarifying the classical and quantum nature of the fundamental costs. The obtained results are numerically demonstrated by driven two-level systems.

Title: Infinite-dimensional Extension of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation: Theorems and Applications
Authors: Rundi Lu, Hao-En Li, Zhengwei Liu, Jin-Peng Liu
Abstract: We generalize the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation (LCHS) formula [An, Liu, Lin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2023] to simulate time-evolution operators in infinite-dimensional spaces, including scenarios involving unbounded operators. This extension, named Inf-LCHS for short, bridges the gap between finite-dimensional quantum simulations and the broader class of infinite-dimensional quantum dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Furthermore, we propose two sampling methods by integrating the infinite-dimensional LCHS with Gaussian quadrature schemes (Inf-LCHS-Gaussian) or Monte Carlo integration schemes (Inf-LCHS-MC). We demonstrate the applicability of the Inf-LCHS theorem to a wide range of non-Hermitian dynamics, including linear parabolic PDEs, queueing models (birth-or-death processes), Schr√∂dinger equations with complex potentials, Lindblad equations, and black hole thermal field equations. Our analysis provides insights into simulating general linear dynamics using a finite number of quantum dynamics and includes cost estimates for the corresponding quantum algorithms.

Title: Breakdown of time-independent methods in non-Hermitian scattering systems
Authors: Chao Zheng
Abstract: Time-independent methods, such as the transfer matrix method, are widely used to analyze the scattering properties of non-Hermitian systems. However, we demonstrate that these methods become invalid when the scattering matrix (S-matrix) exhibits poles in the first quadrant of the complex wave-number plane, indicating the presence of time-growing bound states within the system. The breakdown of time-independent approaches is attributed to their inherent omission of these bound states. We illustrate this using tight-binding models where non-Hermiticity is introduced through imaginary on-site potentials or asymmetric hopping terms. In all the models considered, parameter regimes exist where time-independent methods fail. Our findings highlight the critical importance of examining the distribution of S-matrix poles when applying time-independent methods to non-Hermitian scattering systems. Inappropriate application of these methods can lead to unphysical results and erroneous conclusions.

Title: Controllable single-photon scattering in a Rydberg-atom-waveguide system via van der Waals interactions
Authors: Peng-Fei Wang, Lei Huang, Yi-Long-Yue Guo, Jing Wang, Han-Xiao Zhang, Hong Yang, Dong Yan
Abstract: We investigate single-photon scattering in a system comprising a waveguide coupled to a pair of Rydberg atoms, illuminated by a coherent field. By adjusting the interatomic distance, we can transition between the Rydberg blockade and Rydberg antiblockade regimes, as the van der Waals interaction strength varies with distance. These distinct regimes, manifesting themselves in single-photon scattering, allow flexible reflection control due to their analogy to those of a small- and giant-atom interactions with the waveguide. We also derive scattering criteria for Rydberg blockade and Rydberg antiblockade, corresponding to specific single-photon reflection spectrum. Based on these criteria, the blockade and antiblockade distances can be estimated.

Title: Optimized quantum entanglement network enabled by a state-multiplexing quantum light source
Authors: Yun-Ru Fan, Yue Luo, Kai Guo, Jin-Peng Wu, Hong Zeng, Guang-Wei Deng, You Wang, Hai-Zhi Song, Zhen Wang, Li-Xing You, Guang-Can Guo, Qiang Zhou
Abstract: A fully connected quantum network with a wavelength division multiplexing architecture plays an increasingly pivotal role in quantum information technology. With such architecture, an entanglement-based network has been demonstrated in which an entangled photon-pair source distributes quantum entanglement resources to many users. Despite these remarkable advances, the scalability of the architecture could be constrained by the finite spectrum resource, where O(N^2)wavelength channels are needed to connect N users, thus impeding further progress in real-world scenarios. Here, we propose an optimized scheme for the wavelength division multiplexing entanglement-based network using a state-multiplexing quantum light source. With a dual-pump configuration, the feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by generating state-multiplexing photon pairs at multiple wavelength channels with a silicon nitride microring resonator chip. In our demonstration, we establish a fully connected graph between four users with six wavelength channels - saving half of which without sacrificing functionality and performance of the secure communication. A total asymptotic secure key rate of 1946.9 bps is obtained by performing the BBM92 protocol with the distributed state. The network topology of our method has great potential for developing a scalable quantum network with significantly minimized infrastructure requirements.

Title: High-precision measurement of microwave electric field by cavity-enhanced critical behavior in a many-body Rydberg atomic system
Authors: Qinxia Wang, Yukang Liang, Zhihui Wang, Shijun Guan, Pengfei Yang, Pengfei Zhang, Gang Li, Tiancai Zhang
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that the Rydberg criticality in a many-body atomic system can enhance the measurement sensitivity of the microwave electric field by increasing the Fisher information. In our previous work, we proposed and experimentally verified that the Fisher information near the critical point can be increased by more than two orders of magnitude with the Rydberg atoms coupled with an optical cavity compared with that in free space. Here we demonstrate the precision measurement of the microwave electric field by cavity-enhanced critical behavior. We show that the equivalent measurement sensitivity of the microwave electric field can be enhanced by an order of magnitude compared with that in free space. The obtained sensitivity can be enhanced to 2.6 nV/cm/Hz$^{1/2}$.

Title: Linear optical quantum computing with a hybrid squeezed cat code
Authors: Shohei Kiryu, Kosuke Fukui, Atsushi Okamoto, Akihisa Tomita
Abstract: In recent years, squeezed cat codes with resilience to specific types of loss have been proposed as a step toward realizing fault-tolerant optical quantum computers. However, error correction for squeezed cat codes requires a strong nonlinearity, which makes its implementation challenging with current technology. We propose a novel hybrid code that combines the squeezed cat code and the polarization qubit. First, we propose a generation method and a universal gate set that can be implemented with a linear optical system. Then, we show the superiority of the hybrid squeezed cat code over the hybrid cat code and the squeezed cat code through numerical simulations. These results demonstrate that the hybrid squeezed cat code is a promising candidate as a new resource for optical quantum information processing.

Title: Universal quantum control with error correction
Authors: Zhu-yao Jin, Jun Jing
Abstract: Error correction is generally demanded in large-scale quantum information processing and quantum computation. We here provide a universal and realtime control strategy to cope with arbitrary type of errors in the system Hamiltonian. The strategy provides multiple error-resilient paths of the interested system by the von Neumann equation for ancillary projection operators. With no extra control fields and precise designs, only the path-dependent global phase is required to vary rapidly to suppress the error-induced transitions among distinct paths. Those corrected paths can also be regarded as the approximate solutions to the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation perturbated by errors. We practice the strategy with the cyclic transfer of populations in a three-level system, showing a superior error-resilience to parallel transport. Our universal control theory can advance the performance of various quantum tasks on imperfect systems.

Title: Applications of the Quantum Phase Difference Estimation Algorithm to the Excitation Energies in Spin Systems on a NISQ Device
Authors: Boni Paul, Sudhindu Bikash Mandal, Kenji Sugisaki, B. P. Das
Abstract: The Quantum Phase Difference Estimation (QPDE) algorithm, as an extension of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), is a quantum algorithm designed to compute the differences of two eigenvalues of a unitary operator by exploiting the quantum superposition of two eigenstates. Unlike QPE, QPDE is free of controlled-unitary operations, and is suitable for calculations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We present the implementation and verification of a novel early fault-tolerant QPDE algorithm for determining energy gaps across diverse spin system configurations using NISQ devices. The algorithm is applied to the systems described by two and three-spin Heisenberg Hamiltonians with different geometric arrangements and coupling strengths, including symmetric, asymmetric, spin-frustrated, and non-frustrated configurations. By leveraging the match gate-like structure of the time evolution operator of Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we achieve constant-depth quantum circuits suitable for NISQ hardware implementation. Our results on IBM quantum processors show remarkable accuracy ranging from 85\% to 93\%, demonstrating excellent agreement with classical calculations even in the presence of hardware noise. The methodology incorporates sophisticated quantum noise suppression techniques, including Pauli Twirling and Dynamical Decoupling, and employs an adaptive framework. Our findings demonstrate the practical viability of the QPDE algorithm for quantum many-body simulations on current NISQ hardware, establishing a robust framework for future applications.

Title: A cavity QED system with defect-free single-atom array strongly coupled to an optical cavity
Authors: Zhihui Wang, Shijun Guan, Guansheng Teng, Pengfei Yang, Pengfei Zhang, Gang Li, Tiancai Zhang
Abstract: We experimentally realize a new cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) platform with defect-free single-atom array strongly coupled to an optical cavity. The defect-free single-atom array is obtained by rearranging a probabilistically loaded one-dimensional (1D) optical tweezer array with dimensions of $1 \times 40$. The atom array is enclosed with two cavity mirrors, which compose a miniature optical Fabry-P{√©}rot cavity with cavity length of 1.15 mm. By precisely controlling the position of the atom array, we demonstrate uniform and strong coupling of all atoms in the array with the optical cavity. The average coupling strength between the single atom and the cavity is 2.62 MHz. The vacuum Rabi splitting spectra for single-atom arrays with atom number $N$ changing from 3 to 26 are measured. Thus, the collective enhancement of the coupling strength with ${\sqrt N}$-dependence for multiple atoms is validated at the single atom level. Our system holds significant potential for establishing the foundation of distributed quantum computing and advancing fundamental research in many-body physics.

Title: Postponing the choice: advantage of deferred measurements in quantum information processing
Authors: C. Carmeli, T. Heinosaari, A. Toigo
Abstract: Simultaneously implementing two arbitrary quantum measurements on the same system is impossible. The consequence of this limitation is that selecting one measurement actively excludes other possibilities. Two incompatible choices can then be forced together only at the cost of adding enough noise to the measurements. An intriguing alternative is to postpone the choice, or part of it, until a later stage. We explore the advantages of this deferred decision-making and discover that the benefits critically depends on the assumptions about the forthcoming choice. In certain scenarios postponing the choice introduces no additional cost, while in others partial postponement can be effectively the same as full postponement.

Title: AI-Powered Noisy Quantum Emulation: Generalized Gate-Based Protocols for Hardware-Agnostic Simulation
Authors: Matthew Ho, Jun Yong Khoo, Adrian M. Mak, Stefano Carrazza
Abstract: Quantum computer emulators model the behavior and error rates of specific quantum processors. Without accurate noise models in these emulators, it is challenging for users to optimize and debug executable quantum programs prior to running them on the quantum device, as device-specific noise is not properly accounted for. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a general protocol to approximate device-specific emulators without requiring pulse-level control. By applying machine learning to data obtained from gate set tomography, we construct a device-specific emulator by predicting the noise model input parameters that best match the target device. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol's emulator in estimating the unitary coupled cluster energy of the H$_2$ molecule and compare the results with those from actual quantum hardware. Remarkably, our noise model captures device noise with high accuracy, achieving a mean absolute difference of just 0.3\% in expectation value relative to the state-vector simulation.

Title: Low crosstalk modular flip-chip architecture for coupled superconducting qubits
Authors: Soeren Ihssen, Simon Geisert, Gabriel Jauma, Patrick Winkel, Martin Spiecker, Nicolas Zapata, Nicolas Gosling, Patrick Paluch, Manuel Pino, Thomas Reisinger, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer, Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll, Ioan M. Pop
Abstract: We present a flip-chip architecture for an array of coupled superconducting qubits, in which circuit components reside inside individual microwave enclosures. In contrast to other flip-chip approaches, the qubit chips in our architecture are electrically floating, which guarantees a simple, fully modular assembly of capacitively coupled circuit components such as qubit, control, and coupling structures, as well as reduced crosstalk between the components. We validate the concept with a chain of three nearest neighbor coupled generalized flux qubits in which the center qubit acts as a frequency-tunable coupler. Using this coupler, we demonstrate a transverse coupling on/off ratio $\approx$ 50, zz-crosstalk $\approx$ 0.7 kHz between resonant qubits and isolation between the qubit enclosures > 60 dB.

Title: Quantum generative classification with mixed states
Authors: Diego H. Useche, Sergio Quiroga-Sandoval, Sebastian L. Molina, Vladimir Vargas-Calder√≥n, Juan E. Ardila-Garc√≠a, Fabio A. Gonz√°lez
Abstract: Classification can be performed using either a discriminative or a generative learning approach. Discriminative learning consists of constructing the conditional probability of the outputs given the inputs, while generative learning consists of constructing the joint probability density of the inputs and outputs. Although most classical and quantum methods are discriminative, there are some advantages of the generative learning approach. For instance, it can be applied to unsupervised learning, statistical inference, uncertainty estimation, and synthetic data generation. In this article, we present a quantum generative multiclass classification strategy, called quantum generative classification (QGC). This model uses a variational quantum algorithm to estimate the joint probability density function of features and labels of a data set by means of a mixed quantum state. We also introduce a quantum map called quantum-enhanced Fourier features (QEFF), which leverages quantum superposition to prepare high-dimensional data samples in quantum hardware using a small number of qubits. We show that the quantum generative classification algorithm can be viewed as a Gaussian mixture that reproduces a kernel Hilbert space of the training data. In addition, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network that shows that it is possible to perform generative classification on high-dimensional data sets. The method was tested on various low- and high-dimensional data sets including the 10-class MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data sets, illustrating that the generative classification strategy is competitive against other previous quantum models.

Title: Efficient and Universal Neural-Network Decoder for Stabilizer-Based Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Gengyuan Hu, Wanli Ouyang, Chao-Yang Lu, Chen Lin, Han-Sen Zhong
Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for large-scale quantum computing, but the absence of efficient decoders for new codes like quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes has hindered progress. Here we introduce a universal decoder based on linear attention sequence modeling and graph neural network that operates directly on any stabilizer code's graph structure. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this decoder outperforms specialized algorithms in both accuracy and speed across diverse stabilizer codes, including surface codes, color codes, and QLDPC codes. The decoder maintains linear time scaling with syndrome measurements and requires no structural modifications between different codes. For the Bivariate Bicycle code with distance 12, our approach achieves a 39.4% lower logical error rate than previous best decoders while requiring only ~1% of the decoding time. These results provide a practical, universal solution for quantum error correction, eliminating the need for code-specific decoders.

Title: Quantum information flow in impurity qubits interacting with Bose-Bose mixtures
Authors: Abdelaali Boudjemaa, Lan Xu, Qing-Shou Tan
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of quantum information flow in one and two impurity qubits trapped in a double-well potential and interacting with a one-dimensional ultracold Bose-Bose mixture reservoir. For a single qubit immersed in a binary Bose mixture, we show that the system maintains coherence over finite timescales and exhibits non-Markovian dynamics, particularly in the upper branch of the environment. We explore the transition from Markovian to non-Markovian dephasing through the Ohmicity of the spectral density functions, which are significantly influenced by interspecies interactions. In the case of two spatially separated qubits coupled to the Bose-Bose mixture reservoir, we demonstrate that collective decoherence affects the system dynamics, leading to prolonged coherence survival in both branches of the mixture. The intricate evolution of the decoherence factors is reflected in the density spectral functions and their Ohmicity characteristics. We find that the decoherence functions and spectra oscillate with increasing distance between the qubits, modifying the information flow dynamics. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation of the entanglement dynamics between the two qubits induced by the binary Bose mixture reservoir in both branches, underscoring the critical role of interspecies interactions.

Title: Local ergotropy dynamically witnesses many-body localized phases
Authors: Francesco Formicola, Grazia Di Bello, Giulio De Filippis, Vittorio Cataudella, Donato Farina, Carmine Antonio Perroni
Abstract: Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems which fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.

Title: Generating long-distance magnetic couplings with flat bands
Authors: Georges Bouzerar, Maxime Thumin
Abstract: One of the great challenges for the large-scale development of quantum technologies is to generate and control the entanglement of quantum bits through interactions of sufficiently long range. Two decades ago, spin chains have been proposed for quantum communication. Unfortunately, couplings are of very short range in general which drastically limits the communication to very short distances. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of flat bands (FBs) can trigger very long-distance magnetic couplings in spin chains. Furthermore, we show that the typical decaying lengthscale is directly related to the quantum metric of the flat band eigenstates. We believe that our unexpected findings could open up an alternative route to enable long-distance quantum communication.

Title: The likelihood operator and Fisher information in quantum probability
Authors: Kalyan B. Sinha, Ritabrata Sengupta
Abstract: We study the problem of Quantum Likelihood Operators (LO) and their connection with quantum Fisher information (QFI). It is observed that the present approaches to this problem tacitly assume commutativity of parametrised density matrix $\rho_\theta$ and its derivative, which, in general, need not be true, and this has nontrivial consequences in QFI. As examples, we discuss the parametrised two-level system exhaustively, and, as a further example, the one-mode coherent states of an infinite-dimensional system.

Title: Enhancing quantum computations with the synergy of auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo and computational basis tomography
Authors: Viktor Khinevich, Wataru Mizukami
Abstract: In general, quantum chemical calculations using quantum computers do not accurately describe dynamical correlation effects. The quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) algorithm proposed by Huggins et al. [Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)] addresses this challenge effectively. However, approaches such as classical and matchgate shadow tomography often require deeper circuits or large numbers of shots, making them less practical on current quantum hardware. In contrast, computational basis tomography (CBT) employs shallow circuits and is thus more suited to realistically constrained shot budgets, enabling efficient extraction of CI coefficients even with near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QC-CBT-AFQMC on molecular systems such as the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and the nitrogen molecule. The resulting potential energy curves agree closely with established classical benchmarks, including CCSD(T) and NEVPT2. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active-space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques. These results highlight the potential of QC-CBT-AFQMC as a practical method for quantum computational chemistry.

Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous parity-time (PT )-symmetry breaking and spectral properties of a PT symmetric quantum kicked rotor under resonance conditions. At resonance, the QKR reduces to a finite-dimensional system. In the localized regime, we find that increasing the non-Hermitian parameter always induces a transition from a phase where the states exhibit PT symmetry to one where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. In contrast, in the delocalized regime, the existence of such a transition depends on whether the reduced system is PT symmetric. If the reduced system is not PT symmetric, PT symmetry remains in the broken phase regardless of the non-Hermitian parameter. We further analyze the spectral statistics of the system in the delocalized regime. For real energy spectra, the level-spacing distribution transitions from Wigner-Dyson statistics, associated with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, to Poisson statistics as the non-Hermitian parameter increases, with the intermediate regime well described by the Brody distribution. For complex spectra, the level-spacing ratios and distributions are governed by time-reversal symmetry. The spectral statistics align with predictions for non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles in classes AI‚Ä† and A, depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry. Our results provide insights into the spectral characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum chaotic systems and their connection to PT symmetry.

Title: Electric-field control of photon indistinguishability in cascaded decays in quantum dots
Authors: Gabriel Undeutsch, Maximilian Aigner, Ailton J. Garcia Jr., Johannes Reindl, Melina Peter, Simon Mader, Christian Weidinger, Saimon F. Covre da Silva, Santanu Manna, Eva Sch√∂ll, Armando Rastelli
Abstract: Photon indistinguishability, entanglement, and antibunching are key ingredients in quantum optics and photonics. Decay cascades in quantum emitters offer a simple method to create entangled photon-pairs with negligible multi-pair generation probability. However, the degree of indistinguishability of the photons emitted in a cascade is intrinsically limited by the lifetime ratio of the involved transitions. Here we show that, for the biexciton-exciton cascade in a quantum dot, this ratio can be widely tuned by an applied electric field. Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements of two subsequently emitted biexciton photons show that their indistinguishability increases with increasing field, following the theoretically predicted behavior. At the same time, the emission linewidth stays close to the transform-limit, favoring applications relying on the interference among photons emitted by different sources.

Title: Disentangling by random pulses
Authors: Henryk Gzyl
Abstract: Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an entangled quantum state subject to random shocks and prove that disentanglement occurs asymptotically. The system consists of two identical, two level state systems, say two entangled qubits or two entangled two state molecules, and the heat bath consists of the occurrence of state switching shocks, which happen at a Poisson rate. The time dependence of such system can be explicitly obtained and the decay rate to disentanglement happens to be twice the frequency of the occurrence of shocks.

Title: Partial independence suffices to prove real Hilbert spaces insufficient in quantum physics
Authors: Mirjam Weilenmann, Nicolas Gisin, Pavel Sekatski
Abstract: The role of complex quantities in quantum theory has been puzzling physicists since the beginnings. Recently, it was shown that they are inevitable in network scenarios with independent sources. Indeed, quantum theory based on real Hilbert spaces cannot explain the predictions of quantum theory over complex Hilbert spaces [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Here, we revisit the independence assumption underlying this work. We show that assuming partial independence is sufficient for showing the inadequacy of quantum theory over real Hilbert spaces. We derive a trade-off between source independence and the Bell value achievable in real quantum theory, which also lower bounds the source correlations required to explain previous experiments with real quantum systems. We further show that 1 bit of entanglement is necessary and sufficient for recovering the complex quantum correlations by means of real quantum theory in the scenario from [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Finally, building on [McKague et al., PRL 102, 2009], we provide a construction to simulate any complex quantum setup with m independent sources by means of real quantum theory, by allowing the sources to share a m real-qubit entangled state in the first round of the experiment.

Title: High Efficiency Storage of Quasi-Classical and Quantum States in Coupled Resonators
Authors: Luiz O. R. Solak, Ciro M. Diniz, Daniel Z. Rossatto, Antonio S. M. de Castro, Charles A. Downing, Celso J. Villas-Boas
Abstract: We propose an optical model in which both quantum and quasi-classical states can be ideally stored using coupled resonators. The protocol is based on a time-dependent coupling between two cavities, carefully modulated to allow the complete transfer of an external propagating field from one cavity to another. The system maintains high storage efficiency (above $99.99\%$) even when error sources are introduced (up to $5\%$) in the coupling, such as amplitude deviation or a time delay between field propagation and coupling control. Furthermore, this procedure can be extended to store entangled states by considering either a pair of systems or bimodal cavities. Due to its high efficiency, this model may find application in current quantum technologies, such as quantum memories and quantum batteries, which rely on efficient quantum state storage.

Title: Thermodynamically Consistent Lindbladians for Quantum Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Jin-Fu Chen
Abstract: We develop a Lindblad framework for quantum stochastic thermodynamics to study the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of open quantum systems. Our approach adopts the local quantum detailed balance condition, ensuring thermodynamic consistency and leading to a joint fluctuation theorem of quantum work and heat. Instead of solving the full evolution of the density matrix, we employ an effective parametrization to derive the full counting statistics of work and heat and determine the optimal protocols. As an application, we refine the quantum Brownian motion master equation to ensure the quantum detailed balance condition, derive the optimal protocols at different temperatures, and study the work statistics. Our framework provides fundamental insights and practical strategies for optimizing thermodynamic processes in open quantum systems.

Title: Experimental realization of a quantum heat engine based on dissipation-engineered superconducting circuits
Authors: Tuomas Uusn√§kki, Timm M√∂rstedt, Wallace Teixeira, Miika Rasola, Mikko M√∂tt√∂nen
Abstract: Quantum heat engines (QHEs) have attracted long-standing scientific interest, especially inspired by considerations of the interplay between heat and work with the quantization of energy levels, quantum superposition, and entanglement. Operating QHEs calls for effective control of the thermal reservoirs and the eigenenergies of the quantum working medium of the engine. Although superconducting circuits enable accurate engineering of controlled quantum systems, beneficial in quantum computing, this framework has not yet been employed to experimentally realize a cyclic QHE. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum heat engine based on superconducting circuits, using a single-junction quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) as a two-way tunable heat reservoir coupled to a flux-tunable transmon qubit acting as the working medium of the engine. We implement a quantum Otto cycle by a tailored drive on the QCR to sequentially induce cooling and heating, interleaved with flux ramps that control the qubit frequency. Utilizing single-shot qubit readout, we monitor the evolution of the qubit state during several cycles of the heat engine and measure positive output powers and efficiencies that agree with our simulations of the quantum evolution. Our results verify theoretical models on the thermodynamics of quantum heat engines and advance the control of dissipation-engineered thermal environments. These proof-of-concept results pave the way for explorations on possible advantages of QHEs with respect to classical heat engines.

Title: Quantum algorithms and lower bounds for eccentricity, radius, and diameter in undirected graphs
Authors: Adam Weso≈Çowski, Jinge Bao
Abstract: The problems of computing eccentricity, radius, and diameter are fundamental to graph theory. These parameters are intrinsically defined based on the distance metric of the graph. In this work, we propose quantum algorithms for the diameter and radius of undirected, weighted graphs in the adjacency list model. The algorithms output diameter and radius with the corresponding paths in $\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{m})$ time. Additionally, for the diameter, we present a quantum algorithm that approximates the diameter within a $2/3$ ratio in $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m}n^{3/4})$ time. We also establish quantum query lower bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt{nm})$ for all the aforementioned problems through a reduction from the minima finding problem.

Title: An Amplitude-Encoding-Based Classical-Quantum Transfer Learning framework: Outperforming Classical Methods in Image Recognition
Authors: Shouwei Hu, Xi Li, Banyao Ruan, Zhihao Liu
Abstract: The classical-quantum transfer learning (CQTL) method is introduced to address the challenge of training large-scale, high-resolution image data on a limited number of qubits (ranging from tens to hundreds) in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale quantum (NISQ) era. existing CQTL frameworks have been demonstrate quantum advantages with a small number of parameters (around 50), but the performance of quantum neural networks is sensitive to the number of parameters. Currently, there is a lack of exploration into larger-scale quantum circuits with more parameters. This paper proposes an amplitude-encoding-based classical-quantum transfer learning (AE-CQTL) framework, accompanied by an effective learning algorithm. The AE-CQTL framework multiplies the parameters of quantum circuits by using multi-layer ansatz. Based on the AE-CQTL framework, we designed and implemented two CQTL neural network models: Transfer learning Quantum Neural Network (TLQNN) and Transfer Learning Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (TLQCNN). Both models significantly expand the parameter capacity of quantum circuits, elevating the parameter scale from a few dozen to over one hundred parameters. In cross-experiments with three benchmark datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10) and three source models (ResNet18, ResNet50 and DenseNet121), TLQNN and TLQCNN have exceeded the benchmark classical classifier in multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, convergence, stability, and generalization capability. Our work contributes to advancing the application of classical-quantum transfer learning on larger-scale quantum devices in future.

Title: Quantum LDPC codes for erasure-biased atomic quantum processors
Authors: Laura Pecorari, Guido Pupillo
Abstract: Identifying the best families of quantum error correction (QEC) codes for near-term experiments is key to enabling fault-tolerant quantum computing. Ideally, such codes should have low overhead in qubit number, high physical error thresholds, and moderate requirements on qubit connectivity to simplify experiments, while allowing for high logical error suppression. Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes have been recently shown to provide a path towards QEC with low qubit overhead and small logical error probabilities. Here, we demonstrate that when the dominant errors are erasures -- as can be engineered in different quantum computing architectures -- quantum LDPC codes additionally provide high thresholds and even stronger logical error suppression in parameter regimes that are accessible to current experiments. Using large-scale circuit-level QEC simulations, we benchmark the performance of two families of high-rate quantum LDPC codes, namely Clifford-deformed La-cross codes and Bivariate Bicycle codes, under a noise model strongly biased towards erasure errors. Both codes outperform the surface code by offering up to orders of magnitude lower logical error probabilities. Interestingly, we find that this decrease in the logical error probability may not be accompanied by an increase in the code threshold, as different QEC codes benefit differently from large erasure fractions. While here we focus on neutral atom qubits, the results also hold for other quantum platforms, such as trapped ions and superconducting qubits, for which erasure conversion has been demonstrated.

Title: Highly Entangled 2D Ground State: Tensor Network, Order Parameter and Correlation
Authors: Olai B. Mykland, Zhao Zhang
Abstract: In this article we present analytical results on the exact tensor network representation, spin order parameter and color correlation function of the first example of 2D ground states with entanglement phase transitions from area law to extensive entanglement entropy. The tensor network constructed is one dimension higher than the lattice of the physical system, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes in 3D space. The network directly generalizes the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the order parameter of in the spin sector from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, and the correlation in the color sector.

Title: Exploring experimental limit of deep quantum signal processing using a trapped-ion simulator
Authors: J.-T. Bu, Lei Zhang, Zhan Yu, Jing-Bo Wang, W.-Q. Ding, W.-F. Yuan, B. Wang, H.-J. Du, W.-J. Chen, L. Chen, J.-W. Zhang, J.-C. Li, F. Zhou, Xin Wang, M. Feng
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP), which enables systematic polynomial transformations on quantum data through sequences of qubit rotations, has emerged as a fundamental building block for quantum algorithms and data re-uploading quantum neural networks. While recent experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of shallow QSP circuits, the inherent limitations in scaling QSP to achieve complex transformations on quantum hardware remain an open and critical question. Here we report the first experimental realization of deep QSP circuits in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. By manipulating the qubit encoded in a trapped $^{43}\textrm{Ca}^{+}$ ion, we demonstrate high-precision simulation of some prominent functions used in quantum algorithms and machine learning, with circuit depths ranging from 15 to 360 layers and implementation time significantly longer than coherence time of the qubit. Our results reveal a crucial trade-off between the precision of function simulation and the concomitant accumulation of hardware noise, highlighting the importance of striking a balance between circuit depth and accuracy in practical QSP implementation. This work addresses a key gap in understanding the scalability and limitations of QSP-based algorithms on quantum hardware, providing valuable insights for developing quantum algorithms as well as practically realizing quantum singular value transformation and data re-uploading quantum machine learning models.

Title: Spatio-temporal tensor-network approaches to out-of-equilibrium dynamics bridging open and closed systems
Authors: Sergio Cerezo-Roquebr√∫n, Aleix Bou-Comas, Jan T. Schneider, Esperanza L√≥pez, Luca Tagliacozzo, Stefano Carignano
Abstract: The study of many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium remains a significant challenge with complexity barriers arising in both state and operator-based representations. In this work, we review recent approaches based on finding better contraction strategies for the full spatio-temporal tensor networks that encode the path integral of the dynamics, as well as the conceptual integration of influence functionals, process tensors, and transfer matrices within the tensor network formalism. We discuss recent algorithmic developments, highlight the complexity of influence functionals in various dynamical regimes and present consistent results of different communities, showing how ergodic dynamics render these functionals exponentially difficult to compress. Finally, we provide an outlook on strategies to encode complementary influence functional overlaps, paving the way for accurate descriptions of open and closed quantum systems with tensor networks.

Title: Microwave-coupled optical bistability in driven and interacting Rydberg gases
Authors: Zhehua Zhang, Zeyan Zhang, Shaoxing Han, Yuqing Zhang, Guoqing Zhang, Jizhou Wu, Vladimir B. Sovkov, Wenliang Liu, Yuqing Li, Linjie Zhang, Liantuan Xiao, Suotang Jia, Weibin Li, Jie Ma
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics are closely related to various fields of research, in which vastly different phases emerge when parameters are changed. However, it is difficult to construct nonequilibrium systems that have sufficiently tunable controllable parameters. Using microwave field coupling induced optical bistability, Rydberg gases exhibit a range of significantly different optical responses. In conjunction with electromagnetically induced transparency, the microwave coupling can create versatile nonequilibrium dynamics. In particular, the microwave coupling of two Rydberg states provides an additional handle for controlling the dynamics. And the microwave-controlled nonequilibrium phase transition has the potential to be applied in microwave field measurement. This study opens a new avenue to exploring bistable dynamics using microwave-coupled Rydberg gases, and developing quantum technological applications.

Title: Entanglement buffering with multiple quantum memories
Authors: √Ålvaro G. I√±esta, Bethany Davies, Sounak Kar, Stephanie Wehner
Abstract: Entanglement buffers are systems that maintain high-quality entanglement, ensuring it is readily available for consumption when needed. In this work, we study the performance of a two-node buffer, where each node has one long-lived quantum memory for storing entanglement and multiple short-lived memories for generating fresh entanglement. Newly generated entanglement may be used to purify the stored entanglement, which degrades over time. Stored entanglement may be removed due to failed purification or consumption. We derive analytical expressions for the system performance, which is measured using the entanglement availability and the average fidelity upon consumption. Our solutions are computationally efficient to evaluate, and they provide fundamental bounds to the performance of purification-based entanglement buffers. We show that purification must be performed as frequently as possible to maximise the average fidelity of entanglement upon consumption, even if this often leads to the loss of high-quality entanglement due to purification failures. Moreover, we obtain heuristics for the design of good purification policies in practical systems. A key finding is that simple purification protocols, such as DEJMPS, often provide superior buffering performance compared to protocols that maximize output fidelity.

Here we present a concise review of the progress made over the last few decades in the engineering of quantum light states. Although far from exhaustive, this review aims at providing a sufficiently wide and updated introduction that may serve as the entry point to such a fascinating and rapidly evolving field.

Title: Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Hong-Yu Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which the parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We further develop a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, in which the concrete example for $d=3$ parafermions is studied in detail. We also examine the real parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in superconducting devices. This work extends previous methods for twist defects in superconducting qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.

Title: Symmetry defects and gauging for quantum states with matrix product unitary symmetries
Authors: Adri√°n Franco-Rubio, Arkadiusz Bochniak, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: In this work, we examine the consequences of the existence of a finite group of matrix product unitary (MPU) symmetries for matrix product states (MPS). We generalize the well-understood picture of onsite unitary symmetries, which give rise to virtual symmetry defects given by insertions of operators in the bonds of the MPS. In the MPU case, we can define analogous defect tensors, this time sitting on lattice sites, that can be created, moved, and fused by local unitary operators. We leverage this formalism to study the gauging of MPU symmetries. We introduce a condition, block independence, under which we can gauge the symmetries by promoting the symmetry defects to gauge degrees of freedom, yielding an MPS of the same bond dimension that supports a local version of the symmetry given by commuting gauge constraints. Whenever block independence does not hold (which happens, in particular, whenever the symmetry representation is anomalous), a modification of our method which we call state-level gauging still gives rise to a locally symmetric MPS by promotion of the symmetry defects, at the expense of producing gauge constraints that do not commute on different sites.

Title: On the interpretability of neural network decoders
Authors: Lukas B√∂deker, Luc J. B. Kusters, Markus M√ºller
Abstract: Neural-network (NN) based decoders are becoming increasingly popular in the field of quantum error correction (QEC), including for decoding of state-of-the-art quantum computation experiments. In this work, we make use of established interpretability methods from the field of machine learning, to introduce a toolbox to achieve an understanding of the underlying decoding logic of NN decoders, which have been trained but otherwise typically operate as black-box models. To illustrate the capabilities of the employed interpretability method, based on the Shapley value approximation, we provide an examplary case study of a NN decoder that is trained for flag-qubit based fault-tolerant (FT) QEC with the Steane code. We show how particular decoding decisions of the NN can be interpreted, and reveal how the NN learns to capture fundamental structures in the information gained from syndrome and flag qubit measurements, in order to come to a FT correction decision. Further, we show that the understanding of how the NN obtains a decoding decision can be used on the one hand to identify flawed processing of error syndrome information by the NN, resulting in decreased decoding performance, as well as for well-informed improvements of the NN architecture. The diagnostic capabilities of the interpretability method we present can help ensure successful application of machine learning for decoding of QEC protocols.

Title: Quantum Natural Gradient optimizer on noisy platforms: QAOA as a case study
Authors: Federico Dell'Anna, Rafael Gomez-Lurbe, Armando Perez, Elisa Ercolessi
Abstract: We investigate the performance of the Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) optimizer in the presence of noise. Specifically, we evaluate the efficacy of QNG within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for finding the ground state of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM). Its performance is benchmarked against the Vanilla Gradient Descent optimizer across two prominent quantum computing platforms: Rydberg atoms and superconducting circuits. Our analysis includes simulations under both idealized noise-free conditions and realistic noisy environments based on calibration data from actual devices. Results demonstrate that QNG consistently outperforms Vanilla Gradient Descent, exhibiting faster convergence on average and greater robustness against random initializations of parameters. This robustness is attributed to the distance regularization in parameter space inherent to QNG. Additionally, QNG achieves a higher convergence rate to the solution, effectively avoiding certain local minima. These findings highlight QNG as a promising tool for optimizing variational quantum algorithms in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

Title: Moderate-length lifted quantum Tanner codes
Authors: Virgile Guemard, Gilles Z√©mor
Abstract: We introduce new families of quantum Tanner codes, a class of quantum codes which first appeared in the work of Leverrier and Z√©mor. These codes are built from two classical Tanner codes, for which the underlying graphs are extracted from coverings of 2D geometrical complexes, and the local linear codes are tensor-product of cyclic or double-circulant linear codes. We present several explicit families, and identify instances of moderate length quantum codes which are degenerate, have low check weight, and for which the distance surpasses the square root of the code length. Among them, we report the existence of a $[[96,2,12]]$ code, for which half of the checks are of weight 8 and the other half of weight 4.

Abstract: The implementation of large-scale universal quantum computation represents a challenging and ambitious task on the road to quantum processing of information. In recent years, an intermediate approach has been pursued to demonstrate quantum computational advantage via non-universal computational models. A relevant example for photonic platforms has been provided by the Boson Sampling paradigm and its variants, which are known to be computationally hard while requiring at the same time only the manipulation of the generated photonic resources via linear optics and detection. Beside quantum computational advantage demonstrations, a promising direction towards possibly useful applications can be found in the field of quantum machine learning, considering the currently almost unexplored intermediate scenario between non-adaptive linear optics and universal photonic quantum computation. Here, we report the experimental implementation of quantum machine learning protocols by adding adaptivity via post-selection to a Boson Sampling platform based on universal programmable photonic circuits fabricated via femtosecond laser writing. Our experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive Boson Sampling is a viable route towards dimension-enhanced quantum machine learning with linear optical devices.

Title: Shadow measurements for feedback-based quantum optimization
Authors: Leticia Bertuzzi, Jo√£o P. Engster, Evandro C. R. da Rosa, Eduardo I. Duzzioni
Abstract: Improving the performance of quantum algorithms is a fundamental task to achieve quantum advantage. In many cases, extracting information from quantum systems poses an important challenge for practical implementations in real-world quantum computers, given the high resource cost of performing state tomography. In this scenario, randomized measurements emerged as a promising tool. In particular, the classical shadows protocol allows one to retrieve expected values of low-weight Pauli observables by performing only local measurements. In this paper, we present an implementation of the recently introduced Feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization (FALQON) with the Ket quantum programming platform, for solving the MaxCut optimization problem. We employ classical shadows for the feedback routine of parameter estimation and compare this approach with the direct estimation of observables. Our results show that depending on the graph geometry for the MaxCut problem, the number of measurements required to estimate expected values of observables with classical shadows can be up to 16 times lower than with direct observable estimation. Furthermore, by analyzing complete graphs, we numerically confirm a logarithmic growth in the required number of measurements relative to the number of observables, reinforcing that classical shadows can be a useful tool for estimating low-locality Pauli observables in quantum algorithms.

Title: Hamiltonian Learning at Heisenberg Limit for Hybrid Quantum Systems
Authors: Lixing Zhang, Ze-Xun Lin, Prineha Narang, Di Luo
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems are fundamental in quantum materials and quantum information science. In this work, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian learning in hybrid spin-boson systems can achieve the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, we establish a rigorous theoretical framework proving that, given access to an unknown hybrid Hamiltonian system, our algorithm can estimate the Hamiltonian coupling parameters up to root mean square error (RMSE) $\epsilon$ with a total evolution time scaling as $T \sim \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ using only $\mathcal{O}({\rm polylog}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ measurements. Furthermore, it remains robust against small state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. In addition, we also provide an alternative algorithm based on distributed quantum sensing, which significantly reduces the maximum evolution time per this http URL validate our method, we apply it to the generalized Dicke model for Hamiltonian learning and the spin-boson model for spectrum learning, demonstrating its efficiency in practical quantum systems. These results provide a scalable and robust framework for precision quantum sensing and Hamiltonian characterization in hybrid quantum platforms.

Title: Fault-Resilience of Dissipative Processes for Quantum Computing
Authors: James Purcell, Abhishek Rajput, Toby Cubitt
Abstract: Dissipative processes have long been proposed as a means of performing computational tasks on quantum computers that may be intrinsically more robust to noise. In this work, we prove two main results concerning the error-resilience capabilities of two types of dissipative algorithms: dissipative ground state preparation in the form of the dissipative quantum eigensolver (DQE), and dissipative quantum computation (DQC). The first result is that under circuit-level depolarizing noise, a version of the DQE algorithm applied to the geometrically local, stabilizer-encoded Hamiltonians that arise naturally when fermionic Hamiltonians are represented in qubits, can suppress the additive error in the ground space overlap of the final output state exponentially in the code distance. This enables us to get closer to fault-tolerance for this task without the associated overhead. In contrast, for computation as opposed to ground state preparation, the second result proves that DQC is no more robust to noise than the standard quantum circuit model.

Title: The number of fundamental constants from a spacetime-based perspective
Authors: George E. A. Matsas, Vicente Pleitez, Alberto Saa, Daniel A. T. Vanzella
Abstract: We revisit Duff, Okun, and Veneziano's divergent views on the number of fundamental constants and argue that the issue can be set to rest by having spacetime as the starting point. This procedure disentangles the resolution in what depends on the assumed spacetime (whether relativistic or not) from the theories built over it. By defining that the number of fundamental constants equals the minimal number of independent standards necessary to express all observables, as assumed by Duff, Okun, and Veneziano, it is shown that the same units fixed by the apparatuses used to construct the spacetimes are enough to express all observables of the physical laws defined over them. As a result, the number of fundamental constants equals two in Galilei spacetime and one in relativistic spacetimes.

Title: The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter
Authors: Romuald A. Janik
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.

Title: Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Charlie Cummings
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on "link complements", i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to GHZ-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state.

Title: Local Quenches from a Krylov Perspective
Authors: Pawel Caputa, Giuseppe Di Giulio
Abstract: In this work, we investigate local quench dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theories using Krylov space methods. We derive Lanczos coefficients, spread complexity, and Krylov entropies for local joining and splitting quenches in theories on an infinite line, a circle, a finite interval, and at finite temperature. We examine how these quantities depend on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and find that both spread complexity and Krylov entropy are proportional to it. Interestingly, Krylov entropies evolve logarithmically with time, mirroring standard entanglement entropies, making them useful for extracting the central charge. In the large central charge limit, using holography, we establish a connection between the rate of spread complexity and the proper momentum of the tip of the end-of-the world brane, which probes the bulk analogously to a point particle. Our results further demonstrate that spread complexity and Krylov entropies are powerful tools for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems.

Title: Signatures of collective photon emission and ferroelectric ordering of excitons near their Mott insulating state in a WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer
Authors: Luka Matej Devenica, Zach Hadjri, Jan Kumlin, Runtong Li, Weijie Li, Daniel Suarez Forrero, Valeria Vento, Nicolas Ubrig, Song Liu, James Hone, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Thomas Pohl, Ajit Srivastava
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking, arising from the competition of interactions and quantum fluctuations, is fundamental to understanding ordered electronic phases. Although electrically neutral, optical excitations like excitons can interact through their dipole moment, raising the possibility of optically active ordered phases. The effects of spontaneous ordering on optical properties remain largely unexplored. Recent observations of the excitonic Mott insulating state in semiconducting moir√© crystals make them promising for addressing this question. Here, we present evidence for an in-plane ferroelectric phase of dipolar moir√© excitons driven by strong exciton-exciton interactions. We discover a surprising speed-up of photon emission at late times and low densities in excitonic decay. This counterintuitive behavior is attributed to collective radiance, linked to the transition between disordered and symmetry-broken ferroelectric phases of moir√© excitons. Our findings provide first evidence for strong dipolar inter-site interactions in moir√© lattices, demonstrate collective photon emission as a probe for moir√© quantum materials, and pave the way for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Local Optimization of Quantum Circuits (Extended Version)
Authors: Jatin Arora, Mingkuan Xu, Sam Westrick, Pengyu Liu, Dantong Li, Yongshan Ding, Umut A. Acar
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum architectures and computing have motivated the development of new optimizing compilers for quantum programs or circuits. Even though steady progress has been made, existing quantum optimization techniques remain asymptotically and practically inefficient and are unable to offer guarantees on the quality of the optimization. Because many global quantum circuit optimization problems belong to the complexity class QMA (the quantum analog of NP), it is not clear whether quality and efficiency guarantees can both be achieved. In this paper, we present optimization techniques for quantum programs that can offer both efficiency and quality guarantees. Rather than requiring global optimality, our approach relies on a form of local optimality that requires each and every segment of the circuit to be optimal. We show that the local optimality notion can be attained by a cut-and-meld circuit optimization algorithm. The idea behind the algorithm is to cut a circuit into subcircuits, optimize each subcircuit independently by using a specified "oracle" optimizer, and meld the subcircuits by optimizing across the cuts lazily as needed. We specify the algorithm and prove that it ensures local optimality. To prove efficiency, we show that, under some assumptions, the main optimization phase of the algorithm requires a linear number of calls to the oracle optimizer. We implement and evaluate the local-optimality approach to circuit optimization and compare with the state-of-the-art optimizers. The empirical results show that our cut-and-meld algorithm can outperform existing optimizers significantly, by more than an order of magnitude on average, while also slightly improving optimization quality. These results show that local optimality can be a relatively strong optimization criterion and can be attained efficiently.

Title: Comment on "InAs-Al hybrid devices passing the topological gap protocol", Microsoft Quantum, Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023)
Authors: Henry F. Legg
Abstract: The topological gap protocol (TGP) is presented as "a series of stringent experimental tests" for the presence of topological superconductivity and associated Majorana bound states. Here, we show that the TGP, 'passed' by Microsoft Quantum [PRB 107, 245423 (2023)], lacks a consistent definition of 'gap' or 'topological', and even utilises different parameters when applied to theoretical simulations compared to experimental data. Furthermore, the TGP's outcome is sensitive to the choice of magnetic field range, bias voltage range, data resolution, and number of cutter voltage pairs - data parameters that, in PRB 107, 245423 (2023), vary significantly, even for measurements of the same device. As a result, the core claims of PRB 107, 245423 (2023) are primarily based on unexplained measurement choices and inconsistent definitions, rather than on intrinsic properties of the studied devices. As such, Microsoft Quantum's claim in PRB 107, 245423 (2023) that their devices have a "high probability of being in the topological phase" is not reliable and must be revisited. Our findings also suggest that subsequent studies, e.g. Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), that are based on tuning up devices via the TGP are built on a flawed protocol and should also be revisited.

Title: First-Principles Framework for the Prediction of Intersystem Crossing Rates in Spin Defects: The Role of Electron Correlation
Authors: Yu Jin, Jinsoo Park, Marquis M. McMillan, Daniel Donghyon Ohm, Corrie Barnes, Benjamin Pingault, Christopher Egerstrom, Benchen Huang, Marco Govoni, F. Joseph Heremans, David D. Awschalom, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids are promising platforms for quantum technologies. Here, we present a first-principles framework to investigate intersystem crossing processes, which represent crucial steps in the optical spin-polarization cycle used to address spin defects. Considering the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a case study, we demonstrate that our framework effectively captures electron correlation effects in the calculation of many-body electronic states and their spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, while systematically addressing finite-size effects. We validate our predictions by carrying out measurements of fluorescence lifetimes, finding excellent agreement between theory and experiments. The framework presented here provides a versatile and robust tool for exploring the optical cycle of varied spin defects entirely from first principles.

Title: Robust Geometrical Dimensions in Uniform Directional Couplers
Authors: Jonatan Piasetzky, Khen Cohen, Yehonatan Drori, Amit Rotem, Yuval Warshavsky, Yaron Oz, Haim Suchowski
Abstract: Integrated photonics, a scalable platform for optical networks, sensors, and circuits, has experienced exponential growth. Over the past decade, these platforms have been increasingly harnessed for the emerging field of quantum integrated photonics. However, fabrication tolerances, such as waveguide width, wafer height variations, and sensitivity to temperature changes, significantly impact their robustness and performance. In this work, we identify and analyze stationary geometrical dimensions of directional couplers that enhance tolerance to such variations. Through theoretical predictions and experimental validation, we investigate the behavior of these robust dimensions under changes in refractive index, waveguide height, wavelength, and inter-waveguide distance. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of these stationary geometrical dimensions in a single-coupler design and subsequently utilize them to fabricate a quantum two-photon controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. The CNOT gate achieves an improved mean fidelity, as compared to a CNOT gate fabricated at a different arbitrary design point. This discovery highlights the potential of stationary geometrical dimensions for robust, high-performance photonic circuits and paves the way for new, resilient configurations in quantum technologies.

Title: Simulating Bulk Gap in Chiral Projected Entangled-Pair States
Authors: Ji-Yao Chen, Yi Tan, Sylvain Capponi, Didier Poilblanc, Fei Ye, Jia-Wei Mei
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have proven effective in capturing chiral spin liquid ground states, yet the presence of long-range ``gossamer'' correlation tails raises concerns about their ability to accurately describe bulk gaps. Here, we address this challenge and demonstrate that PEPS can reliably characterize gapped bulk excitations in chiral topological phases. Using a variational principle for excited states within a local mode approximation, we establish that correlation functions decaying faster than $r^{-2}$ are not necessarily related to gapless modes and thus long-range ``gossamer'' correlation tails in chiral PEPS do not contradict the presence of a bulk gap. This framework is validated in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kitaev model with a chiral term, where PEPS yields excitation gaps that agree well with exact solutions. Extending our approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model, we present compelling evidence for its chiral ground state and accurately resolve its gapped excitations. These findings thus solidify PEPS as a powerful tool for studying both ground and excited states in chiral topological systems, thereby bridging a key gap in the understanding of their bulk properties.

Title: Polynomial time classical versus quantum algorithms for representation theoretic multiplicities
Authors: Greta Panova
Abstract: Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.

Title: Discrete Superconvergence Analysis for Quantum Magnus Algorithms of Unbounded Hamiltonian Simulation
Authors: Yonah Borns-Weil, Di Fang, Jiaqi Zhang
Abstract: Motivated by various applications, unbounded Hamiltonian simulation has recently garnered great attention. Quantum Magnus algorithms, designed to achieve commutator scaling for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation, have been found to be particularly efficient for such applications. When applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, they exhibit an unexpected superconvergence phenomenon. However, existing proofs are limited to the spatially continuous setting and do not extend to discrete spatial discretizations. In this work, we provide the first superconvergence estimate in the fully discrete setting with a finite number of spatial discretization points $N$, and show that it holds with an error constant uniform in $N$. The proof is based on the two-parameter symbol class, which, to our knowledge, is applied for the first time in algorithm analysis. The key idea is to establish a semiclassical framework by identifying two parameters through the discretization number and the time step size rescaled by the operator norm, such that the semiclassical uniformity guarantees the uniformity of both. This approach may have broader applications in numerical analysis beyond the specific context of this work.

Title: Non-relativistic limit of Dirac Hamiltonians with Aharonov-Bohm fields
Authors: Matteo Gallone, Alessandro Michelangeli, Diego Noja
Abstract: We characterise the families of self-adjoint Dirac and Schr√∂dinger operators with Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field, and we exploit the non-relativistic limit of infinite light speed to connect the former to the latter. The limit consists of the customary removal of the rest energy and of a suitable scaling, with the light speed, of the short-scale boundary condition of self-adjointness. This ensures that the scattering length of the Aharonov-Bohm interaction is preserved along the limit. Noteworthy is the fact that the whole family of Dirac-AB operators is mapped, in the non-relativistic limit, into the physically relevant sub-family of $s$-wave, angular-momentum-commuting, Schr√∂\-dinger-AB Hamiltonians with relativistic Dirac approximants.

Title: Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors
Authors: Albert Georg Passegger, Rainer Verch
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.

Title: Entangling macroscopic light states by delocalized photon addition
Authors: Nicola Biagi, Luca S. Costanzo, Marco Bellini, Alessandro Zavatta
Abstract: We present the experimental generation of tunable entanglement between distinct field modes by the delocalized addition of a single photon. We show that one can preserve a high degree of entanglement even between macroscopically populated modes and illustrate this concept by adding a single photon to two modes containing identical coherent states of growing amplitude. Discorrelation, a new joint statistical property of multimode quantum states, is also experimentally demonstrated here for the first time.

Title: Power and temperature dependent model for High Q superconductors

Weddle ((1) Laboratory for Physical Sciences, University of Maryland), Christopher J.K. Richardson ((1) Laboratory for Physical Sciences, University of Maryland (3) Department of Material Science and Engineering, University of Maryland)
Abstract: Measuring the internal quality factor of coplanar waveguide superconducting resonators is an established method of determining small losses in superconducting devices. Traditionally, the resonator losses are only attributed to two-level system (TLS) defects using a power dependent model for the quality factor. However, excess non-equilibrium quasiparticles can also limit the quality factor of the planar superconducting resonators used in circuit quantum electrodynamics. At millikelvin temperatures, quasiparticles can be generated by breaking Cooper pairs via a single high-energy or multiple sub-gap photons. Here a two-temperature, power and temperature dependent model is proposed to evaluate resonator losses for isolating TLS and quasiparticle loss simultaneously. The model combines the conventional TLS power and temperature dependence with an effective temperature non-equilibrium quasiparticle description of the superconducting loss. The quasiparticle description is based on the quasiparticle number density calculated using rate equations for an external quasiparticle generation source, recombination, and trapping. The number density is translated to an effective temperature using a thermal distribution that may be different from the bath. Experimental measurements of high-quality factor resonators fabricated from single crystal aluminum and titanium nitride thin films on silicon are interpreted with the presented model. This approach enables identification of quasiparticle and TLS loss, resulting in the determination that the TiN resonator has comparable TLS and quasiparticle loss at low power and low-temperature, while the low-temperature Al resonator behavior is dominated by non-equilibrium quasiparticle loss.

Title: Entanglement-Assisted Covert Communication via Qubit Depolarizing Channels
Authors: Elyakim Zlotnick, Boulat Bash, Uzi Pereg
Abstract: We consider entanglement-assisted communication over the qubit depolarizing channel under the security requirement of covert communication, where not only the information is kept secret, but the transmission itself must be concealed from detection by an adversary. Previous work showed that $O(\sqrt{n})$ information bits can be reliably and covertly transmitted in $n$ channel uses without entanglement assistance. However, Gagatsos et al. (2020) showed that entanglement assistance can increase this scaling to $O(\sqrt{n}\log(n))$ for continuous-variable bosonic channels. Here, we present a finite-dimensional parallel, and show that $O(\sqrt{n}\log(n))$ covert bits can be transmitted reliably over $n$ uses of a qubit depolarizing channel. The coding scheme employs "weakly" entangled states such that their squared amplitude scales as $O(1/\sqrt{n})$.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Boson-Related Hamiltonians: Techniques, Effective Hamiltonian Construction, and Error Analysis
Authors: Bo Peng, Yuan Su, Daniel Claudino, Karol Kowalski, Guang Hao Low, Martin Roetteler
Abstract: A broad spectrum of physical systems in condensed-matter and high-energy physics, vibrational spectroscopy, and circuit and cavity QED necessitates the incorporation of bosonic degrees of freedom, such as phonons, photons, and gluons, into optimized fermion algorithms for near-future quantum simulations. In particular, when a quantum system is surrounded by an external environment, its basic physics can usually be simplified to a spin or fermionic system interacting with bosonic modes. Nevertheless, troublesome factors such as the magnitude of the bosonic degrees of freedom typically complicate the direct quantum simulation of these interacting models, necessitating the consideration of a comprehensive plan. This strategy should specifically include a suitable fermion/boson-to-qubit mapping scheme to encode sufficiently large yet manageable bosonic modes, and a method for truncating and/or downfolding the Hamiltonian to the defined subspace for performing an approximate but highly accurate simulation, guided by rigorous error analysis. In this pedagogical tutorial review, we aim to provide such an exhaustive strategy, focusing on encoding and simulating certain bosonic-related model Hamiltonians, inclusive of their static properties and time evolutions. Specifically, we emphasize two aspects: (1) the discussion of recently developed quantum algorithms for these interacting models and the construction of effective Hamiltonians, and (2) a detailed analysis regarding a tightened error bound for truncating the bosonic modes for a class of fermion-boson interacting Hamiltonians.

Title: New Protocols for Conference Key and Multipartite Entanglement Distillation
Authors: Farzin Salek, Andreas Winter
Abstract: We approach two interconnected problems of quantum information processing in networks: Conference key agreement and entanglement distillation, both in the so-called source model where the given resource is a multipartite quantum state and the players interact over public classical channels to generate the desired correlation. The first problem is the distillation of a conference key when the source state is shared between a number of legal players and an eavesdropper; the eavesdropper, apart from starting off with this quantum side information, also observes the public communication between the players. The second is the distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) from the given mixed state. These problem settings extend our previous paper [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 68(2):976-988, 2022], and we generalise its results: using a quantum version of the task of communication for omniscience, we derive novel lower bounds on the distillable conference key from any multipartite quantum state by means of non-interacting communication protocols. Secondly, we establish novel lower bounds on the yield of GHZ states from multipartite mixed states. Namely, we present two methods to produce bipartite entanglement between sufficiently many nodes so as to produce GHZ states. Next, we show that the conference key agreement protocol can be made coherent under certain conditions, enabling the direct generation of multipartite GHZ states.

Title: Extending the coherence time limit of a single-alkali-atom qubit by suppressing phonon-jumping-induced decoherence
Authors: Zhuangzhuang Tian, Haobo Chang, Xin Lv, Mengna Yang, Zhihui Wang, Pengfei Yang, Pengfei Zhang, Gang Li, Tiancai Zhang
Abstract: In the fields of quantum metrology and quantum information processing with the system of optically trapped single neutral atoms, the coherence time of qubit encoded in the electronic states is regarded as one of the most important parameters. Longer coherence time is always pursued for higher precision of measurement and quantum manipulation. The coherence time is usually assumed to be merely determined by relative stability of the energy between the electronic states, and the analysis of the decoherence was conducted by treating the atom motion classically. We proposed a complete description of the decoherence of a qubit encoded in two ground electronic states of an optically trapped alkali atom by adopting a full description of the atomic wavefunction. The motional state, i.e., the phonon state, is taken into account. In addition to decoherence due to the variance of differential light shift (DLS), a new decoherence mechanism, phonon-jumping-induced decoherence (PJID), was discovered and verified experimentally. The coherence time of a single-cesium-atom qubit can be extended to $T_2\approx 20$ s by suppressing both the variances of DLS and PJID by trapping the atom in a blue-detuned bottle beam trap (BBT) and preparing the atom in its three-dimensional motional ground states. The coherence time is the longest for a qubit encoded in an optically trapped single alkali atom. Our work provides a deep understanding of the decoherence mechanism for single atom qubits and thus provides a new way to extend the coherence time limit. The method can be applied for other atoms and molecules, opening up new prospects for high-precision control the quantum states of optically trapped atoms or molecules.

Title: Seedless extractors for device-independent quantum cryptography
Authors: Cameron Foreman, Lluis Masanes
Abstract: Device-independent (DI) quantum cryptography aims at providing secure cryptography with minimal trust in, or characterisation of, the underlying quantum devices. A key step in DI protocols is randomness extraction (or privacy amplification), which typically requires a \textit{seed} of additional bits with sufficient entropy and statistical independence from any bits generated during the protocol. In this work, we propose a method for extraction in DI protocols that does not require a seed and is secure against computationally unbounded quantum adversaries. The core idea is to use the Bell violation of the raw data, rather than its min-entropy, as the extractor promise. We present a complete security proof in a model where the experiment uses memoryless measurement devices acting on an arbitrary joint (across all rounds) state. Our results mark a first step in this alternative, seedless, approach to extraction in DI protocols.

Title: Entanglement Coordination Rates in Multi-User Networks
Authors: Hosen Nator, Uzi Pereg
Abstract: The optimal coordination rates are determined in three primary settings of multi-user quantum networks, thus characterizing the minimal resources required in order to simulate a joint quantum state among multiple parties. We study the following models: (1) a cascade network with rate-limited entanglement, (2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers, (3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotically-achievable communication and entanglement rates in each setting. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.

Title: Quantum metrology of rotations with mixed spin states
Authors: Eduardo Serrano-Ens√°stiga, Chryssomalis Chryssomalakos, John Martin
Abstract: The efficiency of a quantum metrology protocol can be significantly diminished by the interaction of the system with its environment, leading to a loss of purity and, as a result, a mixed state for the probing system. An example is the measurement of a magnetic field through the rotation of a spin that is subject to decoherence due to its coupling to a surrounding spin or bosonic bath. In this work, we define mixed optimal quantum rotosensors (OQRs) as mixed spin-$j$ states that achieve maximum sensitivity to estimate infinitesimal rotations, when the rotation axis is unknown. We study two scenarios, where the probe states saturate the averaged fidelity or the averaged quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound, the latter giving the ultimate sensitivity. We find that mixed OQRs can achieve sensitivity equal to that of pure states and are obtained by mixing states from linear subspaces of anticoherent states. We present several examples of mixed OQRs and their associated anticoherent subspaces. We also show that OQRs maximize entanglement in a specific sense, preserving the known relation between entanglement and optimal rotation sensitivity for pure states, even in the context of mixed states. Our results highlight the interconnection between quantum metrology of rotations, anticoherence and entanglement in mixed spin states.

Title: Correlated and Critical Phenomena in Multipartite Quantum Non-Markovianity
Authors: Ignacio Gonz√°lez, √Ångel Rivas
Abstract: We study non-Markovianity in the exact dynamics of two two-level atoms in a resonant cavity. We find a critical behavior in the form of a Markovian to non-Markovian transition at a finite interatomic distance and a discontinuity in the limit of infinitely close atoms. Actually, in this highly correlated regime, we find that non-Markovianity always arises if the system size exceeds a critical threshold. To this end, a non-singular, additive non-Markovian measure with appropriate asymptotic behavior is formulated. These results show how inter-subsystem distance and system size can act as precise controls for modulating memory effects in multipartite open quantum systems.

Title: Chaos and magic in the dissipative quantum kicked top
Authors: Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignano, Davide Rossini, Angelo Russomanno
Abstract: We consider an infinite-range interacting quantum spin-1/2 model, undergoing periodic kicking and dissipatively coupled with an environment. In the thermodynamic limit, it is described by classical mean-field equations that can show regular and chaotic regimes. At finite size, we describe the system dynamics using stochastic quantum trajectories. We find that the asymptotic nonstabilizerness (alias the magic, a measure of quantum complexity), averaged over trajectories, mirrors to some extent the classical chaotic behavior, while the entanglement entropy has no relation with chaos in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Walking through Hilbert Space with Quantum Computers
Authors: Tong Jiang, Jinghong Zhang, Moritz K. A. Baumgarten, Meng-Fu Chen, Hieu Q. Dinh, Aadithya Ganeshram, Nishad Maskara, Anton Ni, Joonho Lee
Abstract: Computations of chemical systems' equilibrium properties and non-equilibrium dynamics have been suspected of being a "killer app" for quantum computers. This review highlights the recent advancements of quantum algorithms tackling complex sampling tasks in the key areas of computational chemistry: ground state, thermal state properties, and quantum dynamics calculations. We review a broad range of quantum algorithms, from hybrid quantum-classical to fully quantum, focusing on the traditional Monte Carlo family, including Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational Monte Carlo, projector Monte Carlo, path integral Monte Carlo, etc. We also cover other relevant techniques involving complex sampling tasks, such as quantum-selected configuration interaction, minimally entangled typical thermal states, entanglement forging, and Monte Carlo-flavored Lindbladian dynamics. We provide a comprehensive overview of these algorithms' classical and quantum counterparts, detailing their theoretical frameworks and discussing the potentials and challenges in achieving quantum computational advantages.

Title: Non-symmetric GHZ states: weighted hypergraph and controlled-unitary graph representations
Authors: Hrachya Zakaryan, Konstantinos-Rafail Revis, Zahra Raissi
Abstract: Non-symmetric GHZ states ($n$-GHZ$_\alpha$), defined by unequal superpositions of $|00...0>$ and $|11...1>$, naturally emerge in experiments due to decoherence, control errors, and state preparation imperfections. Despite their relevance in quantum communication, relativistic quantum information, and quantum teleportation, these states lack a stabilizer formalism and a graph representation, hindering their theoretical and experimental analysis. We establish a graph-theoretic framework for non-symmetric GHZ states, proving their local unitary (LU) equivalence to two structures: fully connected weighted hypergraphs with controlled-phase interactions and star-shaped controlled-unitary (CU) graphs. While weighted hypergraphs generally lack stabilizer descriptions, we demonstrate that non-symmetric GHZ states can be efficiently stabilized using local operations and a single ancilla, independent of system size. We extend this framework to qudit systems, constructing LU-equivalent weighted qudit hypergraphs and showing that general non-symmetric qudit GHZ states can be described as star-shaped CU graphs. Our results provide a systematic approach to characterizing and stabilizing non-symmetric multipartite entanglement in both qubit and qudit systems, with implications for quantum error correction and networked quantum protocols.

Title: IQP computations with intermediate measurements
Authors: Richard Jozsa, Soumik Ghosh, Sergii Strelchuk
Abstract: We consider the computational model of IQP circuits (in which all computational steps are X-basis diagonal gates), supplemented by intermediate X- or Z-basis measurements. We show that if we allow non-adaptive or adaptive X-basis measurements, or allow non-adaptive Z-basis measurements, then the computational power remains the same as that of the original IQP model; and with adaptive Z-basis measurements the model becomes quantum universal. Furthermore we show that the computational model having circuits of only CZ gates and adaptive X-basis measurements, with input states that are tensor products of 1-qubit states from the set |+>, |->, |0>+i|1> and |0>+ e^{i pi/4}|1> (each normalised), is quantum universal.

Title: Does Quantum Information Require Additional Structure?
Authors: Ryszard Horodecki
Abstract: We consider the status of quantum information in the quantum theory and based on the correspondence principle, we propose an interpretation of the wave function as a mathematical representation of quantum information. We consider Clauser's analysis of incompatibility formulations of quantum theory in laboratory space and configuration-space in the context of local realism. Then, we introduce the hypothesis of quantum space of directly unobserved relations, which precede quantum correlations, and are compatible with the Reichenbach common cause principle. The possible implications of the hypothesis are discussed in the context of the latest experimental and theoretical results on the dynamics of entanglement formation in helium atoms. Finally, we present the Chyli≈Ñski model as an example of quantum relational continuum space, which predicts potentially measurable effects for the bound states.

Title: Bosonic Quantum Error Correction with Neutral Atoms in Optical Dipole Traps
Authors: Leon H. Bohnmann, David F. Locher, Johannes Zeiher, Markus M√ºller
Abstract: Bosonic quantum error correction codes encode logical qubits in the Hilbert space of one or multiple harmonic oscillators. A prominent class of bosonic codes is that of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes of which implementations have been demonstrated with trapped ions and microwave cavities. In this paper, we investigate theoretically the preparation and error correction of a GKP qubit in a vibrational mode of a neutral atom stored in an optical dipole trap. This platform has recently shown remarkable progress in simultaneously controlling the motional and electronic degrees of freedom of trapped atoms. The protocols we develop make use of motional states and, additionally, internal electronic states of the trapped atom to serve as an ancilla qubit. We compare optical tweezer arrays and optical lattices and find that the latter provide more flexible control over the confinement in the out-of-plane direction, which can be utilized to optimize the conditions for the implementation of GKP codes. Concretely, the different frequency scales that the harmonic oscillators in the axial and radial lattice directions exhibit and a small oscillator anharmonicity prove to be beneficial for robust encodings of GKP states. Finally, we underpin the experimental feasibility of the proposed protocols by numerically simulating the preparation of GKP qubits in an optical lattice with realistic parameters.

Title: On Propagation of Information in Quantum Mechanics and Maximal Velocity Bounds
Authors: Israel Michael Sigal, Xiaoxu Wu
Abstract: We revisit key notions related to the evolution of quantum information in few-body quantum mechanics (fbQM) and, for a wide class of dispersion relations, prove uniform bounds on the maximal speed of propagation of quantum information for states and observables with exponential error bounds. Our results imply, in particular, a fbQM version of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which is known to have wide applications in quantum information sciences. We propose a novel approach to proving maximal speed bounds.

Title: Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes
Authors: Shi Jie Samuel Tan, Lev Stambler
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.

Title: Benchmarking Quantum Red TEA on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs
Authors: Daniel Jaschke, Marco Ballarin, Nora Reiniƒá, Luka Pave≈°iƒá, Simone Montangero
Abstract: We benchmark simulations of many-body quantum systems on heterogeneous hardware platforms using CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. We compare different linear algebra backends, e.g., NumPy versus the PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow libraries, as well as a mixed-precision-inspired approach and optimizations for the target hardware. Quantum Red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses handling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are the building blocks of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a variational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a ubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor network methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum correlations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of particles. We present a way to obtain speedups of a factor of 34 when tuning parameters on the CPU, and an additional factor of 2.76 on top of the best CPU setup when migrating to GPUs.

Title: QKD as a Quantum Machine Learning task
Authors: T. Decker, M. Gallezot, S. F. Kerstan, A. Paesano, A. Ginter, W. Wormsbecher
Abstract: We propose considering Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols as a use case for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms. We define and investigate the QML task of optimizing eavesdropping attacks on the quantum circuit implementation of the BB84 protocol. QKD protocols are well understood and solid security proofs exist enabling an easy evaluation of the QML model performance. The power of easy-to-implement QML techniques is shown by finding the explicit circuit for optimal individual attacks in a noise-free setting. For the noisy setting we find, to the best of our knowledge, a new cloning algorithm, which can outperform known cloning methods. Finally, we present a QML construction of a collective attack by using classical information from QKD post-processing within the QML algorithm.

Title: Learning junta distributions, quantum junta states, and QAC$^0$ circuits
Authors: Jinge Bao, Francisco Escudero-Guti√©rrez
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problems of learning junta distributions, their quantum counterparts (quantum junta states) and $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits, which we show to be close to juntas. (1) Junta distributions. A probability distribution $p:\{-1,1\}^n\to \mathbb [0,1]$ is a $k$-junta if it only depends on $k$ bits. We show that they can be learned with to error $\varepsilon$ in total variation distance from $O(2^k\log(n)/\varepsilon^2)$ samples, which quadratically improves the upper bound of Aliakbarpour et al. (COLT'16) and matches their lower bound in every parameter. (2) Junta states. We initiate the study of $n$-qubit states that are $k$-juntas, those that are the tensor product of a $k$-qubit state and an $(n-k)$-qubit maximally mixed state. We show that these states can be learned with error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance with $O(12^{k}\log(n)/\varepsilon^2)$ single copies. We also prove a lower bound of $\Omega((4^k+\log (n))/\varepsilon^2)$ copies. Additionally, we show that, for constant $k$, $\tilde{\Theta}(2^n/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to test whether a state is $\varepsilon$-close or $7\varepsilon$-far from being a $k$-junta. (3) $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits. Nadimpalli et al. (STOC'24) recently showed that the Pauli spectrum of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits (with a limited number of auxiliary qubits) is concentrated on low-degree. We remark that they implied something stronger, namely that the Choi states of those circuits are close to be juntas. As a consequence, we show that $n$-qubit $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits with size $s$, depth $d$ and $a$ auxiliary qubits can be learned from $2^{O(\log(s^22^a)^d)}\log (n)$ copies of the Choi state, improving the $n^{O(\log(s^22^a)^d)}$ by Nadimpalli et al.

Title: Magnetic Field Detection Using a Two-Qubit System Under Noisy Heisenberg Interaction
Authors: George Biswas, Sayan Sengupta, Anindya Biswas
Abstract: We propose a method to design a magnetic field detector using a noisy two-qubit system. The system evolves under a noisy Heisenberg interaction Hamiltonian, and we investigate its behavior by calculating both the $l_1$-norm of quantum coherence and the return probability in the presence and absence of an external magnetic field. We allow for decoherence modeled by quasi-static charge noise in the exchange coupling of the two-qubit system and find that, while the magnetic field does not significantly influence the decoherence process, it introduces a distinct oscillation in the return probability over time. Importantly, the oscillation frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field, providing a clear signature that can be used for magnetic field detection. These results point towards the feasibility of realizing a practical quantum-based magnetic field detector, with the ability to operate under noisy conditions while maintaining sensitivity to the field strength.

Title: Extendible quantum measurements and limitations on classical communication
Authors: Vishal Singh, Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Unextendibility of quantum states and channels is inextricably linked to the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics, it has played an important role in understanding and quantifying entanglement, and more recently it has found applications in providing limitations on quantum error correction and entanglement distillation. Here we generalize the framework of unextendibility to quantum measurements and define $k$-extendible measurements for every integer $k\ge 2$. Our definition provides a hierarchy of semidefinite constraints that specify a set of measurements containing every measurement that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication. Furthermore, the set of $k$-extendible measurements converges to the set of measurements that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication as $k\to \infty$. To illustrate the utility of $k$-extendible measurements, we establish a semidefinite programming upper bound on the one-shot classical capacity of a channel, which outperforms the best known efficiently computable bound from [Matthews and Wehner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60, pp. 7317-7329 (2014)] and also leads to efficiently computable upper bounds on the $n$-shot classical capacity of a channel.

Title: Quantum walk based Monte Carlo simulation for photon interaction cross sections
Authors: Euimin Lee, Sangmin Lee, Shiho Kim
Abstract: High-energy physics simulations traditionally rely on classical Monte Carlo methods to model complex particle interactions, often incurring significant computational costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum-enhanced simulation framework that integrates discrete-time quantum walks with quantum amplitude estimation to model photon interaction cross sections. By mapping the probabilistic transport process of 10 MeV photons in a water medium onto a quantum circuit and focusing on Compton scattering as the dominant attenuation mechanism, we demonstrate that our approach reproduces classical probability distributions with high fidelity. Simulation results obtained via the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator reveal a quadratic speedup in amplitude estimation compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods. Our framework not only validates the feasibility of employing quantum algorithms for high-energy physics simulations but also offers a scalable pathway toward incorporating multiple interaction channels and secondary particle production. These findings underscore the potential of quantum-enhanced methods to overcome the computational bottlenecks inherent in large-scale particle physics simulations.

Title: Tailoring transport in quantum spin chains via disorder and collisions
Authors: Vittoria Stanzione, Alessandro Civolani, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Jorge Yago Malo
Abstract: We systematically investigate the interplay of disorder and space-time heterogeneous collisional noise in shaping the transport dynamics of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain. Using stochastic collision models to simulate interaction with the environment, we explore the localization-delocalization transitions across regimes with single and multiple excitations. We find that space homogeneous collisions occurring at low rates favor the shaping of regions where the localization degree sets in the form of subsequent plateaus at a rate and duration universally scaling with the collision rate. We also find that interactions among the excitations favor this process even for tiniest levels of disorder. Our findings can be applied to design stroboscopic protocols where sequences of transport and localization can be tailored. We establish relevant connections to noise-engineering of quantum devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators platforms, and to realistic biological systems where noise and disorder coexist.

Title: A novel approach to accounting for correlations in evolution over time of an open quantum system
Authors: Victor F. Los (V.G. Baryakhtar Institute of Magnetism of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine)
Abstract: A projection operator is introduced, which exactly transforms the inhomogeneous Nakajima--Zwanzig generalized master equation for the relevant part of a system +bath statistical operator, containing the inhomogeneous irrelevant term comprising the initial corrrelations, into the homogeneous equation accounting for initial correlations in the kernel governing its evolution. No "molecular chaos"-like approximation has been used. The obtained equation is equivalent to completely closed (homogeneous) equation for the statistical operator of a system of interest interacting with a bath. In the Born approximation (weak system-bath interaction) this equation can be presented as the time-local Redfield-like equation with additional terms caused by initial correlations. As an application, a quantum oscillator, interacting with a Boson field and driven from a Gibbs initial equilibrium system+bath state by an external force, is considered. All terms determining the oscillator evolution over time are explicitly calculated at all timescales. It is shown, how the initial correlations influence the evolution process. It is also demonstrated, that at the large timescale this influence vanishes, and the evolution equation for the quantum oscillator statistical operator acquires the Lindblad form..

Title: Using Gaussian Boson Samplers to Approximate Gaussian Expectation Problems
Authors: J√∏rgen Ellegaard Andersen, Shan Shan
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) have shown advantages over classical methods for performing some specific sampling tasks. To fully harness the computational power of GBS, there has been great interest in identifying their practical applications. In this study, we explore the use of GBS samples for computing a numerical approximation to the Gaussian expectation problem, that is to integrate a multivariate function against a Gaussian distribution. We propose two estimators using GBS samples, and show that they both can bring an exponential speedup over the plain Monte Carlo (MC) estimator. Precisely speaking, the exponential speedup is defined in terms of the guaranteed sample size for these estimators to reach the same level of accuracy $\epsilon$ and the same success probability $\delta$ in the $(\epsilon, \delta)$ multiplicative error approximation scheme. We prove that there is an open and nonempty subset of the Gaussian expectation problem space for such computational advantage.

Title: Estimating the Percentage of GBS Advantage in Gaussian Expectation Problems
Authors: J√∏rgen Ellegaard Andersen, Shan Shan
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), which can be realized with a photonic quantum computing model, perform some special kind of sampling tasks. In [4], we introduced algorithms that use GBS samples to approximate Gaussian expectation problems. We found a non-empty open subset of the problem space where these algorithms achieve exponential speedup over the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method. This speedup is defined in terms of the guaranteed sample size to reach the same accuracy $\epsilon$ and success probability $\delta$ under the $(\epsilon, \delta)$ multiplicative error approximation scheme. In this paper, we enhance our original approach by optimizing the average photon number in the GBS distribution to match the specific Gaussian expectation problem. We provide updated estimates of the guaranteed sample size for these improved algorithms and quantify the proportion of problem space where they outperform MC. Numerical results indicate that the proportion of the problem space where our improved algorithms have an advantage is substantial, and the advantage gained is significant. Notably, for certain special cases, our methods consistently outperform MC across nearly 100\% of the problem space.

Title: Probing quantum properties of black holes with a Floquet-driven optical lattice simulator
Authors: Asmae Benhemou, Georgia Nixon, Aydin Deger, Ulrich Schneider, Jiannis K. Pachos
Abstract: In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation and maximally fast scrambling. Here, we present a scheme for an analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes using ultracold atoms in a locally Floquet-driven optical lattice. We show how the effective dynamics of the driven system can generate position-dependent tunnelling amplitudes that encode the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of a (1+1)D simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements. Combined with the highly tunable onsite atom-atom interactions typical for cold atoms, our simulator provides a powerful and feasible platform to probe the scrambling of quantum information in black holes. We illustrate the ergodicity of our (2+1)D black-hole simulator by showing numerically that its level statistics in the hard-core limit approaches the ergodic regime faster than a globally homogeneous Hamiltonian.

Title: Proposal for many-body quantum chaos detection

Abstract: In this work, the term ``quantum chaos'' refers to spectral correlations similar to those found in the random matrix theory. Quantum chaos can be diagnosed through the analysis of level statistics using e.g.~the spectral form factor, which detects both short- and long-range level correlations. The spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how this structure could be detected through the quench dynamics of two physical quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival probability and the spin autocorrelation function. The survival probability is equivalent to the spectral form factor with an additional filter. When the system is small, the dip of the correlation hole reaches sufficiently large values at times which are short enough to be detected with current experimental platforms. As the system is pushed away from chaos, the correlation hole disappears, signaling integrability or localization. We also provide a relatively shallow circuit with which the correlation hole could be detected with commercially available quantum computers.

Title: Systematic analysis of relative phase extraction in one-dimensional Bose gases interferometry
Authors: Taufiq Murtadho, Marek Gluza, Khatee Zathul Arifa, Sebastian Erne, J√∂rg Schmiedmayer, Nelly H.Y. Ng
Abstract: Spatially resolved relative phase measurement of two adjacent 1D Bose gases is enabled by matter-wave interference upon free expansion. However, longitudinal dynamics is typically ignored in the analysis of experimental data. We provide an analytical formula showing a correction to the readout of the relative phase due to longitudinal expansion and mixing with the common phase. We numerically assess the error propagation to the estimation of the gases' physical quantities such as correlation functions and temperature. Our work characterizes the reliability and robustness of interferometric measurements, directing us to the improvement of existing phase extraction methods necessary to observe new physical phenomena in cold-atomic quantum simulators.

Title: Multi-axis inertial sensing with 2D matter-wave arrays
Authors: K. Stolzenberg, C. Struckmann, S. Bode, R. Li, A. Herbst, V. Vollenkemper, D. Thomas, A. Rajagopalan, E. M. Rasel, N. Gaaloul, D. Schlippert
Abstract: Atom interferometery is an exquisite measurement technique sensitive to inertial forces. However, it is commonly limited to a single sensitive axis, allowing high-precision multi-dimensional sensing only through subsequent or post-corrected measurements. We report on a novel method for multi-axis inertial sensing based on the correlation of simultaneous light-pulse atom interferometers in 2D array arrangements of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC). Deploying a scalable 3 x 3 BEC array spanning 1.6 mm^2 created using time-averaged optical potentials, we perform measurements of linear acceleration induced by gravity and simultaneously demonstrate sensitivity to angular velocity and acceleration of a rotating reference mirror, as well as gravity gradients and higher-order derivatives. Our work enables simple, high-precision multi-axis inertial sensing compatible with high rotation rates, e.g., for inertial navigation in dynamic environments. We finally envision further applications of our method, e.g., 3D in-situ measurements and reconstruction of laser beam intensities and wave fronts.

Title: Quantum-vacuum-protected topological edge polaritons
Authors: Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: This paper uncovers the formation of topological edge polaritons that are protected by the presence of quantum vacuum. Such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons could be achieved in a system of neutral atomic lattice under appropriate interaction with a single photonic mode. In the absence of the light-matter coupling, the system is shown to be topologically trivial, which consequently does not support edge modes. By employing Floquet theory, the system is also found to be topologically trivial in the classical light limit, i.e., at very small light-matter coupling but very large number of photons. On the other hand, by treating both the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, the system becomes topologically nontrivial in the full (atomic+photonic) Hilbert space, which manifests itself as a pair of topological (almost) zero energy eigenstates localized near each lattice's edge and with very small mean photon number. Finally, the robustness of such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons against spatial disorder and counterrotating coupling effect is explicitly demonstrated.

Title: Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in two representative quantum mechanical models at both infinite and finite temperature: the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our findings align with established results from spectral statistics and OTOCs, while introducing an operator-independent diagnostic for quantum chaos, offering more `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of the general properties of quantum chaotic systems.

Title: Measuring Non-Hermitian Topological Invariants Directly from Quench Dynamics
Authors: Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang
Abstract: While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.

Title: Angular momentum effects in neutron decay
Authors: I. Pavlov, A. Chaikovskaia, D. Karlovets
Abstract: We investigate the intriguing phenomenon of beta decay of a free neutron in a non-plane-wave(structured) state. Our analysis covers three types of states: unpolarized vortex (Bessel) neutrons that possess nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets, and spin-correlated OAM (spin-orbit) states characterized by unique polarization patterns. These states are of particular interest as they have recently been generated in neutron optics experiments and have promising applications in studies of quantum magnetic materials. The spectral-angular distributions (SAD) of the emitted electrons and protons are examined. We show that the high sensitivity of the protons SAD to the structure of the neutron wave packet can be used as a tool to extract the distinctive features of the non-plane-wave neutron states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the angular distribution of the emitted particles serves as a reflection of the spatial symmetries inherent to the neutron wave packet.

Title: Ultrafast quantum light uncertainty dynamics in real time
Authors: Mohamed Sennary, Javier Rivera-Dean, Mohamed ElKabbash, Vladimir Pervak, Maciej Lewenstein, Mohammed Th. Hassan
Abstract: Advancements in quantum optics and squeezed light generation have transformed various domains of quantum science and technology. However, real-time quantum dynamics remain an underexplored frontier. Here, we extend quantum optics into the ultrafast regime, providing direct experimental evidence that quantum uncertainty is not a static constraint but evolves dynamically with the system state and interactions. Using ultrafast squeezed light generated via a four-wave mixing nonlinear process, we observe the temporal dynamics of amplitude uncertainty, demonstrating that quantum uncertainty is a controllable and tunable physical quantity. This offers new insights into fundamental quantum mechanics in real-time. Additionally, we demonstrate control over the quantum state of light by switching between amplitude and phase squeezing. Our ability to generate and manipulate ultrafast squeezed light waveforms with attosecond resolution unlocks exciting possibilities for quantum technologies, including petahertz scale secure quantum communication, quantum computing, and ultrafast spectroscopy. We also introduce an ultrafast quantum encryption protocol leveraging squeezed light for secure digital communication at unprecedented speeds. This work paves the way for exploring quantum uncertainty dynamics and establishes the foundation for the emerging field of ultrafast quantum science.

Title: Quantum Models of Consciousness from a Quantum Information Science Perspective
Authors: Lea Gassab, Onur Pusuluk, Marco Cattaneo, √ñzg√ºr E. M√ºstecaplƒ±oƒülu
Abstract: This perspective explores various quantum models of consciousness from the viewpoint of quantum information science, offering potential ideas and insights. The models under consideration can be categorized into three distinct groups based on the level at which quantum mechanics might operate within the brain: those suggesting that consciousness arises from electron delocalization within microtubules inside neurons, those proposing it emerges from the electromagnetic field surrounding the entire neural network, and those positing it originates from the interactions between individual neurons governed by neurotransmitter molecules. Our focus is particularly on the Posner model of cognition, for which we provide preliminary calculations on the preservation of entanglement of phosphate molecules within the geometric structure of Posner clusters. These findings provide valuable insights into how quantum information theory can enhance our understanding of brain functions.

Title: Measurement of Neutron Whispering Gallery States Using a Pulsed Neutron Beam
Authors: Go Ichikawa, Kenji Mishima
Abstract: A neutron whispering gallery state is a quantum state localized on a material surface bound by the centrifugal force and the material potential. Precise measurements of such quantum states enable tests of quantum mechanics in non-inertial frames, characterization of the surface potential, and searches for hypothetical short-range interactions at the nanometer scale. We observed a neutron whispering gallery state on a $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ concave mirror using a pulsed cold neutron beam. The measured results agree with theoretical calculations within $1.9\%$ for the centrifugal acceleration $a \approx 7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, which is due to unmodeled deviations of the shape of the concave mirror edge from an ideal one. We found that the sensitivity itself was $1\times 10^{-4}$, which is two orders of magnitude better than the above agreement.
