Title: From Quantum Cognition to Conceptuality Interpretation II: Unraveling the Quantum Mysteries
Authors: Diederik Aerts, Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi, Sandro Sozzo
Abstract: An overview of the conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics is presented, along with an explanation of how it sheds light on key quantum and relativistic phenomena. In particular, we show how the interpretation clarifies Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, wave function-based and entanglement-based nonlocality, interference effects resulting from the superposition principle, delayed choice experiments, quantum measurements, the mechanism of quantization, the reason why entities can establish entanglement bonds, and the statistical behavior of indistinguishable entities. We further argue that the interpretation can also elucidate relativistic effects, focusing on time dilation. Finally, we suggest that it can provide a novel and challenging perspective on evolution. This article is the second in a two-part series devoted to exploring this promising approach to reality. The first part, which serves as a companion to this discussion, outlines the intellectual trajectory leading from the first applications of quantum notions to human cognition to the bold rethinking suggested by the conceptuality interpretation.

Title: Quantum Bayesian Networks for Machine Learning in Oil-Spill Detection
Authors: Owais Ishtiaq Siddiqui, Nouhaila Innan, Alberto Marchisio, Mohamed Bennai, Muhammad Shafique
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has shown promise in diverse applications such as environmental monitoring, healthcare diagnostics, and financial modeling. However, the practical application of QML faces challenges, such as the limited availability of quantum hardware and the complexity of integrating quantum algorithms with classical systems. This paper introduces a novel Bayesian approach using Quantum Bayesian Networks (QBNs) to classify imbalanced datasets, focusing on differentiating ``oil-spill'' from ``non-spill'' classes in satellite-derived data. By employing QBNs, which combine probabilistic reasoning with quantum state preparation, we effectively address the challenge of integrating quantum enhancements with classical machine learning architectures. While the integration improves key performance metrics, it also uncovers areas for refinement, highlighting the need for customized strategies to address specific challenges and optimize outcomes. Our study demonstrates significant advances in detecting and classifying anomalies, contributing to more effective and precise environmental monitoring and management.

Title: Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes
Authors: Haifeng Tang, Shreya Vardhan, Jinzhao Wang
Abstract: We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times. Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.

Title: Revisiting the Bohr Model of the Atom through Brownian Motion of the Electron
Authors: Vasil Yordanov
Abstract: In this work, we enhance the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom by incorporating Stochastic Mechanics to describe the electron's behavior through Brownian motion. In contrast to traditional quantum mechanics, where the Born rule postulates the physical interpretation of the wave function, our model derives the Born rule by performing statistical averaging of single-particle positions. Because the particle always has a definite, though random, position, there is no need for wave function collapse, as required by the Copenhagen interpretation. In this approach, we use the wave function to compute the electron's optimal drift velocity within its stochastic equation of motion. We develop modified stochastic equations in curvilinear spherical coordinates and demonstrate that the resulting radial and angular kinetic energies align with those from the operator approach. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical framework by showing stable electron orbits and accurately reproducing the probability distribution of finding the electron around the hydrogen nucleus as defined by the Born rule. We show that at very short timescales, wave function-based single electron probability distributions can be inadequate due to insufficient statistical averaging of single-particle trajectories. This model thus offers enhanced insights into the quantum world beyond conventional interpretations. Our findings underscore the potential of applying wave function-derived drift velocities within Stochastic Mechanics to the hydrogen atom, providing new perspectives on atomic dynamics.

Title: Nonreciprocal Microwave-Optical Entanglement in Kerr-Modified Cavity Optomagnomechanics
Authors: Ming-Yue Liu, Yuan Gong, Jiaojiao Chen, Yan-Wei Wang, Wei Xiong
Abstract: Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.

Title: Tunable cavity coupling to spin defects in 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator platform
Authors: Tongyuan Bao, Qi Luo, Ailun Yin, Yao Zhang, Haibo Hu, Zhengtong Liu, Shumin Xiao, Xin Ou, Yu Zhou, Qinghai Song
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.

Title: Efficient Evaluation of Optical Quantum Modules via Dual-Photon High-Dimensional Interference
Authors: Xiaoqian Zhang, Maolin Luo, Xiaoqi Zhou
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum information technology has increased the demand for precise testing and calibration of quantum modules, especially in optical quantum circuits where module reliability directly impacts system performance. To address this need, we propose a dual-photon quantum module evaluation method based on high-dimensional Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. Our method employs multi-degree-of-freedom photon encoding, enabling fast evaluation of optical quantum modules while simplifying implementation and significantly reducing measurement resources. Resource demands stay constant as system dimensionality increases, allowing efficient evaluations in high-dimensional quantum systems. We validated this method on a programmable silicon photonic chip, demonstrating its ability to accurately evaluate optical quantum module performance while significantly reducing resource consumption. Furthermore, we extended this method to general qubit systems and validated its feasibility through a proof-of-principle experiment on IBM's superconducting platform. This quantum module evaluation method holds significant potential for widespread application in quantum information fields.

Title: Optimal and Feasible Contextuality-based Randomness Generation
Authors: Yuan Liu, Ravishankar Ramanathan
Abstract: Semi-device-independent (SDI) randomness generation protocols based on Kochen-Specker contextuality offer the attractive features of compact devices, high rates, and ease of experimental implementation over fully device-independent (DI) protocols. Here, we investigate this paradigm and derive four results to improve the state-of-art. Firstly, we introduce a family of simple, experimentally feasible orthogonality graphs (measurement compatibility structures) for which the maximum violation of the corresponding non-contextuality inequalities allows to certify the maximum amount of $\log_2 d$ bits from a qu$d$it system with projective measurements for $d \geq 3$. We analytically derive the Lovasz theta and fractional packing number for this graph family, and thereby prove their utility for optimal randomness generation in both randomness expansion and amplification tasks. Secondly, a central additional assumption in contextuality-based protocols over fully DI ones, is that the measurements are repeatable and satisfy an intended compatibility structure. We frame a relaxation of this condition in terms of $\epsilon$-orthogonality graphs for a parameter $\epsilon > 0$, and derive quantum correlations that allow to certify randomness for arbitrary relaxation $\epsilon \in [0,1)$. Thirdly, it is well known that a single qubit is non-contextual, i.e., the qubit correlations can be explained by a non-contextual hidden variable (NCHV) model. We show however that a single qubit is \textit{almost} contextual, in that there exist qubit correlations that cannot be explained by $\epsilon$-ontologically faithful NCHV models for small $\epsilon > 0$. Finally, we point out possible attacks by quantum and general consistent (non-signalling) adversaries for certain classes of contextuality tests over and above those considered in DI scenarios.

Title: Optimal Control for Open Quantum System in Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Mo Zhou, F. A. Cárdenas-López, Sugny Dominique, Xi Chen
Abstract: We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

Title: Quantum phase estimation and realistic detection schemes in Mach-Zehnder interferometer using SU(2) coherent states
Authors: Mohammed Abdellaoui, Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara
Abstract: In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.

Title: The quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism: the role of boundary conditions, endpoints and kink types
Authors: Jose Soto Garcia, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are characterised by the universal scaling laws in the critical region surrounding the transitions. This universality is also manifested in the critical real-time dynamics through the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In recent experiments on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism has been used to probe the nature of quantum phase transitions. In this paper we analyze the caveats associated with this method and develop strategies to improve its accuracy. Focusing on two minimal models -- transverse-field Ising and three-state Potts -- we study the effect of boundary conditions, the location of the endpoints and some subtleties in the definition of the kink operators. In particular, we show that the critical scaling of the most intuitive types of kinks is extremely sensitive to the correct choice of endpoint, while more advanced types of kinks exhibit remarkably robust universal scaling. Furthermore, we show that when kinks are tracked over the entire chain, fixed boundary conditions improve the accuracy of the scaling. Surprisingly, the Kibble-Zurek critical scaling appears to be equally accurate whether the fixed boundary conditions are chosen to be symmetric or anti-symmetric. Finally, we show that the density of kinks extracted in the central part of long chains obeys the predicted universal scaling for all types of boundary conditions.

Title: Experimental investigation of a quantum Otto heat engine with shortcuts to adiabaticity implemented using counter-adiabatic driving
Authors: Krishna Shende, Matreyee Kandpal, Arvind, Kavita Dorai
Abstract: The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.

Title: Qubit Casimir effect
Authors: Antonino Flachi, Gonçalo M. Quinta
Abstract: In this letter we propose a new interpretation of the Casimir effect. Concretely, we show that the Casimir energy can be written as the quantum ``Von Neumann'' entropy associated to a 2-qubit, mixed, non-separable, pseudo-density matrix of the relevant quantum fluctuations. The quantum entropy we introduce draws parallels to the concept of quantum inseparability found in quantum information theory. Our results suggest that the Casimir energy is a measure of the entanglement of quantum fluctuations.

Title: Advanced Attacks On Qubit-Ensemble Based Quantum Coins
Authors: Bernd Bauerhenne, Lucas Tsunaki, Jan Thieme, Boris Naydenov, Kilian Singer
Abstract: The ensemble based quantum token protocol allows for implementing non-clonable tokens containing an ensemble of identically prepared qubits. A quantum coin that is issued by a bank can be designed with desired security by adding multiple tokens with ensembles of different orientations. Advanced attacks on the protocol can assume that measurements on sub-ensembles can be carried through and that even individual qubits can be measured. Even though such an attack might be perceived as technically unfeasible we proof the security of the ensemble based protocol under these advanced attacks and provide detailed expression on how the quantum coin must be designed to fulfill desired security requirements. We have used realistic parameters for the IBM Quantum Platform for advanced attacks using brute force optimization. Full MPI parallelized source code is provided to allow for adjusting to other hardware platforms. Interestingly, our results deviate from predictions provided by quantum state tomography due to the fact that an attacker's goal is not to get an optimal estimate of an unknown quantum state, but to fool the bank into accepting the counterfeit quantum coin.

Title: Average mutual information for random fermionic Gaussian quantum states
Authors: Lucas Hackl, Mario Kieburg, Joel Maldonado
Abstract: Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Overcoming Intensity Limits for Long-Distance Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Ibrahim Almosallam
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables the sharing of cryptographic keys secured by quantum mechanics. The BB84 protocol assumed single-photon sources, but practical systems rely on weak coherent pulses vulnerable to photon-number-splitting (PNS) attacks. The Gottesman-Lo-Lütkenhaus-Preskill (GLLP) framework addressed these imperfections, deriving secure key rate bounds under limited PNS. The Decoy-state protocol further improved performance by refining single-photon yield estimates, but still considered multi-photon states as insecure, limiting intensities and thereby constraining key rate and distance. Here, we show that higher intensities can be securely permitted by applying Bayesian inference to estimate key parameters directly from observed data rather than relying on worst-case assumptions. By raising the pulse intensity to 10 photons, we achieve 50 times the key rate and a 62.2% increase in operational range (about 200 km) compared to the decoy-state protocol. Furthermore, we accurately model after-pulsing using a Hidden Markov Model and reveal inaccuracies in decoy-state calculations that may produce erroneous key-rate estimates. By bridging theoretical security and real-world conditions, this Bayesian methodology provides a versatile post-processing step for many discrete-variable QKD protocols, advancing their reach, efficiency, and facilitating broader adoption of quantum-secured communication.

Title: Artificial Intelligence for Quantum Error Correction: A Comprehensive Review
Authors: Zihao Wang, Hao Tang
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is the process of detecting and correcting errors in quantum systems, which are prone to decoherence and quantum noise. QEC is crucial for developing stable and highly accurate quantum computing systems, therefore, several research efforts have been made to develop the best QEC strategy. Recently, Google's breakthrough shows great potential to improve the accuracy of the existing error correction methods. This survey provides a comprehensive review of advancements in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to enhance QEC schemes for existing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. Specifically, we focus on machine learning (ML) strategies and span from unsupervised, supervised, semi-supervised, to reinforcement learning methods. It is clear from the evidence, that these methods have recently shown superior efficiency and accuracy in the QEC pipeline compared to conventional approaches. Our review covers more than 150 relevant studies, offering a comprehensive overview of progress and perspective in this field. We organized the reviewed literature on the basis of the AI strategies employed and improvements in error correction performance. We also discuss challenges ahead such as data sparsity caused by limited quantum error datasets and scalability issues as the number of quantum bits (qubits) in quantum systems kept increasing very fast. We conclude the paper with summary of existing works and future research directions aimed at deeper integration of AI techniques into QEC strategies.

Title: Quantum Phase Transitions in the Spin 1 Bilinear-Biquadratic Heisenberg Model Based on Classical and Quantum Correlations
Authors: Ghader Najarbashi, Hassan Bahmani, Babak Tarighi
Abstract: We investigate thermal and nonthermal quantum correlations in the one dimensional spin 1 bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model. Using tools from quantum information theory such as generalized concurrence, negativity, and various measures of quantum, classical, and total correlations in bipartite states we demonstrate that these measures effectively identify quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at critical points. Our negativity analysis reveals nearly identical results at zero or very low temperatures. Importantly, we find that partial concurrence, defined with the reduced density matrix, detects more quantum critical points than total concurrence. Additionally, we argue that spin chains with an odd number of spins are more effective than those with an even number in identifying QPTs.

Title: Extensive manipulation of transition rates and substantial population inversion of rotating atoms inside a cavity
Authors: Yan Peng, Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu
Abstract: We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.

Title: Critical spectrum of the anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model
Authors: Jiong Li, Daniel Braak, Qing-Hu Chen
Abstract: The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.

Title: Towards a General Framework for Practical Quantum Network Protocols
Authors: Sumeet Khatri
Abstract: The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.

Title: LSQCA: Resource-Efficient Load/Store Architecture for Limited-Scale Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing
Authors: Takumi Kobori, Yasunari Suzuki, Yosuke Ueno, Teruo Tanimoto, Synge Todo, Yuuki Tokunaga
Abstract: Current fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) architectures utilize several encoding techniques to enable reliable logical operations with restricted qubit connectivity. However, such logical operations demand additional memory overhead to ensure fault tolerance. Since the main obstacle to practical quantum computing is the limited qubit count, our primary mission is to design floorplans that can reduce memory overhead without compromising computational capability. Despite extensive efforts to explore FTQC architectures, even the current state-of-the-art floorplan strategy devotes 50% of memory space to this overhead, not to data storage, to ensure unit-time random access to all logical qubits. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture based on a novel floorplan strategy, Load/Store Quantum Computer Architecture (LSQCA), which can achieve almost 100% memory density. The idea behind our architecture is to separate all memory regions into small computational space called Computational Registers (CR) and space-efficient memory space called Scan-Access Memory (SAM). We define an instruction set for these abstract structures and provide concrete designs named point-SAM and line-SAM architectures. With this design, we can improve the memory density by allowing variable-latency memory access while concealing the latency with other bottlenecks. We also propose optimization techniques to exploit properties of quantum programs observed in our static analysis, such as access locality in memory reference timestamps. Our numerical results indicate that LSQCA successfully leverages this idea. In a resource-restricted situation, a specific benchmark shows that we can achieve about 90% memory density with 5% increase in the execution time compared to a conventional floorplan, which achieves at most 50% memory density for unit-time random access. Our design ensures broad quantum applicability.

Title: A comparison of HPC-based quantum computing simulators using Quantum Volume
Authors: Lourens van Niekerk, Dhiraj Kumar, Aasish Kumar Sharma, Tino Meisel, Martin Leandro Paleico, Christian Boehme
Abstract: This paper compares quantum computing simulators running on a single CPU or GPU-based HPC node using the Quantum Volume benchmark commonly proposed for comparing NISQ systems. As simulators do not suffer from noise, the metric used in the comparison is the time required to simulate a set Quantum Volume. The results are important to estimate the feasibility of proof of concept studies and debugging of quantum algorithms on HPC systems. Besides benchmarks of some commonly used simulators, this paper also offers an overview of their main features, a review of the state of quantum computing simulation and quantum computing benchmarking, and some insight into the theory of Quantum Volume.

Title: Automated Auxiliary Qubit Allocation in High-Level Quantum Programming
Authors: Evandro C. R. Rosa, Jerusa Marchi, Eduardo I. Duzzioni, Rafael de Santiago
Abstract: We present a method for optimizing quantum circuit compilation by automating the allocation of auxiliary qubits for multi-qubit gate decompositions. This approach is implemented and evaluated within the high-level quantum programming platform Ket. Our results indicate that the decomposition of multi-qubit gates is more effectively handled by the compiler, which has access to all circuit parameters, rather than through a quantum programming API. To evaluate the approach, we compared our implementation against Qiskit, a widely used quantum programming platform, by analyzing two quantum algorithms. Using a 16-qubit QPU, we observed a reduction of 87% in the number of CNOT gates in Grover's algorithm for 9 qubits. For a state preparation algorithm with 7 qubits, the number of CNOT gates was reduced from $2.8\times10^7$ to $5.7\times10^3$, leveraging additional Ket optimizations for high-level quantum program constructions. Overall, a quadratic reduction in the number of CNOT gates in the final circuit was observed, with greater improvements achieved when more auxiliary qubits were available. These findings underscore the importance of automatic resource management, such as auxiliary qubit allocation, in optimizing quantum applications and improving their suitability for near-term quantum hardware.

Title: A Model of Entropy Production
Authors: Andreas Schlatter, R. E. Kastner
Abstract: A key tenet of the Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is the idea that photon absorption localizes the absorbing material system. In doing so, it measures the location of the absorber and hence reduces information entropy, which in turn needs to be balanced by appropriate entropy production, if there is a link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy. Based on a critical analysis of the physics of information erasure, we clarify the link between information and thermodynamic entropy and develop a rigorous model of entropy production in photon absorption processes. Links to the intepretation of quantum probabilities and Maxwell's Demon are made.

Title: Error Estimates and Higher Order Trotter Product Formulas in Jordan-Banach Algebras
Authors: Sarah Chehade, Andrea Delgado, Shuzhou Wang, Zhenhua Wang
Abstract: In quantum computing, Trotter estimates are critical for enabling efficient simulation of quantum systems and quantum dynamics, help implement complex quantum algorithms, and provide a systematic way to control approximate errors. In this paper, we extend the analysis of Trotter-Suzuki approximations, including third and higher orders, to Jordan-Banach algebras. We solve an open problem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula error estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply our formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the approximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product formulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights into the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.

Title: Measurement-based quantum computation utilizing the graph states of Bose-Einstein condensates and continuous variables
Authors: Genji Fujii
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a protocol for quantum computation that represents a model distinct from the circuit-based approach. MBQC has been proposed not only for qubits but also for qudits, continuous-variable (CV qubits), and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) qubits. In qubit-based MBQC, arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere can be performed by measuring a graph state. This naturally raises the question of whether arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere can similarly be achieved through measurements in other types of quantum bits. We have demonstrated that this can indeed be realized for BECs qubits by considering composite graph states involving CV qubits and BECs qubits.

Title: Producing Energy Eigenstates of the ${\rm H}_{2}$ Molecule by Classically Emulated Quantum Simulation
Authors: Kazuto Oshima
Abstract: We produce an energy eigenstate of the ${\rm H}_{2}$ molecule from a superposition of energy eigenstates by classically emulated quantum simulation. We use a Hamiltonian of the ${\rm H}_{2}$ molecule represented by Pauli matrices and concatenated ancilla qubits. Starting from an adequate initial state of physical qubits, we produce a corresponding energy eigenstate by twirling operations, that are time evolutions by the Hamiltonian controlled by the ancilla qubits.

Title: Quantum communication and fault-tolerance
Authors: Paula Belzig
Abstract: In this thesis, we are interested in the limits of quantum communication with and without entanglement, and with and without noise assumptions on the communication setup. When a sender and a receiver are connected by a communication line that is governed by noise which is modelled by a quantum channel, they hope to design a coding scheme, i.e. messages and message decoders, in such a way that they are robust to this noise. The amount of message bits per channel use is called the achievable rate of the coding scheme, and the maximal achievable rate for a given quantum channel is called capacity of the quantum channel. Here, we are interested in coding schemes and capacities under various assumptions, in particular in the case where the sender and the receiver share quantum entanglement, which turns out to be the most natural generalization of the classical communication analogue that lies at the basis of many of our modern technologies.

Title: Enhancing Privacy in Federated Learning through Quantum Teleportation Integration
Authors: Koffka Khan
Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, thereby enhancing privacy. However, the exchange of model updates can still expose sensitive information. Quantum teleportation, a process that transfers quantum states between distant locations without physical transmission of the particles themselves, has recently been implemented in real-world networks. This position paper explores the potential of integrating quantum teleportation into federated learning frameworks to bolster privacy. By leveraging quantum entanglement and the no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation ensures that data remains secure during transmission, as any eavesdropping attempt would be detectable. We propose a novel architecture where quantum teleportation facilitates the secure exchange of model parameters and gradients among clients and servers. This integration aims to mitigate risks associated with data leakage and adversarial attacks inherent in classical federated learning setups. We also discuss the practical challenges of implementing such a system, including the current limitations of quantum network infrastructure and the need for hybrid quantum-classical protocols. Our analysis suggests that, despite these challenges, the convergence of quantum communication technologies and federated learning presents a promising avenue for achieving unprecedented levels of privacy in distributed machine learning.

Title: Superluminal signalling and chaos in nonlinear quantum dynamics
Authors: Marta Emilia Bielińska, Michał Eckstein, Paweł Horodecki
Abstract: Nonlinear quantum dynamics is often invoked in models trying to bridge the gap between the quantum micro-world and the classical macro-world. Such endeavors, however, encounter challenges at the nexus with relativity. In 1989 Nicolas Gisin proved a powerful no-go theorem, according to which nonlinear quantum dynamics would lead to superluminal signalling, violating Einstein's causality. Here we analyse the theorem from the perspective of recent developments. First, we observe that it harmonises with the no-restriction hypothesis from General Probabilistic Theories. Second, we note that it requires a suitable synchronisation of Alice's and Bob's clocks and actions. Next, we argue that it does not automatically exclude the possibility of global nonlinear quantum dynamics on a tensor product Hilbert space. Consequently, we investigate a class of such dynamics inspired by discrete analogues of nonlinear Schrödinger equations. We show that, in general, they exhibit a chaotic character. In this context we inspect whether superluminal signalling can be avoided by relaxing the no-restriction hypothesis. We study three possible communication protocols involving either local measurements or modifications of a local Hamiltonian. We conclude that, in general, in all three cases, two spacelike separated parties can effectuate statistical superluminal information transfer. Nevertheless, we show an example of a nonlocal nonlinear quantum dynamics, which does not allow for it, provided that we relax the no-restriction hypothesis.

Title: Redesign Quantum Circuits on Quantum Hardware Device
Authors: Runhong He, Ji Guan, Xin Hong, Xusheng Xu, Guolong Cui, Shengbin Wang, Shenggang Ying
Abstract: In the process of exploring quantum algorithms, researchers often need to conduct equivalence checking of quantum circuits with different structures or to reconstruct a circuit in a variational manner, aiming to reduce the depth of the target circuit. Whereas the exponential resource overhead for describing quantum systems classically makes the existing methods not amenable to serving large-scale quantum circuits. Grounded in the entangling quantum generative adversarial network (EQ-GAN), we present in this article a new architecture which enables one to redesign large-scale quantum circuits on quantum hardware. For concreteness, we apply this architecture to three crucial applications in circuit optimization, including the equivalence checking of (non-) parameterized circuits, as well as the variational reconstruction of quantum circuits. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by the excellent results of these applications, which are implemented both in classical computers and current NISQ hardware. We believe our work should facilitate the implementation and validation of the advantages of quantum algorithms.

Title: Active Learning with Variational Quantum Circuits for Quantum Process Tomography
Authors: Jiaqi Yang, Xiaohua Xu, Wei Xie
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT), used for reconstruction of an unknown quantum process from measurement data, is a fundamental tool for the diagnostic and full characterization of quantum systems. It relies on querying a set of quantum states as input to the quantum process. Previous works commonly use a straightforward strategy to select a set of quantum states randomly, overlooking differences in informativeness among quantum states. Since querying the quantum system requires multiple experiments that can be prohibitively costly, it is always the case that there are not enough quantum states for high-quality reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a general framework for active learning (AL) to adaptively select a set of informative quantum states that improves the reconstruction most efficiently. In particular, we introduce a learning framework that leverages the widely-used variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to perform the QPT task and integrate our AL algorithms into the query step. We design and evaluate three various types of AL algorithms: committee-based, uncertainty-based, and diversity-based, each exhibiting distinct advantages in terms of performance and computational cost. Additionally, we provide a guideline for selecting algorithms suitable for different scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithms achieve significantly improved reconstruction compared to the baseline method that selects a set of quantum states randomly. Moreover, these results suggest that active learning based approaches are applicable to other complicated learning tasks in large-scale quantum information processing.

Title: QAHAN: A Quantum Annealing Hard Attention Network
Authors: Ren-Xin Zhao
Abstract: Hard Attention Mechanisms (HAMs) effectively filter essential information discretely and significantly boost the performance of machine learning models on large datasets. Nevertheless, they confront the challenge of non-differentiability, which raises the risk of convergence to a local optimum. Quantum Annealing (QA) is expected to solve the above dilemma. We propose a Quantum Annealing Hard Attention Mechanism (QAHAM) for faster convergence to the global optimum without the need to compute gradients by exploiting the quantum tunneling effect. Based on the above theory, we construct a Quantum Annealing Hard Attention Network (QAHAN) on D-Wave and Pytorch platforms for MNIST and CIFAR-10 multi-classification. Experimental results indicate that the QAHAN converges faster, exhibits smoother accuracy and loss curves, and demonstrates superior noise robustness compared to two traditional HAMs. Predictably, our scheme accelerates the convergence between the fields of quantum algorithms and machine learning, while advancing the field of quantum machine vision.

Title: Entangling gates from cabling of knots
Authors: Sergey Mironov, Andrey Morozov
Abstract: While there is a general consensus about the structure of one qubit operations in topological quantum computer, two qubits are as usual a more difficult and complex story of different attempts with varying approaches, problems and effectiveness. In this paper we discuss how to construct an efficient realization of a two qubit gate in topological quantum computer, by using principle of cabling from the knot theory. This allows to construct a braiding of cables dependent on the parameters of the theory where there is a low probability of moving out of computational space (high fidelity of operation) while there is a non-trivial entangling two-qubit operation. We also present some examples of these operations for different parameters of the theory.

Title: QuantumLLMInstruct: A 500k LLM Instruction-Tuning Dataset with Problem-Solution Pairs for Quantum Computing
Authors: Shlomo Kashani
Abstract: We present QuantumLLMInstruct (QLMMI), an innovative dataset featuring over 500,000 meticulously curated instruction-following problem-solution pairs designed specifically for quantum computing - the largest and most comprehensive dataset of its kind. Originating from over 90 primary seed domains and encompassing hundreds of subdomains autonomously generated by LLMs, QLMMI marks a transformative step in the diversity and richness of quantum computing datasets. Designed for instruction fine-tuning, QLMMI seeks to significantly improve LLM performance in addressing complex quantum computing challenges across a wide range of quantum physics topics. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled advancements in computational science with datasets like Omni-MATH and OpenMathInstruct, these primarily target Olympiad-level mathematics, leaving quantum computing largely unexplored. The creation of QLMMI follows a rigorous four-stage methodology. Initially, foundational problems are developed using predefined templates, focusing on critical areas such as synthetic Hamiltonians, QASM code generation, Jordan-Wigner transformations, and Trotter-Suzuki quantum circuit decompositions. Next, detailed and domain-specific solutions are crafted to ensure accuracy and relevance. In the third stage, the dataset is enriched through advanced reasoning techniques, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Task-Oriented Reasoning and Action (ToRA), which enhance problem-solution diversity while adhering to strict mathematical standards. Lastly, a zero-shot Judge LLM performs self-assessments to validate the dataset's quality and reliability, minimizing human oversight requirements.

Title: Indistinguishability in general probabilistic theories
Authors: John H. Selby, Victoria J. Wright, Máté Farkas, Marcin Karczewski, Ana Belén Sainz
Abstract: The existence of indistinguishable quantum particles provides an explanation for various physical phenomena we observe in nature. We lay out a path for the study of indistinguishable particles in general probabilistic theories (GPTs) via two frameworks: the traditional GPT framework and the diagrammatic framework of process theories. In the first approach we define different types of indistinguishable particle by the orbits of symmetric states under transformations. In the diagrammatic approach, we find a decomposition of the symmetrised state space using two key constructions from category theory: the biproduct completion and the Karoubi envelope. In both cases for pairs of indistinguishable particles in quantum theory we recover bosons and fermions.

Title: Genuine Quantum non-Gaussianity and metrological sensitivity of Fock states prepared in a mechanical resonator
Authors: Q. Rumman Rahman, Igor Kladarić, Max-Emanuel Kern, Yiwen Chu, Radim Filip, Matteo Fadel
Abstract: Fock states of the quantum harmonic oscillator are fundamental to quantum sensing and information processing, serving as key resources for exploiting bosonic degrees of freedom. Here, we prepare high Fock states in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) by coupling it to a superconducting qubit and applying microwave pulses designed using quantum optimal control. We characterize the experimentally realized states by employing a criterion for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity (QNG) designed to reveal multiphonon contributions. Although energy relaxation and decoherence limit the achievable fidelities, we demonstrate genuine QNG features compatible with Fock state $\vert 6\rangle$, confirming that the prepared states cannot be generated through Gaussian operations on states with up to Fock state $\vert 5\rangle$ contributions. We further investigate the robustness of these QNG features to losses and their utility in sensing displacement amplitudes. In particular, we introduce a hierarchy based on the quantum Fisher information and show that, despite decoherence and measurement imperfections, the prepared states achieve a displacement sensitivity surpassing that of an ideal Fock state $\vert 3\rangle$. Our results have immediate applications in quantum sensing and simulations with HBAR devices.

Title: Efficient Estimation and Sequential Optimization of Cost Functions in Variational Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Muhammad Umer, Eleftherios Mastorakis, Dimitris G. Angelakis
Abstract: Classical optimization is a cornerstone of the success of variational quantum algorithms, which often require determining the derivatives of the cost function relative to variational parameters. The computation of the cost function and its derivatives, coupled with their effective utilization, facilitates faster convergence by enabling smooth navigation through complex landscapes, ensuring the algorithm's success in addressing challenging variational problems. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization methodology that conceptualizes the parameterized quantum circuit as a weighted sum of distinct unitary operators, enabling the cost function to be expressed as a sum of multiple terms. This representation facilitates the efficient evaluation of nonlocal characteristics of cost functions, as well as their arbitrary derivatives. The optimization protocol then utilizes the nonlocal information on the cost function to facilitate a more efficient navigation process, ultimately enhancing the performance in the pursuit of optimal solutions. We utilize this methodology for two distinct cost functions. The first is the squared residual of the variational state relative to a target state, which is subsequently employed to examine the nonlinear dynamics of fluid configurations governed by the one-dimensional Burgers' equation. The second cost function is the expectation value of an observable, which is later utilized to approximate the ground state of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Our findings reveal substantial enhancements in convergence speed and accuracy relative to traditional optimization methods, even within complex, high-dimensional landscapes. Our work contributes to the advancement of optimization strategies for variational quantum algorithms, establishing a robust framework for addressing a range of computationally intensive problems across numerous applications.

Title: Halma: a routing-based technique for defect mitigation in quantum error correction
Authors: Runshi Zhou, Fang Zhang, Linghang Kong, Jianxin Chen
Abstract: As quantum chips scale up for large-scale computation, hardware defects become inevitable and must be carefully addressed. In this work, we introduce Halma, a defect mitigation technique empowered by an expanded native gate set that incorporates the iSWAP gate alongside the conventional CNOT gate, both commonly available on many superconducting processors. Halma effectively mitigates ancilla qubit defects during surface code stabilizer measurements, enhancing the robustness and reliability of quantum computation. Halma introduces zero reduction in the spacelike distance of the code, leading to effective preservation of encoded logical information. Meanwhile, it does not further sacrifice the timelike distance, which enables efficient logical operations on surface code patches. Under a realistic physical noise level of $10^{-3}$, Halma achieves a logical error rate that is only $\sim1.5\times$ that of the defect-free code when handling a single ancilla qubit defect on a small-distance surface code. In comparison to previous defect-handling methods, Halma provides a $\sim10\times$ improvement in the average logical error rate of distance-11 surface codes with a defect rate of 2%, and a $\sim3\times$ reduction in the teraquop footprint, that is, the number of physical qubits required to reach a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Generally speaking, Halma can be viewed as an additional equipment in the toolbox of defect mitigation, or an upgrade patch, as it is directly compatible with most of the existing superstabilizer-based approaches in handling data qubit defects and defect clusters. Halma not only significantly eases the near-term realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing on hardware with fabrication defects, but also exemplifies how leveraging intrinsic hardware capabilities can enhance quantum hardware performance, particularly in the context of quantum error correction.

Title: Observation of metastability in open quantum dynamics of a solid-state system
Authors: Jun-Xiang Zhang, Yuan-De Jin, Chu-Dan Qiu, Wen-Long Ma, Gang-Qin Liu
Abstract: Metastability is a ubiquitous phenomenon in non-equilibrium physics and classical stochastic this http URL arises when the system dynamics settles in long-lived states before eventually decaying to true equilibria. Remarkably, it has been predicted that quantum metastability can also occur in continuous-time and discrete-time open quantum dynamics. However, the direct experimental observation of metastability in open quantum systems has remained elusive. Here, we experimentally observe metastability in the discrete-time evolution of a single nuclear spin in diamond, realized by sequential Ramsey interferometry measurements of a nearby nitrogen-vacancy electron spin. We demonstrate that the metastable polarization of the nuclear spin emerges at around 60,000-250,000 sequential measurements, enabling high-fidelity single-shot readout of the nuclear spin under a small magnetic field of 108.4 gauss. An ultra-long spin relaxation time of more than 10 s has been observed at room temperature. By further increasing the measurement number, the nuclear spin eventually relaxes into the maximally mixed state. Our results represent a concrete step towards uncovering non-equilibrium physics in open quantum dynamics, which is practically relevant for the utilization of metastable information in various quantum information processing tasks, such as accurate quantum operations, quantum channel discrimination and quantum error correction.

Title: The surface code under generic $X$-error channels: Statistical mechanics, error thresholds, and errorfield double phenomenology
Authors: Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri
Abstract: We study the surface code under the most general single-qubit $X$-error channel, encompassing both coherent and incoherent errors. We develop a statistical mechanics mapping for the decoding problem and represent the partition function as a transfer-matrix, i.e., a (1+1)$D$ hybrid quantum circuit. The relevant circuit evolution, as we show, has an efficient matrix product state approximation, using which we develop an algorithm for large-scale syndrome sampling, thus enabling the simulation of these non-Pauli errors away from the limits captured by previous methods. Using these results, we compute maximum-likelihood thresholds and show that error coherence has negligible influence away from the fully coherent limit. We also study how coherence impacts information-theoretic measures like the coherent information, which we show to require, for accurate threshold estimates, increasingly large codes upon increasing error coherence and to eventually break down in the fully coherent limit. To interpret the dominant effect of incoherent errors in large codes, we develop a phenomenological errorfield double field theory, which indicates the instability of coherent errors' above-threshold quasi-long-range order to the above-threshold disorder characteristic of bit-flip errors and the suppression of coherence in the logical noise channel.

Title: Exponentially reduced circuit depths in Lindbladian simulation
Authors: Wenjun Yu, Xiaogang Li, Qi Zhao, Xiao Yuan
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently simulate Lindbladian dynamics, enabling powerful applications in open system simulation, thermal and ground-state preparation, autonomous quantum error correction, dissipative engineering, and more. Despite the abundance of well-established algorithms for closed-system dynamics, simulating open quantum systems on digital quantum computers remains challenging due to the intrinsic requirement for non-unitary operations. Existing methods face a critical trade-off: either relying on resource-intensive multi-qubit operations with experimentally challenging approaches or employing deep quantum circuits to suppress simulation errors using experimentally friendly methods. In this work, we challenge this perceived trade-off by proposing an efficient Lindbladian simulation framework that minimizes circuit depths while remaining experimentally accessible. Based on the incoherent linear combination of superoperators, our method achieves exponential reductions in circuit depth using at most two ancilla qubits and the straightforward Trotter decomposition of the process. Furthermore, our approach extends to simulate time-dependent Lindbladian dynamics, achieving logarithmic dependence on the inverse accuracy for the first time. Rigorous numerical simulations demonstrate clear advantages of our method over existing techniques. This work provides a practical and scalable solution for simulating open quantum systems on quantum devices.

Title: Investigating layer-selective transfer learning of QAOA parameters for Max-Cut problem
Authors: Francesco Aldo Venturelli, Sreetama Das, Filippo Caruso
Abstract: Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) ideal for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, and is highly successful for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). It has been observed that the optimal variational parameters obtained from one instance of a COP can be transferred to another instance, producing sufficiently satisfactory solutions for the latter. In this context, a suitable method for further improving the solution is to fine-tune a subset of the transferred parameters. We numerically explore the role of optimizing individual QAOA layers in improving the approximate solution of the Max-Cut problem after parameter transfer. We also investigate the trade-off between a good approximation and the required optimization time when optimizing transferred QAOA parameters. These studies show that optimizing a subset of layers can be more effective at a lower time-cost compared to optimizing all layers.

Title: Quantum Diffusion Model for Quark and Gluon Jet Generation
Authors: Mariia Baidachna, Rey Guadarrama, Gopal Ramesh Dahale, Tom Magorsch, Isabel Pedraza, Konstantin T. Matchev, Katia Matcheva, Kyoungchul Kong, Sergei Gleyzer
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation, but they are computationally intensive and time-consuming to train. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion model that benefits from quantum computing techniques in order to mitigate computational challenges and enhance generative performance within high energy physics data. The fully quantum diffusion model replaces Gaussian noise with random unitary matrices in the forward process and incorporates a variational quantum circuit within the U-Net in the denoising architecture. We run evaluations on the structurally complex quark and gluon jets dataset from the Large Hadron Collider. The results demonstrate that the fully quantum and hybrid models are competitive with a similar classical model for jet generation, highlighting the potential of using quantum techniques for machine learning problems.

Title: Quantum States with Maximal Magic
Authors: Gianluca Cuffaro, Christopher A. Fuchs
Abstract: Finding ways to quantify magic is an important problem in quantum information theory. Recently Leone, Oliviero and Hamma introduced a class of magic measures for qubits, the stabilizer entropies of order $\alpha$, to aid in studying nonstabilizer resource theory. This suggests a way to search for those states that are as distinct as possible from the stabilizer states. In this work we explore the problem in any finite dimension $d$ and characterize the states that saturate an upper bound on stabilizer entropies of order $\alpha\geq2$. Particularly, we show that if a Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) covariant Symmetric Informationally Complete (SIC) quantum measurement exists, its states uniquely maximize the stabilizer entropies by saturating the bound. No other states can reach so high. This result is surprising, as the initial motivation for studying SICs was a purely quantum-foundational concern in QBism. Yet our result may have implications for quantum computation at a practical level, as it demonstrates that this notion of maximal magic inherits all the difficulties of the 25-year-old SIC existence problem, along with the deep questions in number theory associated with it.

Title: Chaos-Driven Quantum State Discrimination Near Unit Fidelity
Authors: Sourav Paul, Anant Vijay Varma, Yogesh N. Joglekar, Sourin Das
Abstract: Distinguishing quantum states becomes exponentially difficult as their fidelity approaches unity, with diminishing success probabilities. This study revisits chaotic dynamics, leveraging their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions for rapid amplification of state discrimination measures. The discrete-time chaotic evolution of qubit states is generated via iterative application of a nonlinear conformal map on the Julia set. The "quantum microscope" is characterized by a magnification power quantified through a temporal Bell-type inequality. Fixed points of the conformal map are shown to dictate optimal measurement operators, enabling (a) well-defined magnification power and (b) bounded Bell-type inequality values, providing a device-independent framework for self-testing the microscopes performance.

Title: Efficient Approximate Degenerate Ordered Statistics Decoding for Quantum Codes via Reliable Subset Reduction
Authors: Ching-Feng Kung, Kao-Yueh Kuo, Ching-Yi Lai
Abstract: Efficient decoding of quantum codes is crucial for achieving high-performance quantum error correction. In this paper, we introduce the concept of approximate degenerate decoding and integrate it with ordered statistics decoding (OSD). Previously, we proposed a reliability metric that leverages both hard and soft decisions from the output of belief propagation (BP), which is particularly useful for identifying highly reliable subsets of variables. Using the approach of reliable subset reduction, we reduce the effective problem size. Additionally, we identify a degeneracy condition that allows high-order OSD to be simplified to order-0 OSD. By integrating these techniques, we present an ADOSD algorithm that significantly improves OSD efficiency in the code capacity noise model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BP+ADOSD approach through extensive simulations on a varity of quantum codes, including generalized hypergraph-product codes, topological codes, lift-connected surface codes, and bivariate bicycle codes. The results indicate that the BP+ADOSD decoder outperforms existing methods, achieving higher error thresholds and enhanced performance at low error rates. Additionally, we validate the efficiency of our approach in terms of computational time, demonstrating that ADOSD requires, on average, the same amount of time as two to three BP iterations on surface codes at a depolarizing error rate of around $1\%$. All the proposed algorithms are compared using single-threaded CPU implementations.

Title: Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation
Authors: Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow
Abstract: We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.

Title: Quantum Error Correction near the Coding Theoretical Bound
Authors: Daiki Komoto, Kenta Kasai
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have led to the realization of systems comprising tens of reliable logical qubits, constructed from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many of the critical applications that quantum computers aim to solve require quantum computations involving millions or more logical qubits. This necessitates highly efficient quantum error correction capable of handling large numbers of logical qubits. Classical error correction theory is well-developed, with low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes achieving performance limits by encoding large classical bits. Despite more than two decades of effort, no efficiently decodable quantum error-correcting code that approaches the hashing bound, which is a fundamental lower bound on quantum capacity, had been discovered. Here, we present quantum error-correcting codes constructed from classical LDPC codes that approach the hashing bound while maintaining linear computational complexity in the number of physical qubits. This result establishes a pathway toward realizing large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. By integrating our quantum error correction scheme with devices capable of managing vast numbers of qubits, the prospect of solving critical real-world problems through quantum computation is brought significantly closer.

Title: Enhanced Two-Way Teleportation of Entangled States with Six-Qubit Cluster State
Authors: Vedhanayagi R, Soubhik De, Basherrudin Mahmud Ahmed A, Alok Sharan
Abstract: This work presents a two-way teleportation protocol for the transfer of an unknown two-qubit quantum state between two parties Alice and Bob, utilizing a six-qubit cluster state. This bidirectional exchange is achieved by performing Bell measurements on the qubit pairs of Alice and Bob, ensuring the successful teleportation of the quantum state for both parties. We demonstrate the proposed protocol by designing a teleportation circuit that incorporates the necessary quantum gates. The fidelity of the teleportation process is evaluated through simulations, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the proposed scheme. The protocol restores teleported states without requiring CNOT operations or auxiliary qubits, offering a significant advantage in resource efficiency(utilization). A comparative analysis of the intrinsic efficiency with previous approaches establishes that the proposed protocol brings forth an efficient approach for achieving two-way quantum teleportation.

Title: Exploring Grassmann manifolds in topological systems via quantum distance
Authors: Shin-Ming Huang, Dimitrios Giataganas
Abstract: Quantum states defined over a parameter space form a Grassmann manifold. To capture the geometry of the associated gauge structure, gauge-invariant quantities are essential. We employ the projector of a multilevel system to quantify the quantum distance between states. Using the multidimensional scaling method, we transform the quantum distance into a reconstructed manifold embedded in Euclidean space. This approach is demonstrated with examples of topological systems, showcasing their topological features within these manifolds. Our method provides a comprehensive view of the manifold, rather than focusing on local properties.

Title: An Addressable and Tunable Module for Donor-based Scalable Silicon Quantum Computing
Authors: Shihang Zhang, Yu He, Peihao Huang
Abstract: Donor-based spin qubit offers a promising silicon quantum computing route for building large-scale qubit arrays, attributed to its long coherence time and advancements in nanoscale donor placement. However, the state-of-the-art device designs face scalability challenges, notably in achieving tunable two-qubit coupling and ensuring qubit addressability. Here, we propose a surface-code-compatible architecture, where each module has both tunable two-qubit gates and addressable single-qubit gates by introducing only a single extra donor in a pair of donors. We found that to compromise between the requirement of tunability and that of addressability, an asymmetric scheme is necessary. In this scheme, the introduced extra donor is strongly tunnel-coupled to one of the donor spin qubits for addressable single-qubit operation, while being more weakly coupled to the other to ensure the turning on and off of the two-qubit operation. The fidelity of single-qubit and two-qubit gates can exceed the fault-tolerant threshold in our design. Additionally, the asymmetric scheme effectively mitigates valley oscillations, allowing for engineering precision tolerances up to a few nanometers. Thus, our proposed scheme presents a promising prototype for large-scale, fault-tolerant, donor-based spin quantum processors.

Title: Quantum Transport in Interacting Spin Chains: Exact Derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom Distribution
Authors: Kazuya Fujimoto, Tomohiro Sasamoto
Abstract: We theoretically study quantum spin transport in a one-dimensional folded XXZ model with an alternating domain-wall initial state via the Bethe ansatz technique, exactly demonstrating that a probability distribution of finding a left-most up-spin with an appropriate scaling variable converges to the Tracy-Widom distribution for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), which is a universal distribution for the largest eigenvalue of GUE under a soft-edge scaling limit. Our finding presented here offers a first exact derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution in the dynamics of the interacting quantum model not being mapped to a noninteracting fermion Hamiltonian via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. On the basis of the exact solution of the folded XXZ model and our numerical analysis of the XXZ model, we discuss a universal behavior for the probability of finding the left-most up-spin in the XXZ model.

Title: Holographic fermions in the Dyonic Gubser-Rocha black hole
Authors: Cheng-Yuan Lu, Xian-Hui Ge, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We investigate the fermionic properties of a dyonic Gubser-Rocha model in the context of gauge/gravity duality. This model incorporates both a magnetic field and momentum relaxation. We have derived this model's scaling exponent, revealing the influence of the magnetic field and momentum relaxation on low-energy physics. As the magnetic field strength and momentum relaxation increase, the spectral function of the dual field changes significantly. Specifically, we observe variations in the scaling exponent, Fermi momentum, and dispersion relations as the magnetic field increases, highlighting the system's transition from a Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid, and eventually to an insulating state. Our analysis of the magneto-scattering rate reveals that it is nearly zero in the Fermi liquid region, increases significantly in the non-Fermi liquid region, and ultimately arrives at a maximum value in the insulating state.

Title: Anatomy of information scrambling and decoherence in the integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
Authors: Antonio M. García-García, Chang Liu, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot, Jie-ping Zheng
Abstract: The growth of information scrambling, captured by out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), is a central indicator of the nature of many-body quantum dynamics. Here, we compute analytically the complete time dependence of the OTOC for an integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ Majoranas with random two-body interactions of infinite range, coupled to a Markovian bath at finite temperature. In the limit of no coupling to the bath, the time evolution of scrambling experiences different stages. For $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$, after an initial polynomial growth, the OTOC approaches saturation in a power-law fashion with oscillations superimposed. At $t \sim \sqrt{N}$, the OTOC reverses trend and starts to decrease linearly in time. The reason for this linear decrease is that, despite being a subleading $1/N$ effect, the OTOC in this region is governed by the spectral form factor of the antisymmetric couplings of the SYK model. The linear decrease stops at $t \sim 2N$, the Heisenberg time, where saturation occurs. The effect of the environment is an overall exponential decay of the OTOC for times longer than the inverse of the coupling strength to the bath. The oscillations at $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$ indicate lack of thermalization -- a desired feature for a better performance of quantum information devices.

Title: Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance
Authors: Emre Ozan Polat, Zafer Artvin, Yusuf Şaki, Alpan Bek, Ramazan Sahin
Abstract: Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).

Title: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoder Framework for End-to-End Communication Systems
Authors: Bolun Zhang, Gan Zheng, Nguyen Van Huynh
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of quantum machine learning to End-to-End (E2E) communication systems in wireless fading scenarios. We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder architecture that combines parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder (QAE) framework to optimize the E2E communication system. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid system, and reveal that it is the first work that can achieve comparable block error rate (BLER) performance to classical DNN-based and conventional channel coding schemes, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, the proposed QAE exhibits steady and superior BLER convergence over the classical autoencoder baseline.

Title: Computing the graph-changing dynamics of loop quantum gravity
Authors: Thiago L. M. Guedes, Guillermo A. Mena Marugán, Francesca Vidotto, Markus Müller
Abstract: In loop quantum gravity (LQG), quantum states of the gravitational field are represented by labelled graphs called spinnetworks. Their dynamics can be described by a Hamiltonian constraint, which modifies the spinnetwork graphs. Fixed graph approximations of the dynamics have been extensively studied, but its full graph-changing action so far remains elusive. The latter, alongside the solutions of its constraint, are arguably the missing features to access physically correct quantum-relativistic phenomenology from canonical LQG. Here, we introduce the first numerical tool that implements graph-changing dynamics via the Hamiltonian constraint. We find new solutions to this constraint and show that some quantum-geometrical observables behave differently than in the graph-preserving truncation. This work aims at fostering a new era of numerical simulations in canonical LQG that, crucially, embrace the graph-changing aspects of its dynamics, laying aside debated approximations.

Abstract: We demonstrate trapping of individual rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms in an interleaved array of bright tweezers and dark bottle-beam traps, using a microfabricated optical element illuminated by a single laser beam. This trapping approach is simple and robust compared to common approaches that use active optoelectronic components and multiple laser wavelengths, and can be easily adapted for other atomic species.

Title: Taming Thiemann's Hamiltonian constraint in canonical loop quantum gravity: reversibility, eigenstates and graph-change analysis
Authors: Thiago L. M. Guedes, Guillermo A. Mena Marugán, Markus Müller, Francesca Vidotto
Abstract: The Hamiltonian constraint remains an elusive object in loop quantum gravity because its action on spinnetworks leads to changes in their corresponding graphs. As a result, calculations in loop quantum gravity are often considered unpractical, and neither the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian constraint, which form the physical space of states, nor the concrete effect of its graph-changing character on observables are entirely known. Much worse, there is no reference value to judge whether the commonly adopted graph-preserving approximations lead to results anywhere close to the non-approximated dynamics. Our work sheds light on many of these issues, by devising a new numerical tool that allows us to implement the action of the Hamiltonian constraint without the need for approximations and to calculate expectation values for geometric observables. To achieve that, we fill the theoretical gap left in the derivations of the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on spinnetworks: we provide the first complete derivation of such action for the case of 4-valent spinnetworks, while updating the corresponding derivation for 3-valent spinnetworks. Our derivations also include the action of the volume operator. By proposing a new approach to encode spinnetworks into functions of lists and the derived formulas into functionals, we implement both the Hamiltonian constraint and the volume operator numerically. We are able to transform spinnetworks with graph-changing dynamics perturbatively and verify that volume expectation values have rather different behavior from the approximated, graph-preserving results. Furthermore, using our tool we find a family of potentially relevant solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint. Our work paves the way to a new generation of calculations in loop quantum gravity, in which graph-changing results and their phenomenology can finally be accounted for and understood.

Title: False vacuum decay of excited states in finite-time instanton calculus
Authors: Björn Garbrecht, Nils Wagner
Abstract: Extracting information about a system's metastable ground state energy employing functional methods usually hinges on utilizing the late-time behavior of the Euclidean propagator, practically impeding the possibility of determining decay widths of excited states. We demonstrate that such obstacles can be surmounted by working with bounded time intervals, adapting the standard instanton formalism to compute a finite-time amplitude corresponding to excited state decay. This is achieved by projecting out the desired resonant energies utilizing carefully chosen approximations to the excited state wave functions in the false vacuum region. To carry out the calculation, we employ unconventional path integral techniques by considering the emerging amplitude as a single composite functional integral that includes fluctuations at the endpoints of the trajectories. This way, we explicitly compute the sought-after decay widths, including their leading quantum corrections, for arbitrary potentials, demonstrating accordance with traditional WKB results. While the initial starting point of weighting Euclidean propagator contributions according to their endpoints using false vacuum states has been proposed earlier, we find several flaws in the published evaluation of the relevant amplitudes. Although we show that the previous proposition of employing a sequential calculation scheme -- where the functional integral is evaluated around extremal trajectories with fixed endpoints, weighted only at a subsequent stage -- can lead to the desired goal, the novel composite approach is found to be more concise and transparent.

Title: Capturing strong correlation effects on a quantum annealer: calculation of avoided crossing in the H$_4$ molecule using the quantum annealer eigensolver
Authors: Aashna Anil Zade, Kenji Sugisaki, Matthias Werner, Ana Palacios, Artur Garcia-Saez, Arnau Riera, V. S. Prasannaa
Abstract: We broaden the scope of the Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm, an underexplored noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era approach for calculating atomic and molecular properties, to predict avoided crossings, where strong correlation effects are at play. For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.1% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver. Our work contributes to the existing body of literature on QAE by demonstrating that high-quality results can be achieved on noisy hardware.

Title: Algorithmic Idealism I: Reconceptualizing Reality Through Information and Experience
Authors: Krzysztof Sienicki
Abstract: Algorithmic idealism represents a transformative approach to understanding reality, emphasizing the informational structure of self-states and their algorithmic transitions over traditional notions of an external, objective universe. Rooted in algorithmic information theory, it redefines reality as a sequence of self-state transitions governed by principles such as Solomonoff induction. This framework offers a unified solution to longstanding challenges in quantum mechanics, cosmology, and metaphysics, addressing issues like the measurement problem, the Boltzmann brain paradox, and the simulation hypothesis. Algorithmic idealism shifts the focus from describing an independent external world to understanding first-person experiences, providing epistemic interpretations of physical theories and dissolving metaphysical divides between "real" and simulated realities. Beyond resolving these conceptual challenges, it raises profound ethical questions regarding the continuity, duplication, and termination of informational entities, reshaping discussions on identity, consciousness, and existence in the digital and quantum age. By offering a mathematically rigorous yet philosophically innovative framework, algorithmic idealism invites a rethinking of reality as an emergent property of informational dynamics rather than a static external construct.

Title: CubeSat single-photon detector module for investigating in-orbit laser annealing to heal radiation damage
Authors: Nigar Sultana, Joanna Krynski, Jin Gyu Lim, John Floyd, Michael Lembeck, Vadim Makarov, Paul Kwiat, Thomas Jennewein
Abstract: Single-photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) based on silicon are widely considered for quantum satellite communications but suffer from an increasing dark count rate (DCR) due to displacement damage in their active areas induced by proton radiation. When the DCR of SPADs exceeds a certain threshold, they become unusable for quantum communication protocols. Previous laboratory experiments have demonstrated that laser annealing of SPADs' active area with about 1~W optical power can significantly reduce radiation-induced DCR of synthetically irradiated SPADs. To assess the feasibility of in-orbit laser annealing on constantly irradiated SPADs in low-Earth orbit, we developed a module with a CubeSat form factor capable of both laser and thermal annealing of four silicon SPADs. Here we report the design and ground testing of this module, investigating laser annealing in a simulated space environment. Our results pave the way for an in-orbit trial that may prove this technology useful for future satellite missions with quantum receivers on board.

Title: Phonon-Induced Effects in Quantum Dot Absorption and Resonance Fluorescence with Hierarchy of Pure States
Authors: Sebastian Toivonen, Kimmo Luoma
Abstract: We investigate a quantum dot (QD) system coupled to a vibrational environment with a super-Ohmic spectral density and weakly to a leaky cavity mode, a model relevant for semiconductor-based single-photon sources. The phonon coupling induces dephasing and broadens the absorption and emission line shapes, while the weakly coupled cavity mode leads to effective driving of the QD. To capture non-Markovian effects, we use non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion and its hierarchical extension the Hierarchy of Pure States to compute multitime correlation functions underlying absorption and resonance fluorescence spectra. We present numerical results for the absorption spectra at strong phonon coupling and finite temperature, as well as for resonance fluorescence spectra at varying phonon coupling strengths and temperatures, and analyse the visibility of the resonance fluorescence spectra to provide insights into how phonon coupling and thermal effects influence the spectral features.

Title: Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder
Authors: Abel Thayil, Lasse Ermoneit, Markus Kantner
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by the empirical pseudopotential method to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature and compare our results with previous work. This framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.

Title: Dynamic transition of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model: multi-particles and inter-particle interaction effects
Authors: Wen Liang, Zhenhua Yu
Abstract: How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes. Previous analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the case that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method. We find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and is suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.

Title: Machine learning orbital-free density functional theory: taming quantum shell effects in deformed nuclei
Authors: X. H. Wu, Z. X. Ren, P. W. Zhao
Abstract: Accurate description of deformed atomic nuclei by the orbital-free density functional theory has been a longstanding textbook challenge, due to the difficulty in accounting for the intricate quantum shell effects that are present in such systems. Orbital-free density functional theory is, in principle, capable of describing all effects of nuclear systems, as guaranteed by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, from a microscopic perspective, shell and deformation effects are believed to be intrinsically connected to single-orbital structures, posing a significant challenge for orbital-free approaches. Here, we develop a machine learning approach to the orbital-free density functional theory, which is capable of achieving a high level of accuracy in describing the ground-state properties and potential energy curves for both spherical $^{16}$O and deformed $^{20}$Ne nuclei. This is the inaugural instance where a fully orbital-free energy density functional has succeeded in taming the complex shell effects in deformed nuclei. It demonstrates that the orbital-free energy density functional, which is directly based on the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, is not only a theoretical concept but also a practical one for nuclear systems.

Title: Simple Quantum Coins Enable Pretty Good State Transfer on Every Hypercube
Authors: Hanmeng Zhan
Abstract: We consider pretty good state transfer in coined quantum walks between antipodal vertices on the hypercube $Q_d$. When $d$ is a prime, this was proven to occur in the arc-reversal walk with Grover coins. We extend this result by constructing weighted Grover coins that enable pretty good state transfer on every $Q_d$. Our coins are real, and require modification of the weight on only one arc per vertex. We also generalize our approach and establish a sufficient condition for pretty good state transfer to occur on other graphs.

Title: Symmetry-enforced minimal entanglement and correlation in quantum spin chains
Authors: Kangle Li, Liujun Zou
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.

Title: The Smearing of Quasi-Particles: Signatures in the Entanglement Entropy of Excited Many-Particle Systems
Authors: Jagannath Sutradhar, Jonathan Ruhman, Avraham Klein, Dimitri Gutman, Richard Berkovits
Abstract: The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.

Title: Probing Light Bosonic Dark Matter with Transmon Qubits
Authors: Wei Chao, Yu Gao, Ming-die Jin, Xiao-sheng Liu, Xi-lei Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the constraints of the transmon qubit, an improved version of the charge qubit, on bosonic light dark matters. Phonon excitations induced by the scattering or absorption of dark matter on a superconductor may destroy the Cooper pair, leading to the production of quasiparticles made by the electron. By measuring the production rate of the quasiparticle density, one may read out the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter, assuming that these quasiparticles are solely induced by dark matter interactions. For the first time, we show constraints on the parameter space of the dark photon, light scalar dark matter, and axion-like particles from the measurement of quasiparticles in transmon qubit experiments. This study offers insights for the development of quantum qubit experiments aimed at the direct detection of dark matter in underground laboratories.

Title: Environmental gravitational decoherence with higher derivative theory
Authors: Linda M. van Manen
Abstract: We discuss the decoherence in a quantum system induced by interaction with gravitational degrees of freedom that are part of a higher derivative theory. The deformation of a mass distribution due to gravitational waves acquires naturally a mass quadrupole moment. This adds higher derivative dynamics of the quadrupole moment to the unitary evolution of the system, where the quadrupole moment oscillates with the gravitational frequencies following a higher derivative theory. The consequence of higher derivatives in the dynamics is that the system is described by four canonical variables. This departure from the usual particle position and momentum operators gives an entirely different interpretation of the decoherence basis. This model focuses on the open dynamics of the quadrupole moment, rather than on individual particles. As such, a short example is given to utilize quadrupole measurements to probe gravitational decoherence and noise. We first derive a Langevin equation for a lower derivative model and show how higher derivatives naturally emerge on the boundary. A quantum master equation is derived for the emerging quadrupole moment, considering that the environment is a higher derivative theory of gravity.

Title: Effects of alternating interactions and boundary conditions on quantum entanglement of three-leg Heisenberg ladder
Authors: Qinghui Li, Lizhen Hu, Panpan Zhang, Chuanzheng Miao, Yuliang Xu, Zhongqiang Liu, Xiangmu Kong
Abstract: The spin-12 three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder is studied under open boundary condition (OBC) and cylinder boundary condition (CBC), using the density matrix renormalization group and matrix product state methods, respectively. Specifically, we calculate the energy density, entanglement entropy, and concurrence while discussing the effects of interleg interaction J2 and the alternating coupling parameter gamma on these quantities. It is found that the introduction of gamma can completely reverse the concurrence distribution between odd and even bonds. Under CBC, the generation of the interleg concurrence is inhibited when gamma=0, and the introduction of gamma can cause interleg concurrence between chains 1 and 3, in which the behavior is more complicated due to the competition between CBC and gamma. Additionally, we find that gamma induces two types of long-distance entanglement (LDE) in the system under OBC: intraleg LDE and inter-leg one. When the system size is sufficiently large, both types of LDE reach similar strength and stabilize at a constant value. The study indicates that the three-leg ladder makes it easier to generate LDE compared with the two-leg system. However, the generation of LDE is inhibited under CBC which the spin frustration exists. In addition, the calculated results of energy, entanglement entropy and concurrence all show that there are essential relations between these quantities and phase transitions of the system. Further, we predict a phase transition point near gamma=0.54 under OBC. The present study provides valuable insights into understanding the phase diagram of this class of systems.

Title: First-principles Spin and Optical Properties of Vacancy Clusters in Lithium Fluoride
Authors: Mariano Guerrero Perez, Keegan Walkup, Jordan Chapman, Pranshu Bhaumik, Giti Khodaparast, Brenden Magill, Patrick Huber, Vsevolod Ivanov
Abstract: Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.

Title: 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Mirror Symmetry, TQFTs, and 't Hooft Anomaly Matching
Authors: Mahesh K. N. Balasubramanian, Anindya Banerjee, Matthew Buican, Zhihao Duan, Andrea E. V. Ferrari, Hongliang Jiang
Abstract: Any local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) has a corresponding "universal" relevant deformation that takes it to a gapped phase. This deformation preserves all continuous internal symmetries, $\mathcal{S}$, and therefore also preserves any 't Hooft anomalies supported purely in $\mathcal{S}$. We describe the resulting phase diagram in the case of SCFTs that arise as the endpoints of renormalization group flows from 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Abelian gauge theories with any number of $U(1)$ gauge group factors and arbitrary integer charges for the matter fields. We argue that the universal deformations take these QFTs to Abelian fractional quantum Hall states in the infrared (IR), and we explain how to match 't Hooft anomalies between the non-topological ultraviolet theories and the IR topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). Along the way, we give a proof that 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror symmetry of our Abelian gauge theories descends to a duality of these TQFTs. Finally, using our anomaly matching discussion, we describe how to connect, via the renormalization group, abstract local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs with certain 't Hooft anomalies for their internal symmetries to IR phases (partially) described by Abelian spin Chern-Simons theories.

Title: Quantum tunneling and its absence in deep wells and strong magnetic fields
Authors: Charles L. Fefferman, Jacob Shapiro, Michael I. Weinstein
Abstract: We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.

Title: Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture
Authors: Li Gan
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.

Title: Anyonization of bosons
Authors: Sudipta Dhar, Botao Wang, Milena Horvath, Amit Vashisht, Yi Zeng, Mikhail B. Zvonarev, Nathan Goldman, Yanliang Guo, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl
Abstract: Anyons are low-dimensional quasiparticles that obey fractional statistics, hence interpolating between bosons and fermions. In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states and they are believed to enable topological quantum computing. One-dimensional (1D) anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here, we observe anyonic correlations, which emerge through the phenomenon of spin-charge separation, in a 1D strongly-interacting quantum gas. The required spin degree of freedom is provided by a mobile impurity, whose effective anyonic correlations are associated with an experimentally tunable statistical angle. These anyonic correlations are measured by monitoring the impurity momentum distribution, whose asymmetric feature demonstrates the transmutation of bosons via anyons to fermions. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we study the dynamical properties of the anyonic correlations via dynamical fermionization of the anyons. Our work opens up the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting.

Title: Quantum algorithms for the simulation of QCD processes in the perturbative regime
Authors: Herschel A. Chawdhry, Mathieu Pellen
Abstract: Theoretical predictions for high-energy collision processes at particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), rely on calculations in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which are often computationally challenging. In these conference proceedings, we explore the possibility of using quantum computers to simulate QCD processes in the perturbative QCD regime. In particular, as a first step towards that goal, we present quantum circuits to simulate the colour part of perturbative QCD. The circuits are validated by implementing them on a simulated quantum computer and verifying the colour factors for several example Feynman diagrams.

Title: Impossibility of Local State Transformation via Hypercontractivity
Authors: Payam Delgosha, Salman Beigi
Abstract: Local state transformation is the problem of transforming an arbitrary number of copies of a bipartite resource state to a bipartite target state under local operations. That is, given two bipartite states, is it possible to transform an arbitrary number of copies of one of them to one copy of the other state under local operations only? This problem is a hard one in general since we assume that the number of copies of the resource state is arbitrarily large. In this paper we prove some bounds on this problem using the hypercontractivity properties of some super-operators corresponding to bipartite states. We measure hypercontractivity in terms of both the usual super-operator norms as well as completely bounded norms.

Title: Decoding quantum information via the Petz recovery map
Authors: Salman Beigi, Nilanjana Datta, Felix Leditzky
Abstract: We obtain a lower bound on the maximum number of qubits, $Q^{n, \epsilon}(\mathcal{N})$, which can be transmitted over $n$ uses of a quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$, for a given non-zero error threshold $\epsilon$. To obtain our result, we first derive a bound on the one-shot entanglement transmission capacity of the channel, and then compute its asymptotic expansion up to the second order. In our method to prove this achievability bound, the decoding map, used by the receiver on the output of the channel, is chosen to be the \emph{Petz recovery map} (also known as the \emph{transpose channel}). Our result, in particular, shows that this choice of the decoder can be used to establish the coherent information as an achievable rate for quantum information transmission. Applying our achievability bound to the 50-50 erasure channel (which has zero quantum capacity), we find that there is a sharp error threshold above which $Q^{n, \epsilon}(\mathcal{N})$ scales as $\sqrt{n}$.

Title: Encoding quantum bits in bound electronic states of a graphene nanotorus
Authors: J. Furtado, A. C. A. Ramos, J. E. G. Silva, R. Bachelard, Alan C. Santos
Abstract: We propose to use the quantum states of an electron trapped on the inner surface of a graphene nanotorus to realize as a new kind of physical quantum bit, which can be used to encode quantum information. Fundamental tasks for quantum information processing, such as the qubit initialization and the implementation of arbitrary single qubit gates, can then be performed using external magnetic and electric fields. We also analyze the robustness of the device again systematic errors, which can be suppressed by a suitable choice of the external control fields. These findings open new prospects for the development an alternative platform for quantum computing, the scalability of which remains to be determined.

Title: Bipartite polygon models: entanglement classes and their nonlocal behaviour
Authors: Mayalakshmi Kolangatt, Thigazholi Muruganandan, Sahil Gopalkrishna Naik, Tamal Guha, Manik Banik, Sutapa Saha
Abstract: Hardy's argument constitutes an elegantly logical test for identifying nonlocal features of multipartite correlations. In this paper, we investigate Hardy's nonlocal behavior within a broad class of operational theories, including the qubit state space as a specific case. Specifically, we begin by examining a wider range of operational models with state space descriptions in the form of regular polygons. First, we present a systematic method to characterize the possible forms of entangled states within bipartite compositions of these models. Then, through explicit examples, we identify the classes of entangled states that exhibit Hardy-type nonlocality. Remarkably, our findings highlight a closer analogy between odd polygon models and the qubit state space in terms of their bipartite Hardy nonlocal behavior compared to even-sided polygons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the emergence of mixed-state Hardy nonlocality in any operational model is determined by a specific symmetry inherent in its dynamic description. Finally, our results uncover an unexplored class of almost-quantum correlations that can be associated with an explicit operational model.

Title: Device-independent uncloneable encryption
Authors: Srijita Kundu, Ernest Y.-Z. Tan
Abstract: Uncloneable encryption, first introduced by Broadbent and Lord (TQC 2020) is a quantum encryption scheme in which a quantum ciphertext cannot be distributed between two non-communicating parties such that, given access to the decryption key, both parties cannot learn the underlying plaintext. In this work, we introduce a variant of uncloneable encryption in which several possible decryption keys can decrypt a particular encryption, and the security requirement is that two parties who receive independently generated decryption keys cannot both learn the underlying ciphertext. We show that this variant of uncloneable encryption can be achieved device-independently, i.e., without trusting the quantum states and measurements used in the scheme, and that this variant works just as well as the original definition in constructing quantum money. Moreover, we show that a simple modification of our scheme yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme, which was a related notion introduced by Georgiou and Zhandry. In particular, the resulting single-decryptor encryption scheme achieves device-independent security with respect to a standard definition of security against random plaintexts. Finally, we derive an "extractor" result for a two-adversary scenario, which in particular yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme for single bit-messages that achieves perfect anti-piracy security without needing the quantum random oracle model.

Title: Anomalous Heat Transfer in Nonequilibrium Quantum Systems
Authors: Teng Ma, Jing-Ning Zhang, Yuan-Sheng Wang, Hong-Yi Xie, Man-Hong Yung
Abstract: Anomalous heat transfer (AHT), a process by which heat spontaneously flows from a cold system into a hot one, superficially contradicts the Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Here we provide a full classification of mechanisms of the AHT in nonequilibrium quantum systems from a quantum-information perspective. For initial states in local equilibrium, we find that the AHT can arise from three resources: initial correlation, intrasystem interaction, and intrasystem temperature inhomogeneity. In particular, for qubit systems, we prove that initial quantum coherence is necessary for AHT if the intersystem interactions are limited to the two-body type. We explicitly show the AHT dominated by each of the mechanisms in a three-qubit system. Our classification scheme may offer a guideline for developing high-efficiency quantum autonomous thermal machines.

Title: Ultratight confinement of atoms in a Rydberg empowered optical lattice
Authors: Mohammadsadegh Khazali
Abstract: Optical lattices serve as fundamental building blocks for atomic quantum technology. However, the scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. In conventional lattices, achieving tight confinement of single sites requires high laser intensity, which unfortunately leads to reduced coherence due to increased scattering. This article presents a novel approach for creating an atomic optical lattice with a sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is generated by leveraging the nonlinear optical response of three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which allows us to overcome the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The resulting lattice comprises a three-dimensional array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells over nanometer scales. These unprecedented scales can now be accessed through a hybrid scheme that combines the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The feasibility study shows that single-atom confinement in Lorentzian sites with 3nm width, and 37MHz depth are realizable with available lasers. The development of these ultra-narrow trapping techniques holds great promise for applications such as Rydberg-Fermi gates, atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation.

Title: Quantum state testing beyond the polarizing regime and quantum triangular discrimination
Authors: Yupan Liu
Abstract: The complexity class Quantum Statistical Zero-Knowledge ($\mathsf{QSZK}$) captures computational difficulties of the time-bounded quantum state testing problem with respect to the trace distance, known as the Quantum State Distinguishability Problem (QSDP) introduced by Watrous (FOCS 2002). However, QSDP is in $\mathsf{QSZK}$ merely within the constant polarizing regime, similar to its classical counterpart shown by Sahai and Vadhan (JACM 2003) due to the polarization lemma (error reduction for SDP). Recently, Berman, Degwekar, Rothblum, and Vasudevan (TCC 2019) extended the $\mathsf{SZK}$ containment for SDP beyond the polarizing regime via the time-bounded distribution testing problems with respect to the triangular discrimination and the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Our work introduces proper quantum analogs for these problems by defining quantum counterparts for triangular discrimination. We investigate whether the quantum analogs behave similarly to their classical counterparts and examine the limitations of existing approaches to polarization regarding quantum distances. These new $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete problems improve $\mathsf{QSZK}$ containments for QSDP beyond the polarizing regime and establish a simple $\mathsf{QSZK}$-hardness for the quantum entropy difference problem (QEDP) defined by Ben-Aroya, Schwartz, and Ta-Shma (ToC 2010). Furthermore, we prove that QSDP with some exponentially small errors is in $\mathsf{PP}$, while the same problem without error is in $\mathsf{NQP}$.

Title: Quantum algorithm for collisionless Boltzmann simulation of self-gravitating systems
Authors: Soichiro Yamazaki, Fumio Uchida, Kotaro Fujisawa, Koichi Miyamoto, Naoki Yoshida
Abstract: The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) is a fundamental equation that governs the dynamics of a broad range of astrophysical systems from space plasma to star clusters and galaxies. It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a multi-dimensional phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova & Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on Nv , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64*64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers.

Title: Fast Partitioning of Pauli Strings into Commuting Families for Optimal Expectation Value Measurements of Dense Operators
Authors: Ben Reggio, Nouman Butt, Andrew Lytle, Patrick Draper
Abstract: The Pauli strings appearing in the decomposition of an operator can be can be grouped into commuting families, reducing the number of quantum circuits needed to measure the expectation value of the operator. We detail an algorithm to completely partition the full set of Pauli strings acting on any number of qubits into the minimal number of sets of commuting families, and we provide python code to perform the partitioning. The partitioning method scales linearly with the size of the set of Pauli strings and it naturally provides a fast method of diagonalizing the commuting families with quantum gates. We provide a package that integrates the partitioning into Qiskit, and use this to benchmark the algorithm with dense Hamiltonians, such as those that arise in matrix quantum mechanics models, on IBM hardware. We demonstrate computational speedups close to the theoretical limit of $(3/2)^m$ relative to qubit-wise commuting groupings, for $m=2,\dotsc,6$ qubits.

Title: Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-Time Sampling and Verifiable Quantum Advantage: Stabilizer Scheme and Classical Security
Authors: Michael J. Bremner, Bin Cheng, Zhengfeng Ji
Abstract: Sampling problems demonstrating beyond classical computing power with noisy intermediate scale quantum devices have been experimentally realized. In those realizations, however, our trust that the quantum devices faithfully solve the claimed sampling problems is usually limited to simulations of smaller-scale instances and is, therefore, indirect. The problem of verifiable quantum advantage aims to resolve this critical issue and provides us with greater confidence in a claimed advantage. Instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling has been proposed to achieve beyond classical capabilities with a verifiable scheme based on quadratic-residue codes (QRC). Unfortunately, this verification scheme was recently broken by an attack proposed by Kahanamoku-Meyer. In this work, we revive IQP-based verifiable quantum advantage by making two major contributions. Firstly, we introduce a family of IQP sampling protocols called the stabilizer scheme, which builds on results linking IQP circuits, the stabilizer formalism, coding theory, and an efficient characterization of IQP circuit correlation functions. This construction extends the scope of existing IQP-based schemes while maintaining their simplicity and verifiability. Secondly, we introduce the Hidden Structured Code (HSC) problem as a well-defined mathematical challenge that underlies the stabilizer scheme. To assess classical security, we explore a class of attacks based on secret extraction, including the Kahanamoku-Meyer's attack as a special case. We provide evidence of the security of the stabilizer scheme, assuming the hardness of the HSC problem. We also point out that the vulnerability observed in the original QRC scheme is primarily attributed to inappropriate parameter choices, which can be naturally rectified with proper parameter settings.

Title: Designs from Local Random Quantum Circuits with SU(d) Symmetry
Authors: Zimu Li, Han Zheng, Junyu Liu, Liang Jiang, Zi-Wen Liu
Abstract: The generation of $k$-designs (pseudorandom distributions that emulate the Haar measure up to $k$ moments) with local quantum circuit ensembles is a problem of fundamental importance in quantum information and physics. Despite the extensive understanding of this problem for ordinary random circuits, the crucial situations where symmetries or conservation laws are in play are known to pose fundamental challenges and remain little understood. We construct, for the first time, explicit local unitary ensembles that can achieve high-order unitary $k$-designs under transversal continuous symmetry, in the particularly important SU$(d)$ case. Specifically, we define the Convolutional Quantum Alternating group (CQA) generated by 4-local SU$(d)$-symmetric Hamiltonians as well as associated 4-local SU$(d)$-symmetric random unitary circuit ensembles, and prove that they form and converge to SU$(d)$-symmetric $k$-designs, respectively, for all $k < n(n-3)/2$ with $n$ being the number of qudits. A key technique that we employ to obtain the results is the Okounkov--Vershik approach to $S_n$ representation theory. To study the convergence time of the CQA ensemble, we develop a numerical method using the Young orthogonal form and $S_n$ branching rule. We provide strong evidence for a subconstant spectral gap and certain convergence time scales of various important circuit architectures, which contrast with the symmetry-free case. We also provide comprehensive explanations of the difficulties and limitations in rigorously analyzing the convergence time using methods that have been effective for cases without symmetries, including Knabe's local gap threshold and Nachtergaele's martingale methods. This suggests that a novel approach is likely necessary for understanding the convergence time of SU$(d)$-symmetric local random circuits.

Title: Typical entanglement entropy in systems with particle-number conservation
Authors: Yale Yauk, Rohit Patil, Yicheng Zhang, Marcos Rigol, Lucas Hackl
Abstract: We calculate the typical bipartite entanglement entropy $\langle S_A\rangle_N$ in systems containing indistinguishable particles of any kind as a function of the total particle number $N$, the volume $V$, and the subsystem fraction $f=V_A/V$, where $V_A$ is the volume of the subsystem. We expand our result as a power series $\langle S_A\rangle_N=a f V+b\sqrt{V}+c+o(1)$, and find that $c$ is universal (i.e., independent of the system type), while $a$ and $b$ can be obtained from a generating function characterizing the local Hilbert space dimension. We illustrate the generality of our findings by studying a wide range of different systems, e.g., bosons, fermions, spins, and mixtures thereof. We provide evidence that our analytical results describe the entanglement entropy of highly excited eigenstates of quantum-chaotic spin and boson systems, which is distinct from that of integrable counterparts.

Title: A multiple-circuit approach to quantum resource reduction with application to the quantum lattice Boltzmann method
Authors: Melody Lee, Zhixin Song, Sriharsha Kocherla, Austin Adams, Alexander Alexeev, Spencer H. Bryngelson
Abstract: This work proposes a multi-circuit quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) algorithm that leverages parallel quantum computing to reduce quantum resource requirements. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient for these computations. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems are based on single quantum circuits and, in many cases, use lattice-based methods. Current quantum devices are adorned with sufficient noise to make large and deep circuits untenable. We introduce a multiple-circuit algorithm for a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) solve of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The method, called QLBM-frugal, aims to create more practical quantum circuits and strategies for differential equation-based problems. The presented method is validated and demonstrated for 2D lid-driven cavity flow. The two-circuit algorithm shows a marked reduction in CNOT gates, which consume the majority of the runtime on quantum devices. Compared to the baseline QLBM technique, a two-circuit strategy shows increasingly large improvements in gate counts as the qubit size, or problem size, increases. For 64 lattice sites, the CNOT count was reduced by 35%, and the gate depth decreased by 16%. This strategy also enables concurrent circuit execution, further halving the seen gate depth.

Title: A General PSTD Method to Solve Quantum Scattering in the Fresnel and Far-field regions by A Localized Potential of Arbitrary Form
Authors: Kun Chen
Abstract: We present a time domain method to solve quantum scattering by an arbitrary potential of finite range. The scattering wave function in full space can be obtained, including the near field, the mid field (i.e. Fresnel region) and the far field. This is achieved by extending several techniques of FDTD computational electrodynamics into the quantum realm. The total-field/scattered-field scheme naturally incorporates the incidence source condition. The wave function in the internal model, including the interaction region and the close near field, is directly computed through PSTD/FDTD iterations. The quantum version of surface equivalence theorem is proven and links the wave function in the external free space to the PSTD/FDTD solution in the internal model. Parallel implementation of PSTD based on overlapping domain decomposition and FFT on local Fourier-basis is briefly discussed. These building blocks unite into a numerical system that provides a general, robust solver to potential scattering problems. Its accuracy is verified by the established partial wave method, by comparing the predictions of both on the central square potential scattering. Further investigations show the far-field solution is inadequate for simulating Fresnel-region effects.

Title: Quantum analog of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics
Authors: Yuefei Liu, Ivan P. Miranda, Lee Johnson, Anders Bergman, Anna Delin, Danny Thonig, Manuel Pereiro, Olle Eriksson, Vahid Azimi Mousolou, Erik Sjöqvist
Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) and Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equations play an essential role for describing the dynamics of magnetization in solids. While a quantum analog of the LL dynamics has been proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 147201 (2013)], the corresponding quantum version of LLG remains unknown. Here, we propose such a quantum LLG equation that inherently conserves purity of the quantum state. We examine the quantum LLG dynamics of a dimer consisting of two interacting spin-1/2 particles. Our analysis reveals that, in the case of ferromagnetic coupling, the evolution of initially uncorrelated spins mirrors the classical LLG dynamics. However, in the antiferromagnetic scenario, we observe pronounced deviations from classical behavior, underscoring the unique dynamics of becoming a spinless state, which is non-locally correlated. Moreover, when considering spins that are initially entangled, our study uncovers an unusual form of revival-type quantum correlation dynamics, which differs significantly from what is typically seen in open quantum systems.

Title: Time-dependent conserved operators for autonomous systems and quantization of resistance
Authors: Jorge A. Lizarraga
Abstract: Two systems for a charged particle are studied, the first one when it is under the effect of a constant electric field, and the second one when it is under the effect of a constant electromagnetic field. For both systems, it is possible to find time-dependent conserved operators that can be used to derive time-dependent wave functions to the complete Schrödinger equation, such that the time variable is not separable from the space coordinates. At the same time, these conserved operators are used to build up a unitary operators, which define the symmetries of the systems. Then, it is shown that the invariance of the wave function under the action of these unitary operators leads to the quantization of resistance as integer multiples of the Klitzing's constant.

Title: Generalized group designs: overcoming the 4-design-barrier and constructing novel unitary 2-designs in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: Ágoston Kaposi, Zoltán Kolarovszki, Adrián Solymos, Zoltán Zimborás
Abstract: Unitary designs are essential tools in several quantum information protocols. Similarly to other design concepts, unitary designs are mainly used to facilitate averaging over a relevant space, in this case, the unitary group $\mathrm{U}(d)$. While it is known that exact unitary $t$-designs exist for any degree $t$ and dimension $d$, the most appealing type of designs, group designs (in which the elements of the design form a group), can provide at most $3$-designs. Moreover, even group $2$-designs can only exist in limited dimensions. In this paper, we present novel construction methods for creating exact generalized group designs based on the representation theory of the unitary group and its finite subgroups that overcome the $4$-design-barrier of unitary group designs. Furthermore, a construction is presented for creating generalized group $2$-designs in arbitrary dimensions.

Title: Optimal-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition for quantum simulation on noisy quantum computers
Authors: A. A. Avtandilyan, W. V. Pogosov
Abstract: The potential of employing higher orders of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the evolution operator for more effective simulations of quantum systems on a noisy quantum computer is explored. By examining the transverse-field Ising model and the XY model, it is demonstrated that when the gate error is decreased by approximately an order of magnitude relative to typical modern values, higher-order Trotterization becomes advantageous. This form of Trotterization yields a global minimum of the overall simulation error, comprising both the mathematical error of Trotterization and the physical error arising from gate execution.

Title: Nonreciprocal Multipartite Entanglement in a two-cavity magnomechanical system
Authors: Rizwan Ahmed, Hazrat Ali, Aamir Shehzad, S K Singh, Amjad Sohail, Marcos Cesar de Oliveira
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for the generation of nonreciprocal multipartite entanglement in a two-mode cavity magnomechanical system, consisting of two cross-microwave (MW) cavities having a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which is coupled through magnetic dipole interaction. Our results show that the self-Kerr effect of magnon can significantly enhance multipartite entanglement, which turns out to be nonreciprocal when the magnetic field is tuned along the crystallographic axis [110]. This is due to the frequency shift on the magnons (YIG sphere), which depends on the direction of the magnetic field. Interestingly, the degree of nonreciprocity of bipartite entanglements depends upon a careful optimal choice of system parameters like normalized cavity detunings, bipartite nonlinear index, self-Kerr coefficient, and effective magnomechanical coupling rate G. In addition to bipartite entanglement, we also present the idea of a bidirectional contrast ratio, which quantifies the nonreciprocity in tripartite entanglements. Our present theoretical proposal for nonreciprocity in multipartite entanglement may find applications in diverse engineering nonreciprocal devices

Title: Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit
Authors: Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen
Abstract: Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.

Title: Self-ordering, cooling, and lasing in an ensemble of clock atoms
Authors: Anna Bychek, Laurin Ostermann, Helmut Ritsch
Abstract: Active atomic clocks are predicted to provide far better short-term stability and robustness against thermal fluctuations than typical feedback-based optical atomic clocks. However, continuous laser operation using an ensemble of clock atoms still remains an experimentally challenging task. We study spatial self-organization in a transversely driven ensemble of clock atoms inside an optical resonator and coherent light emission from the cavity. We focus on the spectral properties of the emitted light in the narrow atomic linewidth regime, where the phase coherence providing frequency stability is stored in the atomic dipoles rather than the cavity field. The atoms are off-resonantly driven by a standing-wave coherent laser transversely to the cavity axis allowing for atomic motion along the cavity axis as well as along the pump. In order to treat larger atom numbers we employ a second-order cumulant expansion which allows us to calculate the spectrum of the cavity light field. We identify the self-organization threshold where the atoms align themselves in a checkerboard pattern, thus maximizing light scattering into the cavity, which simultaneously induces cooling. For a larger driving intensity, more atoms are transferred to the excited state, reducing cooling but increasing light emission from the excited atoms. This can be enhanced via a second cavity mode at the atomic frequency spatially shifted by a quarter wavelength. For large enough atom numbers we observe laser-like emission close to the bare atomic transition frequency.

Title: Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes
Authors: Ming Wang, Frank Mueller
Abstract: This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.

Title: Symmetries of Liouvillians of squeeze-driven parametric oscillators
Authors: Francesco Iachello, Colin V. Coane, Jayameenakshi Venkatraman
Abstract: We study the symmetries of the Liouville superoperator of one dimensional parametric oscillators, especially the so-called squeeze-driven Kerr oscillator, and discover a remarkable quasi-spin symmetry $su(2)$ at integer values of the ratio $\eta =\omega /K$ of the detuning parameter $\omega$ to the Kerr coefficient $K$, which reflects the symmetry previously found for the Hamiltonian operator. We find that the Liouvillian of an $su(2)$ representation $\left\vert j,m_{j}\right\rangle$ has a characteristic double-ellipsoidal structure, and calculate the relaxation time $T_{X}$ for this structure. We then study the phase transitions of the Liouvillian which occur as a function of the parameters $\xi =\varepsilon _{2}/K$ and $\eta=\omega /K$. Finally, we study the temperature dependence of the spectrum of eigenvalues of the Liouvillian. Our findings may have applications in the generation and stabilization of states of interest in quantum computing.

Title: Chaos and spatial prethermalization in driven-dissipative bosonic chains
Authors: Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona
Abstract: Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.

Title: Oscillatory dissipative tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential

Abstract: Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influence the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully adjustable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show a quantum simulator system that consists of a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity that can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout, based on a tunnel Josephson junction circuit, of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work is a first step for the development of analog molecule simulators of proton transfer reactions based on quantum superconducting circuits.

Title: Atom graph, partial Boolean algebra and quantum contextuality
Authors: Songyi Liu, Yongjun Wang, Baoshan Wang, Jian Yan, Heng Zhou
Abstract: Partial Boolean algebra underlies the quantum logic as an important tool for quantum contextuality. We propose the notion atom graphs to reveal the graph structure of partial Boolean algebra for finite dimensional quantum systems by proving that (i) the partial Boolean algebras for quantum systems are determined by their atom graphs; (ii) the states on atom graphs can be extended uniquely to the partial Boolean algebras, and (iii) each exclusivity graph is an induced graph of an atom graph. (i) and (ii) show that the finite dimensional quantum systems are uniquely determined by their atom graphs. which proves the reasonability of graphs as the models of quantum experiments. (iii) establishes a connection between atom graphs and exclusivity graphs, and introduces a method to express the exclusivity experiments more precisely. We also present a general and parametric description for Kochen-Specker theorem based on graphs, which gives a type of non-contextuality inequality for KS contextuality.

Title: Four-qubit critical states
Authors: Luke Oeding, Ian Tan
Abstract: Verstraete, Dehaene, and De Moor (2003) showed that SLOCC invariants provide entanglement monotones. We observe that many highly entangled or useful four-qubit states that appear in prior literature are stationary points of such entanglement measures. This motivates the search for more stationary points. We use the notion of critical points (in the sense of the Kempf-Ness theorem) together with Vinberg theory to reduce the complexity of the problem significantly. We solve the corresponding systems utilizing modern numerical nonlinear algebra methods and reduce the solutions by natural symmetries. This method produces an extended list of four-qubit stationary points, which includes all the critical states in the survey by Enriquez et al (2016).

Title: Quantum correlations enhanced in hybrid optomechanical system via phase tuning
Authors: K. B. Emale, J.-X. Peng, P. Djorwe, A. K. Sarma, Abdourahimi, A.-H. Abdel-Aty, K.S. Nisar, S. G. N. Engo
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical framework for enhancing quantum correlations in a hybrid double-cavity optomechanical system that hosts an atomic ensemble. We investigate the role of the coupling phase $\phi$ between cavity 1 and the atomic ensemble in optimizing quantum correlations, i.e., bipartite/tripartite quantum entanglement and quantum discord. By employing metrics such as logarithmic negativity for bipartite entanglement and minimum residual contangle for genuine tripartite entanglement, we demonstrate that tuning the phase $\phi$ is essential for maximizing photon-phonon entanglement. Specifically, we find that optimal entanglement occurs at $\phi=n\pi$, with distinct conditions for odd and even integers $n$. Our results also indicate that the quantum entanglement achieved in this system is robust against thermal fluctuations, making it a promising candidate for applications in quantum information processing and quantum computing. Furthermore, this research highlights the significance of phase tuning in controlling quantum correlations, paving the way for advancements in quantum technologies.

Title: Extractable energy from quantum superposition of current states
Authors: Francesco Perciavalle, Davide Rossini, Juan Polo, Luigi Amico
Abstract: We explore the energy content of superpositions of current states. Specifically, we focus on the maximum energy that can be extracted from them through local unitary transformations. The figure of merit we employ is the local ergotropy. We perform a complete analysis in the whole range of the system's parameters. This way, we prove that superpositions of two current states in spatially closed spin networks are characterized by specific peaks in extractable energy, generally overcoming the ergotropy of each of the two separate current states characterized by a single winding number. The many-body state dynamics entails to ergotropy evolving in a controlled fashion. The implementation we suggest is based on a Rydberg-atom platform. Optimal transformations able to extract locally the maximum possible amount of energy are sorted out.

Title: Solving the Independent Domination Problem by Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
Authors: Haoqian Pan, Changhong Lu
Abstract: In the wake of quantum computing advancements and quantum algorithmic progress, quantum algorithms are increasingly being employed to address a myriad of combinatorial optimization problems. Among these, the Independent Domination Problem (IDP), a derivative of the Domination Problem, has practical implications in various real-world scenarios. Despite this, existing classical algorithms for IDP are plagued by high computational complexity, and quantum algorithms have yet to tackle this challenge. This paper introduces a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)-based approach to address the IDP. Utilizing IBM's qasm_simulator, we have demonstrated the efficacy of QAOA in solving IDP under specific parameter settings, with a computational complexity that surpasses that of classical methods. Our findings offer a novel avenue for the resolution of IDP.

Title: Application of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Solving the Total Domination Problem
Authors: Haoqian Pan, Shiyue Wang, Changhong Lu
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have led to significant research into applying quantum algorithms to combinatorial optimization problems. Among these challenges, the Total Domination Problem (TDP) is particularly noteworthy, representing a classic and critical example in the field. Since the last century, research efforts have focused on establishing its NP-completeness and developing algorithms for its resolution, which have been fundamental to combinatorial mathematics. Despite this rich history, the application of quantum algorithms to the TDP remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a pioneering application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to tackle the TDP, evaluating its efficacy across a diverse array of parameters. Our experimental findings indicate that QAOA is effective in addressing the TDP; under most parameter combinations, it successfully computes the correct total dominating set (TDS). However, the algorithm's performance in identifying the optimal TDS is contingent upon the specific parameter choices, revealing a significant bias in the distribution of effective parameter points. This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of quantum algorithms for addressing the TDP and lays the groundwork for future investigations in this area.

Title: On some states minimizing uncertainty relations
Authors: Krzysztof Urbanowski
Abstract: Analyzing Heisenberg-Robertson (HR) and Schrödinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non-commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. We have also shown that the so-called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states.

Title: Solving the Perfect Domination Problem by Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with Small Layers
Authors: Haoqian Pan, Changhong Lu, Yuqing Zheng
Abstract: The Perfect Domination Problem (PDP), a classical challenge in combinatorial optimization, has significant applications in real-world scenarios, such as wireless and social networks. Over several decades of research, the problem has been demonstrated to be NP-complete across numerous graph classes. With the recent advancements in quantum computing, there has been a surge in the development of quantum algorithms aimed at addressing NP-complete problems, including the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). However, the applicability of quantum algorithms to the PDP, as well as their efficacy in solving it, remains largely unexplored. This study represents a pioneering effort to apply QAOA, with a limited number of layers, to address the PDP. Comprehensive testing and analysis were conducted across 420 distinct parameter combinations. Experimental results indicate that QAOA successfully identified the correct Perfect Dominating Set (PDS) in 82 cases, including 17 instances where the optimal PDS was computed. Furthermore, it was observed that with appropriate parameter settings, the approximation ratio could achieve a value close to 0.9. These findings underscore the potential of QAOA as a viable approach for solving the PDP, signifying an important milestone that introduces this problem into the realm of quantum computing.

Title: A Novel Pseudo-Spectral Time-Domain Theory of Magnetic Neutron Scattering Illustrated Using A Uniformly Magnetized Sphere
Authors: Kun Chen
Abstract: A universal numerical method is developed for the investigation of magnetic neutron scattering. By applying the pseudospectral-time-domain (PSTD) algorithm to the spinor version of the Schrödinger equation, the evolution of the spin-state of the scattered wave can be solved in full space and time. This extra spin degree of freedom brings some unique new features absent in the numerical theory on the scalar wave scatterings [1]. Different numerical stability condition has to be re-derived due to the coupling between the different spin states. As the simplest application, the neutron scattering by the magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is studied. The PSTD predictions are compared with those from the Born-approximation. This work not only provides a systematic tool for analyzing spin-matter interactions, but also builds the forward model for testing novel neutron imaging methodologies, such as the newly developed thermal neutron Fourier-transform ghost imaging.

Title: An alternative explicit circuit diagram for the quantum search algorithm by implementing a non-unitary gate
Authors: Ammar Daskin
Abstract: Since the final quantum state in the Grover search algorithm is the normalized marked quantum state in the Gram-Schmidt process, Abrams and Lloyd [1] has showed that we can generate this vector by using a non-unitary gate or an approximation of this non-unitary gate. Following Abrams and Lloyd [1], in this paper, we present an example explicit unitary implementation by using the square root of the non-unitary matrix. In this implementation, the reading of the marked element with high probability still requires repetitions similar to the original algorithm. However, we show that in smaller numerical cases one can obtain the solution with $O(n)$ repetitions. Since we still use the marking part of the original algorithm, $U_{mark}$, the complexity for a single repetition of the circuit is bounded by the complexity of this operator. We also discuss how the implementation of the non-unitary can be done through linear combination of unitary matrices or similar methods. Finally we discuss how these approximations may change the complexity.

Title: Chiral anomaly in (1+1) dimensions revisited: complementary kinetic perspective and universality
Authors: Wei-Han Hsiao, Chiao-Hsuan Wang
Abstract: We reinvestigate the classic example of the chiral anomaly in (1+1) dimensional spacetime. By reviewing the derivation of charge conservation using the semiclassical Boltzmann equation, we show that chiral anomalies could emerge in (1+1) dimensions without Berry curvature corrections to the kinetic theory. The pivotal step depends only on the asymptotic behavior of the distribution function of the quasiparticle--and thus its dispersion relation--in the limit of $\mathbf p\to\pm\infty$ rather than the detailed functional form of the dispersion. We address two subjects motivated by this observation. First, we reformulate (1+1)-dimensional chiral anomaly using kinetic theory with the current algebra approach and the gradient expansion of the Dirac Lagrangian, adding a complementary perspective to existing approaches. Second, we demonstrate the universality of the chiral anomaly across various quasiparticle dispersions. For two-band models linear in the temporal derivative, with Fujikawa's method we show it is sufficient to have a chirality-odd strictly monotonic dispersion in order to exhibit the chiral anomaly.

Title: Live magnetic observation of parahydrogen hyperpolarization dynamics
Authors: James Eills, Morgan W. Mitchell, Irene Marco Rius, Michael C. D. Tayler
Abstract: Hyperpolarized nuclear spins in molecules exhibit high magnetization that is unachievable by classical polarization techniques, making them widely used as sensors in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The state of a hyperpolarized material, however, is typically only studied indirectly and with partial destruction of magnetization, due to the nature of conventional detection by resonant-pickup nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or imaging. Here we establish atomic magnetometers with sub-pT sensitivity as an alternative modality to detect in real time the complex dynamics of hyperpolarized materials without disturbing or interrupting the magnetogenesis process. As an example of dynamics that are impossible to detect in real time by conventional means, we examine parahydrogen-induced $^{1}$H and $^{13}$C magnetization during adiabatic eigenbasis transformations at $\mu$T-field avoided crossings. Continuous but nondestructive magnetometry reveals previously unseen spin dynamics, fidelity limits, and magnetization backaction effects. As a second example, we apply magnetometry to observe the chemical-exchange-driven $^{13}$C hyperpolarization of [1--$^{13}$C]-pyruvate -- the most important spin tracer for clinical metabolic imaging. The approach can be readily combined with other high-sensitivity magnetometers and is applicable to a broader range of general observation scenarios involving production, transport and systems interaction of hyperpolarized compounds.

Title: Cyclic Quantum Annealing: Searching for Deep Low-Energy States in 5000-Qubit Spin Glass
Authors: Hao Zhang, Kelly Boothby, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Quantum computers promise a qualitative speedup in solving a broad spectrum of practical optimization problems. The latter can be mapped onto the task of finding low-energy states of spin glasses, which is known to be exceedingly difficult. Using D-Wave's 5000-qubit quantum processor, we demonstrate that a recently proposed iterative cyclic quantum annealing algorithm can find deep low-energy states in record time. We also find intricate structures in a low-energy landscape of spin glasses, such as a power-law distribution of connected clusters with a small surface energy. These observations offer guidance for further improvement of the optimization algorithms.

Title: Routing and Spectrum Allocation in Broadband Quantum Entanglement Distribution
Authors: Rohan Bali, Ashley N. Tittelbaugh, Shelbi L. Jenkins, Anuj Agrawal, Jerry Horgan, Marco Ruffini, Daniel C. Kilper, Boulat A. Bash
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single broadband quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing and spectrum allocation scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. As our setting allows separately solving the routing and spectrum allocation problems, we first find an optimal polynomial-time routing algorithm. We then employ max-min fairness criterion for spectrum allocation, which presents an NP-hard problem. Thus, we focus on approximately-optimal schemes. We compare their performance by evaluating the max-min and median number of EPR-pair rates assigned by them, and the associated Jain index. We identify two polynomial-time approximation algorithms that perform well, or better than others under these metrics. We also investigate scalability by analyzing how the network size and connectivity affect performance using Watts-Strogatz random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves higher minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair rate, Jain index, and computational resources are considered. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of the source node placement on the performance.

Title: Complex-valued 3D atomic spectroscopy with Gaussian-assisted inline holography
Authors: Xing Huang, Yuzhuo Wang, Jian Zhao, Saijun Wu
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we develop a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase-shift profiles of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. The samples' axial positions are resolved with micrometer resolution, and their spectroscopy are extracted from complex-valued images recorded at various probe frequencies. The phase-angle readout is not only robust against transition saturation, but also insensitive to atom-number and optical-pumping-induced interaction-strength fluctuations. Benefiting from such features, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot resolution to the transition frequency of a $^{87}$Rb D2 line, with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate single-shot 3D field sensing by measuring local light shifts to the atomic array with micrometer spatial resolution.

Title: Probing de Sitter Space Using CFT States
Authors: Kazuki Doi, Naoki Ogawa, Kotaro Shinmyo, Yu-ki Suzuki, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states describing a putative holographic dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of a time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.

Title: SIC-POVMs and orders of real quadratic fields
Authors: Gene S. Kopp, Jeffrey C. Lagarias
Abstract: This paper concerns SIC-POVMs and their relationship to class field theory. SIC-POVMs are generalized quantum measurements (POVMs) described by $d^2$ equiangular complex lines through the origin in $\mathbb{C}^d$. Weyl--Heisenberg SICs are those SIC-POVMs described by the orbit a single vector under a finite Weyl--Heisenberg group ${\rm WH}(d)$. We relate known data on the structure and classification of Weyl--Heisenberg SICs in low dimensions to arithmetic data attached to certain orders of real quadratic fields. For $4 \le d \le 90$, we show the number of known geometric equivalence classes of Weyl--Heisenberg SICs in dimension $d$ equals the cardinality of the ideal class monoid of the real quadratic order $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ of discriminant $\Delta=(d+1)(d-3)$; we conjecture the equality extends to all $d \ge 4$. We prove that this conjecture implies the existence of more than one geometric equivalence class of Weyl--Heisenberg SICs for $d > 22$. We conjecture Galois multiplets of SICs are in one-to-one correspondence with the over-orders $\mathcal{O}'$ of $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ in such a way that the number of classes in the multiplet equals the ring class number of $\mathcal{O}'$. We test that conjecture against known data on exact SICs in low dimensions. We refine the class field hypothesis of Appleby, Flammia, McConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{(d+1)(d-3)})$ generated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a Weyl--Heisenberg SIC. The refined conjectures use a recently developed class field theory for orders of number fields (arXiv:2212.09177). The refined class fields assigned to over-orders $\mathcal{O}'$ have a natural partial order under inclusion; the inclusions of these fields fail to be strict in some cases. We characterize such cases and give a table of them for $d < 500$.

Title: Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space
Authors: Rivo Herivola Manjakamanana Ravelonjato, Ravo Tokiniaina Ranaivoson, Raoelina Andriambololona, Roland Raboanary, Naivo Rabesiranana, Solofoarisina Wilfrid Chrysante
Abstract: In this work, it is shown that improvements can be introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas to take into account the quantum nature of phase space, which is related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particle number, the internal energy, the Von Neumann entropy, and the pressure, as well as the thermodynamic state equations corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperatures and for confined volumes. They allow for the highlighting of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamic functions and variables are directly related to the quantum statistical variances of the momenta. Well-known relations corresponding to the classical ideal gas model can be recovered from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperatures and for large volumes.

Title: Emerging Quadrature Lattices of Kerr Combs
Authors: Eran Lustig, Melissa A. Guidry, Daniil M. Lukin, Shanhui Fan, Jelena Vuckovic
Abstract: A quadrature lattice is a coupled array of squeezed vacuum field quadratures that offers new avenues in shaping the quantum properties of multimode light [1-3]. Such lattices are described within the framework of non-Hermitian, non-dissipative physics and exhibit intriguing lattice phenomena such as lattice exceptional points, edge-states, entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect, offering fundamentally new methods for controlling quantum fluctuations [1, 4]. Nonlinear resonators are suitable for studying multimode pair-generation processes and squeezing which are non-dissipative in \chi(2) and \chi(3) materials [5-12], but observing non-Hermitian lattice phenomena in photonic quadrature lattices was not achieved. Remarkably, in dissipative Kerr microcombs [13], which have revolutionized photonic technology, such lattices emerge and govern the quantum noise that leads to comb formation. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to realize quadrature lattices, and to study and manipulate multimode quantum noise which is essential for any quantum technology. Here, we experimentally study non-Hermitian lattice effects in photonic quadrature lattices for the first time. Our photonic quadrature lattices emerge at Kerr microcomb transitions, allowing us to observe fundamental connections between dispersion symmetry, frequency-dependent squeezed supermodes, and non-Hermitian lattice physics in an integrated setup. Our work unifies two major fields, quantum non-Hermitian physics and Kerr combs, and opens the door to utilizing dissipative Kerr combs to experimentally explore rich non-Hermitian physics in the quantum regime, engineer quantum light, and develop new tools to study the quantum noise and formation of Kerr combs.

Title: Internal diffraction dynamics of trilobite molecules
Authors: Rohan Srikumar, Seth T. Rittenhouse, Peter Schmelcher
Abstract: Trilobite molecules are ultralong-range Rydberg molecules formed when a high angular momentum Rydberg electron scatters off of a ground-state atom. Their unique electronic structure and highly oscillatory potential energy curves support a rich variety of dynamical effects yet to be explored. We analyze the vibrational motion of these molecules using a framework of adiabatic wavepacket propagation dynamics and observe that for appropriate initial states, the trilobite potential acts as molecular diffraction grating. The quantum dynamic effects observed are explained using a Fourier analysis of the scattering potential and the associated scattered wavepacket. Furthermore, vibrational ground-states of the low angular momentum ultralong-range Rydberg molecules are found to be particularly suitable to prepare the relevant wavepackets. Hence, we propose a time resolved pump-probe scheme designed for the realization of the effect in question, and advertise the utilization of a single diatomic Rydberg molecule as a testbed for the study of exaggerated quantum dynamical phenomena.

Title: Entanglement dynamics in 2d HCFTs on the curved background: the case of q-M\"obius Hamiltonian
Authors: Chen Bai, Akihiro Miyata, Masahiro Nozaki
Abstract: We will explore the dynamical property of non-equilibrium phenomena induced by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theory (2d holographic CFT) Hamiltonian on the curved spacetime by studying the time dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information. Here, holographic CFT is the CFT having the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double states, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved background, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We found that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the curved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear. Furthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this entanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the one for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world brane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be regarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also discussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line tension picture.

Title: Potential Enabling Technologies for 7G Networks: Survey
Authors: Savo Glisic
Abstract: Every new generation of mobile networks brings significant advances in two segments, enhancement of the network parameters within the legacy technologies and introduction of new technologies enabling new paradigms in designing the networks. In the first class of enhancements the effort is to increase data rates, improve energy efficiency, enhance connectivity, reduce data transmission latency etc. In the second class of innovations for 6G and 7G, we anticipate focus on optimum integration of advanced ML and AI in general, and quantum computing with the continuous interest in the satellite networks for optimal quantum key distribution . By introducing quantum technology 7G will be able to speed up computing processes in the net, enhance network security as well as to enable distributed QC, which is a new paradigm in computer sciences. Using advanced networks as a basic ingredient of inter system integration, here we focus only on the second segment of anticipated innovations in networking and present a survey of the subset of potential technology enablers for the above concept with special emphasis on the inter dependency of the solutions chosen in different segments of the network. In Section II, we present several anticipated 6G/7G (system of systems type) network optimization examples resulting in a new paradigm of network optimization indicating a need for quantum computing and quantum computing based optimization algorithms. In Section III we survey work on quantum cryptography and QKD.

Title: Gravity from entropy
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime {to a quantum operator, playing the role of an renormalizable effective density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-Kähler formalism, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the {\em G-field}, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remain second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.

Title: Hybrid-Order Topological Phase And Transition in 1H Transition Metal Compounds
Authors: Ning-Jing Yang, Zhigao Huang, Jian-Min Zhang
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of hybrid topological states [Hossain et al. Nature 628, 527 (2024)], we predict hybrid-order topological insulators in 1H transition metal compounds (TMCs), where both second-order and first-order topological (FOT) states coexist near the Fermi level. Initially, 1H-TMCs exhibit a second-order topological phase due to the d orbital bandgap. Upon coupling of p and d orbitals through the crystal field effect, first-order topological characteristics emerge. This hybrid-order topological phase transition can be tuned via crystal field effects. Combined with first-principles calculations, we illustrate the phase transition with WTe2 and NbSe2. The WTe2 exhibits hybrid-order under ambient conditions, while NbSe2 transitions to hybrid-order under pressure. Additionally, the first-order topological bandgap in the HyOTI demonstrates a strong spin Hall effect. Our findings reveal a hybrid-order topological phase in two-dimensional electron materials and underscore spintronic applications.

Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.

Title: QUBO Formulations for Variation of Domination Problem
Authors: Haoqian Pan, Changhong Lu
Abstract: With the development of quantum computing, the use of quantum algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers has become a major research focus. The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model serves as a bridge between combinatorial optimization problems and quantum computers, and is a prerequisite for these studies. In combinatorial optimization problems, the Domination Problem (DP) is related to many practical issues in the real world, such as the fire station problem, social network theory, and so on. Additionally, the DP has numerous variants, such as independent DP, total DP, k-domination, and so forth. However, there is a scarcity of quantum computing research on these variant problems. A possible reason for this is the lack of research on QUBO modeling for these issues. This paper investigates the QUBO modeling methods for the classic DP and its variants. Compared to previous studies, the QUBO modeling method we propose for the classic DP can utilize fewer qubits. This will lower the barrier for solving DP on quantum computers. At the same time, for many variants of DP problems, we provide their QUBO modeling methods for the first time. Our work will accelerate the entry of DP into the quantum era.

Title: Quantum gravity corrections to the spontaneous excitation of an accelerated atom interacting with a quantum scalar field
Authors: Zhi Wang
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) extends the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) by suggesting a minimum observable scale that includes the effects of quantum gravity, which is supposed to potentially result in observable effects far below the Planck energy scale, providing us the opportunity to explore the theory of quantum gravity through physical processes at low energy scale. In present work, we study the corrections induced by the GUP to the spontaneous radiation properties of a two-level atom interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field based on the DDC formalism. The GUP alters the correlation function of the scalar field, consequently affecting the radiative properties of atoms. We compute the rate of change in the mean atomic energy for an atom undergoing inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and uniform circular motion. We show that the GUP can enhance the spontaneous emission rate of an excited state atom in inertial motion; however, it does not alter the stability of the ground-state atom in vacuum. For an atom in uniformly accelerated and uniformly circular motion, the GUP can change both its spontaneous emission and spontaneous excitation rates, and the proper acceleration $a$ can significantly amplify the effect of the GUP on the spontaneous transition rates of the atom.

Title: Boundaries, frames and the issue of physical covariance
Authors: Henrique Gomes, Simon Langenscheidt, Daniele Oriti
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general focus, as well as broader conceptual implications. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modelling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. These two goals combine to identify a key open issue: a proper characterization of physical covariance, i.e. covariance across fully physical (as opposed to idealized) reference frames. The broader conceptual implications concern the influence of observers in physics and possible physical limits to objectivity.

Title: High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces
Authors: Shihao Shao, Yikang Li, Zhouchen Lin, Qinghua Cui
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, we recently achieve an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ \citep{bonvicini2024irreducible} with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set \citep{pearce2023brauer}, through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available in this https URL where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively.

Title: The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities
Authors: Naoto Shiraishi, Hal Tasaki
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.

Title: Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect
Authors: Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Ashley M. Cook
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.

Title: Signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model
Authors: Reyhan Ay, Adipta Pal, Ashley M. Cook
Abstract: Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.
