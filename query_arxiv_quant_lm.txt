Title: Spin coherence scale: operator-ordering sensitivity beyond Heisenberg-Weyl
Authors: Aaron Z. Goldberg, Anaelle Hertz
Abstract: We introduce the spin coherence scale as a measure of quantum coherence for spin systems, generalizing the quadrature coherence scale (QCS) previously defined for quadrature observables. This SU($2$)-invariant measure quantifies the off-diagonal coherences of a quantum state in angular momentum bases, weighted by the classical distinguishability of the superposed states. It serves as a witness of nonclassicality and provides both upper and lower bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the set of classical (spin coherent) states. We demonstrate that many hallmark properties of the QCS carry over to the spin setting, including its links to noise susceptibility of a state and moments of quasiprobability distributions. The spin coherence scale has direct implications for quantum metrology in the guise of rotation sensing. We also generalize the framework to SU($n$) systems, identifying the unique SU($n$)-invariant depolarization channel and outlining a broad, Lie-algebraic approach to defining and characterizing the properties of coherence scale beyond harmonic oscillators.

Title: Vari-Cool: a non-unitary quantum variational protocol for simulated cooling
Authors: Jeffrey Z. Song, Gilad Kishony, Erez Berg, Mark S. Rudner
Abstract: We introduce a variational approach for preparing low energy states of arbitrary target Hamiltonians. The protocol is defined in terms of a repeated cycle consisting of p layers of unitary gates applied to the system and ancilla "bath" qubits, followed by reset of the bath qubits. The gate parameters within each cycle are optimized such that the steady state achieved after many cycles has a low energy expectation value with respect to the target Hamiltonian, and that the energy converges toward the steady state value in as few cycles as possible. We illustrate the protocol for the transverse field Ising model, and study its systematic behaviors with respect to system size, model parameters, and noise using tensor network based classical simulations. We then experimentally demonstrate its operation on IBM's ibm_kingston quantum processor for up to 28 system qubits coupled to 14 bath sites. Classical training on small system sizes and with few unitary layers per cycle gives robust results that transfer well to larger system sizes and to noisy hardware.

Title: Bounds in the Projective Unitary Group with Respect to Global Phase Invariant Metric
Authors: Bhanu Pratap Yadav, Mahdi Bayanifar, Olav Tirkkonen
Abstract: We consider a global phase-invariant metric in the projective unitary group PUn, relevant for universal quantum computing. We obtain the volume and measure of small metric ball in PUn and derive the Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds in PUn. In addition, we provide upper and lower bounds for the kissing radius of the codebooks in PUn as a function of the minimum distance. Using the lower bound of the kissing radius, we find a tight Hamming bound. Also, we establish bounds on the distortion-rate function for quantizing a source uniformly distributed over PUn. As example codebooks in PUn, we consider the projective Pauli and Clifford groups, as well as the projective group of diagonal gates in the Clifford hierarchy, and find their minimum distances. For any code in PUn with given cardinality we provide a lower bound of covering radius. Also, we provide expected value of the covering radius of randomly distributed points on PUn, when cardinality of code is sufficiently large. We discuss codebooks at various stages of the projective Clifford + T and projective Clifford + S constructions in PU2, and obtain their minimum distance, distortion, and covering radius. Finally, we verify the analytical results by simulation.

Title: Efficient Emulation of Neutral Atom Quantum Hardware
Authors: Kemal Bidzhiev, Stefano Grava, Pablo le Henaff, Mauro Mendizabal, Elie Merhej, Anton Quelle
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of neutral atom arrays is a challenging problem. To address this, we introduce two emulators, emu-sv and emu-mps, as computational backends for Pasqal's pulser package. Emu-sv is designed for high-precision state-vector simulations, giving the possibility to emulate systems of up to $\thicksim 27$ qubits on an A100 40GB GPU, making it perfect for cases where numerically exact results are needed. In contrast, emu-mps uses a Matrix Product State representation and other controlled approximations to efficiently simulate much larger arrays of atoms with manageable errors. We show through benchmark comparisons that both emulators provide significant speed-ups over generic solvers such as QuTiP. In addition, we provide practical guidance on choosing between the two emulators. These quantum software tools are designed to support researchers and developers aiming to simulate quantum systems either as a precursor to full hardware implementation or as a means of benchmarking hardware performance.

Title: Quantum Circuit for Quantum Fourier Transform for Arbitrary Qubit Connectivity Graphs
Authors: Kamil Khadiev, Aliya Khadieva, Vadim Sagitov, Kamil Khasanov
Abstract: In the paper, we consider quantum circuits for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) algorithm. The QFT algorithm is a very popular technique used in many quantum algorithms. We present a generic method for constructing quantum circuits for this algorithm implementing on quantum devices with restrictions. Many quantum devices (for example, based on superconductors) have restrictions on applying two-qubit gates. These restrictions are presented by a qubit connectivity graph. Typically, researchers consider only the linear nearest neighbor (LNN) architecture of the qubit connection, but current devices have more complex graphs. We present a method for arbitrary connected graphs that minimizes the number of CNOT gates in the circuit for implementing on such architecture. We compare quantum circuits built by our algorithm with existing quantum circuits optimized for specific graphs that are Linear-nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, ``sun'' (a cycle with tails, presented by the 16-qubit IBMQ device) and ``two joint suns'' (two joint cycles with tails, presented by the 27-qubit IBMQ device). Our generic method gives similar results with existing optimized circuits for ``sun'' and ``two joint suns'' architectures, and a circuit with slightly more CNOT gates for the LNN architecture. At the same time, our method allows us to construct a circuit for arbitrary connected graphs.

Title: Quantum Action-Dependent Channels
Authors: Michael Korenberg, Uzi Pereg
Abstract: We study the quantum action-dependent channel. The model can be viewed as a quantum analog of the classical action-dependent channel model. In this setting, the communication channel has two inputs: Alice's transmission and the input environment. The action-dependent mechanism enables the transmitter to influence the channel's environment through an action channel. Specifically, Alice encodes her message into a quantum action, which subsequently affects the environment state. For example, a quantum measurement at the encoder can induce a state collapse of the environment. In addition, Alice has access to side information. Unlike the classical model, she cannot have a copy of the environment state due to the no-cloning theorem. Instead, she shares entanglement with this environment. We establish an achievable communication rate for reliable message transmission via the quantum action-dependent channel, thereby extending the classical action-dependent framework to the quantum domain.

Title: Quantum Algorithms for the Minimum Steiner Tree problem with application to Binary Near-Perfect Phylogenies
Authors: Lingfa Meng, David Salvador Novo, Albert H. Werner, Samir Bhatt
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm in bioinformatics for solving the Binary Near-Perfect Phylogeny Problem (BNPP) with a complexity bound of $O(8.926^q + 8^q nm2)$, where n is the number of input taxa and m is the sequence length for each taxon with each character in the sequence being a binary bit using the QRAM model. We give another polynomial space exact algorithm for the Minimum Steiner Tree (MST) problem with complexity $O^*(e^{(1+g(k,l))k})$ in the circuit model.

Title: How much can we learn from quantum random circuit sampling?
Authors: Tudor Manole, Daniel K. Mark, Wenjie Gong, Bingtian Ye, Yury Polyanskiy, Soonwon Choi
Abstract: Benchmarking quantum devices is a foundational task for the sustained development of quantum technologies. However, accurate in situ characterization of large-scale quantum devices remains a formidable challenge: such systems experience many different sources of errors, and cannot be simulated on classical computers. Here, we introduce new benchmarking methods based on random circuit sampling (RCS), that substantially extend the scope of conventional approaches. Unlike existing benchmarks that report only a single quantity--the circuit fidelity--our framework extracts rich diagnostic information, including spatiotemporal error profiles, correlated and contextual errors, and biased readout errors, without requiring any modifications of the experiment. Furthermore, we develop techniques that achieve this task without classically intractable simulations of the quantum circuit, by leveraging side information, in the form of bitstring samples obtained from reference quantum devices. Our approach is based on advanced high-dimensional statistical modeling of RCS data. We sharply characterize the information-theoretic limits of error estimation, deriving matching upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity across all regimes of side information. We identify surprising phase transitions in learnability as the amount of side information varies. We demonstrate our methods using publicly available RCS data from a state-of-the-art superconducting processor, obtaining in situ characterizations that are qualitatively consistent yet quantitatively distinct from component-level calibrations. Our results establish both practical benchmarking protocols for current and future quantum computers and fundamental information-theoretic limits on how much can be learned from RCS data.

Title: Bounds on Eventually Universal Quantum Gate Sets
Authors: Chaitanya Karamchedu, Matthew Fox, Daniel Gottesman
Abstract: Say a collection of $n$-qu$d$it gates $\Gamma$ is eventually universal if and only if there exists $N_0 \geq n$ such that for all $N \geq N_0$, one can approximate any $N$-qu$d$it unitary to arbitrary precision by a circuit over $\Gamma$. In this work, we improve the best known upper bound on the smallest $N_0$ with the above property. Our new bound is roughly $d^4n$, where $d$ is the local dimension (the `$d$' in qu$d$it), whereas the previous bound was roughly $d^8n$. For qubits ($d = 2$), our result implies that if an $n$-qubit gate set is eventually universal, then it will exhibit universality when acting on a $16n$ qubit system, as opposed to the previous bound of a $256n$ qubit system. In other words, if adding just $15n$ ancillary qubits to a quantum system (as opposed to the previous bound of $255 n$ ancillary qubits) does not boost a gate set to universality, then no number of ancillary qubits ever will. Our proof relies on the invariants of finite linear groups as well as a classification result for all finite groups that are unitary $2$-designs.

Title: Observational entropy of quantum correlations and entanglement
Authors: Leonardo Rossetti, Stefano Mancini, Andreas Winter, Joseph Schindler
Abstract: The use of coarse graining to connect physical and information theoretic entropies has recently been given a precise formulation in terms of ``observational entropy'', describing entropy for observers with respect to a measurement. Here we consider observers with various locality restrictions, including local measurements (LO), measurements based on local operations with classical communication (LOCC), and separable measurements (SEP), with the idea that the ``entropy gap'' between the minimum locally measured observational entropy and the von Neumann entropy quantifies quantum correlations in a given state. After introducing entropy gaps for general classes of measurements and deriving their general properties, we specialize to LO, LOCC, SEP and other measurement classes related to the locality of subsystems. For those, we show that the entropy gap can be related to well-known measures of entanglement or non-classicality of the state (even though we point out that they are not entanglement monotones themselves). In particular, for bipartite pure states, all of the ``local'' entropy gaps reproduce the entanglement entropy, and for general multipartite states they are lower-bounded by the relative entropy of entanglement. The entropy gaps of the different measurement classes are ordered, and we show that in general (mixed and multipartite states) they are all different.

Title: Broad nonlocal spectrum in the Pb-InSb hybrid three terminals for potential realization of Kitaev chains
Authors: Guoan Li, Xiaofan Shi, Ruixuan Zhang, Yuxiao Song, Marco Rossi, Ghada Badawy, Zhiyuan Zhang, Anqi Wang, Xingchen Guo, Xiao Deng, Xiao Chen, Liangqian Xu, Bingbing Tong, Peiling Li, Xiaohui Song, Zhaozheng Lyu, Guangtong Liu, Fanming Qu, Michał P. Nowak, Paweł Wójcik, Ziwei Dou, Erik P. A. M. Bakkers, Li Lu, Jie Shen
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor(SC-SM) nanowires remain one of the foremost platforms for engineering topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes(MZMs) towards fault-tolerant topological qubits, especially with the rapid development of artificial Kitaev chains. In contrast to the widely used aluminum(Al)-based hybrids, lead(Pb) offers a bulk superconducting gap of ~1.4meV and a critical temperature of ~7.2K, giving rise to a proximity-induced gap that is roughly five times larger than that obtained with Al. Here we present the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal measurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and the large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a switch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the induced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo singlet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve gate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance, identifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations of quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and can be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the feasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust nonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating temperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap, thereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the suitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial Kitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially larger topological gap.

Title: Spin exchange of two spin-1/2 atoms
Authors: Pan Zeming, Tan Naiming, Gao Chao, Yao Zhihai, Wang Xiaoqian
Abstract: The quantum Cheshire cat effect is an important phenomenon in quantum mechanics that reveals the separability of physical properties from their carriers. This effect transcends the classical framework whose attributes must be inherently attached to objects, providing new perspectives for quantum information and precision measurement. According to the quantum Cheshire cat effect, we prepare a pre-selected state of a spin1/2 atomic system composed of two particles through a pre-selection process. We conduct quantum weak measurements on the spins and positions of these two atoms and extract weak values by using the method of imaginary time evolution(ITE). Subsequently, we perform post-selection on these two atoms and design two distinct post-selected states. Initially, we calculate analytical solutions when both atoms encounter these two different post-selected states separately. We also compare the analytical and numerical solutions. Our research theoretically confirms the feasibility of fermionic systems within bipartite quantum Cheshire cat effects and illustrates how delayed-choice influences quantum Cheshire cat effects in spin-1/2 atomic systems.

Title: On the Noisy Road to Open Quantum Dynamics: The Place of Stochastic Hamiltonians
Authors: Pietro De Checchi, Federico Gallina, Barbara Fresch, Giulio G. Giusteri
Abstract: Stochastic evolution underpins several approaches to the dynamics of open quantum systems, such as random modulation of Hamiltonian parameters, the stochastic Schrödinger equation (SSE), and the stochastic Liouville equation (SLE). In a stochastic formulation, the open-system problem is reduced from a coupled system-environment dynamics to an effective system-only description, with dissipative evolution recovered by ensemble averaging. In this work, we aim at a self-contained and accessible presentation of these approaches to further elaborate on their common roots in essential concepts of stochastic calculus and to delineate the conditions under which they are equivalent. We also discuss how different formulations naturally lead to different numerical time-integration schemes, better suited for either classical simulation platforms, based on finite-difference approximations, or quantum algorithms, that employ random unitary maps. Our analysis supplies a unified perspective and actionable recipes for classical and quantum implementations of stochastic evolution in the simulation of open quantum systems.

Title: Features of preparable entangled states in Gaussian quantum networks
Authors: Shuanping Du, Zhaofang Bai
Abstract: Large-scale quantum networks have been employed to overcome practical constraints on transmission and storage for single entangled systems. The deterministic preparation of entangled states is one of the key factors for realization of quantum networks. There is no efficient method to verify whether single multipartite entanglement can be prepared by multisource quantum networks. Here, we theoretically analysize under what conditions entangled states can be prepared in three kinds of basic Gaussian quantum networks, named triangle networks, star-shaped networks and chain-type networks. Some necessity criteria are derived for all preparable entangled Gaussian states in such networks. It shows that the network structure imposes strong constraints on the set of preparable entangled Gaussian states, which is fundamentally different with the standard single multipartite entanglement. This takes the first step towards understanding network mechanism for preparing entangled Gaussian states.

Title: Universal Manipulation of Quantum Synchronization in Spin Oscillator Networks
Authors: Shuo Dai, Zeqing Wang, Liang-Liang Wan, Weidong Li, Augusto Smerzi, Ran Qi, Jianwen Jie
Abstract: Quantum synchronization (QS) in open many-body systems offers a promising route for controlling collective quantum dynamics, yet existing manipulation schemes often rely on dissipation engineering, which distorts limit cycles, lacks scalability, and is strongly system-dependent. Here, we propose a universal and scalable method for continuously tuning QS from maximal synchronization under isotropic interactions to complete synchronization blockade (QSB) under fully anisotropic coupling in spin oscillator networks. Our approach preserves intrinsic limit cycles and applies to both few-body and macroscopic systems. We analytically show that QS arises solely from spin flip-flop processes and their higher-order correlations, while anisotropic interactions induce non-synchronizing coherence. A geometric QS measure reveals a macroscopic QSB effect in the thermodynamic limit. The proposed mechanism is experimentally feasible using XYZ interactions and optical pumping, and provides a general framework for programmable synchronization control in complex quantum networks and dynamical phases of matter.

Title: On the validity of intermediate tracing in multiple quantum interactions
Authors: Reuven Ianconescu, Bin Zhang, Aharon Friedman, Jacob Scheuer, Avraham Gover
Abstract: Interactions between many (initially separate) quantum systems raise the question on how to prepare and how to compute the measurable results of their interaction. When one prepares each system individually and let them interact, one has to tensor multiply their density matrices and apply Hamiltonians on the composite system (i.e. the system which includes all the interacting systems) for definite time intervals. Evaluating the final state of one of the systems after multiple consecutive interactions, requires tracing all other systems out of the composite system, which may grow up to immense dimensions. For computation efficiency during the interaction(s) one may consider only the contemporary interacting partial systems, while tracing out the other non interacting systems. In concrete terms, the type of problems to which we direct this formulation is a ``target'' system interacting {\bf succesively} with ``incident'' systems, where the ``incident'' systems do not mutually interact. For example a two-level atom, interacting succesively with free electrons, or a resonant cavity interacting with radiatively free electrons, or a quantum dot interacting succesively with photons. We refer to a ``system'' as one of the components before interaction, while each interaction creates a ``composite system''. A new interaction of the ``composite system'' with another ``system'' creates a ``larger composite system'', unless we trace out one of the systems before this interaction. The scope of this work is to show that under proper conditions one may add a system to the composite system just before it interacts, and one may trace out this very system after it finishes to interact. We show in this work a mathematical proof of the above property and give a computational example.

Title: Fractional Aharonov-Bohm effect for retarded potentials
Authors: J. D. Franson
Abstract: It has been suggested that the magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted equally well as being due to a phase shift associated with an electron in an interferometer enclosing a magnetic flux, or as a phase shift associated with the electrons in the solenoid that generates the field. Here the Aharonov-Bohm effect is derived using second-quantized field theory to describe all the electrons as well as the electromagnetic field in a consistent way. The results are in agreement with the usual expression for the Aharonov-Bohm effect when the retardation of the electromagnetic field is negligible, but they predict the possibility of a fractional phase shift when retardation effects are significant.

Title: Monogamy of Gaussian quantum steering and entanglement in a hybrid qubit-cavity optomagnonic system with coherent feedback loop
Authors: Hamza Harraf, Mohamed Amazioug, Amjad Sohail, Rachid Ahl Laamara
Abstract: The monogamy of quantum correlations is a fundamental principle in quantum information processing, limiting how quantum correlations can be shared among multiple subsystems. Here we propose a theoretical scheme to investigate the monogamy of quantum steering and genuine tripartite entanglement in a hybrid qubit-cavity optomagnonic system with a coherent feedback loop. Using logarithmic negativity and Gaussian quantum steering, we quantify entanglement and steerability, respectively. We verify the CKW-type monogamy inequalities which leads to steering monogamous through adjustments of the reflective parameter among three tripartite modes versus temperature. Our results show that a coherent feedback loop can enhance entanglement and quantum steering under thermal effects.

Title: Depth One Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz as an Approximate Gibbs Distribution Sampler
Authors: Elijah Pelofske
Abstract: This study numerically investigates the thermal sampling properties of QAOA, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz which was generalized from the original Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Specifically, the ability of QAOA to sample from the Gibbs distribution, equivalently the Boltzmann distribution, defined by a classical Ising model, specifically a fully connected disordered spin glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) model. We focus on two different QAOA mixers; the standard transverse field X mixer, and the Grover mixer. At a QAOA depth of one we examine, for a single full QAOA parameter search space period, the energy landscape, the Shannon entropy landscape of the QAOA probability distribution, and the tradeoff between Boltzmann distribution sampling temperature and error rate (how close to the true Boltzmann distribution is the QAOA distribution). We find that at very high temperatures one-round Grover mixer QAOA can sample from the Boltzmann distribution more accurately than the standard X mixer QAOA at one round. Both X mixer and Grover mixer depth one QAOA can serve as approximate Boltzmann distribution samplers, and how good this approximation is depends heavily on the QAOA angle choice.

Title: Electron Lateral Trapping Induced by Non-Uniform Thickness in Solid Neon Layers
Authors: Toshiaki Kanai, Chuanwei Zhang
Abstract: Recent experimental advances highlight electron charge qubits floating above solid neon as an emerging promising platform for quantum computing, but the physical origin of single-electron lateral trapping is still not fully understood. While prior theoretical work has mainly examined electrons above bulk solid neon, experimental systems usually feature neon layers of only $\lesssim 10$ nm thickness and non-uniformity, highlighting unresolved questions about how thickness influences electron trapping. Here we theoretically investigate the effect of finite thickness and non-uniformity of solid neon layers on electron trapping. For a 10 nm layer, the electron binding energy is enhanced threefold compared to bulk. Exploiting this thickness dependence, we propose a nanopatterned-substrate mechanism in which engineered thickness variations generate lateral trapping potentials for electrons. The lateral trapping potential can be finely tuned by a perpendicular electric field. Such non-uniform-thickness induced electron charge qubits open a viable pathway toward building multi-qubit systems for quantum computation.

Title: Spectrally controlled dissipation in a target subsystem
Authors: Man Yin Cheung, Mona Berciu, Kyle Monkman
Abstract: We present a microscopic Hamiltonian time-evolution on an ancilla+target system that evolves the target to a steady state. Using this description, we demonstrate the potential of a spectrally controllable dissipator: Depending on the energy scale of the target, the subsystem reaches the intended steady state or remains partially trapped in the initial state. For a steady state which is pure, this protocol can function as an autonomous qubit reset. We can also choose a mixed steady state so that this functions as a tunable mixed-state preparation. With a particular dissipative condition, we guarantee the equilibration to the steady-state with spectral measure theory. This type of spectral control over dissipation is not present in the common Lindblad description of open systems. Our construction establishes a new design principle for engineered dissipation and opens a pathway toward tunable autonomous quantum control.

Title: Oscillator-qubit generalized quantum signal processing for vibronic models: a case study of uracil cation
Authors: Jungsoo Hong, Seong Ho Kim, Seung Kyu Min, Joonsuk Huh
Abstract: Hybrid oscillator-qubit processors have recently demonstrated high-fidelity control of both continuous- and discrete-variable information processing. However, most of the quantum algorithms remain limited to homogeneous quantum architectures. Here, we present a compiler for hybrid oscillator-qubit processors, implementing state preparation and time evolution. In hybrid oscillator-qubit processors, this compiler invokes generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP) to constructively synthesize arbitrary bosonic phase gates with moderate circuit depth O(log(1/{\varepsilon})). The approximation cost is scaled by the Fourier bandwidth of the target bosonic phase, rather than by the degree of nonlinearity. Armed with GQSP, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics can be decomposed with arbitrary-phase potential propagators. Compared to fully discrete encodings, our approach avoids the overhead of truncating continuous variables, showing linear dependence on the number of vibration modes while trading success probability for circuit depth. We validate our method on the uracil cation, a canonical system whose accurate modeling requires anharmonic vibronic models, estimating the cost for state preparation and time evolution.

Title: Quantum Integration Networks for Efficient Monte Carlo in High-Energy Physics
Authors: Heechan Yi, Kayoung Ban, Myeonghun Park, Kyoungchul Kong
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods play a central role in particle physics, where they are indispensable for simulating scattering processes, modeling detector responses, and performing multi-dimensional integrals. However, traditional Monte Carlo methods often suffer from slow convergence and insufficient precision, particularly for functions with singular features such as rapidly varying regions or narrow peaks. Quantum circuits provide a promising alternative: compared to conventional neural networks, they can achieve rich expressivity with fewer parameters, and the parameter-shift rule provides an exact analytic form for circuit gradients, ensuring precise optimization. Motivated by these advantages, we investigate how sampling strategies and loss functions affect integration efficiency within the \textbf{Quantum Integration Network} (QuInt-Net). We compare adaptive and non-adaptive sampling approaches and examine the impact of different loss functions on accuracy and convergence. Furthermore, we explore three quantum circuit architectures for numerical integration: the data re-uploading model, the quantum signal processing protocol, and deterministic quantum computation with one qubit. The results provide new insights into optimizing QuInt-Nets for applications in high energy physics.

Title: Gravitational and other shifts of neutron, hydrogen, antihydrogen, muonium, and positronium whispering gallery and gravitational state interference patterns
Authors: V.V. Nesvizhevsky, J.A. Pioquinto, K. Schreiner, S. Baessler, P. Crivelli, E. Widmann
Abstract: Recently, a shift of a neutron whispering-gallery interference pattern due to an external magnetic field gradient was measured. By analogy, a similar phenomenon can be observed with other particles and forces. In particular, a gravitational shift of the neutron whispering gallery can be easily observed with cold or very cold or ultracold neutrons, and the developed methods can be used for observing/searching for other shifts in fundamental neutron physics experiments, for instance, for measuring the gravitational constant or constraining the neutron electric charge. A peculiar feature of analogous atomic (anti-atomic) experiments is the much smaller effective critical energies of the materials of atomic (anti-atomic) mirrors. We evaluated parameters that make a measurement of the hydrogen and antihydrogen whispering gallery and their gravitational shifts feasible. A series of such measurements will be made with neutrons at the PF1B/PF2/D17 facilities at the ILL, as well as with hydrogen or/and deuterium atoms by the GRASIAN collaboration in Vienna and Turku. Such a measurement with antihydrogen atoms may be of interest for the GBAR experiment, the ASACUSA experiment which is producing a beam of slow antihydrogen atoms, or other experiments at CERN, which study the gravitational properties of antimatter. Quantum reflection of muonium and positronium from material surfaces opens the possibility of observing whispering-galley states, although such measurements remain experimentally challenging. The observation of gravitational shifts is particularly demanding because of the extremely short lifetimes of these systems. Measurements of whispering gallery with all these atoms and particles yield unique information on the quantum reflection properties at surfaces, providing valuable input for both fundamental and surface studies.

Title: One-Query Quantum Algorithms for the Index-$q$ Hidden Subgroup Problem
Authors: Amit Te'eni, Yaron Oz, Eliahu Cohen
Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is central to many quantum algorithms, yet its necessity is not always well understood. We re-examine its role in canonical query problems. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm requires neither a QFT nor a domain group structure. In contrast, the Bernstein-Vazirani problem is an instance of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP), where the hidden subgroup has either index $1$ or $2$; and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exploits this promise to solve the problem with a single query. Motivated by these insights, we introduce the index-$q$ HSP: determine whether a hidden subgroup $H \le G$ has index $1$ or $q$, and, when possible, identify $H$. We present a single-query algorithm that always distinguishes index $1$ from $q$, for any choice of abelian structure on the oracle's codomain. Moreover, with suitable pre- and post-oracle unitaries (inverse-QFT/QFT over $G$), the same query exactly identifies $H$ under explicit minimal conditions: $G/H$ is cyclic of order $q$, and the output alphabet admits a faithful, compatible group structure. These conditions hold automatically for $q \in \left\{ 2,3 \right\}$, giving unconditional single-query identification in these cases. In contrast, the Shor-Kitaev sampling approach cannot guarantee exact recovery from a single sample. Our results sharpen the landscape of one-query quantum solvability for abelian HSPs.

Title: Beating the standard quantum limit with single-photon-added coherent states
Authors: Pankaj K. Jha, Lakshya Nagpal, Amir Targholizadeh, Utkarsh Mishra, Konstantin E. Dorfman
Abstract: The standard quantum limit (SQL), also known as the shot-noise limit, defines how quantum fluctuations of light constrain measurement precision. In a benchmark experiment using the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), where a coherent state with the average photon number $\langle n\rangle$ is combined with an ordinary vacuum input, the SQL for the phase uncertainty is given by the well-known relation $\Delta\varphi_{\text{SQL}} = 1/\langle n\rangle$. Using a single photon-added coherent state and a weak coherent state as inputs, we report an enhanced phase sensitivity in MZI surpassing the SQL. In stark contrast to other approaches, we focus on the low-photon-number regime, $\langle n\rangle < 10$, and demonstrate that our scheme offers better phase sensitivity compared to the SQL. Beating the SQL at low photon numbers paves the way for the new generation of devices employed in \textquotedblleft photon-starved\textquotedblright quantum sensing, spectroscopy, and metrology.

Title: Uniformity Bias in Ground-State Sampling Induced by Replica Alignment in Quantum Monte Carlo for Quantum Annealing
Authors: Naoki Maruyama, Masayuki Ohzeki, Kazuyuki Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) with a transverse field often fails to sample degenerate ground states fairly, limiting applicability to problems requiring diverse optimal solutions. Although Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is widely used to simulate QA, its ability to reproduce such unfair ground-state sampling remains unclear because stochastic and coherent quantum dynamics differ fundamentally. We quantitatively evaluate how accurately QMC reproduces the sampling bias in QA by comparing the final ground-state distributions from the QMC master equation and the Schrödinger equation. We find QMC tends to produce uniform ground-state probabilities, unlike QA's biased distribution, and that this uniformity bias strengthens as annealing proceeds. Our analysis reveals that this bias originates from replica alignment -- the dominance of configurations in which all Trotter replicas coincide -- caused by the energetic suppression and entropic reduction of kink configurations (replica mismatches). These findings clarify a fundamental limitation of discrete-time QMC in faithfully simulating QA dynamics, highlighting the importance of replica correlations and transition rules in achieving realistic ground-state sampling.

Title: Quantum-Squeezing-Induced Algebraic Non-Hermitian Skin Effects and Ultra Spectral Sensitivity
Authors: Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu
Abstract: The well-established non-Bloch band theory predicts exponential localization of skin-mode eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies, however, have uncovered anomalous algebraic localization in higher dimensions. Here, we extend these ideas to Hermitian bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians incorporating quantum squeezing, offering a genuine quantum framework to explore non-Hermitian phenomena without external reservoirs. We construct a two-dimensional (2D) bosonic lattice model with two-mode squeezing and study its spectral properties of bosonic excitation within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We demonstrate an algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by quasi-long-range power-law localization of complex eigenstates. The system shows ultra spectral sensitivity to double infinitesimal on-site and long-range hopping impurities, while remaining insensitive to single impurities. Analytical treatment via the Green's function reveals that this sensitivity originates from the divergence of the nonlocal Green's function associated with the formation of nonlocal bound states between impurities. Our study establishes a framework for realizing novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics in Hermitian bosonic platforms such as superconducting circuits, photonic lattices, and optomechanical arrays, with the demonstrated ultraspectral sensitivity enabling quantum sensing and amplification via bosonic squeezing.

Title: Quantum Radar: An Engineering Perspective
Authors: Murat Can Karakoc, Ozgun Ersoy, Ahmad Salmanoghli Khiavi, Asaf Behzat Sahin
Abstract: Quantum radar has emerged as a promising paradigm that utilizes entanglement and quantum correlations to overcome the limitations of classical detection in noisy and lossy environments. By exploiting microwave entanglement generated from superconducting devices such as Josephson parametric amplifiers, converters, and traveling-wave parametric amplifiers, quantum radar systems can achieve enhanced detection sensitivity, lower error probabilities, and greater robustness against thermal noise and jamming. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the field, beginning with the theoretical foundations of quantum illumination and extending to the generation of entanglement in the microwave regime. We then examine key quantum radar subsystems, including quantum transducers, amplification chains, and receiver architectures, which form the backbone of practical designs. Recent experimental systems are surveyed in the microwave domain, highlighting proof-of-principle demonstrations and their transition from conceptual frameworks to laboratory realizations. Collectively, the progress reviewed here demonstrates that quantum radar is evolving from a theoretical construct to a practical quantum technology capable of extending the performance boundaries of classical radar.

Title: Automated discovery of high-dimensional multipartite entanglement with photons that never interacted
Authors: Sören Arlt, Mario Krenn, Xuemei Gu
Abstract: Quantum entanglement across spatially separated network nodes is conventionally established through the distribution of photons from a common source or via entanglement swapping that relies on Bell-state measurements and pre-shared entanglement. Path identity, where the emission origins of photons from different sources are made indistinguishable, offers an alternative route. We show that this mechanism enables complex multipartite, high-dimensional, and even logical entanglement between remote nodes whose photons never interacted. Our schemes require neither direct photon interaction, pre-shared entanglement, nor Bell-state measurements, highlighting a distinct resource for distributed quantum communication and computation. All of the solutions were discovered automatically using highly efficient computational design tools, indicating the potential for scientific inspiration from computational algorithms.

Title: Extreme Capacities in Generalized Direct Sum Channels
Authors: Zhen Wu, Si-Qi Zhou
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities play a central role in quantum Shannon theory, a formalism built upon rigorous coding theorems for noisy channels. Evaluating exact capacity values for general quantum channels remains intractable due to superadditivity. As a step toward understanding this phenomenon, we construct the generalized direct sum (GDS) channel, extending conventional direct sum channels through a direct sum structure in their Kraus operators. This construction forms the basis of the GDS framework, encompassing classes of channels with single-letter formula for quantum capacities and others exhibiting striking capacity features. The quantum capacity can approach zero yet display unbounded superadditivity combined with erasure channels. Private and classical capacities coincide and can become arbitrarily large, resulting in an unbounded gap with the quantum capacity. Providing a simpler and more intuitive approach, the framework deepens our understanding of quantum channel capacities.

Title: Quantum complementarity
Authors: Davide Rolino, Paolo Perinotti, Alessandro Tosini
Abstract: We propose an operational definition of complementarity, pinning down the concept originally introduced by Bohr. Two properties of a system are considered complementary if they cannot be simultaneously well defined. We further show that, within quantum theory, this notion is equivalent to the incompatibility of operations -- that is, their inability to be performed simultaneously.

Title: Sheared potentials and travelling nodes
Authors: Francisco M. Fernández
Abstract: When a sheared potential is deformed in such a way that the distance between the classical turning points remains constant the eigenvalues of the Schrödinger equation oscillate with respect to the potential parameter responsible for the deformation. We show that such an oscillation is intimately related to the passing of the nodes of the corresponding eigenfunctions through the origin. We illustrate this effect by means of the split harmonic oscillator and the split linear potential.

Title: Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates
Authors: Yichen Xu, Yiqing Zhou, James P. Sethna, Eun-Ah Kim
Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.

Title: Magnon-rotation enhanced nonreciprocity of multipartite entanglement in a magnomechanical system
Authors: Hamza Harraf, Noura Chabar, Mohamed Amazioug, Rachid Ahl Laamara, Mojtaba Mazaheri
Abstract: Nonreciprocal physics is attracting significant interest in quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a scheme to investigate the nonreciprocity of bi- and tripartite entanglement and generate squeezed states in a magnomechanical system. This is achieved through the Barnett effect, which originates from the rotation of the first magnon mode. The system consists of two YIG spheres, each supporting a magnon mode that represents collective spin motion, positioned inside a microwave cavity (MC). We show that the Barnett effect enhances entanglement under thermal effects and generates squeezed states for the two magnon modes and the photon mode. Moreover, we show that magnon-magnon coupling enhances entanglement between different two modes.

Title: Sublogarithmic Distillation in all Prime Dimensions using Punctured Reed-Muller Codes
Authors: Tanay Saha, Shiroman Prakash
Abstract: Magic state distillation is a leading but costly approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation, and it is important to explore all possible ways of minimizing its overhead cost. The number of ancillae required to produce a magic state within a target error rate $\epsilon$ is $O(\log^{\gamma} (\epsilon^{-1}))$ where $\gamma$ is known as the yield parameter. Hastings and Haah derived a family of distillation protocols with sublogarithmic overhead (i.e., $\gamma < 1$) based on punctured Reed-Muller codes. Building on work by Campbell \textit{et al.} and Krishna-Tillich, which suggests that qudits of dimension $p>2$ can significantly reduce overhead, we generalize their construction to qudits of arbitrary prime dimension $p$. We find that, in an analytically tractable puncturing scheme, the number of qudits required to achieve sublogarithmic overhead decreases drastically as $p$ increases, and the asymptotic yield parameter approaches $\frac{1}{\ln p}$ as $p \to \infty$. We also perform a small computational search for optimal puncture locations, which results in several interesting triorthogonal codes, including a $[[519,106,5]]_5$ code with $\gamma=0.99$.

Title: Structural encoding with classical codes for computational-basis bit-flip correction in the early fault-tolerant regime
Authors: IlKwon Sohn, Changyeol Lee, Wooyeong Song, Kwangil Bae, Wonhyuk Lee
Abstract: Achieving reliable performance on early fault-tolerant quantum hardware will depend on protocols that manage noise without incurring prohibitive overhead. We propose a novel framework that integrates quantum computation with the functionality of classical error correction. In this approach, quantum computation is performed within the codeword subspace defined by a classical error correction code. The correction of various types of errors that manifest as bit flips is carried out based on the final measurement outcomes. The approach leverages the asymmetric structure of many key algorithms, where problem-defining diagonal operators (e.g., oracles) are paired with fixed non-diagonal operators (e.g., diffusion operators). The proposed encoding maps computational basis states to classical codewords. This approach commutes with diagonal operators, obviating their overhead and confining the main computational cost to simpler non-diagonal components. Noisy simulations corroborate this analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme serves as a viable protocol-level layer for enhancing performance in the early fault-tolerant regime.

Title: A Simple and Efficient One-Shot Signature Scheme
Authors: Andrew Huang, Vinod Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: One-shot signatures (OSS) are a powerful and uniquely quantum cryptographic primitive which allows anyone, given common reference string, to come up with a public verification key $\mathsf{pk}$ and a secret signing state $|\mathsf{sk}\rangle$. With the secret signing state, one can produce the signature of any one message, but no more. In a recent breakthrough work, Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2025) constructed one-shot signatures, either unconditionally in a classical oracle model or assuming post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscation and the hardness of Learning with Errors (LWE) in the plain model. In this work, we address the inefficiency of the Shmueli-Zhandry construction which signs messages bit-by-bit, resulting in signing keys of $\Theta(\lambda^4)$ qubits and signatures of size $\Theta(\lambda^3)$ bits for polynomially long messages, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter. We construct a new, simple, direct, and efficient one-shot signature scheme which can sign messages of any polynomial length using signing keys of $\Theta(\lambda^2)$ qubits and signatures of size $\Theta(\lambda^2)$ bits. We achieve corresponding savings in runtimes, in both the oracle model and the plain model. In addition, unlike the Shmueli-Zhandry construction, our scheme achieves perfect correctness. Our scheme also achieves strong signature incompressibility, which implies a public-key quantum fire scheme with perfect correctness among other applications, correcting an error in a recent work of Çakan, Goyal and Shmueli (QCrypt 2025) and recovering their applications.

Title: Error mitigation for partially error-corrected quantum computers
Authors: Ben DalFavero, Ryan LaRose
Abstract: We present a method for quantum error mitigation on partially error-corrected quantum computers - i.e., computers with some logical qubits and some noisy qubits. Our method is inspired by the error cancellation method and is implemented via a circuit for convex combinations of channels which we introduce in this work. We show how logical ancilla qubits can arbitrarily reduce the sampling complexity of error cancellation in a continuous space-time tradeoff, in the limiting case achieving $O(1)$ sample complexity which circumvents lower bounds for sample complexity with all known error mitigation techniques. This comes at the cost of exponential circuit depth, however, and leads us to conjecture that any error mitigation protocol with (sub-)polynomial sample complexity requires exponential time and/or space, even when logical qubits are utilized as a resource. We anticipate additional applications for our quantum circuits to implement convex combinations of channels, and to this end we discuss one application in simulating open quantum systems, showing an order of magnitude reduction in gate counts relative to current state-of-the-art methods for a canonical problem.

Title: Dominant spin-spin relaxation mechanism at clock transition of the $Ho_{x}Y_{1-x}W_{10}$ complex at different concentrations
Authors: Xiao Chen, Haechan Park, Silas Hoffman, Shuanglong Liu, Hai-Ping Cheng
Abstract: Spin decoherence poses a significant challenge in molecular magnets, with the nuclear spin bath serving as a prominent source. Intriguingly, spin qubits at the clock transition exhibit remarkable insensitivity to the surrounding nuclear spins. Recent experimental studies have unveiled a correlation between the decoherence time and the density of spin qubits, prompting our investigation into the contribution of the qubit bath to spin decoherence. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of a few S=1 spin qubits, focusing on their interaction at the clock transition. Employing the exact diagonalization and the cluster correlation expansion (CCE) method, we simulate the dynamics of spin decoherence while varying the density of the qubit bath. To ensure the realism of our simulations, we incorporate structural and energetic parameters derived from previous studies on the HoW10 crystal. Our findings indicate that when the energy mismatch between the energy splittings of two qubits exceeds their interaction strength, they can become effectively insensitive to each other, offering an explanation for the absence of observed changes in the T2 time during experiments with lower qubit densities. Understanding the role of qubit bath density in spin decoherence at the clock transition not only advances our knowledge of decoherence mechanisms but also provides insights for the development of strategies to protect coherence in molecular magnets and other quantum systems. By optimizing the density of spin qubits, we can enhance the coherence properties and pave the way for improved performance of quantum devices. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the relationship between qubit bath density and spin decoherence at the clock transition, contributing to the broader understanding and control of quantum systems in molecular magnets.

Title: On the Feasibility of Exact Unitary Transformations for Many-body Hamiltonians
Authors: Praveen Jayakumar, Tao Zeng, Artur F. Izmaylov
Abstract: Exact unitary transformations play a central role in the analysis and simulation of many-body quantum systems, yet the conditions under which they can be carried out exactly and efficiently remain incompletely understood. We show that exact transformations arise whenever the adjoint action of a unitary's generator defines a linear map within a finite-dimensional operator space. In this regime, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem ensures the existence of a finite-degree polynomial that annihilates the adjoint map, rendering the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion finite. This perspective brings together previously disparate examples of exact transformations under a single unifying principle and clarifies how algebraic relations between generators and transformed operators determine the polynomial degree of the transformation. We illustrate this framework for unitary coupled-cluster and involutory generators, identifying cases in which a single commutator suffices. The result establishes clear algebraic criteria for when exact unitary transformations are possible and provides new strategies for reducing their computational cost in quantum simulation.

Title: Verifiable Quantum Advantage via Optimized DQI Circuits
Authors: Tanuj Khattar, Noah Shutty, Craig Gidney, Adam Zalcman, Noureldin Yosri, Dmitri Maslov, Ryan Babbush, Stephen P. Jordan
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) provides a framework for superpolynomial quantum speedups by reducing certain optimization problems to reversible decoding tasks. We apply DQI to the Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) problem, whose dual code is Reed-Solomon (RS). We establish that DQI for OPI is the first known candidate for verifiable quantum advantage with optimal asymptotic speedup: solving instances with classical hardness $O(2^N)$ requires only $\widetilde{O}(N)$ quantum gates, matching the theoretical lower bound. Realizing this speedup requires highly efficient reversible RS decoders. We introduce novel quantum circuits for the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, the decoder's bottleneck. Our techniques, including a new representation for implicit Bézout coefficient access, and optimized in-place architectures, reduce the leading-order space complexity to the theoretical minimum of $2nb$ qubits while significantly lowering gate counts. These improvements are broadly applicable, including to Shor's algorithm for the discrete logarithm. We analyze OPI over binary extension fields $GF(2^b)$, assess hardness against new classical attacks, and identify resilient instances. Our resource estimates show that classically intractable OPI instances (requiring $>10^{23}$ classical trials) can be solved with approximately 5.72 million Toffoli gates. This is substantially less than the count required for breaking RSA-2048, positioning DQI as a compelling candidate for practical, verifiable quantum advantage.

Authors: Ethan Abraham, Junghyun Yoon, Troy Van Voorhis, Martin Z. Bazant
Abstract: We predict that in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus normal regime, Marcus kinetics will be observed with a reduced effective reorganization energy that is a function of the standard reorganization energy and the coupling strength. This result enables the derivation of a closed-form Marcus-Hush-Chidsey type rate expression for heterogeneous electron transfer in the adiabatic limit, which also involves a different prefactor than in the non-adiabatic case.

Title: Electron-positron pair creation in a supercritical static asymmetric potential well
Authors: Z. L. Li, A. R. Sun, J. H. Xia, J. X. Wu, Y. J. Li
Abstract: The electron-positron pair creation in a supercritical static asymmetric potential well, which is composed of a subcritical and a supercritical potential separated by a fixed distance, is investigated using computational quantum field theory. To explain the discrete peaks in the positron energy spectrum, an analytical formula for determining the positions of bound states in a subcritical asymmetric potential well is derived and extended to the supercritical asymmetric potential well in two ways. One of the two methods can not only predict the positions of bound states, but also offer the pair creation rate. This study also reveals that the subcritical potential height can optimize the energy spread of created electrons, providing a new way to produce high-energy electron beams with concentrated energy in experiments. Moreover, it is found that the pair creation rate in a supercritical asymmetric potential well, composed of a subcritical symmetric potential well and a supercritical Sauter potential, exceeds the sum of the pair creation rates produced by each potential individually. This finding suggests a potential method for enhancing pair yield.

Title: On the Potential of Quantum Computing in Classical Program Analysis
Authors: Yicheng Guang, Pietro Zanotta, Kai Zhou, Yueqi Chen, Ramin Ayanzadeh
Abstract: Classical program analysis techniques, such as abstract interpretation and symbolic execution, are essential for ensuring software correctness, optimizing performance, and enabling compiler optimizations. However, these techniques face computational limitations when analyzing programs with large or exponential state spaces, limiting their effectiveness in ensuring system reliability. Quantum computing, with its parallelism and ability to process superposed states, offers a promising solution to these challenges. In this work, we present QEX, a design that uses quantum computing to analyze classical programs. By synthesizing quantum circuits that encode program states in superposition and trace data dependency between program variables through entanglement, QEX enables the simultaneous exploration of program behaviors, significantly improving scalability and precision. This advancement has broad applications, from debugging and security verification to optimizing compilers for next-generation hardware. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluated QEX on 22 benchmark programs, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing program states. To support more language features and make QEX realized sooner in Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC), we propose QEX-H which hybridizes QEX with classical analysis techniques. To our knowledge, this work is the first proposal to use quantum computing for classical program analysis.

Title: Assessing the Role of Communication in Modular Multi-Core Quantum Systems
Authors: Maurizio Palesi, Enrico Russo, Giuseppe Ascia, Hamaad Rafique, Davide Patti, Vincenzo Catania, Sergi Abadal, Abhijit Das, Pau Escofet, Eduard Alarcon, Carmen G. Almudéver
Abstract: The scalability of quantum computing is constrained by the physical and architectural limitations of monolithic quantum processors. Modular multi-core quantum architectures, which interconnect multiple quantum cores (QCs) via classical and quantum-coherent links, offer a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, transitioning to a modular architecture introduces communication overhead, where classical communication plays a crucial role in executing quantum algorithms by transmitting measurement outcomes and synchronizing operations across QCs. Understanding the impact of classical communication on execution time is therefore essential for optimizing system performance. In this work, we introduce \qcomm, an open-source simulator designed to evaluate the role of classical communication in modular quantum computing architectures. \qcomm{} provides a high-level execution and timing model that captures the interplay between quantum gate execution, entanglement distribution, teleportation protocols, and classical communication latency. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis to quantify the impact of classical communication bandwidth, interconnect types, and quantum circuit mapping strategies on overall execution time. Furthermore, we assess classical communication overhead when executing real quantum benchmarks mapped onto a cryogenically-controlled multi-core quantum system. Our results show that, while classical communication is generally not the dominant contributor to execution time, its impact becomes increasingly relevant in optimized scenarios -- such as improved quantum technology, large-scale interconnects, or communication-aware circuit mappings. These findings provide useful insights for the design of scalable modular quantum architectures and highlight the importance of evaluating classical communication as a performance-limiting factor in future systems.

Title: Analytical Control of Quantum Coherence: Markovian Revival via Basis Engineering and Exact Non-Markovian Criteria
Authors: Na-Na Zhang, Chao-Yi Wu, Ming Li, Wei-Xuan Cao, Jun-Hao Zhang, Yong-Rui Guo, Ren-Pu Li
Abstract: The preservation of quantum coherence is besieged by a fundamental dogma: its revival necessitates non-Markovian memory effects from structured environments. This paradigm has constrained quantum control strategies and obscured simpler paths to coherence protection. Here, we shatter this belief by demonstrating unambiguous coherence revival even in strictly Markovian regimes, achieved solely through basis engineering in the $\sigma_x/\sigma_y$ bases. We establish a comprehensive analytical framework for predictive coherence control, delivering three universal design principles. First, we derive a minimum critical noise based frequency, $\omega_{0}^{c} = 1.57/(0.4996 \cdot t_{\max})$, serving as a universal criterion for engineering non-Markovian dynamics over any interval $[0, t_{\max}]$. Crucially, we show that Markovian environments ($\omega_0 < \omega_0^c$) can exhibit coherence revival when the Zeeman energy satisfies $\omega_k > \pi/(2t_{\max})$, decoupling revival from environmental memory. Furthermore, for non-Markovian environments, we provide exact conditions for periodic and complete revival: setting $\omega_0 = n \cdot 6.285/t_{\max}$ guarantees revival in the $\sigma_z$ basis, while combining it with $\omega_k = \pi \omega_0 / 6.285$ ensures perfect revival in the $\sigma_x/\sigma_y$ bases. Our results, validated by rigorous quantum simulations, provide a predictive toolkit for coherence control, offering immediate strategies for enhancing quantum memory, sensing, and error mitigation.

Title: Quantum phase transition of sub-Ohmic spin-boson models: An approach by the multiple Davydov D2 Ansatz
Authors: Justin Tan, Nengji Zhou, Yang Zhao
Abstract: The ground state properties and quantum phase transitions of sub-Ohmic spin-boson models are investigated using the multiple Davydov D2 Ansatz in conjunction with the variational principle. Three variants of the model are studied: (i) a single bath with diagonal coupling, (ii) two independent baths with diagonal and off-diagonal couplings, and (iii) a single bath with simultaneous diagonal and off-diagonal couplings. For the purely diagonal model, the multiple Davydov D2 Ansatz yields critical coupling strengths that are consistent with other methodologies, validating its accuracy and efficiency. In the two-bath model, the competition between diagonal and off-diagonal couplings drives a first-order transition for both symmetric and asymmetric spectral exponents, with von-Neumann entropy showing a continuous peak only under exact symmetry. Finally, for a single bath with simultaneous diagonal and off-diagonal couplings, we demonstrate that a rotational transformation maps the system to an equivalent purely diagonal model, enabling simpler and intuitive physical interpretation and reduced computational complexity.

Title: Hot-Starting Quantum Portfolio Optimization
Authors: Sebastian Schlütter, Tomislav Maras, Alexander Dotterweich, Nico Piatkowski
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization with a smooth and convex objective function arises naturally in applications such as discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization, where assets must be traded in integer quantities. Although optimal solutions to the associated smooth problem can be computed efficiently, existing adiabatic quantum optimization methods cannot leverage this information. Moreover, while various warm-starting strategies have been proposed for gate-based quantum optimization, none of them explicitly integrate insights from the relaxed continuous solution into the QUBO formulation. In this work, a novel approach is introduced that restricts the search space to discrete solutions in the vicinity of the continuous optimum by constructing a compact Hilbert space, thereby reducing the number of required qubits. Experiments on software solvers and a D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: Quantum Information Processing with Spatially Structured Light
Authors: Suraj Goel, Bohnishikha Ghosh, Mehul Malik
Abstract: Qudits have proven to be a powerful resource for quantum information processing, offering enhanced channel capacities, improved robustness to noise, and highly efficient implementations of quantum algorithms. The encoding of photonic qudits in transverse-spatial degrees of freedom has emerged as a versatile tool for quantum information processing, allowing access to a vast information capacity within a single photon. In this review, we examine recent advances in quantum optical circuits with spatially structured light, focusing particularly on top-down approaches that employ complex mode-mixing transformations in free-space and fibers. In this context, we highlight circuits based on platforms such as multi-plane light conversion, complex scattering media, multimode and multi-core fibers. We discuss their applications for the manipulation and measurement of multi-dimensional and multi-mode quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss how these circuits have been employed to perform multi-party operations and multi-outcome measurements, thereby opening new avenues for scalable photonic quantum information processing.

Authors: Thomas K. Bracht, Rachel N. Clark, Petros Androvitsaneas, Matthew Jordan, Samuel G. Bishop, Harry E. Dyte, Moritz Cygorek, Ian A. Farrer, Doris E. Reiter, Anthony J. Bennett
Abstract: Mixing the fields generated by different light sources has emerged as a powerful approach for engineering non-Gaussian quantum states. Understanding and controlling the resulting photon statistics is useful for emerging quantum technologies that are underpinned by interference. In this work, we investigate intensity correlation functions arising from the interference of resonance fluorescence from a quantum emitter with a coherent laser field. We show that the observed bunching behavior results from a subtle interplay between quantum interference and the normalization of the correlation functions. We show that by adjusting the mixing ratio and phase one can achieve full tunability of the second-order correlation, ranging from anti-bunching to bunching. We further extend our analysis to third-order correlation functions, both experimentally and theoretically, to provide new insights into the interpretation of higher-order correlations and offer practical tools for shaping quantum optical fields.

Title: Tensor-Network-Based Unraveling of Non-Markovian Dynamics in Large Spin Chains via the Influence Martingale Approach
Authors: Sujay Mondal, Siddhartha Dutta, Abhijit Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Classical simulation of open quantum system dynamics remains challenging due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, the need to accurately capture dissipation and decoherence, and the added complexity of memory effects in the non-Markovian regime. We develop an efficient algorithm for simulating both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics in large one-dimensional quantum systems. Extending the Tensor Jump Method, which combines TDVP-based tensor-network evolution with a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of stochastic trajectories, our approach incorporates time-dependent decay rates-treating positive rates as time-inhomogeneous Markovian processes and negative rates via the Influence Martingale formalism to unravel time-local non-Markovian dynamics. This resource-efficient framework enables scalable simulations of open-system dynamics in the non-Markovian regime, as demonstrated for a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising chain comprising up to 100 spin qubits.

Abstract: We study two hybridization algorithms used for the combination of a quantum inertial sensor based on atom interferometry with a classical inertial sensor for onboard acceleration measurements. The first is based on the direct extraction of the interferometer phase, and was previously used in seaborne and airborne gravity measurement campaigns. The second is based on the combination of three consecutive measurements and was originally developed to increase the measurement range of the quantum sensor beyond its linear range. After comparing their performances using synthetic data, we implement them on acceleration data collected in a recent airborne campaign and evaluate the bias and the scale factor error of the classical sensor. We then extend their scope to the dynamical evaluation of other key measurement parameters (e.g. alignment errors). We demonstrate an improvement in the correlation between the two accelerometers' measurements and a significant reduction of the error in the estimation of the bias of the classical sensor.

Title: Experimental Demonstration of the PBR Test on a Superconducting Processor
Authors: Songqinghao Yang, Haomu Yuan, Crispin H. W. Barnes
Abstract: We present an experimental implementation of the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) no-go theorem on IBM's 156-qubit Heron2 Marrakesh superconducting quantum processor. By preparing qubits in a set of non-orthogonal states and evolving them under carefully compiled unitary circuits, we test whether one can interpret the hidden variable model for quantum states as merely epistemic -- reflecting ignorance about some underlying physical reality. To account for realistic hardware imperfections, we derive noise-aware error tolerance based on decoherence models calibrated to the device's performance. Our results show that a significant majority of adjacent qubit pairs and adjacent five-qubit configurations yield outcome statistics that violate the epistemic bound, thus ruling out the epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we observe a clear trend: the probability of passing the PBR test decreases as the spatial separation within the quantum processor between qubits increases, highlighting the sensitivity of this protocol to connectivity and coherence in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. These results demonstrate the PBR test as a promising device-level benchmark for quantumness in the presence of realistic noise.

Title: Bright Single-Photon Emission from Individual Tin-Vacancy Centers in Multi-Cone Diamond Waveguides
Authors: Pablo Tieben, Jan Rhensius, Takuya F. Segawa, Risei Abe, Konosuke Shimazaki, Shigeki Takeuchi, Andeas W. Schell, Hideaki Takashima
Abstract: Diamonds containing color centers have recently gathered significant attention for photonic quantum technologies, including quantum sensing, photonic quantum computers, and quantum networks. Among the various color centers, tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are particularly promising due to the high emission efficiency from the zero-phonon line and due to their long spin coherence times. However, the extraction of photons from diamond remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate high photon extraction from a single SnV center incorporated in a diamond nanopillar with tapered sidewalls and a multi-cone structure. A sharp emission peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $6\,$nm was observed at a wavelength of $619\,$nm. Furthermore, the second-order correlation function exhibited an antibunching dip well below $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.5$, indicating single-photon emission. Remarkably, the emitter achieved a high saturation count rate of approximately $9\,$Mcps. These results establish our nanopillar platform as a promising candidate for bright and stable quantum sources and sensors based on SnV centers in diamond.

Title: Basis-independent Coherence in Noninertial Frames
Authors: Ming-Ming Du Yi-Hao Fan, Hong-Wei Li, Shu-Ting Shen, Xiao-Jing Yan, Xi-Yun Li, Wei Zhong, Yu-Bo Sheng, Lan Zhou
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of basis-independent quantum coherence between two modes of a free Dirac field as observed by relatively accelerated observers. Our findings reveal three key results: (i) the basis-independent coherence between modes A and BI decreases with increasing acceleration but remains finite even in the limit of infinite acceleration; (ii) at zero acceleration, the coherence between modes $A$ and $B_II$ is nonzero contrasting with the behavior of basis-dependent coherence, which typically vanishes in this case; and (iii) the basis-independent coherence between modes BI and BII remains constant regardless of acceleration, exhibiting a freezing phenomenon. These results demonstrate the intrinsic robustness of basis-independent coherence under Unruh effects.

Abstract: We offer a fresh perspective on the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics as a way of thinking about the world described by quantum theory based on quantifiable notions of information. This allows us to provide a definition of a relative fact, with no addition to orthodox quantum theory and no fundamentally special role for observers. By associating perspectives with commutative observables rather than entire quantum systems, several previous problems with the interpretation are dissolved. As a side result, we show how a quantum measurement, properly described, is a continuous process.

Title: Disorder-Induced Strongly Correlated Photons in Waveguide QED
Authors: Guoqing Tian, Li-Li Zheng, Zhi-Ming Zhan, Franco Nori, Xin-You Lü
Abstract: Strongly correlated photons play a crucial role in modern quantum technologies. Here, we investigate the probability of generating strongly correlated photons in a chain of N qubits coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide. We found that disorder in the transition frequencies can induce photon antibunching, and especially nearly perfect photon blockade events in the transmission and reflection outputs. As a comparison, in ordered chains, strongly correlated photons cannot be generated in the transmission output, and only weakly antibunched photons are found in the reflection output. The occurrence of nearly perfect photon blockade events stems from the disorder-induced near completely destructive interference of photon scattering paths. Our work highlights the impact of disorder on photon correlation generation and suggests that disorder can enhance the potential for achieving strongly correlated photon.

Title: The Dirac equation and the Quantum Potential
Authors: Calum Robson
Abstract: One key theme of Basil Hiley's work was the development of David Bohm's approach to Quantum Mechanics; in particular the concept of the quantum potential. Another theme was the importance of Clifford Algebras in fundamental physics. In this paper I will combine these approaches by looking at how the quantum potential can be extended to the Dirac equation. I will begin by discussing the geometry of the Dirac equation, and how this is made clearer by the use of Clifford algebras .Next, I will rewrite the Cl(2) Dirac wavefunction in Polar form, and show that new behaviour arises due to topological nonlocality. Finally, I discuss the relationship between the Dirac and Schroedinger equations.

Title: Finite Key Rates for QKD Protocols with Data Filtering
Authors: Walter O. Krawec
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a new proof of security for a general class of quantum cryptographic protocol involving filtering and discarded data. We derive a novel bound on the quantum min entropy of such a system, based in large part on properties of a certain classical sampling strategy. Finally, we show how our methods can be used to readily prove security of the Extended B92 protocol, providing the first finite key proof of security for this protocol against general, coherent, attacks.

Title: French on London and Bauer, and QBism
Authors: Jacques L. Pienaar
Abstract: In this article I compare two interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM) that draw inspiration from phenomenology: the London-Bauer-French interpretation (hereafter LBF) as articulated by Steven French, and QBism. I give special attention to certain disagreements between QBism and LBF identified French's work, as well as French's related claims that QBism may be at odds with key ideas in phenomenology. My main finding is that QBism does not fare so badly with phenomenology as French makes out; in particular it can be made compatible with Zahavi's correlationism and Husserl's notion of intersubjectivity, both of which strongly inform LBF. Nevertheless, I concur with French's argument that QBism is incompatible with the conception of quantum measurement in LBF, hence also with that of Merleau-Ponty, as the latter based his own analysis on that of London and Bauer. I explain why I find QBism's account preferable in this case.

Title: Telecom-compatible cross-band quantum memory via dual photon modes dark-state polaritons
Authors: Dounan Du, Eden Figueroa
Abstract: Quantum memories are essential components of quantum networks, enabling synchronization, quantum repeaters, and long-distance entanglement distribution. Most ensemble-based realizations rely on dark-state polaritons (DSPs) in $\Lambda$-type systems that operate at near-infrared wavelengths, such as 795 nm in $^{87}$Rb, far from the telecom band where long fiber transmission is optimal. Here we identify a DSP in $^{87}$Rb that coherently couples two photonic modes at 795 nm and 1324 nm through a shared spin-wave coherence. We derive its field operator and group velocity, extending the Fleischhauer-Lukin model to a dual-wavelength regime, and formulate a memory protocol enabling bidirectional storage and retrieval between the two modes. Numerical simulations of the full six-level dynamics confirm two-way storage and retrieval for both same-mode and cross-mode operation between the two wavelengths. The results demonstrate a dual-wavelength memory that unifies node-band and telecom-band operation within a single ensemble, providing a potential route toward frequency-conversion-free quantum-network interfaces.

Title: Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer for Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Seong-Joon Park, Hee-Youl Kwak, Yongjune Kim
Abstract: For reliable large-scale quantum computation, a quantum error correction (QEC) scheme must effectively resolve physical errors to protect logical information. Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, neural network-based decoders have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reliability of QEC. We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and general decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of stabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our architecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of stabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations to build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves substantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a dedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across various code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural network-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline. This hierarchical approach provides a scalable and effective framework for surface code decoding, advancing the realization of reliable quantum computing.

Title: Quantum Synchronization of Perturbed Oscillating Coherences
Authors: Yi J. Zhao, Joel E. Moore, Juzar Thingna, Christopher W. Wächtler
Abstract: Synchronization in quantum systems has been recently studied through persistent oscillations of local observables, which stem from undamped modes of the dissipative dynamics. However, the existence of such modes requires fine-tuning the system to satisfy specific symmetry constraints. We investigate the response of spin systems that possess such oscillating modes to generic, weak perturbations. We show that even when these perturbations break the symmetry and lead to a single steady state, the phase correlations in the resulting state exhibit signatures of synchronization. Our results therefore connect the persistent oscillation notion (dynamical) and the notion based on phase correlations (steady-state) of synchronization, which so far have been regarded as distinct phenomena. Furthermore, we demonstrate that steady-state synchronization in these systems can exhibit features that are absent in the dynamical synchronization. Our work suggests robustness of synchronization and points toward a potential unifying framework of quantum synchronization.

Title: A Monte Carlo approach to bound Trotter error
Authors: Nick S. Blunt, Aleksei V. Ivanov, Andreas Juul Bay-Smidt
Abstract: Trotter product formulas are a natural and powerful approach to perform quantum simulation. However, the error analysis of product formulas is challenging, and their cost is often overestimated. It is established that Trotter error can be bounded in terms of spectral norms of nested commutators of the Hamiltonian partitions [Childs et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011020], but evaluating these expressions is challenging, often achieved by repeated application of the triangle inequality, significantly loosening the bound. Here, we show that the spectral norm of an operator can be upper bounded by the spectral norm of an equivalent sign-problem-free operator, which can be calculated efficiently to large system sizes using projector Monte Carlo simulation. For a range of Hamiltonians and considering second-order formulas, we demonstrate that this Monte Carlo-based bound is often extremely tight, and even exact in some instances. For the uniform electron gas we reduce the cost of performing Trotterization from the literature by an order of magnitude. For the Pariser-Parr-Pople model for linear acene molecules, which has $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ long-range interaction terms, we show that it suffices to use $\mathcal{O}(N^{0.57})$ Trotter steps and circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.57})$ to implement Hamiltonian simulation. We hope that this approach will lead to a better understanding of the potential accuracy of Trotterization in a range of important applications.

Title: Observation of ballistic plasma and memory in high-energy gauge theory dynamics
Authors: Daniel K. Mark, Federica M. Surace, Thomas Schuster, Adam L. Shaw, Wenjie Gong, Soonwon Choi, Manuel Endres
Abstract: Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces of nature. However, high-energy dynamics, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasmas, is notoriously difficult to model with classical methods. Quantum simulation offers a promising alternative in this regime, yet experiments have mainly probed low energies. Here, we observe the formation of a ballistic plasma and long-time memory effects in high-energy gauge theory dynamics on a high-precision quantum simulator. Both observations are unexpected, as the initial state - fully filled with particle-antiparticle pairs - was thought to rapidly thermalize. Instead, we find correlations spreading ballistically to long distances and a memory of charge clusters. Our observations cannot be explained by many-body scars, but are captured by a new theory of plasma oscillations between electric field and current operators, persisting all the way to the continuum limit of the (1+1)D Schwinger model, of which we simulate a lattice version. Adapting techniques from quantum optics, we visualize plasma oscillations as rotations of Wigner distributions, leading to a novel set of predictions which we test in experiment and numerics. The new framework encompasses both our scenario and scars, which show up as coherent states of the plasma. The experimental surprises we observe in the high-energy dynamics of a simple gauge theory point to the potential of high-precision quantum simulations of gauge theories for general scientific discovery.

Title: The Magic Barrier before Thermalization
Authors: Lukas Ebner, Berndt Müller, Andreas Schäfer, Leonhard Schmotzer, Clemens Seidl, Xiaojun Yao
Abstract: We investigate the time dependence of anti-flatness in the entanglement spectrum, a measure for non-stabilizerness and lower bound for non-local quantum magic, on a subsystem of a linear SU(2) plaquette chain during thermalization. Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states, we find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time period when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the initial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is strongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest growth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational basis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime, revealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during thermalization. We conclude that quantitative simulations of thermalization for nonabelian gauge theories require quantum computing. We speculate that this property generalizes to other quantum chaotic systems.

Title: Probing emergent prethermal dynamics and resonant melting on a programmable quantum simulator

Abstract: The dynamics of isolated quantum systems following a sudden quench plays a central role in many areas of material science, high-energy physics, and quantum chemistry. Featuring complex phenomena with implications for thermalization, non-equilibrium phase transitions, and Floquet phase engineering, such far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics is challenging to study numerically, in particular, in high-dimensional systems. Here, we use a programmable neutral atom quantum simulator to systematically explore quench dynamics in spin models with up to 180 qubits. By initializing the system in a product state and performing quenches across a broad parameter space, we discover several stable, qualitatively distinct dynamical regimes. We trace their robustness to Floquet-like prethermal steady states that are stabilized over long emergent timescales by strong dynamical constraints. In addition, we observe sharp peaks in the dynamical response that are quantitatively explained by the structured melting of prethermalization through resonances. In two dimensions, we uncover a sharp dynamical response change that converges with increased system size, that is linked to the proliferation of Néel-order defects and indicative of a dynamical phase transition with no equilibrium analogs. Uncovering an intricate interplay between quantum prethermalization and emergent dynamical phases, our results demonstrate the use of quantum simulators for revealing complex non-equilibrium quantum many-body phenomena.

Title: Neural PDE Solvers with Physics Constraints: A Comparative Study of PINNs, DRM, and WANs
Authors: Jiakang Chen
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks (WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schrödinger equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the study to a laser-driven case of Schrödinger's equation via the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation. Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs), forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning, network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case, indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks. We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible, scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

Title: Random State Approach to Quantum Computation of Electronic-Structure Properties
Authors: Yiran Bai, Feng Xiong, Xueheng Kuang
Abstract: Classical computation of electronic properties in large-scale materials remains challenging. Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state quantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating electronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on quantum computers.

Title: Hybrid Quantum Systems: Coupling Single-Molecule Magnet Qudits with Industrial Silicon Spin Qubits
Authors: Daniel Schroller, Daniel Sitter, Thomas Koch, Viktor Adam, Noah Glaeser, Clement Godfrin, Stefan Kubicek, Julien Jussot, Roger Loo, Yosuke Shimura, Danny Wan, Yaorong Chen, Mario Ruben, Kristiaan De Greve, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer
Abstract: Molecular spin qudits offer an attractive platform for quantum memory, combining long coherence times with rich multi-level spin structures. Terbium bis(phthalocyaninato) (TbPc$_2$) exemplifies such systems, with demonstrated quantum control and chemical reproducibility. In hybrid quantum architectures, TbPc$_2$ can act as the primary memory element, with semiconductor qubits providing scalable readout and coupling. Here we present a step toward such a hybrid system: using an industrially manufactured silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) spin qubit to detect electronic spin transitions of an ensemble of TbPc$_2$ molecules. The readout is based on a compact and robust protocol that applies a microwave pulse while all gate voltages defining the qubit are held at a fixed operating point. This protocol, which combines simultaneous Rapid adiabatic Passage and Spin- Selective tunneling (RPSS), enables high-contrast resonance detection and avoids repeated $\pi$-pulse recalibration common in decoupling schemes. By demonstrating ensemble detection, we establish a foundation for integrating molecular quantum memories with industrial qubit platforms and mark an important step toward single-molecule hybrid quantum technologies.

Title: Quasiparticle pairing encoding of atomic nuclei for quantum annealing
Authors: Emanuele Costa, Axel Pérez-Obiol, Javier Menéndez, Arnau Rios, Artur García-Sáez, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a promising tool in nuclear physics. However, the cost of encoding fermionic operators hampers the application of algorithms in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we analyze an encoding scheme based on pairing nucleon modes. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of the encoding, while maintaining a high accuracy for the ground states of semimagic nuclei across the $sd$ and $pf$ shells and for tin isotopes. In addition, we also explore the encoding ability to describe open-shell nuclei within the above configuration spaces. When this scheme is applied to a trotterized quantum adiabatic evolution, our results demonstrate a computational advantage of up to three orders of magnitude in CNOT gate count compared to the standard Jordan-Wigner encoding. Our approach paves the way for efficient quantum simulations of nuclear structure using quantum annealing, with applications to both digital and hybrid quantum computing platforms.

Title: Time-diffracting 2D wave vortices
Authors: Boris A. Khanikati, Konstantin Y. Bliokh
Abstract: Wave vortices constitute a large family of wave entities, closely related to phase singularities and orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, two main classes of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i) transversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined longitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract in space, and (ii) 2D-localized spatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted) OAM and propagate/diffract in both space and time. Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely in time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, as well as examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices.

Title: Defect-driven incoherent skin localization
Authors: Emmanouil T. Kokkinakis, Konstantinos G. Makris, Eleftherios N. Economou
Abstract: The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.

Title: Amplified Directional Photoluminescence from CIS Quantum Dots and hBN Quantum Emitters using Tunable BIC Metasurfaces
Authors: Omar A. M. Abdelraouf
Abstract: Integrated and tunable light sources are critical for advancing quantum nanophotonic chips in quantum computing, communications, and sensing. However, efficient and tunable emission amplification post-fabrication poses major challenges. Hybrid metasurfaces combining niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), copper indium sulfide (CIS) quantum dots or hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) as a low-loss phase-change material offer a compelling solution for dynamic control and amplification of photoluminescence and quantum light emission. In this work, we report an active hybrid metasurface supporting tunable bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances in the visible regime, achieving experimental Q-factors up to 206 and strong amplification of CIS QDs photoluminescence as well as quantum light emission of hBN single-photon emitters. The metasurface enables BIC resonance shifts of 33.5 nm in the visible spectrum via phase transition of Sb2S3, and 17 nm through dimensional parametric tuning. We experimentally demonstrate highly directional photoluminescence amplification up to 33-fold, alongside broad tunable amplified PL emission upon Sb2S3 phase modulation. Furthermore, we propose amplified, tunable, and on-demand strong coupling of hBN single-photon emitters with the tunable BIC metasurface for next-generation broadband quantum nanophotonic chips. This work sets a new benchmark in reconfigurable nanophotonic platforms for efficient quantum light sources in integrated photonic systems.

Title: Time domain braiding of anyons revealed through a nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation theorem
Authors: Ines Safi
Abstract: We derive a novel fluctuation--dissipation theorem (FDT) valid for nonequilibrium initial states that imprint the braiding of anyons in the time domain. The derivation is carried out within the Unifying Nonequilibrium Perturbative Theory (UNEPT), which applies to both standard reservoir geometries and configurations with one or two quantum point contacts (QPCs) injecting dilute anyonic fluxes. Based on this FDT, we propose complementary methods to determine the time-domain braiding phase. The first method relates the DC backscattering noise to the integral of the current with respect to DC drives, while the second connects the AC current phase shift to the DC noise. The latter provides a particularly robust probe of the statistical angle $\theta$, offering an intrinsic calibration and cancelling certain nonuniversal renormalization effects. Specializing to a thermalized Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL), we further show that in the quantum regime the phase shift enables a direct determination of the scaling dimension $\delta$ when $\delta > 1/2$. These results define experimentally accessible schemes to extract either $\theta$ or $\delta$ in minimal single-QPC setups, without relying on interferometry or cross-correlation measurements.

Abstract: The spectral and statistical properties are explored for surface plasmon (SP) emission in resonance fluorescence from a driven two level emitter in the proximity of 2D single graphene sheet. We derive expressions for the emitted SP field and spectrum function that depend on the graphene conductivity and take into account the controllable parameters of the graphene system. We present analysis for the spectrum and second order coherence functions and discuss the possibility of their control using graphene system parameters to manipulate the spectral linewidth and coherence.

Title: On the Capacity of Distributed Quantum Storage
Authors: Hua Sun, Syed A. Jafar
Abstract: A distributed quantum storage code maps a quantum message to N storage nodes, of arbitrary specified sizes, such that the stored message is robust to an arbitrary specified set of erasure patterns. The sizes of the storage nodes, and erasure patterns may not be homogeneous. The capacity of distributed quantum storage is the maximum feasible size of the quantum message (relative to the sizes of the storage nodes), when the scaling of the size of the message and all storage nodes by the same scaling factor is allowed. Representing the decoding sets as hyperedges in a storage graph, the capacity is characterized for various graphs, including MDS graph, wheel graph, Fano graph, and intersection graph. The achievability is related via quantum CSS codes to a classical secure storage problem. Remarkably, our coding schemes utilize non-trivial alignment structures to ensure recovery and security in the corresponding classical secure storage problem, which leads to similarly non-trivial quantum codes. The converse is based on quantum information inequalities, e.g., strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity of quantum entropy, tailored to the topology of the storage graphs.

Title: Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases
Authors: Santhosh M, Jorge Dukelsky, Gerardo Ortiz
Abstract: We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.

Title: Spinning into Quantum Geometry: Dirac and Wheeler-DeWitt Dynamics from Stochastic Helicity
Authors: Partha Nandi, Partha Ghose, Francesco Petruccione
Abstract: Spin networks in loop quantum gravity provide a kinematical picture of quantum geometry but lack a natural mechanism for dynamical Dirac-type evolution, while the Wheeler--DeWitt equation typically enters only as an imposed constraint. We propose a stochastic framework in which each spin-network edge carries helicity-resolved amplitudes -- two-state internal labels that undergo Poisson-driven flips. The resulting coupled master equations, after analytic continuation and the introduction of a fundamental length scale, generate Dirac-type dynamics on discrete geometry. At long times, the same process relaxes to helicity-symmetric equilibrium states, which are shown to satisfy a Wheeler--DeWitt-type condition. In this way, both quantum evolution and the gravitational constraint emerge within a single probabilistic framework. Our approach thus provides a background-independent and stochastic route to quantum geometry, offering an alternative to canonical quantization and a fresh perspective on the problem of time.

Title: Detecting gravitational waves with spin systems
Authors: Jiamin Liang, Mingqiu Li, Yu Gao, Wei Ji, Sichun Sun, Qi-Shu Yan
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves has opened a new window into the Universe through gravitational-wave astronomy. However, high-frequency gravitational waves remain undetected. In this work, we propose that spin systems can be employed to detect gravitational waves in this unexplored frequency regime. We derive the spin's response to gravitational waves and identify three distinct effects: the well-known Gertsenshtein effect, a metric-induced interaction, and the gravitational spin Hall effect. We focus on nuclear spins and utilize nuclear magnetic resonance to enhance the gravitational response, leveraging the advantages of long coherence time, high polarization, and a small gyromagnetic ratio. The proposed experimental scheme is capable of probing gravitational waves in the kilohertz to gigahertz range, with projected sensitivities reaching $\sqrt{S_h}\approx10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$.

Title: A novel quantum memory effect and thermal modulation in graviton-mediated entanglement
Authors: Mainak Dutta, Partha Nandi, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: A central challenge in probing the quantum nature of gravity is to distinguish effects that are genuinely quantum from those that can be explained classically. In this work, we study how quantized gravitational waves interact with thermal quantum systems, modeled as harmonic oscillators. We show that, unlike classical waves, quantized gravitons generate entanglement and leave behind a persistent ``graviton-induced quantum memory'' even after the wave has passed. This effect is further shaped by the presence of thermal noise, which does not simply wash out quantum correlations but can in fact amplify them in distinctive ways. Our analysis reveals clear signatures - such as nonlinear thermal corrections and a prethermal time-crystal-like phase-that cannot arise from any classical treatment. These results identify experimentally relevant markers of gravitons and provide a framework for exploring how finite-temperature environments may help uncover the quantum nature of gravity.

Title: Quantum chaos and semiclassical behavior in mushroom billiards II: Structure of quantum eigenstates and their phase space localization properties
Authors: Matic Orel, Marko Robnik
Abstract: We investigate eigenstate localization in the phase space of the Bunimovich mushroom billiard, a paradigmatic mixed-phase-space system whose piecewise-$C^{1}$ boundary yields a single clean separatrix between one regular and one chaotic region. By varying the stem half-width $w$, we continuously change the strength and extent of bouncing-ball stickiness in the stem, which for narrow stems gives rise to phase space localization of chaotic eigenstates. Using the Poincaré-Husimi (PH) representation of eigenstates we quantify localization via information entropies and inverse participation ratios of PH functions. For sufficiently wide stems the distribution of entropy localization measures converges to a two-parameter beta distribution, while entropy localization measures and inverse participation ratios across the chaotic ensemble exhibit an approximately linear relationship. Finally, the fraction of mixed (neither purely regular nor fully chaotic) eigenstates decays as a power-law in the effective semiclassical parameter, in precise agreement with the Principle of Uniform Semiclassical Condensation of Wigner functions (PUSC).

Abstract: This paper analyzes the numerical approximation of the Lindblad master equation on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Using \textit{a priori} estimates, we derive explicit convergence rates and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through examples motivated by autonomous quantum error correction.

Title: HUGR: A Quantum-Classical Intermediate Representation
Authors: Mark Koch, Agustín Borgna, Seyon Sivarajah, Alan Lawrence, Alec Edgington, Douglas Wilson, Craig Roy, Luca Mondada, Lukas Heidemann, Ross Duncan
Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Unified Graph Representation (HUGR): a novel graph based intermediate representation for mixed quantum-classical programs. HUGR's design features high expressivity and extensibility to capture the capabilities of near-term and forthcoming quantum computing devices, as well as new and evolving abstractions from novel quantum programming paradigms. The graph based structure is machine-friendly and supports powerful pattern matching based compilation techniques. Inspired by MLIR, HUGR's extensibility further allows compilation tooling to reason about programs at multiple levels of abstraction, lowering smoothly between them. Safety guarantees in the structure including strict, static typing and linear quantum types allow rapid development of compilation tooling without fear of program invalidation. A full specification of HUGR and reference implementation are open-source and available online.

Title: A minimal and universal representation of fermionic wavefunctions (fermions = bosons + one)
Authors: Liang Fu
Abstract: Representing fermionic wavefunctions efficiently is a central problem in quantum physics, chemistry and materials science. In this work, we introduce a universal and exact representation of continuous antisymmetric functions by lifting them to continuous symmetric functions defined on an enlarged space. Building on this lifting, we obtain a \emph{parity-graded representation} of fermionic wavefunctions, expressed in terms of symmetric feature variables that encode particle configuration and antisymmetric feature variables that encode exchange statistics. This representation is both exact and minimal: the number of required features scales as $D\sim N^d$ ($d$ is spatial dimension) or $D\sim N$ depending on the symmetric feature maps employed. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for efficient representations of fermionic wavefunctions and enable scalable and systematically improvable neural network solvers for many-electron systems.

Title: Intermediate chiral edge states in quantum Hall Josephson junctions
Authors: Partha Sarathi Banerjee, Rahul Marathe, Sankalpa Ghosh
Abstract: A transfer-matrix-based theoretical framework is developed to study transport in superconductor-quantum Hall-Superconductor (SQHS) Josephson junctions modulated by local potential barriers in the quantum-Hall regime. The method allows one to evaluate the change in the conductivity of such SQHS Josephson junctions contributed by the intermediate chiral edge states (ICES) induced by these local potential barriers at their electrostatic boundaries at specific electron filling-fractions. It is particularly demonstrated how these ICES created at different Landau levels (LL) overlap with each other through intra- and inter-LL ICES mixing with the change in strength and width of the potential barriers. This results in different mechanisms for forming Landau bands when an array of such potential barriers are present. It is also demonstrated that our theoretical framework can be extended to study the lattice effect in a bounded domain in such SQHS Josephson junctions by simultaneously submitting the normal region to a transverse magnetic field and periodic potential.

Title: Astigmatism-free 3D Optical Tweezer Control for Rapid Atom Rearrangement
Authors: Yue-Hui Lu, Nathan Song, Tai Xiang, Jacquelyn Ho, Tsai-Chen Lee, Zhenjie Yan, Dan M. Stamper-Kurn
Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms are a leading platform for quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 136 $\mu$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.

Title: Efficient and accurate tensor network algorithm for Anderson impurity problems
Authors: Zhijie Sun, Zhenyu Li, Chu Guo
Abstract: The Anderson impurity model (AIM) is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics to study strongly correlated effects. However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension $\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\chi$ as $2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required $\chi$s are much smaller than the worst case.

Title: Scalable Quantum Monte Carlo Method for Polariton Chemistry via Mixed Block Sparsity and Tensor Hypercontraction Method
Authors: Yu Zhang
Abstract: We present a reduced-scaling auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework designed for large molecular systems and ensembles, with or without coupling to optical cavities. Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.

Title: The Quantum Multiple-Access Channel with Cribbing Encoders
Authors: Uzi Pereg, Christian Deppe, Holger Boche
Abstract: Communication over a quantum multiple-access channel (MAC) with cribbing encoders is considered, whereby Transmitter 2 performs a measurement on a system that is entangled with Transmitter 1. Based on the no-cloning theorem, perfect cribbing is impossible. This leads to the introduction of a MAC model with noisy cribbing. In the causal and non-causal cribbing scenarios, Transmitter 2 performs the measurement before the input of Transmitter 1 is sent through the channel. Hence, Transmitter 2's cribbing may inflict a "state collapse" for Transmitter 1. Achievable regions are derived for each setting. Furthermore, a regularized capacity characterization is established for robust cribbing, i.e. when the cribbing system contains all the information of the channel input. Building on the analogy between the noisy cribbing model and the relay channel, a partial decode-forward region is derived for a quantum MAC with non-robust cribbing. For the classical-quantum MAC with cribbing encoders, the capacity region is determined with perfect cribbing of the classical input, and a cutset region is derived for noisy cribbing. In the special case of a classical-quantum MAC with a deterministic cribbing channel, the inner and outer bounds coincide.

Title: No-local-broadcasting theorem for non-signalling behaviours and assemblages
Authors: Adrian Solymos, Carlos Vieira, Cristhiano Duarte, Zoltán Zimborás
Abstract: The no-broadcasting theorem is a fundamental result in quantum information theory. It guarantees that a class of attacks on quantum protocols, based on eavesdropping and indiscriminate copying of quantum information, are impossible. Due to its fundamental importance, it is natural to ask whether it is an intrinsic quantum property or whether it also holds for a broader class of non-classical theories. To address this question, one could use the framework of correlation scenarios. Under this standpoint, Joshi, Grudka, and Horodecki$^{\otimes 4}$ conjectured that one cannot locally broadcast nonlocal behaviours. In this paper, we prove their conjecture based on the monotonicity of the relative entropy for behaviours. Additionally, following a similar reasoning, we obtain an analogous no-go theorem for steerable assemblages.

Title: Local Inaccessibility of Random Classical Information and Their Implications in the Change Point Problem
Authors: Snehasish Roy Chowdhury, Subhendu B. Ghosh, Tathagata Gupta, Anandamay Das Bhowmik, Sutapa Saha, Some Sankar Bhattacharya, Tamal Guha
Abstract: Discrimination of quantum states under local operations and classical communication (LOCC) is an intriguing question in the context of local retrieval of classical information, encoded in the multipartite quantum systems. All the local quantum state discrimination premises, considered so far, mimic a basic communication set-up, where the spatially separated decoding devices are independent of any additional input. Here, exploring a generalized communication scenario, we introduce a framework for input-dependent local quantum state discrimination, which we call local random authentication (LRA). We report that impossibility of LRA certifies the presence of entangled states in the ensemble, a feature absent from erstwhile nonlocality arguments based on local state discrimination. Additionally, we explore the salient features of this state discrimination prototype for arbitrary set of orthogonal quantum states and compare them with the traditional notion of local quantum state discrimination. Finally, our results reveal a fundamental information-theoretic implications in the local estimation of quantum change point problems.

Title: Quantum Lower Bounds by Sample-to-Query Lifting
Authors: Qisheng Wang, Zhicheng Zhang
Abstract: The polynomial method by Beals, Buhrman, Cleve, Mosca, and de Wolf (FOCS 1998, J. ACM 2001), the adversary method by Ambainis (STOC 2000, J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 2002), and the compressed oracle method by Zhandry (CRYPTO 2019) have been shown to be powerful in proving quantum query lower bounds for a wide variety of problems. In this paper, we propose a new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results: 1. A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination. Here, the sample complexity is measured given sample access to the quantum state to be tested, while the query complexity is measured given query access to an oracle that block-encodes the quantum state. 2. A matching lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\beta)$ for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature $\beta$, showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by Gilyén, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019) is optimal. 3. A new lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for the entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, which was recently studied by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023). 4. A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015, Comm. Math. Phys. 2021). In addition, we also provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.

Title: Optimal Convergence Rate of Lie-Trotter Approximation for Quantum Thermal Averages
Authors: Xuda Ye, Zhennan Zhou
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.

Title: The discrete adiabatic quantum linear system solver has lower constant factors than the randomized adiabatic solver
Authors: Pedro C.S. Costa, Dong An, Ryan Babbush, Dominic Berry
Abstract: The solution of linear systems of equations is the basis of many other quantum algorithms, and recent results provided an algorithm with optimal scaling in both the condition number $\kappa$ and the allowable error $\epsilon$ [PRX Quantum \textbf{3}, 040303 (2022)]. That work was based on the discrete adiabatic theorem, and worked out an explicit constant factor for an upper bound on the complexity. Here we show via numerical testing on random matrices that the constant factor is in practice about 1,200 times smaller than the upper bound found numerically in the previous results. That means that this approach is far more efficient than might naively be expected from the upper bound. In particular, it is about an order of magnitude more efficient than using a randomised approach from [arXiv:2305.11352] that claimed to be more efficient.

Title: Error Correction in Dynamical Codes
Authors: Esther Xiaozhen Fu, Daniel Gottesman
Abstract: We ask what is the general framework for a quantum error correcting code that is defined by a sequence of measurements. Recently, there has been much interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.

Title: Lossless Postselected Quantum Metrology with Quasi-pure Mixed States
Authors: Jing Yang
Abstract: Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.

Title: Family of Exact and Inexact Quantum Speed Limits for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving Dynamics
Authors: Abhay Srivastav, Vivek Pandey, Brij Mohan, Arun Kumar Pati
Abstract: Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space are generally unattainable for a wide class of dynamics and it is difficult to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we present two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty relations for operators acting on Liouville space, and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. We also obtain the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal CPTP dynamics that connect the given initial and target states. To illustrate our findings, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. In another important application, we show that our results can help us understand the counter-intuitive phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics, as the minimal relaxation time scale obtained by speed limits is dictated by the eigenmodes of the Liouvillian.

Title: Entanglement-assisted authenticated BB84 protocol
Authors: Pol Julià Farré, Vladlen Galetsky, Soham Ghosh, Janis Nötzel, Christian Deppe
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel authenticated Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol employing maximally entangled qubit pairs. In the absence of noise, we securely authenticate the well-known BB84 QKD scheme under two assumptions: first, adversaries cannot simultaneously access preshared and non-pre-shared secret classical information, and second, adversaries cannot simultaneously access pre-shared secret classical information and quantum memories held by legitimate parties. The main strength of this noiseless result is that access to all secretly pre-shared classical information is insufficient for breaching our scheme. Additionally, our protocol desirably allows for pre-shared secrecy reusage, leading to secret key growing. In order to address noise, we simulate a photonic implementation of our scheme, together with a storage model that aims to replicate the performance of cavity-enhanced Atomic- Frequency Comb (AFC) memories. Two methods are used to distinguish authentic entities from forgery attempts: on the one hand, a statistical approach is used after calibration of its defining parameter $\mu$. Alternatively, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is designed and trained to learn the underlying different structure of that input data coming from adversaries in comparison to that one coming from legitimate parties. Both methods achieve a correct classification rate larger than 0.80 for memory storage time of 150 $\mu$s and a 1 km distance between parties.

Title: Symmetry-induced failures of tomographic locality: Constructing foil theories by twirling
Authors: Daniel Centeno, Marco Erba, Thomas D. Galley, David Schmid, John H. Selby, Robert W. Spekkens, Sina Soltani, Jacopo Surace, Alex Wilce, Yìlè Yīng
Abstract: Tomographic locality is a principle commonly used in the program of finding axioms that pick out quantum theory within the landscape of possible theories. The principle asserts the sufficiency of local measurements for achieving a tomographic characterization of any bipartite state. In this work, we explore the meaning of the principle of tomographic locality by developing a simple scheme for generating a wide variety of theories that violate the principle. In this scheme, one starts with a tomographically local theory -- which can be classical, quantum or post-quantum -- and a physical symmetry, and one restricts the processes in the theory to all and only those that are covariant with respect to the collective action of that symmetry. We refer to the resulting theories as twirled worlds. We show that failures of tomographic locality are ubiquitous in twirled worlds. From the possibility of such failures in classical twirled worlds, we argue that the failure of tomographic locality (i.e., tomographic nonlocality) does not imply ontological holism. Our results also demonstrate the need for researchers seeking to axiomatize quantum theory to take a stand on the question of whether there are superselection rules that have a fundamental status.

Title: Quantum-private distributed sensing
Authors: Joseph Ho, Jonathan W. Webb, Russell M. J. Brooks, Federico Grasselli, Erik Gauger, Alessandro Fedrizzi
Abstract: Quantum networks can enhance both security and privacy conditions for multi-user communication, delegated computation, and distributed sensing tasks. An example quantum protocol is private parameter estimation (PPE) where only the aggregate information is accessible while individual sensor data remain confidential. Specifically, the protocol enables the estimation of a global function of remote sensor parameters without revealing local parameters to any entity. We implement the PPE protocol by distributing a three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, among three sensors, which is verified using stabilizer measurements to establish privacy and precision bounds for the sensing task. We demonstrate Heisenberg-limited precision scaling of the global parameter while suppressing the metrological information of the local parameters by up to three orders of magnitude. This work, which integrates privacy in distributed quantum sensing, marks a crucial step towards developing advanced quantum-secure-and-private protocols in complex quantum networks.

Title: H-DES: a Quantum-Classical Hybrid Differential Equation Solver
Authors: Hamza Jaffali, Jonas Bastos de Araujo, Nadia Milazzo, Marta Reina, Henri de Boutray, Karla Baumann, Frédéric Holweck, Youcef Mohdeb, Roland Katz
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an original hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on a variational quantum algorithm for solving systems of differential equations. The algorithm relies on a spectral decomposition of the trial functions that are encoded directly in the quantum states generated by different parametrized circuits, and transforms the task of solving the differential equations into an optimization problem. We first describe the principle of the algorithm from a theoretical point of view. We provide a detailed pseudo-code of the algorithm, on which we elaborate preliminary elements for a complexity analysis to highlight some of its scaling properties. We apply our algorithm to a set of examples, running on emulators and real hardware showcasing its applicability across diverse sets of differential equations. We discuss the advantages of our method and potential avenues for further exploration and refinement.

Title: Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving
Authors: András Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through exponentially small gaps. First, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving a fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging. Extending our investigation to realistic NP-hard spin-glass problems -- specifically, the $3$-regular \textsc{Max Cut} and $3$-\textsc{XORSAT} -- we find again that local CD expansions lead to negligible improvements in the final ground state fidelity. These results highlight the limited impact of local CD methods in overcoming the bottlenecks associated with first-order quantum phase transitions. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which employs the approximate full CD connecting the ground state and the first excited state at a single parameter value close to the critical point. In the minimal spin-glass model, QBCD enables exponentially faster adiabatic evolution than the local strategies. To alleviate the challenges of its experimental and classical implementation for realistic \textsc{NP}-hard problems, we exponentially reduce the non-locality of the QBCD Hamiltonian by sparsifying its matrix elements to the density of the local expansions. Despite this drastic simplification, sparsified QBCD maintains finite ground-state fidelity at driving times exponentially shorter than in local strategies and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).

Title: Fundamental precision limits in finite-dimensional quantum thermal machines
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost. This notion was recently formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which states that the lower bound on the relative variance of thermodynamic currents decreases as entropy production increases. From another viewpoint, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the lower bound on the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. This indicates that physical constraints impose precision limits on the system, independent of its dynamics. In this study, we derive fundamental precision limits, dynamics-independent bounds on the relative variance and the expectations of observables for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. These bounds are set by quantities such as dimensions and energy bandwidth, which depend only on the initial configuration and are independent of the dynamics. Using a quantum battery model, the fundamental precision limits show that there is a trade-off between the amount of energy storage and the charging precision. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence affects these fundamental limits, demonstrating that the presence of coherence can improve the precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.

Title: Reduction-induced Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy
Authors: Jing-Min Zhu
Abstract: TThe organization and structure of bipartite mixed-state quantum entanglement (QE) are more complex and less well understood compared to bipartite pure-state QE. Bipartite mixed-state QEs and their measures play a crucial role in both theory and practical applications. Some existing measures involve quantifying the minimum QE and reflect the inherently complex nature of their computation, while others are only applicable to highly limited-dimensional quantum systems. In this context, we propose a method termed Reduction-induced Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy to quantify QE in any bipartite states, particularly focusing on bipartite mixed states. Partial Von Neumann Entropy is merely a special case of this method,Its intuitive and clear physical representation, along with easy computation and wide applicability, facilitates exploring its potential applications. Furthermore, we present examples to demonstrate the superiorities of this method in identifying bipartite QE by comparing with other existing bipartite mixed-state QE measures through both their physical implications and mathematical structures.

Title: Unraveling the switching dynamics in a quantum double-well potential
Authors: Qile Su, Rodrigo G. Cortiñas, Jayameenakshi Venkatraman, Shruti Puri
Abstract: The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a double-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and chemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily with the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent experiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called the Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator), whose energy barrier can be increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude increases, the switching rate exhibits a step-like decrease termed the "staircase". The view challenged by the experiment demands a deep review of our understanding of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we derive a semi-analytical formula for the switching rate that resolves a continuous transition between tunneling- and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two dynamics are observed respectively in the flat and the steep parts of each step in the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that limit tunneling: dephasing and decay. This allows us to predict the critical drive amplitudes where steps occur. In addition, we show that in the regime of a few states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited states are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating rather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, however, the perturbation induced by the nonhermitian Hamiltonian becomes important and facilitates a new form of quantum heating. We numerically map the activation mechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our theory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable quantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between tunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated transitions.

Title: Spin Environment of a Superconducting Qubit in High Magnetic Fields
Authors: S. Günzler, J. Beck, D. Rieger, N. Gosling, N. Zapata, M. Field, S. Geisert, A. Bacher, J. K. Hohmann, M. Spiecker, W. Wernsdorfer, I. M. Pop
Abstract: Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolition readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of MHz range fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.

Title: Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling
Authors: Emma C. King, Moritz Linnebacher, Peter P. Orth, Matteo Rizzi, Giovanna Morigi
Abstract: A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d>4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0<\alpha<3d/2$. For $\alpha<d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d<\alpha<d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s>4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.

Title: Flexible manipulation of bipartite and multipartite EPR steerings
Authors: Yunyun Liang, Jing Zhang, Rongguo Yang, Tiancai Zhang, Jiangrui Gao
Abstract: Bipartite and multipartite quantum steerings are significant resources for various quantum tasks, such as ultrasecure multi-user quantum network, one-site-trusted quantum communication, high-fidelity quantum computation, etc. A flexible steering manipulation scheme of five down-converted Hermitian Gaussian modes generated from an optical parametric oscillator by using a spatial structured pump is presented. In our scheme, not only the direction and types of the bipartite steering, but also different situations of multipartite steering, can be manipulated effectively, by adjusting the pump proportions with a spatial light modulator. In addition, stricter genuine pentapartite steering (only one site is trusted) can also be achieved by making the pump proportions as balanced as possible. Our scheme is versatile and experimentally feasible and offers new insights into the manipulation of steering, especially multipartite steering, which is valuable in many special quantum tasks.

Title: Quantum function secret sharing
Authors: Alex B. Grilo, Ramis Movassagh
Abstract: We propose a quantum function secret sharing scheme in which the communication is exclusively classical. In this primitive, a classical dealer distributes a secret quantum circuit $C$ by providing shares to $p$ quantum parties. The parties on an input state $\ket{\psi}$ and a projection $\Pi$, compute values $y_i$ that they then classically communicate back to the dealer, who can then compute $\lVert \Pi C|\psi\rangle\rVert^2$ using only classical resources. Moreover, the shares do not leak much information about the secret circuit $C$. Our protocol for quantum secret sharing uses the {\em Cayley path}, a tool that has been extensively used to support quantum primacy claims. More concretely, the shares of $C$ correspond to randomized version of $C$ which are delegated to the quantum parties, and the reconstruction can be done by extrapolation. Our scheme has two limitations, which we prove to be inherent to our techniques: First, our scheme is only secure against single adversaries, and we show that if two parties collude, then they can break its security. Second, the evaluation done by the parties requires exponential time in the number of gates.

Title: The Quantum Measurement Problem: A Review of Recent Trends
Authors: Anderson A. Tomaz, Rafael S. Mattos, Mario Barbatti
Abstract: Left on its own, a quantum state evolves deterministically under the Schrödinger Equation, forming superpositions. Upon measurement, however, a stochastic process governed by the Born rule collapses it to a single outcome. This dual evolution of quantum states -- the core of the Measurement Problem -- has puzzled physicists and philosophers for nearly a century. Yet, amid the cacophony of competing interpretations, the problem today is not as impenetrable as it once seemed. This paper reviews the current status of the Measurement Problem, distinguishing between what is well understood and what remains unresolved. We examine key theoretical approaches, including decoherence, many-worlds interpretation, objective collapse theories, hidden-variable theories, dualistic approaches, deterministic models, and epistemic interpretations. To make these discussions accessible to a broader audience, we also reference curated online resources that provide high-quality introductions to central concepts.

Title: Enhancing quantum computations with the synergy of auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo and computational basis tomography
Authors: Viktor Khinevich, Wataru Mizukami
Abstract: We introduce QC-CBT-AFQMC, a hybrid algorithm that incorporates computational basis tomography (CBT) into the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) method proposed by Huggins et al. [Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)], replacing the use of classical shadows. While the original QC-AFQMC showed high accuracy for quantum chemistry calculations, it required exponentially costly post-processing. Subsequent work using Matchgate shadows [Commun. Math. Phys. 404, 629 (2023)] improved scalability, but still suffers from prohibitive computational requirements that limit practical applications. Our QC-CBT-AFQMC approach uses shallow Clifford circuits with a quadratic reduction of two-qubit gates over the original algorithm, significantly reducing computational requirements and enabling accurate calculations under limited measurement budgets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and nitrogen molecule, producing potential energy curves that closely match established benchmarks. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques. These results highlight QC-CBT-AFQMC as a practical quantum-classical hybrid method that bridges the capabilities of quantum devices and accurate chemical simulations.

Title: Entanglement dynamics via Geometric phases in Trapped-ions
Authors: Dharmaraj Ramachandran, Ganesh Hanchanahal, Radhika Vathsan
Abstract: Trapped-ion systems are a leading platform for quantum computing. The Mølmer-Sørensen (MS) gate is a widely used method for implementing controlled interactions in multipartite systems. However, due to unavoidable interactions with the environment, quantum states undergo non-unitary evolution, leading to significant deviations from ideal dynamics. Common techniques such as Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) and Bell State Tomography (BST) are typically employed to evaluate MS gate performance and to characterize noise in the system. In this letter, we propose leveraging the geometric phase as a tool for performance assessment and noise identification in the MS gate. Our findings indicate that the geometric phase is particularly sensitive to environmental noise occurring around twice the clock pulse time. Given that geometric phase measurements do not require full-state tomography, this approach offers a practical and experimentally feasible method to detect entanglement and classify the nature of noise affecting the system.

Title: Single-particle entanglement dynamics in complex systems
Authors: Devanshu Shekhar, Pragya Shukla
Abstract: We analyze the effect of varying system conditions on the single-particle entanglement entropy for an arbitrary eigenstate of a complex system that can be described by a multiparametric Gaussian ensemble. Our theoretical analysis leads to the identification of a single functional of the system parameters that governs the entropy dynamics. This reveals a sensitivity of the entropy to collective information content, characterized by the functional, instead of the individual system details. The functional can further be used to identify the universality classes as well as a deep web of connection underlying different quantum states.

Abstract: Optical downconversion is widely used for generating photon pairs, squeezed and entangled states of light, making it an indispensable tool in quantum optics and quantum information. In the regime where the pump is much stronger than the generated field, the standard parametric approximation treats the pump amplitude as a fixed parameter of the model. This approximation has a limited domain of validity since it assumes a non-depleted and non-entangled pump. By finding an approximate solution to the Schrödinger equation of the downconversion process, we obtain an improved analytical model beyond the parametric one, which accounts for pump depletion and pump-signal entanglement. The new model is advantageous, first, because it allows one to compute averages of field operators far beyond the domain of validity of the parametric approximation, and second, because it allows one to establish error-specific limits of the latter domain. For a given pump amplitude, we find a maximum squeezing parameter, up to which the approximation remains valid within a specified acceptable error. Our results confirm that recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling, with a squeezing parameter of $r\approx 1.8$ and a coherent pump amplitude of $\alpha\approx 2\cdot10^6$, can still be accurately described by the standard parametric approximation. However, we observe a sharp decline in validity as the squeezing parameter increases. For pump amplitudes of $\alpha \approx 2\cdot10^6$, the parametric approximation breaks down when the squeezing parameter exceeds $r\approx 4.5$, whereas the new approximation remains valid up to $r\approx 6$ with an acceptable error of 1%.

Title: Dynamically stable two-mode squeezing in cavity optomechanics
Authors: Chen Wang, Shi-fan Qi
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme in a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, where a mechanical resonator couples to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through diagonalization of the full system's transition matrix in the Heisenberg picture. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the framework of open quantum system. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unsteady system states. Remarkably, the squeezing level can exceed the maximum achievable under system stability conditions. Furthermore, we show that our protocol is robust against systematic errors in both driving intensity and frequency, as well as against thermal Markovian noises. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.

Title: QAMA: Scalable Quantum Annealing Multi-Head Attention Operator for Deep Learning
Authors: Peng Du, Jinjing Shi, Wenxuan Wang, Yin Ma, Kai Wen, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin modern deep learning, while the quadratic time and space complexity limit scalability for long sequences. To address this, Quantum Annealing Multi-Head Attention (QAMA) is proposed, a novel drop-in operator that reformulates attention as an energy-based Hamiltonian optimization problem. In this framework, token interactions are encoded into binary quadratic terms, and quantum annealing is employed to search for low-energy configurations that correspond to effective attention patterns. Unlike classical sparse or approximate attention methods that rely on hand-crafted heuristics, QAMA allows sparsity structures to emerge naturally from the optimization process. Theoretically, computational complexity is analysed through single-spin flip dynamics, providing time to solution runtime bounds that depend on the spectral properties of the annealing Hamiltonian. Empirically, evaluation on both natural language and vision benchmarks shows that, across tasks, accuracy deviates by at most 2.7 points from standard multi-head attention, while requiring only linear qubits in sequence length. Visualizations further reveal that the Hamiltonian penalty terms induce meaningful and interpretable sparsity across heads. Finally, deployment on a coherent Ising machine validates the feasibility of running QAMA on real quantum hardware, showing tangible inference-time reductions compared with classical implementations. These results highlight QAMA as a pioneering and scalable step toward integrating quantum optimization devices into deep neural architectures, providing a seamlessly integrable and hardware-compatible alternative to conventional attention mechanisms.

Title: Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination
Authors: Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining an optimal characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric Rényi and Petz Rényi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.

Title: Provably faster randomized and quantum algorithms for $k$-means clustering via uniform sampling
Authors: Tyler Chen, Archan Ray, Akshay Seshadri, Dylan Herman, Bao Bach, Pranav Deshpande, Abhishek Som, Niraj Kumar, Marco Pistoia
Abstract: The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [q-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning, Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Cornelissen, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang, QTML 2025]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We demonstrate that the worst case guarantees of these algorithms can significantly improve upon the bounds for algorithms in prior work. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.

Title: Quantum Transduction: Enabling Quantum Networking
Authors: Marcello Caleffi, Laura d'Avossa, Xu Han, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti
Abstract: The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. For communication at distances beyond a few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as a quantum transducer, capable of converting one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide the reader with a tutorial overview of the fundamental research challenges underlying quantum transduction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this tutorial is the first work addressing quantum transduction from a communications engineering perspective, highlighting its fundamental role within quantum network design and deployment. This analysis reveals that there exist different transduction modalities, including an unorthodox one allowing a transducer to act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in communication performance. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.

Title: Quantum Teleportation in Non-equilibrium Environments and Fixed-point Fidelity
Authors: Xiaokun Yan, Zhihai Wang, Kun Zhang, Jin Wang
Abstract: Quantum teleportation, a fundamental protocol in quantum information science, enables the transfer of quantum states through entangled particle pairs and classical communication channels. While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in non-equilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We apply the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics. In both bosonic and fermionic setups, the fidelity can be enhanced beyond the equilibrium values. Under specific non-equilibrium conditions, the fidelities of all input states are identical. We call it teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Notably, at the fixed-point, fidelity can also be enhanced by combining the two detuned qubits and non-equilibrium environments. These findings provide important guidance for implementing quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, while the fixed-point mechanism offers a promising pathway toward simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.

Title: Benchmarking Quantum Architecture Search with Surrogate Assistance
Authors: Darya Martyniuk, Johannes Jung, Daniel Barta, Adrian Paschke
Abstract: The development of quantum algorithms and their practical applications currently relies heavily on the efficient design, compilation, and optimization of quantum circuits. In particular, parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), which serve as the basis for variational quantum algorithms~(VQAs), demand carefully engineered architectures that balance performance with hardware constraints. Despite recent progress, identifying structural features of PQCs that enhance trainability, noise resilience, and overall algorithmic performance remains an active area of research. Addressing these challenges, quantum architecture search (QAS) aims to automate the design of problem-specific PQCs by systematically exploring circuit architectures to optimize algorithmic performance, often with varying degrees of consideration for hardware constraints. However, comparing QAS methods is challenging due to the absence of a unified benchmark evaluation pipeline, and the high resource demands. In this paper, we present SQuASH, the Surrogate Quantum Architecture Search Helper, a benchmark that leverages surrogate models to enable uniform comparison of QAS methods and considerably accelerate their evaluation. We present the methodology for creating a surrogate benchmark for QAS and demonstrate its capability to accelerate the execution and comparison of QAS methods. Additionally, we provide the code required to integrate SQuASH into custom QAS methods, enabling not only benchmarking but also the use of surrogate models for rapid prototyping. We further release the dataset used to train the surrogate models, facilitating reproducibility and further research.

Title: Observation of Power Superbroadening of Spectral Line Profiles on IBM Quantum
Authors: Ivo S. Mihov, Nikolay V. Vitanov
Abstract: Power broadening refers to the widening of the spectral line profile in a two-state quantum transition as the strength of the driving field increases. This phenomenon commonly arises in continuous-wave driving when the radiation field's intensity exceeds the transition's saturation intensity and it has been extensively studied in spectroscopy. For pulsed-field excitation, the spectral response of the quantum system may differ significantly: while a rectangular-shaped pulse leads to a linear power broadening, pulses with smooth shapes show significantly reduced power broadening, for instance, logarithmic for the Gaussian shape and none for the hyperbolic-secant shape. Recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 020802 (2024)], in a dramatic paradigm shift, we have demonstrated experimentally that for Lorentzian-shaped pulses, the opposite effect - power narrowing - takes place: the width of the spectral profile decreases when the driving pulse amplitude increases, with a narrowing factor of as much as 10 observed. While in high-resolution spectroscopy the push is for eliminating or even inverting the power broadening, there are applications where it is used to an advantage for it facilitates off-resonance excitation. Here, we present a number of shaped pulses that exhibit power broadening much greater than that of the rectangular pulse of the same pulse area. They are grouped in two families of pulse shapes. In particular, in regard to the width of the second Rabi oscillation maximum, the quadratic pulse family shows an increase by a factor of 3.3 whereas the even-exponent pulse family exhibits an increase by a factor of more than 3.5.

Title: The Quantum Paldus Transform: Efficient Circuits with Applications
Authors: Jędrzej Burkat, Nathan Fitzpatrick
Abstract: We present the Quantum Paldus Transform: an efficient quantum algorithm for block-diagonalising fermionic, spin-free Hamiltonians in the second quantisation. Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation number basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin (GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \times SU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and error mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur transform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion principle. Alongside self-contained derivations of the underlying dualities we provide fault-tolerant circuit compilation methods with full gate counts for the Paldus transform, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ Toffoli complexity, where a transform on $50$ spatial orbitals would require a modest $5500$ Toffoli gates. This paves the way for significant advancements in quantum simulation on quantum computers enabled by the UGA paradigm.

Title: Covert Entanglement Generation over Bosonic Channels
Authors: Evan J. D. Anderson, Michael S. Bullock, Ohad Kimelfeld, Christopher K. Eyre, Filip Rozpędek, Uzi Pereg, Boulat A. Bash
Abstract: We explore covert entanglement generation over the lossy thermal-noise bosonic channel, which is a quantum-mechanical model of many practical settings, including optical, microwave, and radio-frequency (RF) channels. Covert communication ensures that an adversary is unable to detect the presence of transmissions, which are concealed in channel noise. We show that a square root law (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical communication: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method. We additionally analyze the performance of covert entanglement generation using single- and dual-rail photonic qubits, which may be more practical for physical implementation.

Title: A Solvable Semi-infinite Fock-state-lattice SSH Model: the Stable Topological Zero Mode and the Non-Hermitian Bound Effect
Authors: Xing Yao Mi, Yong-Chun Liu, Zhi Jiao Deng, Chun Wang Wu, Ping Xing Chen
Abstract: Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Furthermore, a concrete experimental proposal based on the trapped-ion setup is provided.

Title: Theory of Three-Photon Transport Through a Weakly Coupled Atomic Ensemble
Authors: Yangming Wang (1), Noe Demazure (1 and 2), Sahand Mahmoodian (1) ((1) the University of Sydney, (2) ENS Paris-Saclay)
Abstract: Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.

Title: High-throughput electro-optic upconversion and downconversion with few-photon added noise
Authors: M. D. Urmey, S. Dickson, K. Adachi, S. Mittal, L. G. Talamo, A. Kyle, N. E. Frattini, S.-X. Lin, K. W. Lehnert, C. A. Regal
Abstract: A microwave-optical transducer of sufficiently low noise and high signal transfer rate would allow entanglement to be distributed between superconducting quantum processors at a rate faster than the lifetimes of the quantum memories being linked. Here we present measurements of a membrane-based opto-electromechanical transducer with high signal throughput, as quantified by an efficiency-bandwidth-duty-cycle product of 7 kHz, approaching quantum-enabled operation in upconversion as well as downconversion, with input-referred added noise of 3 photons. In downconversion, throughput of this magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a quantum network with reasonable averaging times.

Title: Optimization and Synthesis of Quantum Circuits with Global Gates
Authors: Alejandro Villoria, Henning Basold, Alfons Laarman
Abstract: Compiling quantum circuits to account for hardware restrictions is an essential part of the quantum computing stack. Circuit compilation allows us to adapt algorithm descriptions into a sequence of operations supported by real quantum hardware, and has the potential to significantly improve their performance when optimization techniques are added to the process. One such optimization technique is reducing the number of quantum gates that are needed to execute a circuit. For instance, methods for reducing the number of non-Clifford gates or CNOT gates from a circuit is an extensive research area that has gathered significant interest over the years. For certain hardware platforms such as ion trap quantum computers, we can leverage some of their special properties to further reduce the cost of executing a quantum circuit in them. In this work we use global interactions, such as the Global Mølmer-Sørensen gate present in ion trap hardware, to optimize and synthesize quantum circuits. We design and implement an algorithm that is able to compile an arbitrary quantum circuit into another circuit that uses global gates as the entangling operation, while optimizing the number of global interactions needed. The algorithm is based on the ZX-calculus and uses an specialized circuit extraction routine that groups entangling gates into Global Mølmer-Sørensen gates. We benchmark the algorithm in a variety of circuits, and show how it improves their performance under state-of-the-art hardware considerations in comparison to a naive algorithm and the Qiskit optimizer.

Title: Plasmon-assisted photoelectron emission in a model cluster using time-dependent density functional theory and the time-dependent surface-flux method
Authors: Mikhail Bednov, Waqas Pervez, Ingo Barke, Dieter Bauer
Abstract: We investigate plasmon-assisted photoelectron emission using a one-dimensional time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) model. Photoelectron spectra are computed with the time-dependent surface-flux (t-SURFF) method. In addition to the expected above-threshold ionization (ATI) comb, we observe peaks that arise from long-lived plasmon oscillations and the associated electron emission occurring after the laser pulse. We further analyze the positions of these peaks and their scaling behavior with the laser intensity.

Title: Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries
Authors: Neil Dowling, Jacopo De Nardis, Markus Heinrich, Xhek Turkeshi, Silvia Pappalardi
Abstract: Unitary randomness underpins both fundamental tasks in quantum information and the modern theory of quantum chaos. On one side, a central concept is that of approximate unitary designs: circuits that look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. In a distinct setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), intensely studied as a measure of information scrambling, have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the noncommutative generalization of statistical independence. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables, while traceless observables instead require exponential resources. Indeed, local observables are precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, adding to previous literature, we show how random matrix product unitaries constitute approximate designs: we exactly compute the frame potential of the ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value with polynomial deviations and so indicating that global observables are freely independent on-average. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage and shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.

Title: On continuum and resonant spectra from exact WKB analysis
Authors: Okuto Morikawa, Shoya Ogawa
Abstract: Resonance phenomena are central to many quantum systems, where resonant states are typically characterized by pole singularities of the S-matrix. In this work, we employ the complex scaling method (CSM) in conjunction with exact WKB analysis to elucidate the geometric structure of scattering problems that encompass both bound and resonant states. By analyzing the continuum spectrum via the exact WKB framework, we derive the S-matrix for the inverted Rosen--Morse potential and reveal its underlying complex-geometric features. Furthermore, we reinterpret the Aguilar--Balslev--Combes theorem, the foundation of CSM, from a geometric perspective, and discuss the physical significance of the Siegert boundary condition within a rigorously defined modified Hilbert space. Our analysis bridges scattering cross-sections and spectral theory, offering new geometric insights into quantum resonance and scattering phenomena.

Title: Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum
Authors: Philip A. LeMaitre
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.

Title: Private Quantum Database
Authors: Giancarlo Gatti, Rihan Hai
Abstract: Quantum databases open an exciting new frontier in data management by offering privacy guarantees that classical systems cannot match. Traditional engines tackle user privacy, which hides the records being queried, or data privacy, which prevents a user from learning more than she has queried. We propose a quantum database that protects both by leveraging quantum mechanics: when the user measures her chosen basis, the superposition collapses and the unqueried rows become physically inaccessible. We encode relational tables as a sequence of Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) over mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), transmit a bounded number of quantum states, and let a single, destructive measurement reconstruct only the selected tuple. This allows us to preserve data privacy and user privacy at once without trusted hardware or heavyweight cryptography. Moreover, we envision a novel hybrid quantum-classical architecture ready for early deployment, which ensures compatibility with the limitations of today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.

Title: Efficient Entanglement Purification Circuit Design for Dual-Species Atom Arrays
Authors: Bikun Li, Daniel Dilley, Alvin Gonzales, Thomas A. Hahn, Ryan White, Rotem Arnon, Hannes Bernien, Zain Saleem, Liang Jiang
Abstract: Entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) are essential for generating high-fidelity entangled states in noisy quantum systems, enabling robust quantum networking and computation. Building on the circuit of the foundational recurrence protocol, we generalize two-way EPPs to arbitrary stabilizer codes. Through analytical derivations and noisy circuit simulations incorporating circuit-level noise, we demonstrate enhanced purification performance, with fidelity improvements and finite distillation rates for distillable input states. We propose efficient circuit designs for EPPs tailored to dual-species Rydberg atom arrays, leveraging species-specific laser control and interspecies Rydberg interactions. Introducing a low-overhead operation set, the dual-species atom convenient operation set, we facilitate straightforward compilation of EPP circuits without the need for ancillary atoms or complex atom rearrangements. Our framework provides practical guidance for near-term implementations on dual-species platforms, advancing towards scalable entanglement distribution in neutral atom systems and paving the way for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

Title: How an Equi-ensemble Description Systematically Outperforms the Weighted-ensemble Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Akilan Rajamani, Martin Beseda, Benjamin Lasorne, Bruno Senjean
Abstract: Calculating excited states in chemistry is crucial to provide insight into photoinduced molecular behavior beyond the ground state, enabling innovations in spectroscopy, material sciences, and drug design. While several approaches have been developed to compute excited-state properties, finding the best ratio between computational cost and accuracy remains challenging. The advent of quantum computers brings new perspectives, with the development of quantum algorithms that promise an advantage over classical ones. Most of these new algorithms are inspired from previous classical ones, but with different pros and cons. In this Letter, we focus on the generalization of the variational principle for many-body excited-states that led to the ensemble variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We compare the performance of two ensemble VQE approaches, the equi-ensemble and weighted-ensemble ones, and conclude that the equi-ensemble is the way to go.

Title: Re-uploading quantum data: A universal function approximator for quantum inputs
Authors: Hyunho Cha, Daniel K. Park, Jungwoo Lee
Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.

Title: High harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Philipp Stammer
Abstract: Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the quantum state of the generated harmonics of a driven Bose gas is a classical mixture, while below the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation the emitted harmonic radiation is in a pure quantum state. These states furthermore exhibit squeezing and entanglement across all field modes.

Title: Who Let the Diamonds Out?
Authors: Vincent Halde, Olivier Bernard, Mathieu Brochu, Laurier Dufresne, Nicolas Fleury, Kayla Johnson, Benjamin Moffett, David Roy-Guay
Abstract: Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center magnetometry is a highly promising quantum sensing technology, with early prototypes demonstrating impressive sensitivity in compact sensing heads. Yet, most existing implementations remain tied to laboratory setups, lacking the portability and environmental robustness needed to unlock their full potential in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a fully portable, hand-held NV-based magnetometer that delivers a vector sensitivity of approximately 400 pT/sqrt(Hz), heading errors below 5 nT in Earth's field, and a wide signal bandwidth that supports on-field recalibration and operation on moving platforms. We further demonstrate the system's technological maturity through environmental qualification such as thermal, vibration, radiation and other operational stresses related to deployment in low Earth orbit, and through successful deployments in demanding scenarios, including northern Canadian weather conditions, drone-mounted surveys and high-altitude balloon flights. Together, these achievements establish this NV-based magnetometer as a robust, versatile tool ready to bring quantum sensing performance to a broad range of field and autonomous applications.

Title: Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence
Authors: Lane P. Hughston, Levent A. Mengütürk
Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.

Title: A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus
Authors: Tobias Fischbach, Pierre Talbot, Pascal Bouvry
Abstract: Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.

Title: ConQuER: Modular Architectures for Control and Bias Mitigation in IQP Quantum Generative Models
Authors: Xiaocheng Zou, Shijin Duan, Charles Fleming, Gaowen Liu, Ramana Rao Kompella, Shaolei Ren, Xiaolin Xu
Abstract: Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.

Title: SQuaD: Smart Quantum Detection for Photon Recognition and Dark Count Elimination
Authors: Karl C. Linne (Kai Li), Sho Uemura, Yue Ji, Allen Zang, Martin Di Federico, Orlando Quaranta, Gustavo Cancelo, Tian Zhong
Abstract: Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.

Title: PhotonIDs: ML-Powered Photon Identification System for Dark Count Elimination
Authors: Karl C. Linne (Kai Li), Sho Uemura, Yue Ji, Allen Zang, Ian Chin, Martin Di Federico, Gustavo Cancelo, Orlando Quaranta, Debashri Roy, Tian Zhong
Abstract: Reliable single photon detection is the foundation for practical quantum communication and networking. However, today's superconducting nanowire single photon detector(SNSPD) inherently fails to distinguish between genuine photon events and dark counts, leading to degraded fidelity in long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we introduce PhotonIDs, a machine learning-powered photon identification system that is the first end-to-end solution for real-time discrimination between photons and dark count based on full SNSPD readout signal waveform analysis. PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system. Our result demonstrates that PhotonIDs ~could improve more than 31.2 times of signal-noise-ratio~(SNR) on dark count elimination. PhotonIDs ~ marks a step forward in noise-resilient quantum communication infrastructure.

Title: Evaluating noises of boson sampling with statistical benchmark methods
Authors: Yang Ji, Yongjin Ye, Qiao Wang, Shi Wang, Jie Hou, Yongzheng Wu, Zijian Wang, Bo Jiang
Abstract: The lack of self-correcting codes hiders the development of boson sampling to be large-scale and robust. Therefore, it is important to know the noise levels in order to cautiously demonstrate the quantum computational advantage or realize certain tasks. Based on those statistical benchmark methods such as the correlators and the clouds, which are initially proposed to discriminate boson sampling and other mockups, we quantificationally evaluate noises of photon partial distinguishability and photon loss compensated by dark counts. This is feasible owing to the fact that the output distribution unbalances are suppressed by noises, which are actually results of multi-photon interferences. This is why the evaluation performance is better when high order correlators or corresponding clouds are employed. Our results indicate that the statistical benchmark methods can also work in the task of evaluating noises of boson sampling.

Title: Higher symmetry breaking and non-reciprocity in a driven-dissipative Dicke model
Authors: Jacquelyn Ho, Yue-Hui Lu, Tai Xiang, Tsai-Chen Lee, Zhenjie Yan, Dan M. Stamper-Kurn
Abstract: Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.

Title: The PESCADO Method for Autonomous Systems: An Application to Photoionization at Near-optical Wavelengths
Authors: Selstø Sølve, Bendik Steinsvåg Dalen
Abstract: In a recent publication, Dalen, and Selstø, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 111}, 033116 (2025), it was demonstrated how converged photo electron spectra could be determined using a complex absorbing potential on a truncated numerical domain considerably smaller than the extension of the dynamical wave function. That approach required simulation until virtually all unbound parts of the wave function was absorbed, far beyond the duration of the interaction with the external field. In this work we formulate the method in a semi-analytical manner which allows us to extrapolate to infinite times after the interaction with the external field. In addition to obtaining photoelectron spectra for hydrogen differential in energy and ejection angle, we also demonstrate how -- and when -- the absorber may be seen as a detector, distorting the angular distributions when the detector is placed in the extreme vicinity of the atom.

Title: A Quantum Walk-Enabled Blockchain with Weighted Quantum Voting Consensus
Authors: Chong-Qiang Ye, Heng-Ji Li, Jian Li, Xiao-Yu Chen
Abstract: Quantum blockchains provide inherent resilience against quantum adversaries and represent a promising alternative to classical blockchain systems in the quantum era. However, existing quantum blockchain architectures largely depend on entanglement to maintain inter-block connections, facing challenges in stability, consensus efficiency, and system verification. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel quantum blockchain framework based on quantum walks, which reduces reliance on entanglement while improving stability and connection efficiency. We further propose a quantum consensus mechanism based on a weighted quantum voting protocol, which enables a fairer voting process while reflecting the weights of different nodes. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct circuit simulations to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of both the quantum walk-based block construction and the quantum voting consensus mechanism. Compared with existing entanglement-dependent approaches, our framework achieves stronger stability and enables simpler verification of block integrity, making it a practical candidate for quantum-era blockchain applications.

Title: Local active error correction from simulated confinement
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.

Title: Emergent continuous symmetry and ground-state factorization induced by long-range interactions
Authors: Yue Yu, Myung-Joong Hwang
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry typically gives rise to emergent excitations possessing the same symmetry with a renormalized mass. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we present a theory in which the low-lying excitation in the broken-symmetry phase acquires a continuous symmetry, even when the underlying symmetry of the system is discrete. In the presence of anisotropic long-range interactions, the order parameter renormalizes the relative strength of the particle-conserving and particle-nonconserving interactions. When one of the two renormalized interactions vanishes, a conservation law absent in the original Hamiltonian emerges, giving rise to a continuous symmetry. A striking consequence of the emergent continuous symmetry and conservation law is that it constrains quantum correlations in the ground-state to be zero, leading to the ground-state factorization in the presence of strong interactions. Our finding is a universal feature of quantum phase transitions in fully-connected systems and in their lattice generalizations; therefore, it can be observed in a wide range of physical systems.

Title: Quantum Relative Entropy Decay Composition Yields Shallow, Unstructured k-Designs
Authors: Nicholas Laracuente
Abstract: A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1/logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1/nlogn)-decay (consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.

Title: Quantum and Classical Communication Complexity of Permutation-Invariant Functions
Authors: Ziyi Guan, Yunqi Huang, Penghui Yao, Zekun Ye
Abstract: This paper gives a nearly tight characterization of the quantum communication complexity of the permutation-invariant Boolean functions. With such a characterization, we show that the quantum and randomized communication complexity of the permutation-invariant Boolean functions are quadratically equivalent (up to a logarithmic factor). Our results extend a recent line of research regarding query complexity \cite{AA14, Cha19, BCG+20} to communication complexity, showing symmetry prevents exponential quantum speedups. Furthermore, we show the Log-rank Conjecture holds for any non-trivial total permutation-invariant Boolean function. Moreover, we establish a relationship between the quantum/classical communication complexity and the approximate rank of permutation-invariant Boolean functions. This implies the correctness of the Log-approximate-rank Conjecture for permutation-invariant Boolean functions in both randomized and quantum settings (up to a logarithmic factor).

Title: Simulating Molecular Single Vibronic Level Fluorescence Spectra with ab initio Hagedorn Wavepacket Dynamics
Authors: Zhan Tong Zhang, Jiří J. L. Vaníček
Abstract: We present a practical, ab initio time-dependent method using Hagedorn wavepackets to efficiently simulate single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra of polyatomic molecules from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. We apply the method to compute SVL spectra of anthracene by performing wavepacket dynamics on a 66-dimensional harmonic potential energy surface constructed from density functional theory calculations. The Hagedorn approach captures both mode distortion (frequency changes) and mode mixing (Duschinsky rotation) within the harmonic approximation. We not only reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^1$ and $\overline{11}^1$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments. Notably, all spectra were obtained from the same wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for the emission spectrum from the ground vibrational level of the electronically excited state.

Title: Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events
Authors: Kun Cheng, Tao Han, Matthew Low
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.

Title: Capturing anharmonic effects in single vibronic level fluorescence spectra using local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics
Authors: Zhan Tong Zhang, Máté Visegrádi, Jiří J. L. Vaníček
Abstract: Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics yields exact single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra in global harmonic models. To partially describe the effects of anharmonicity, important in the spectra of real molecules, we describe a combination of the Hagedorn wavepacket approach to SVL spectroscopy with the local harmonic approximation. In a proof-of-principle study [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010801 (2025)], we successfully demonstrated the utility of this method by computing the SVL spectra of difluorocarbene, a floppy molecule with moderately anharmonic potential. Here, we describe the theory in detail and analyse the method more thoroughly. To assess the accuracy of the method independently of electronic structure errors, we use a two-dimensional Morse-type potential for which exact quantum benchmarks are available, and show that the local harmonic approach yields more accurate results than global harmonic approximations, especially for the emission spectra from higher initial vibrational levels. Next, we compare the global and local harmonic SVL spectra of anthracene, where the more expensive local harmonic corrections turn out to be less important as long as the correct global harmonic model is used. We also present additional local harmonic results for difluorocarbene, where treating anharmonicity is essential for accurate evaluation of the spectra. Yet, we also show that the structure of the difluorocarbene spectra can be explained qualitatively (but not quantitatively) with a reduced-dimensional harmonic model, for which the spectral intensities can be evaluated analytically.

Title: Reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector
Authors: Si-Wei Han, Wenjing Chen, Langxuan Chen, Zhichun Ouyang, Jun Feng
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector within a broader context, particularly without necessitating an exact solution for the detector's evolution. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation. Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by reexamining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the square lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions are able to extract accurate information about quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: On the Schrödingerization method for linear non-unitary dynamics with optimal dependence on matrix queries
Authors: Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Chuwen Ma, Yue Yu
Abstract: The Schrödingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrödinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schrödinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schrödingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schrödingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.

Title: Probing arbitrary polarized photon pairs undergoing double Compton scatterings by a dedicated MC simulator validated with experimental data
Authors: M. Bala, W. Krzemien, B. C. Hiesmayr, J. Baran, K. Dulski, K. Klimaszewski, L. Raczynski, R. Y. Shopa, W. Wislicki
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the polarization degrees of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\Delta\hat\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample -- based on a total of $3 \times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector. We deduce the value of the squared visibility (interference contrast) encoding the polarization in the angle difference of the two scattering planes, $\Delta\hat\Phi$. The simulated spectra are in good agreement with the experimental correlation spectra and behave as predicted by theory.

Title: Design and assembly of a cavity microscope with high numerical aperture for quantum simulations
Authors: Gaia Stella Bolognini, Zeyang Xue, Michael Alexander Eichenberger, Nick Sauerwein, Francesca Orsi, Ekaterina Fedotova, Rohit Prasad Bhatt, Jean-Philippe Brantut
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of \SI{19.786}{\milli\meter}, a finesse of \SI{2.35}{\times 10^4} and operates \SI{214}{\micro\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.

Title: Calibration-free single-frame super-resolution fluorescence microscopy
Authors: Anežka Dostálová, Dominik Vašinka, Robert Stárek, Miroslav Ježek
Abstract: Molecular fluorescence microscopy is a leading approach to super-resolution and nanoscale imaging in life and material sciences. However, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is often bottlenecked by system-specific calibrations and long acquisitions of sparsely blinking molecules. We present a deep-learning approach that reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single diffraction-limited camera frame. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic data encompassing a wide range of optical and sample parameters, enabling robust generalization across microscopes and experimental conditions. Applied to dense terrylene samples with 150 ms acquisition time, our method significantly reduces reconstruction error compared to Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and ThunderSTORM multi-emitter fitting. The results confirm the ability to resolve emitters separated by 35 nm at 580 nm wavelength, corresponding to sevenfold resolution improvement beyond the Rayleigh criterion. By delivering unprecedented details from a single short camera exposure without prior information and calibration, our approach enables plug-and-play super-resolution imaging of fast, dense, or light-sensitive samples on standard wide-field setups.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansätze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.

Title: A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity
Authors: Francisco Pipa
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.

Abstract: Reconfigurable photonics have rapidly become an invaluable tool for information processing. Light-based computing accelerators are promising for boosting neural network learning and inference and optical interconnects are foreseen as a solution to the information transfer bottleneck in high-performance computing. In this study, we demonstrate the successful programming of a transformation implemented using a reconfigurable photonic circuit with a non-conventional architecture. The core of most photonic processors is an MZI-based architecture that establishes an analytical connection between the controllable parameters and circuit transformation. However, several architectures that are substantially more difficult to program have improved robustness to fabrication defects. We use two algorithms that rely on different initial datasets to reconstruct the circuit model of a complex interferometer, and then program the required unitary transformation. Both methods performed accurate circuit programming with an average fidelity above 98%. Our results provide a strong foundation for the introduction of non-conventional interferometric architectures for photonic information processing.

Title: Imprints of screened dark energy on nonlocal quantum correlations
Authors: Fabiano Feleppa, Gaetano Lambiase, Sunny Vagnozzi
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.

Title: Landscape of scattering universality with general dispersion relations
Authors: Yidan Wang, Xuesen Na, Michael J. Gullans, Susanne Yelin, Alexey V. Gorshkov
Abstract: Universality in physics describes how disparate systems can exhibit identical low-energy behavior. Here, we reveal a rich landscape of new universal scattering phenomena governed by the interplay between an interaction and a system's density of states. We investigate one-dimensional scattering with general dispersion relations of the form $\epsilon(k) = |k|^m$ and $\epsilon(k) = \text{sign}(k)|k|^m$ for any real $m \geq 1$. For key models such as emitter scattering and separable potentials, we prove that the low-energy S-matrix converges to universal forms determined solely by the dispersion exponent $m$ and a few integers defining the interaction. This establishes a broad classification of new universality classes, extending far beyond the standard quadratic dispersion paradigm. Furthermore, we derive a generalized Levinson's theorem relating the total winding of the scattering phase to the number of bound states. Our findings are directly relevant to synthetic quantum systems, where engineered dispersion relations in atomic arrays and photonic crystals offer a platform to explore these universal behaviors.

Title: Observation of anomalous tunneling in collective excitations via a cloud experiment platform for Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Daichi Kagamihara, Hironori Kazuta, Yewei Wu, N. J. Fitch, Ippei Danshita
Abstract: Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has enabled physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented accessibility. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. An intriguing theoretical prediction of a characteristic phenomenon of BECs is anomalous tunneling, whereby low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy regime, and experimentally measure these frequencies using Oqtant. Our results reveal that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs, as well as highlight the potential of cloud-based experiments in quantum-body physics.

Title: Bogoliubov quasi-particles in superconductors are integer-charged particles inapplicable for braiding quantum information
Authors: Zhiyu Fan, Wei Ku
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian, one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.

Title: Squeezing codes: robust fluctuation-stabilized memories
Authors: Ethan Lake, Sunghan Ro
Abstract: We introduce families of classical stochastic dynamics in two and higher dimensions which stabilize order in the absence of any symmetry. Our dynamics are qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, and have the unusual feature of being fluctuation-stabilized: their order becomes increasingly fragile in larger dimensions. One of our models maintains an ordered phase only in two dimensions. The phase transitions that occur as the order is lost realize new dynamical universality classes which are fundamentally non-equilibrium in character.

Title: Polynomials and asymptotic constants in a resurgent problem from 't Hooft
Authors: David Broadhurst, Gergő Nemes
Abstract: In a recent study of the quantum theory of harmonic oscillators, Gerard 't Hooft proposed the following problem: given $G(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sqrt{n}\,z^n$ for $|z|<1$, find its analytic continuation for $|z|\ge1$, excluding a branch-cut $z\in[1,\,\infty)$. A solution is provided by the bilateral convergent sum $G(z)=\frac12\sqrt{\pi}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty(2\pi{\rm i}n-\log(z))^{-3/2}$. On the negative real axis, $G(-{\rm e}^u)$ has a sign-constant asymptotic expansion in $1/u^2$, for large positive $u$. Optimal truncation leaves exponentially suppressed terms in an asymptotic expansion ${\rm e}^{-u}\sum_{k=0}^\infty P_k(x)/u^k$, with $P_0(x)=x-\frac23$ and $P_k(x)$ of degree $2k+1$ evaluated at $x=u/2-\lfloor u/2\rfloor$. At large $k$, these polynomials become excellent approximations to sinusoids. The amplitude of $P_k(x)$ increases factorially with $k$ and its phase increases linearly, with $P_k(x)\sim\sin((2k+1)C-2\pi x)R^{2k+1}\Gamma(k+\frac12)/\sqrt{2\pi}$, where $C\approx1.0688539158679530121571$ and $R\approx0.5181839789815558726739$ are asymptotic constants satisfying $R\exp({\rm i}\,C)=\sqrt{-1/(2+\pi{\rm i})}$.

Title: Curved Boolean Logic: A Contextual Generalization of Propositional Logic with Algorithmic Consequences
Authors: Maximilian R. P. von Liechtenstein
Abstract: Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) generalizes propositional logic by allowing local truth assignments that do not extend to a single global valuation, analogous to curvature in geometry. We give equivalent sheaf and exclusivity-graph semantics and a context-aware proof calculus that is conservative in the flat limit. We formalize CBL-SAT and basic complexity (NP-complete in general) and present operational operators (CBL-AC and CBL-CONS) that prune contradictions earlier on classical hardware. We model noise with iid, AR(1)-correlated, and adversarial bounded perturbations and provide permutation-based significance with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control. A Colab-ready notebook (ancillary files) regenerates all figures and statistics. We position CBL relative to KCBS, CSW, and sheaf frameworks and outline links to SAT/CSP and robustness/adapter stability in large language models.

Title: Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Pricing Theory
Authors: Tian Xin
Abstract: Motivated by Heisenberg's observable-only stance, we replace latent "information" (filtrations, hidden diffusions, state variables) with observable transitions between price states. On a discrete price lattice with a Hilbert-space representation, shift operators and the spectral calculus of the price define observable frequency operators and a translation-invariant convolution generator. Combined with jump operators that encode transition intensities, this yields a completely positive, translation-covariant Lindblad semigroup. Under the risk-neutral condition the framework leads to a nonlocal pricing equation that is diagonal in Fourier space; in the small-mesh diffusive limit its generator converges to the classical Black-Scholes-Merton operator. We do not propose another parametric model. We propose a foundation for model construction that is observable, first-principles, and mathematically natural. Noncommutativity emerges from the observable shift algebra rather than being postulated. The jump-intensity ledger determines tail behavior and short-maturity smiles and implies testable links between extreme-event probabilities and implied-volatility wings. Future directions: (i) multi-asset systems on higher-dimensional lattices with vector shifts and block kernels; (ii) state- or flow-dependent kernels as "financial interactions" leading to nonlinear master equations while preserving linear risk-neutral pricing; (iii) empirical tests of the predicted scaling relations between jump intensities and market extremes.

Title: Exploring the Spectral Edge in SYK Models
Authors: Bowen Ouyang, Pratik Rath
Abstract: Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.
