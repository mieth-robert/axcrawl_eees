Title: Revisiting the missing He-McKellar-Wilkens geometric quantum phase
Authors: K. Bakke
Abstract: We discuss the missing He-McKellar-Wilkens geometric quantum phase in Landau levels for a neutral particle with a permanent electric dipole moment in the presence of an infinity wall. We also discuss the influence of the missing He-McKellar-Wilkens geometric quantum phase on the energy levels of a neutral particle confined to a one-dimensional quantum ring. Further, we explore this influence of the missing He-McKellar-Wilkens geometric quantum phase on the energy levels by calculating the persistent spin currents.

Title: Quantum geometry and adiabaticity in molecules and in condensed matter
Authors: Raffaele Resta
Abstract: The adiabatic theorem states that when the time evolution of the Hamiltonian is "infinitely slow", a system, when started in the ground state, remains in the instantaneous ground state at all times. This, however, does not mean that the adiabatic evolution of a generic observable obtains simply as its expectation value over the instantaneous eigenstate. As a general principle there is an additional adiabatic term, of quantum-geometrical nature, which is the relevant one for several static or adiabatic observables. This is shown explicitly for the cases of polarizability and infrared tensors (in molecules and condensed matter); rotational g factor and magnetizability (in molecules only). Quantum geometry allows for a transparent derivation and a compact expression for these observables, alternative to the well known sum-over-states Kubo formulas.

Title: Decoherence-free measurement of wavefunction collapse with interferometers in quantum superpositions
Authors: Garrelt Quandt-Wiese
Abstract: A novel approach for measuring wavefunction collapse is proposed which, unlike interferometric measurements, is not affected by decoherence. In the approach, the mirrors of interferometers are placed into quantum superpositions, where the superposition of a mirror can indirectly be measured by the fact that it affects the probability of detecting photons in the interferometer. For a Michelson interferometer, in which one mirror is placed into superposition, the experimental conditions required to measure collapse are discussed. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for testing collapse models, the expected outcomes for the gravity-based models of Di√≥si and Penrose are calculated referring to commercially available components.

Title: Sub-resonant wideband superconducting Purcell filters
Authors: Basil M. Smitham, Jeronimo G. C. Martinez, Christie S. Chiu, Andrew A. Houck
Abstract: In superconducting quantum devices, Purcell filters protect qubit information from decaying into external lines by reducing external coupling at qubit frequencies while maintaining it at readout frequencies. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a novel Purcell filter design that places the readout resonator frequencies in a "linewidth plateau" below the filter's first resonant mode. This approach, based on direct admittance engineering, can simultaneously achieve strong qubit protection and nearly constant external coupling across a wide readout bandwidth, addressing the traditional tradeoff between these properties. We first present a lumped-element analysis of our filters. We then experimentally demonstrate a compact on-chip linewidth-plateau filter, coupled to four resonators across its approximately 1 GHz readout band. We compare the measured linewidths to numerical predictions, and show how the filter protects a frequency-tunable transmon qubit from external decay. We envision that our flexible design paradigm will aid in efforts to create multiplexed readout architectures for superconducting quantum circuits, with well-controlled external couplings.

Title: Chirality, magic, and quantum correlations in multipartite quantum states
Authors: Shreya Vardhan, Bowen Shi, Isaac H. Kim, Yijian Zou
Abstract: We introduce a notion of chirality for generic quantum states. A chiral state is defined as a state which cannot be transformed into its complex conjugate in a local product basis using local unitary operations. We introduce a number of quantitative measures of chirality which vanish for non-chiral states. A faithful measure called the "chiral log-distance" is defined in terms of the maximum fidelity between the state and its complex conjugate under local unitary transformations. We further introduce a set of computable measures that involve nested commutators of modular Hamiltonians. We show general relations between chirality and the amount of "magic" or non-stabilizer resource in a state. We first show that stabilizer states of qubits are non-chiral. Furthermore, magic monotones such as the stabilizer nullity and the stabilizer fidelity are lower-bounded by the chiral log-distance. We further relate chirality to discord-like quantum correlations. We define a measure of discord-like correlations called the intrinsic interferometric power, and show that it is lower-bounded by a nested commutator chirality measure. One interesting aspect of chirality is that it is not monotonic under local partial traces, indicating that it is a unique kind of resource that is not captured by traditional quantum resource theories.

Title: Simple Hamiltonians for Matrix Product State models
Authors: Norbert Schuch, Andras Molnar, David Perez-Garcia
Abstract: Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Networks provide a general framework for the construction of solvable models. The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.

Title: Thermal Capacity Mapping of Cryogenic Platforms for Quantum Computers
Authors: Scott A. Manifold, George B. Long, Jonathan J. Burnett
Abstract: Large-scale cryogenic Input-Output (IO) infrastructure is a requirement for realising fault-tolerant quantum computing in solid-state modalities. Such IO scaling presents significant challenges in thermal modelling, hardware design and verification. Here we present a design tool for cryogenic platform development with applicability to quantum computing and other cryogenic technologies. By taking comprehensive measurements of a commercially available dilution refrigerator we construct a 'platform capacity map', quantifying the platform's complex response to heat loads distributed over multiple temperature stages and accounting for interstage dependencies, avoiding an analytical model. This allows for the modification of the platform parameters to be accurately estimated for the inclusion of an arbitrary IO infrastructure, the identification of stage thermal overheads and the optimisation of system parameters. We identify a key bottleneck around the Still stage, owing to loading from connected stages, and observe discrepancies between existing thermal modelling methods for estimating heat loads associated with IO and experimental results obtained from the platform capacity map.

Title: Quantum Error Detection For Early Term Fault-Tolerant Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Tom Ginsberg, Vyom Patel
Abstract: Quantum error detection (QED) offers a promising pathway to fault tolerance in near-term quantum devices by balancing error suppression with minimal resource overhead. However, its practical utility hinges on optimizing design parameters-such as syndrome measurement frequency-to avoid diminishing returns from detection overhead. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for fault-tolerant compilation and simulation of quantum algorithms using [[n, n-2, 2]] codes, which enable low-qubit-overhead error detection and a simple nearly fault-tolerant universal set of operations. We demonstrate and analyze our pipeline with a purely statistical interpretation and through the implementation of Grover's search algorithm. Our results are used to answer the question is quantum error detection a worthwhile avenue for early-term fault tolerance, and if so how can we get the most out of it? Simulations under the circuit-level noise model reveal that finding optimal syndrome schedules improves algorithm success probabilities by an average of 6.7x but eventual statistical limits from post-selection in noisy/resource-limited regimes constrain scalability. Furthermore, we propose a simple data-driven approach to predict fault tolerant compilation parameters, such as optimal syndrome schedules, and expected fault tolerant performance gains based on circuit and noise features. These results provide actionable guidelines for implementing QED in early-term quantum experiments and underscore its role as a pragmatic, constant-overhead error mitigation layer for shallow algorithms. To aid in further research, we release all simulation data computed for this work and provide an experimental QED compiler at this https URL.

Title: DNA Nanotechnology for Superradiance
Authors: Jaewon Lee, Sung Hun Park, Jangwon Kim, Kyung Hun Rho, Hoyoung Lee, Soyeon Kim, Seungwoo Lee
Abstract: Superradiance, first proposed by Dicke in 1954, is a highly efficient quantum light source that differs from conventional spontaneous emission. Unlike typical spontaneous emission, where intensity scales linearly with the number of electric dipoles, superradiance exhibits an intensity that scales quadratically with the number of electric dipoles. Similarly, the decay rate also increases proportionally to the dipole numbers. To realize superradiance, excited electric dipoles must be arranged in the same orientation with spacing much smaller than the wavelength of the excitation light. While previous studies have accidentally observed superradiance through the random aggregation of quantum dots and organic dyes, a deterministic approach for the materialization of superradiant has yet to be established. Herein, we (i) specifically outline the advantages of DNA nanotechnology in tackling this challenge, (ii) discuss the reasons why superradiance has not yet been realized even with the state-of-the art DNA nanotechnology, and (iii) propose potential solutions for overcoming the current limitations.

Title: Monte Carlo model of distilled remote entanglement between superconducting qubits across optical channels
Authors: Nicolas Dirnegger, Moein Malekakhlagh, Vikesh Siddhu, Ashutosh Rao, Chi Xiong, Muir Kumph, Jason Orcutt, Abram Falk
Abstract: A promising quantum computing architecture comprises modules of superconducting quantum processors linked by optical channels via quantum transducers. To map transducer device performance to system-level channel performance, our model uses Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate 2-to-1 and 3-to-1 entanglement distillation protocols. We show that the Extreme Photon Loss distillation protocol is particularly high performing and that, even without distillation, present-day transducers are at the threshold of enabling Bell pair distribution with fidelities of 50%. If the next generation of transducers can improve by 3 orders of magnitude in both added noise and efficiency, and increase repetition rates by 50x, then they would allow for remote two-qubit gates achieving 99.7% fidelities at 100 kHz rates. These results set targets for transducers to be ready for deployment into scaled superconducting quantum computers.

Title: Computing band gaps of periodic materials via sample-based quantum diagonalization
Authors: Alan Duriez, Pamela C. Carvalho, Marco Antonio Barroca, Federico Zipoli, Ben Jaderberg, Rodrigo Neumann Barros Ferreira, Kunal Sharma, Antonio Mezzacapo, Benjamin Wunsch, Mathias Steiner
Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques in computational materials science often fail to capture many-body interactions in periodic systems. One particular application is the electronic structure problem, where established approaches such as Density Functional Theory are applied to predict experimental results. In this contribution, we present a sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) workflow for simulating the electronic ground state of periodic materials, and for predicting their band gaps. We obtain a fermionic Hamiltonian for crystalline solids by first projecting the electronic density obtained by density functional theory onto a localized basis set and then adding interaction parameters obtained by a self-consistent field theory. We then build an approximation of the system's ground-state wavefunction with the local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz. By sampling the quantum circuit and classically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the resulting configuration subspace, we predict the band gap energy of representative materials and obtain agreement with experimental results. The predicted bandgaps were obtained from calculations using 38 and 46 qubits, performed on a superconducting quantum processor, with minimal error-mitigation overhead. Our self-consistent approach offers a scalable pathway for utility-scale quantum simulation of materials.

Abstract: In this work we introduce a superconducting quantum processor architecture that uses a transmission-line resonator to implement effective all-to-all connectivity between six transmon qubits. This architecture can be used as a test-bed for algorithms that benefit from high connectivity. We show that the central resonator can be used as a computational element, which offers the flexibility to encode a qubit for quantum computation or to utilize its bosonic modes which further enables quantum simulation of bosonic systems. To operate the quantum processing unit (QPU), we develop and benchmark the qubit-resonator conditional Z gate and the qubit-resonator MOVE operation. The latter allows for transferring a quantum state between one of the peripheral qubits and the computational resonator. We benchmark the QPU performance and achieve a genuinely multi-qubit entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state over all six qubits with a readout-error mitigated fidelity of $0.86$.

Title: Fabrication of Metal Air Bridges for Superconducting Circuits using Two-photon Lithography
Authors: Yi-Hsiang Huang, Haozhi Wang, Zhuo Shen, Austin Thomas, C. J. K. Richardson, B. S. Palmer
Abstract: Extraneous high frequency chip modes parasitic to superconducting quantum circuits can result in decoherence when these modes are excited. To suppress these modes, superconducting air bridges (AB) are commonly used to electrically connect ground planes together when interrupted by transmission lines. Here, we demonstrate the use of two-photon photolithography to build a supporting 3D resist structure in conjunction with a lift-off process to create AB. The resulting aluminum AB, have a superconducting transition temperature $T_{c} = 1.08$ K and exhibit good mechanical strength up to lengths of 100 $\mu$m. A measurable amount of microwave loss is observed when 35 AB were placed over a high-$Q$ Ta quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonator.

Title: Surface Reaction Simulations for Battery Materials through Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization and Local Embedding
Authors: Marco Antonio Barroca, Tanvi Gujarati, Vidushi Sharma, Rodrigo Neumann Barros Ferreira, Young-Hye Na, Maxwell Giammona, Antonio Mezzacapo, Benjamin Wunsch, Mathias Steiner
Abstract: Accurate quantum chemistry calculations are essential for understanding electronic structures, yet exactly solving the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation remains impractical due to electron correlation effects. While Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used, its inherent approximations limit its ability to capture strong correlation effects, particularly in surface reactions. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, especially for localized electron interactions. In this work, we apply a quantum embedding approach to study the Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Lithium battery electrode surfaces. We employ an active space selection strategy, using Density Difference Analysis to identify key orbitals, which are subsequently refined with coupled-cluster natural orbitals. These are treated using Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) and its extended version (Ext-SQD), leveraging the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz for efficient state preparation on quantum hardware. Ext-SQD significantly improves upon standard SQD by incorporating excitation operators into the quantum-computed electron configurations used in classical Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy over Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) calculations over ground state energies. The results, validated against Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CASCI), whenever computationally feasible, and Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (HCI), provide new insights into $\mathrm{Li}$-$\mathrm{O_2}$ surface reactions, underscoring the potential of quantum computing in materials discovery and reaction modeling.

Title: Bias-preserving and error-detectable entangling operations in a superconducting dual-rail system

Abstract: For useful quantum computation, error-corrected machines are required that can dramatically reduce the inevitable errors experienced by physical qubits. While significant progress has been made in approaching and exceeding the surface-code threshold in superconducting platforms, large gains in the logical error rate with increasing system size remain out of reach. This is due both to the large number of required physical qubits and the need to operate far below threshold. Importantly, by exploiting the biases and structure of the physical errors, this threshold can be raised. Erasure qubits achieve this by detecting certain errors at the hardware level. Dual-rail qubits encoded in superconducting cavities are a promising erasure qubit wherein the dominant error, photon loss, can be detected and converted to an erasure. In these approaches, the complete set of operations, including two qubit gates, must be high performance and preserve as much of the desirable hierarchy or bias in the errors as possible. Here, we design and realize a novel two-qubit gate for dual-rail erasure qubits based on superconducting microwave cavities. The gate is high-speed ($\sim$500 ns duration), and yields a residual gate infidelity after error detection below 0.1%. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that this gate largely preserves the favorable error structure of idling dual-rail qubits, making it ideal for error correction. We measure low erasure rates of $\sim$0.5% per gate, as well as low and asymmetric dephasing errors that occur at least three times more frequently on control qubits compared to target qubits. Bit-flip errors are practically nonexistent, bounded at the few parts per million level. This error asymmetry has not been well explored but is extremely useful in quantum error correction and flag-qubit contexts, where it can create a faster path to effective error-corrected systems.

Title: Quantum gate broadcasting on graphs
Authors: Hiroki Sukeno, Tzu-Chieh Wei
Abstract: Given a known or unknown phase encoded in a higher-dimensional qudit gate, it is possible to send copies of a gate that encodes the phase to multiple receivers based on a generalized quantum teleportation. We extend this quantum gate broadcast protocol to a quantum network on directed acyclic graphs in which agents can add phase gates to be distributed and pass unknown phase gates to subsequent receivers. Similarly to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, we show that the resource state can be efficiently prepared in finite time.

Title: Charge Parity Rates in Transmon Qubits with Different Shunting Capacitors
Authors: Yi-Hsiang Huang, Haozhi Wang, Yizhou Huang, Sylvie McKnight-Milles, Zachary Steffen, B. S. Palmer
Abstract: The presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting resonators and qubits operating at millikelvin temperature has been known for decades. One metric for the number of quasiparticles affecting qubits is the rate of single-electron change in charge on the qubit island ($\textit i.e.$ the charge parity rate). Here, we have utilized a Ramsey-like pulse sequence to monitor changes in the parity states of five transmon qubits. The five qubits have shunting capacitors with two different geometries and fabricated from both Al and Ta. The charge parity rate differs by a factor of two for the two transmon designs studied here but does not depend on the material of the shunting capacitor. The underlying mechanism of the source of parity switching is further investigated in one of the qubit devices by increasing the quasiparticle trapping rate using induced vortices in the electrodes of the device. The charge parity rate exhibited a weak dependence on the quasiparticle trapping rate, indicating that the main source of charge parity events is from the production of quasiparticles across the Josephson junction. To estimate this source of quasiparticle production, we simulate and estimate pair-breaking photon absorption rates for our two qubit geometries and find a similar factor of two in the absorption rate for a background blackbody radiation temperature of $T^*\sim$ 350 mK.

Title: Exhaustive Search for Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX Calculus
Authors: Tobias Fischbach, Pierre Talbot, Pascal Bouvry
Abstract: Quantum computers allow a near-exponential speed-up for specific applications when compared to classical computers. Despite recent advances in the hardware of quantum computers, their practical usage is still severely limited due to a restricted number of available physical qubits and quantum gates, short coherence time, and high error rates. This paper lays the foundation towards a metric independent approach to quantum circuit optimization based on exhaustive search algorithms. This work uses depth-first search and iterative deepening depth-first search. We rely on ZX calculus to represent and optimize quantum circuits through the minimization of a given metric (e.g. the T-gate and edge count). ZX calculus formally guarantees that the semantics of the original circuit is preserved. As ZX calculus is a non-terminating rewriting system, we utilise a novel set of pruning rules to ensure termination while still obtaining high-quality solutions. We provide the first formalization of quantum circuit optimization using ZX calculus and exhaustive search. We extensively benchmark our approach on 100 standard quantum circuits. Finally, our implementation is integrated in the well-known libraries PyZX and Qiskit as a compiler pass to ensure applicability of our results.

Title: Tesseract: A Search-Based Decoder for Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Laleh Aghababaie Beni, Oscar Higgott, Noah Shutty
Abstract: Tesseract is a Most-Likely Error decoder designed for low-density-parity-check quantum error-correcting codes. Tesseract conducts a search through a graph on the set of all subsets of errors to find the lowest cost subset of errors consistent with the input syndrome. Although this graph is exponentially large, the search can be made efficient in practice for random errors using $A^*$ search technique along with a few pruning heuristics. We show through benchmark circuits for surface, color, and bivariate-bicycle codes that Tesseract is significantly faster than integer programming-based decoders while retaining comparable accuracy at moderate physical error rates. We also find that Tesseract can decode transversal CNOT protocols for surface codes on neutral atom quantum computers. Finally, we compare surface code and bivariate bicycle code circuits, finding that the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code is $14\times$ to $19\times$ more efficient than surface codes using our most-likely error decoding, whereas using correlated matching and BP+OSD decoders would have implied only a $10\times$ improvement. Assuming instead that long-range couplers are $10\times$ noisier, the improvement drops to around $4\times$ using Tesseract or $2\times$ using correlated matching and BP+OSD.

Title: Quantum Parameter Estimation for Detectors in Constantly Accelerated Motion
Authors: Han Wang, Jialin Zhang, Hongwei Yu
Abstract: We investigate quantum parameter estimation by analyzing the dynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the state parameters of accelerated detectors undergoing four different acceleration scenarios: linear, cusped, catenary, and circular motions. Our results show that QFI for the acceleration parameter converges to a nonnegative asymptotic value over long evolution times, with this value strongly dependent on the specific acceleration scenario. In contrast, QFI for the weight parameter degrades to zero over time. Notably, for sufficiently large accelerations, optimal precision in estimating the acceleration parameter can be achieved within a finite evolution time rather than requiring an infinitely long measurement duration. Comparing different scenarios, we find that for small accelerations relative to the detector's energy gap, linear motion provides the most accurate estimation of the weight parameter, introducing the least noise among all scenarios. However, for large accelerations, circular motion becomes the optimal scenario for estimating the weight parameter. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the estimation of the acceleration parameter, where circular motion is optimal both for small accelerations and for large accelerations over extremely long evolution times. These distinctions in QFI may provide a new tool for identifying the specific acceleration scenario of an accelerated detector.

Title: Quantum ensemble learning with a programmable superconducting processor

Wang
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is among the most exciting potential applications of quantum computing. However, the vulnerability of quantum information to environmental noises and the consequent high cost for realizing fault tolerance has impeded the quantum models from learning complex datasets. Here, we introduce AdaBoost.Q, a quantum adaptation of the classical adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm designed to enhance learning capabilities of quantum classifiers. Based on the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement, the algorithm improves the prediction accuracy by refining the attention mechanism during the adaptive training and combination of quantum classifiers. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility of our approach on a programmable superconducting processor, where we observe notable performance enhancements across various quantum machine learning models, including quantum neural networks and quantum convolutional neural networks. With AdaBoost.Q, we achieve an accuracy above 86% for a ten-class classification task over 10,000 test samples, and an accuracy of 100% for a quantum feature recognition task over 1,564 test samples. Our results demonstrate a foundational tool for advancing quantum machine learning towards practical applications, which has broad applicability to both the current noisy and the future fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Title: Preparing magnonic non-Gaussian states by adding a single magnon onto Gaussian states
Authors: Zi-Xu Lu, Huai-Bing Zhu, Xuan Zuo, Jie Li
Abstract: Quantum magnonics based on YIG spheres provides a new arena for observing macroscopic quantum states. Here we propose to prepare two kinds of non-Gaussian magnonic states by adding a single magnon onto two Gaussian states, namely, coherent and thermal states. We adopt an optomagnonic system of a YIG sphere and use fast optical pulses to weakly activate the magnon-induced Stokes scattering. Conditioned on the detection of a polarized single photon, a single magnon can be added onto an initial Gaussian state. We use a microwave cavity to prepare an initial magnon coherent state and finally read out the generated single-magnon added coherent or thermal state. Both the non-Gaussian states of a magnon mode in a large-size YIG sphere are macroscopic quantum states, which exhibit many nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature squeezing, and a negative Wigner function. Further, both states show a smooth transition from a quantum state to a classical state by changing the coherent or thermal magnon excitations and thus can be used for the fundamental study of the quantum-to-classical transition.

Title: AI-assisted hyper-dimensional broadband quantum memory with efficiency above 90% in warm atoms
Authors: Zeliang Wu, Jinxian Guo, Zhifei Yu, Wenfeng Huang, Chun-Hua Yuan, Weiping Zhang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: High-dimensional broadband quantum memory significantly expands quantum information processing capabilities, but the memory efficiency becomes insufficient when extended to high dimensions. We demonstrate an efficient quantum memorize for hyper-dimensional photons encoded with orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum (SAM). OAM information is encoded from -5 to +5, combined with spin angular momentum encoding, enabling up to 22 dimensions. To ensure high memory efficiency, an artificial intelligent algorithm, a modified Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm using Chebyshev sampling, is developed to obtain a perfect signal-control waveform matching. Memory efficiency is experimentally achieved 92% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 91% for information dimension of 6 and 80% for dimensional number to 22. The fidelity is achieved up to 99% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 96% for OAM information and 97% for SAM one, which is far beyond no-cloning limitation. Our results demonstrate superior performance and potential applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing. This achievement provides a crucial foundation for future quantum communication and quantum computing.

Title: Hamiltonian Reordering for Shallower Trotterization Circuits
Authors: C√©dric Ho Thanh
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a popular application of quantum computing, but its practical realization is hindered by the technical limitations of current devices. In this work, we focus on preprocessing Hamiltonians before Trotterization to generate shallower evolution circuits, which are less prone to noise and decoherence. Specifically, we apply graph coloring techniques to reorder Pauli terms and increase "gate parallelism". We benchmark two coloring algorithms, and report the depth reduction and computational overhead. Then, we examine how these optimized circuits affect the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Our results show that shallower circuits lead to faster convergence and reach higher energy levels compared to their non-reordered counterparts.

Title: Realizing a Continuous Set of Two-Qubit Gates Parameterized by an Idle Time
Authors: Colin Scarato, Kilian Hanke, Ants Remm, Stefania LazƒÉr, Nathan Lacroix, Dante Colao Zanuz, Alexander Flasby, Andreas Wallraff, Christoph Hellings
Abstract: Continuous gate sets are a key ingredient for near-term quantum algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a hardware-efficient, continuous set of controlled arbitrary-phase ($\mathrm{C}Z_{\theta}$) gates acting on flux-tunable transmon qubits. This implementation is robust to control pulse distortions on time scales longer than the duration of the gate, making it suitable for deep quantum circuits. Our calibration procedure makes it possible to parameterize the continuous gate set with a single control parameter, the idle time between the two rectangular halves of the net-zero control pulse. For calibration and characterization, we develop a leakage measurement based on coherent amplification, and a new cycle design for cross-entropy benchmarking. We demonstrate gate errors of $0.7 \%$ and leakage of $4\times 10^{-4}$ across the entire gate set. This native gate set has the potential to reduce the depth and improve the performance of near-term quantum algorithms compared to decompositions into $\mathrm{C}Z_{\pi}$ gates and single-qubit gates. Moreover, we expect the calibration and benchmarking methods to find further possible applications.

Title: Dynamics of Quantum Correlations within the double Caldeira-Leggett formalism
Authors: S. V. Mousavi
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of decoherence and squeezing on the dynamics of various kinds of quantum features--local quantum coherence, local entropy, EPR correlations, and entanglement--in the high-temperature limit of the double Caldeira-Leggett model, focusing on initially squeezed states. We compare two scenarios: (1) particles interacting with distinct environments and (2) particles coupled to a common environment. Our analysis reveals that common environments better preserve local coherence over time, whereas distinct environments accelerate decoherence. Temperature enhances decoherence and suppresses coherence revivals, while squeezing affects transient dynamics but not long-term coherence saturation. Local entropy increases with temperature and squeezing, though their underlying physical mechanisms differ. EPR correlations degrade due to environmental interactions, with squeezing initially enhancing them but failing to prevent their eventual loss. Entanglement exhibits distinct behaviors: in separate environments, it undergoes sudden death, whereas in common environments, it experiences a dark period whose duration shortens with stronger squeezing. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how decoherence and squeezing influence quantum correlations in open quantum systems.

Title: Optical-pumping attack on a quantum key distribution laser source
Authors: Maxim Fadeev, Anastasiya Ponosova, Qingquan Peng, Anqi Huang, Roman Shakhovoy, Vadim Makarov
Abstract: We report a new type of vulnerability in practical implementations of quantum key distribution systems. We show that it is possible to increase the pulse energy of a source laser diode not only by injection-locking it by external light near its emission wavelength of 1550 nm, but also by optically pumping it at a much shorter wavelength. We demonstrate 10% increase in pulse energy when exposing the laser diode to 1310-nm, 1.6-mW cw laser light via its fiber pigtail. This may allow an eavesdropper to steal the secret key. A possible countermeasure is to install broadband optical filters and isolators at the source's output and characterise them during the security certification.

Title: Free-space Continuous-variable Quantum Secret Sharing
Authors: Fangli Yang, Liang Chang, Daowen Qiu, Minghua Pan, Wanjun Xiong
Abstract: Free-space quantum cryptography has the potential to enable global quantum communication. However, most existing continuous-variable quantum secret sharing (CV-QSS) schemes rely on fiber channels. In this paper, we present a CV-QSS protocol designed for free-space transmission and construct models of crucial parameters, including channel transmittance, excess noise, and interruption probability, thus deriving the bound of the secret key rate. In particular, we provide a multi-source excess noise model for free-space CV-QSS based on the local local oscillator (LLO) scheme and a straightforward optimization of the noise. Furthermore, our research considers the impact of atmospheric turbulence on the protocol. Simulation results demonstrate that the intensification of atmospheric turbulence adversely affects the aforementioned crucial parameters, leading to a significant reduction in the key rate. However, our protocol shows its capability to securely share secrets over a distance of exceeding $60$ km among five participants in the presence of turbulence with $C^2_n=1\times 10^{-15}m^{-2/3}$, while maintaining a high key rate of approximately $0.55$ bit/pulse over a distance of $10$ km across twenty participants. These findings suggest that efficient CV-QSS in free space is indeed achievable. This research may serve as a reference for the design and optimization of the practical CV-QSS system.

Title: Remote preparation of motional Schr√∂dinger cat states via dissipatively-driven non-Gaussian mechanical entanglement
Authors: Zunbo Yu, Miaomiao Wei, Huatang Tan
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a driven-dissipative scheme for generating non-Gaussian mechanical entangled states and remotely preparing mechanical Schr√∂dinger cat states via the entanglement. The system under study consists of a cavity optomechanical setup with two frequency-mismatched mechanical oscillators coupled to a cavity field driven by a bichromatic pump. We show that under proper conditions, an effective Hamiltonian for nondegenerate parametric downconversion involving the two mechanical oscillators and the cavity field can be engineered. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the cavity dissipation drives the mechanical oscillators into a steady-state pair-coherent state. The no-Gaussianity and nonclassical properties, including Winger negativity, entanglement and quantum steering, of the achieved non-Gaussian mechanical state are investigated in detail. We further show that homodyne detection on one mechanical oscillator enables the remote generation of Schr√∂dinger cat states in the other oscillator through the non-Gaussian mechanical entanglement. As we show, this detection can be implemented by transferring the mechanical state to the output field of an auxiliary probe cavity coupled to the target oscillator, followed by homodyne detection on the output field. We also discuss the robustness of the mechanical entangled states and cat states against thermal fluctuations. Our findings establish a feasible approach for the dissipative and remote preparation of mechanical nonclassical states.

Title: Markov chain Monte Carlo Detector Tomography applied to a NbTiN nanobridge
Authors: F.B. Baalbergen, I.E. Zadeh, M.P. van Exter, M.J.A. de Dood
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of a flexible and highly accurate Markov chain Monte Carlo Quantum Detector Tomography method as a minimization algorithm to best describe the response of an efficient 120nm wide NbTiN superconducting nanobridge single photon detector. Separation of the internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency is possible due to the difference in saturation behavior of an ideal 1-photon threshold detector as compared to a detector with non-unity 1-photon internal quantum efficiency. From a statistical analysis of our measurements (at $T=4.23\pm0.01K$, $I=29.4\pm0.1\mu A$, $I/I_\text{switch}=0.90\pm0.01$) we find an external quantum efficiency $\eta=(1.60\pm0.02)\times10^{-6}$, a 1-photon internal quantum efficiency $p_1=0.568\pm0.008$ and a multi-photon (more than 2) internal quantum efficiency $p_{\ge 2}=1.0$.

Title: High-rate discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution with composable security
Authors: Mingze Wu, Yan Pan, Junhui Li, Heng Wang, Lu Fan, Yun Shao, Yang Li, Wei Huang, Song Yu, Bingjie Xu, Yichen Zhang
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution holds the potential to generate high secret key rates, making it a prime candidate for high-rate metropolitan quantum network applications. However, despite these promising opportunities, the realization of high-rate continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems with composable security remains an elusive goal. Here, we report a discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system with a composable secret key rate of 18.93 Mbps against collective attacks over a 25 km fiber channel. This record-breaking rate is achieved through the probability shaped 16QAM-modulated protocol, which employs semidefinite programming to ensure its composable security. Furthermore, we have employed a fully digital and precise quantum signal processing technique to reduce excess noise to extremely low levels, thereby facilitating efficient broadband system operation. While ensuring low complexity and cost, our system achieves a performance advantage of over an order of magnitude compared to previous continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems, providing a promising solution for future deployment of quantum key distribution.

Title: Estimating Bell Diagonal States with Separable Measurements
Authors: Noah Kaufmann, Maria Quadeer, David Elkouss
Abstract: Quantum network protocols depend on the availability of shared entanglement. Given that entanglement generation and distribution are affected by noise, characterization of the shared entangled states is essential to bound the errors of the protocols. This work analyzes the estimation of Bell diagonal states within quantum networks, where operations are limited to local actions and classical communication. We demonstrate the advantages of Bayesian mean estimation over direct inversion and maximum likelihood estimation, providing analytical expressions for estimation risk and supporting our findings with numerical simulations.

Title: Exponential Quantum Advantage for Simulating Open Classical Systems
Authors: Agi Villanyi, Yariv Yanay, Ari Mizel
Abstract: A recent promising arena for quantum advantage is simulating exponentially large classical systems. Here, we show how this advantage can be used to calculate the dynamics of open classical systems experiencing dissipation, including the effects of non-Markovian baths. This is a particularly interesting class of systems since dissipation plays a key role in contexts ranging from fluid dynamics to thermalization. We adopt the Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian, a generic model for dissipation in which the system is coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators with a large number of degrees of freedom. To date, the most efficient classical algorithms for simulating such systems have a polynomial dependence on the size of the bath. In this work, we give a quantum algorithm with an exponential speedup, capable of simulating $d$ system degrees of freedom coupled to $N = 2^n\gg d$ bath degrees of freedom, to within error $\varepsilon$, using $O({\rm poly}(d, n, t, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ quantum gates.

Title: An automated geometric space curve approach for designing dynamically corrected gates
Authors: Evangelos Piliouras, Dennis Lucarelli, Edwin Barnes
Abstract: The noisy nature of quantum hardware necessitates the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates in a noise-insensitive manner. While there exist many powerful methods for designing dynamically corrected gates, they typically involve an exploration across a large-dimensional landscape filled with solutions that are only locally optimal, making it challenging to find globally optimal ones. Moreover, these methods often use a single cost function to try to accomplish the two disparate goals of achieving a target gate and suppressing noise, and this can lead to unnecessary tradeoffs between the two and, consequently, lower fidelities. Here, we present a method for designing dynamically corrected gates called B√©zier Ansatz for Robust Quantum (BARQ) control to address these challenges. Rather than numerically optimizing the controls directly, BARQ instead makes use of the Space Curve Quantum Control formalism in which the quantum evolution is mapped to a geometric space curve. In the formulation used by BARQ, the boundary conditions of the space curve determine the target gate, while its shape determines the noise robustness of the corresponding gate. This allows the target gate to be fixed upfront, so that numerical optimization is only needed to achieve noise-robustness, and this is performed efficiently using a control-point parameterization of the space curve. In this way, BARQ eliminates the gate-fixing and noise-robustness tradeoff while also providing a global perspective into the control landscape, and allows for ample freedom to design experimentally friendly and robust control pulses. The pulse design is facilitated through the developed software package qurveros.

Title: Bridging wire and gate cutting with ZX-calculus
Authors: Marco Schumann, Tobias Stollenwerk, Alessandro Ciani
Abstract: Quantum circuit cutting refers to a series of techniques that allow one to partition a quantum computation on a large quantum computer into several quantum computations on smaller devices. This usually comes at the price of a sampling overhead, that is quantified by the $1$-norm of the associated decomposition. The applicability of these techniques relies on the possibility of finding decompositions of the ideal, global unitaries into quantum operations that can be simulated onto each sub-register, which should ideally minimize the $1$-norm. In this work, we show how these decompositions can be obtained diagrammatically using ZX-calculus expanding on the work of Ufrecht et al. [arXiv:2302.00387]. The central idea of our work is that since in ZX-calculus only connectivity matters, it should be possible to cut wires in ZX-diagrams by inserting known decompositions of the identity in standard quantum circuits. We show how, using this basic idea, many of the gate decompositions known in the literature can be re-interpreted as an instance of wire cuts in ZX-diagrams. Furthermore, we obtain improved decompositions for multi-qubit controlled-Z (MCZ) gates with $1$-norm equal to $3$ for any number of qubits and any partition, which we argue to be optimal. Our work gives new ways of thinking about circuit cutting that can be particularly valuable for finding decompositions of large unitary gates. Besides, it sheds light on the question of why exploiting classical communication decreases the 1-norm of a wire cut but does not do so for certain gate decompositions. In particular, using wire cuts with classical communication, we obtain gate decompositions that do not require classical communication.

Title: Fault-tolerant logical state construction based on cavity-QED network
Authors: Rui Asaoka, Yasunari Suzuki, Yuuki Tokunaga
Abstract: Exploring an efficient and scalable architecture of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is vital for demonstrating useful quantum computing. Here, we propose and evaluate a scalable and practical architecture with a cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED) network. Our architecture takes advantage of the stability of neutral atoms and the flexibility of a CQED network. We show a concrete framework for implementing surface codes and numerically analyze the logical error rate and threshold values beyond the simplified circuit-level noise model on several network structures. Although the requirement of CQED parameters is demanding given the current performance of experimental systems, we show that an error-decoding algorithm tailored to our proposed architecture, where the loss information of ancillary photons is utilized, greatly improves the error threshold. For example, the internal cooperativity, a good figure of merit of the cavity performance for quantum computing, required for FTQC is relaxed to 1/5 compared to the normal error-decoding for the surface code. Since our proposal and results can be extended to other LDPC codes straightforwardly, our approach will lead to achieve more reliable FTQC using CQED.

Title: Quantum algorithms for simulating systems coupled to bosonic modes using a hybrid resonator-qubit quantum computer

Abstract: Modeling composite systems of spins or electrons coupled to bosonic modes is of significant interest for many fields of applied quantum physics and chemistry. A quantum simulation can allow for the solution of quantum problems beyond classical numerical methods. However, implementing this on existing noisy quantum computers can be challenging due to the mapping between qubits and bosonic degrees of freedom, often requiring a large number of qubits or deep quantum circuits. In this work, we discuss quantum algorithms to solve composite systems by augmenting conventional superconducting qubits with microwave resonators used as computational elements. This enables direct representation of bosonic modes by resonators. We derive efficient algorithms for typical models and propose a device connectivity that allows for feasible scaling of simulations with linear overhead. We also show how the dissipation of resonators can be a useful parameter for modeling continuous bosonic baths. Experimental results demonstrating these methods were obtained on the IQM Resonance cloud platform, based on high-fidelity gates and tunable couplers. These results present the first digital quantum simulation including a computational resonator on a commercial quantum platform.

Title: High-fidelity entanglement between a telecom photon and a room-temperature quantum memory
Authors: Yang Wang, Alexander N. Craddock, Jaeda M. Mendoza, Rourke Sekelsky, Mael Flament, Mehdi Namazi
Abstract: Entanglement distribution through existing telecommunication infrastructure is crucial for realizing large-scale quantum networks. However, distance limitations imposed by photon losses and the no-cloning theorem present significant challenges. Quantum repeaters based on entangled telecom wavelength photons and quantum memories offer a promising solution to overcome these limitations. In this work, we report an important milestone in quantum repeater architecture by demonstrating entanglement between a telecom-wavelength (1324 nm) photon and a room-temperature quantum memory with a fidelity up to 90.2%, using simple rubidium systems for both photon generation and storage. Furthermore, we achieve high-rate photon-memory entanglement generation of up to 1,200 Bell pairs per second with 80% fidelity. The technical simplicity and robustness of our room-temperature systems paves the way towards deploying quantum networks at scale in realistic settings.

Title: Interpretation of Superradiant Ramsey Spectroscopy in a Coherent Picture Based on Transverse Spins Superposition
Authors: Ke-Xin Gao, Yuan Zhang, Shi-Lei Su, Gang Chen, Chongxin Shan, Klaus M√∏lmer
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrated Ramsey spectroscopy with delayed superradiance of strontium-88 atoms transversely excited by a laser pulse [Nat. Commun. 15, 1084 (2024)]. To illustrate the physics involved, we introduce two complementary pictures by considering the in-phase and out-phase superposition of the transverse collective spin operators of two atomic sub-ensembles, and analyze the dynamics of the whole ensemble with the Dicke states and the collective Bloch vector. Our simulations suggest that a coherent picture of the whole atomic ensemble can only be established by employing different pictures for the dynamics associated with the external driving and the cavity-mediated superradiance, and then mapping the two pictures at the end of the external driving. In the future, the pictures as developed here can be utilized to analyze in more detail the dependence of the superradiance on the relative phase of the couplings and the number of atomic sub-ensembles, and the mechanism as revealed here can be explored to study other interesting phenomena, such as weak-to-strong coupling phase transition, triggered superradiance, and quantum measurement effects.

Title: Floquet-ADAPT-VQE: A Quantum Algorithm to Simulate Non-Equilibrium Physics in Periodically Driven Systems
Authors: Abhishek Kumar, Karunya Shirali, Nicholas J. Mayhall, Sophia E. Economou, Edwin Barnes
Abstract: Non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems exhibit many fascinating phenomena absent in equilibrium systems, but simulating them on classical computers is challenging. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, Floquet-ADAPT-VQE, to simulate the non-equilibrium physics of periodically driven quantum systems. We utilize the Floquet-Hilbert space, a composition of auxiliary and physical spaces, to transform the Hamiltonian into a time-independent form. We define a cost function based on the square of the shifted extended Floquet Hamiltonian and show how to prepare Floquet eigenstates using Floquet-ADAPT-VQE. We also obtain a suitable auxiliary initial state whose squared Floquet energy is independent of the number of auxiliary qubits as well as the driving frequency, which leads to better convergence with fewer ADAPT iterations. Additionally, we provide a framework to calculate the time-dependent expectation value of observables in the Floquet state with fixed-depth quantum circuit. We demonstrate our algorithm by performing numerical simulations on a periodically driven XYZ model with a magnetic field. We also explore potential applications of our algorithm for studying various non-equilibrium phenomena in periodically driven systems.

Title: Testing eigenstate thermalization hypothesis on small scale quantum processors
Authors: Maanav Srihari, Anil Shaji
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) is a framework for discussing thermal behavior originating from chaotic dynamics in isolated many-body quantum systems. The PXP model, where certain states do not thermalize, has been compared with the Sachdev-Ye Kitaev (SYK) model, which is believed to be fully thermalizing. A gate-based quantum circuit approach is utilized to simulate time evolution and compute the Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC), a measure of the extent of chaos. Considering restrictions on implementing SYK on gate-based hardware, a simplified model called Spin-XY4 (SXY4), which has a thermal behavior similar to SYK, is tested. An alternate method, which optimizes control on an analog quantum device with the GRAPE (GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm, is also utilized to simulate the SYK model.

Title: Noise immunity in quantum optical systems through non-Hermitian topology
Authors: Jamison Sloan, Sachin Vaidya, Nicholas Rivera, Marin Soljaƒçiƒá
Abstract: Multimode nonlinear optical systems are highly valued for their ability to withstand large amounts of optical power, transmit data with high bandwidth, perform physical computations, generate quantum correlations, and much more. For many of these applications, both classical and quantum noise place limitations on important performance metrics. Moreover, it is well known that nonlinear systems tend to develop noise due to their sensitivity to initial conditions, thus motivating the development of general principles which can be used to control and mitigate noise in such systems. In this work, we show that non-reciprocity can enable the unidirectional flow of noise from the non-equilibrium steady states of nonlinear driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate that this unidirectional flow results from the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) for quantum noise. This effect provides a robust mechanism for isolating parts of the system from degradation due to excess injected noise. Our findings may lead to novel design principles for multimode amplifiers or oscillators that support high power handling while mitigating the buildup of noise. Moreover, our approach provides a new means to connect non-Hermitian topology with nonlinear many-body systems, which is expected to lead to topological descriptions of interacting states of light.

Title: Chiral cat code: Enhanced error correction induced by higher-order nonlinearities
Authors: Adri√† Labay-Mora, Alberto Mercurio, Vincenzo Savona, Gian Luca Giorgi, Fabrizio Minganti
Abstract: We introduce a Schr√∂dinger chiral cat qubit, a novel bosonic quantum code generalizing Kerr cat qubits that exploits higher-order nonlinearities. Compared to a standard Kerr cat, the chiral cat qubit allows additional correction of bit-flip errors within the Hilbert space of a single bosonic oscillator. Indeed, this code displays optical bistability, i.e., the simultaneous presence of multiple long-lived states. Two of them define the code space and two define an error space. Thanks to the chiral structure of the phase space of this system, the error space can be engineered to ``capture'' bit flip events in the code space (a bit-flip trap), without affecting the quantum information stored in the system. Therefore, it is possible to perform detection and correction of errors. We demonstrate how this topological effect can be particularly efficient in the presence of large dephasing. We provide concrete examples of the performance of the code and show the possibility of applying quantum operations rapidly and efficiently. Beyond the interest in this single technological application, our work demonstrates how the topology of phase space can enhance the performance of bosonic codes.

Title: Translating Between the Common Haar Random State Model and the Unitary Model
Authors: Eli Goldin, Mark Zhandry
Abstract: Black-box separations are a cornerstone of cryptography, indicating barriers to various goals. A recent line of work has explored black-box separations for quantum cryptographic primitives. Namely, a number of separations are known in the Common Haar Random State (CHRS) model, though this model is not considered a complete separation, but rather a starting point. A few very recent works have attempted to lift these separations to a unitary separation, which are considered complete separations. Unfortunately, we find significant errors in some of these lifting results. We prove general conditions under which CHRS separations can be generically lifted, thereby giving simple, modular, and bug-free proofs of complete unitary separations between various quantum primitives. Our techniques allow for simpler proofs of existing separations as well as new separations that were previously only known in the CHRS model.

Title: Scaling the Automated Discovery of Quantum Circuits via Reinforcement Learning with Gadgets
Authors: Jan Olle, Oleg M. Yevtushenko, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as a powerful tool for designing quantum circuits, which are essential for processing quantum information. RL applications have typically focused on circuits of small to intermediate complexity, as computation times tend to increase exponentially with growing circuit complexity. This computational explosion severely limits the scalability of RL and casts significant doubt on its broader applicability. In this paper, we propose a principled approach based on the systematic discovery and introduction of composite gates -- {\it gadgets}, that enables RL scalability, thereby expanding its potential applications. As a case study, we explore the discovery of Clifford encoders for Quantum Error Correction. We demonstrate that incorporating gadgets in the form of composite Clifford gates, in addition to standard CNOT and Hadamard gates, significantly enhances the efficiency of RL agents. Specifically, the computation speed increases (by one or even two orders of magnitude), enabling RL to discover highly complex quantum codes without previous knowledge. We illustrate this advancement with examples of QEC code discovery with parameters $ [[n,1,d]] $ for $ d \leq 7 $ and $ [[n,k,6]] $ for $ k \leq 7 $. We note that the most complicated circuits of these classes were not previously found. We highlight the advantages and limitations of the gadget-based approach. Our method paves the way for scaling the RL-based automatic discovery of complicated quantum circuits for various tasks, which may include designing logical operations between logical qubits or discovering quantum algorithms.

Title: Ladder Operator Block-Encoding
Authors: William A. Simon, Carter M. Gustin, Kamil Serafin, Alexis Ralli, Gary R. Goldstein, Peter J. Love
Abstract: We describe and analyze LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding), a framework for block-encoding second-quantized ladder operators that act upon fermionic and bosonic modes. We numerically benchmark these constructions using models arising in quantum field theories including the quartic oscillator, and phi4 and Yukawa Hamiltonians on the light front. These benchmarks show that LOBE produces block-encodings with fewer non-Clifford operations, fewer block-encoding ancillae and overall number of qubits, and lower rescaling factors for various second-quantized operators as compared to block-encoding frameworks that expand the ladder operators in the Pauli basis. The LOBE constructions also demonstrate favorable scaling with respect to key parameters, including the maximum occupation of bosonic modes, the total number of fermionic and bosonic modes, and the locality of the operators. LOBE is implemented as an open source python package to enable further applications.

Title: The waves-in-space Purcell effect for superconducting qubits
Authors: Param Patel, Mingkang Xia, Chao Zhou, Pinlei Lu, Xi Cao, Israa Yusuf, Jacob Repicky, Michael Hatridge
Abstract: Quantum information processing, especially with quantum error correction, requires both long-lived qubits and fast, quantum non-demolition readout. In superconducting circuits this leads to the requirement to both strongly couple qubits, such as transmons, to readout modes while also protecting them from associated Purcell decay through the readout port. So-called Purcell filters can provide this protection, at the cost of significant increases in circuit components and complexity. However, as we demonstrate in this work, visualizing the qubit fields in space reveals locations where the qubit fields are strong and cavity fields weak; simply placing ports at these locations provides intrinsic Purcell protection. For a $\lambda/2$ readout mode in the `chip-in-tube' geometry, we show both millisecond level Purcell protection and, conversely, greatly enhanced Purcell decay (qubit lifetime of 1~$\mu$s) simply by relocating the readout port. This method of integrating the Purcell protection into the qubit-cavity geometry can be generalized to other 3D implementations, such as post-cavities, as well as planar geometries. For qubit frequencies below the readout mode this effect is quite distinct from the multi-mode Purcell effect, which we demonstrate in a 3D-post geometry where we show both Purcell protection of the qubit while spoiling the quality factor of higher cavity harmonics to protect against dephasing due to stray photons in these modes.

Title: Semantic Wave Functions: Exploring Meaning in Large Language Models Through Quantum Formalism
Authors: Timo Aukusti Laine
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode semantic relationships in high-dimensional vector embeddings. This paper explores the analogy between LLM embedding spaces and quantum mechanics, positing that LLMs operate within a quantized semantic space where words and phrases behave as quantum states. To capture nuanced semantic interference effects, we extend the standard real-valued embedding space to the complex domain, drawing parallels to the double-slit experiment. We introduce a "semantic wave function" to formalize this quantum-derived representation and utilize potential landscapes, such as the double-well potential, to model semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued similarity measure that incorporates both magnitude and phase information, enabling a more sensitive comparison of semantic representations. We develop a path integral formalism, based on a nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation with a gauge field and Mexican hat potential, to model the dynamic evolution of LLM behavior. This interdisciplinary approach offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and potentially manipulating LLMs, with the goal of advancing both artificial and natural language understanding.

Abstract: We discuss how the classical notions of time and causal structure may emerge together with quantum-mechanical probabilities from a universal quantum state. For this, the process of decoherence between semiclassical branches is important. Our discussion is based on quantum geometrodynamics, a canonical approach to quantum gravity. In this framework, a particular boundary condition may illuminate the issue of the arrow of (classical) time in connection to the growth of entanglement entropy.

Title: Quantum complexity in gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum information science
Authors: Stefano Baiguera, Vijay Balasubramanian, Pawel Caputa, Shira Chapman, Jonas Haferkamp, Michal P. Heller, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state, or implementing a unitary, using limited resources. Over the past decade, quantum-complexity research has surged. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter and quantum gravity. Different communities apply different tools to quantum complexity, as well as define complexity differently. This review bridges the disciplines' approaches. We cover multiple definitions of complexity, as well as their key properties and applications. In quantum information, random quantum circuits proved to be an invaluable tool in extracting properties of the complexity growth of discrete quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), complexity is defined geometrically through geodesics. Complexity can be defined also in terms of state or operator spreading and tensor-network concepts. In addition to reviewing these approaches, we outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models and QFTs, including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we detail the relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the anti-de Sitter-space (AdS)/CFT correspondence. This review thereby integrates recent quantum-complexity advances across fields.

Title: Quantum teleportation between simulated binary black holes
Authors: Aiden Daniel, Tanmay Bhore, Jiannis K. Pachos, Chang Liu, Andrew Hallam
Abstract: The quantum description of a black hole predicts that quantum information hidden behind the event horizon can be teleported outside almost instantaneously. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral spin-chain model, which naturally simulates a binary black hole system, can realise this teleportation process. Our system captures two essential components of this protocol: Hawking radiation, which generates the necessary entanglement between the black holes, and optimal scrambling, which enables high-fidelity teleportation on short timescales. Through numerical simulations, we quantify the key timescales governing the process, including the Page time, radiation time, scrambling time, and butterfly velocity, showing their universal dependence on the chiral coupling strength. Our results establish the feasibility of simulating quantum properties of black holes within condensed matter systems, offering an experimentally accessible platform for probing otherwise inaccessible high-energy phenomena.

Title: Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states
Authors: Liang Mao, Fan Yang
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.

Title: Benchmarking of quantum and classical SDP relaxations for QUBO formulations of real-world logistics problems
Authors: Birte Ostermann, Taylor Garnowski, Fabian Henze, Vaibhavnath Jha, Asra Dia, Frederik Fiand, David Gross, Wendelin Gross, Julian Nowak, Timo de Wolff
Abstract: Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBOs) are intensively discussed in the realm of quantum computing and polynomial optimization. We provide a vast experimental study of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of QUBOs using sums of squares methods and on Hamiltonian Updates. We test on QUBO reformulations of industry-based instances of the (open) vehicle routing problem and the (affinity-based) slotting problem -- two common combinatorial optimization problems in logistics. Beyond comparing the performance of various methods and software, our results reaffirm that optimizing over non-generic, real-world instances provides additional challenges. In consequence, this study underscores recent developments towards structure exploitation and specialized solver development for the used methods and simultaneously shows that further research is necessary in this direction both on the classical and the quantum side.

Title: Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Mutliwavelets and DMRG
Authors: Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.

Title: Scattering resonances and pairing in a Rabi-coupled Fermi gas
Authors: Olivier Bleu, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Cesar R. Cabrera, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of using a Rabi drive to tune the interactions in an atomic Fermi gas. Specifically, we consider the scenario where two fermion species (spins) are Rabi coupled and interacting with a third uncoupled species. Using an exact calculation within a minimal low-energy model, we derive analytical expressions for the effective scattering length and effective range that characterize the collisions between a Rabi-dressed atom and an atom from the third species. In particular, we find that new scattering resonances emerge in the Rabi-coupled system, which we demonstrate are linked to the existence of hybrid two-body bound states. Furthermore, we show via a generalized Thouless criterion that the scattering properties have a direct impact on the superfluid transitions in the Rabi-coupled Fermi gas. The presence of Rabi-induced resonances thus has implications for the investigation of many-body physics with driven atomic gases.

Title: Scaffold-Assisted Window Junctions for Superconducting Qubit Fabrication

Abstract: The superconducting qubit is one of the promising directions in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), which requires many high-quality qubits. To achieve this, it is desirable to leverage modern semiconductor industry technology to ensure quality, uniformity, and reproducibility. However, conventional Josephson junction fabrication relies mainly on resist-assistant double-angle evaporation, posing integration challenges. Here, we demonstrate a lift-off-free qubit fabrication that integrates seamlessly with existing industrial technologies. This method employs a silicon oxide (SiO$_2$) scaffold to define an etched window with a well-controlled size to form a Josephson junction. The SiO$_2$, which has a large dielectric loss, is etched away in the final step using vapor HF leaving little residue. This Window junction (WJ) process mitigates the degradation of qubit quality during fabrication and allows clean removal of the scaffold. The WJ process is validated by inspection and Josephson junction measurement. The scaffold removal process is verified by measuring the quality factor of the resonators. Furthermore, compared to scaffolds fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), qubits made by WJ through physical vapor deposition (PVD) achieve relaxation time up to $57\,\mu\text{s}$. Our results pave the way for a lift-off-free qubit fabrication process, designed to be compatible with modern foundry tools and capable of minimizing damage to the substrate and material surfaces.

Title: Hole spin splitting in a Ge quantum dot with finite barriers
Authors: Jiawei Wang, Xuedong Hu, Herbert F Fotso
Abstract: We study the low-energy spectrum of a single hole confined in a planar Ge quantum dot (QD) within the effective-mass formalism. The QD is sandwiched between two GeSi barriers of finite potential height grown along the [001] direction. To treat this finite barrier problem, we adopt an independent-band approach in dealing with boundary conditions. The effects of different system parameters are investigated, including the width of the out-of-plane confining well, the size of the dot, and silicon concentration in the confining layers. The more accurate finite-barrier model results in the non-negligible dependence of the anisotropic $g$-factor on the choice of boundary conditions and on the silicon concentration in the barrier. Furthermore, while the ideal model of a planar dot with a square-well heterostructure already has an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, realistic effects arising from the experimental setup may give rise to additional contributions. We investigate the impact from the top-gate electric field and the residual tensile strain on the qubit states. The results indicate that these effects are important contributions to the total spin-orbit coupling which enables fast electric control.

Title: Josephson vortices and persistent current in a double-ring supersolid system
Authors: Malte Schubert, Koushik Mukherjee, Tilman Pfau, Stephanie Reimann
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.

Title: Financial Fraud Detection with Entropy Computing
Authors: Babak Emami, Wesley Dyk, David Haycraft, Carrie Spear, Lac Nguyen, Nicholas Chancellor
Abstract: We introduce CVQBoost, a novel classification algorithm that leverages early hardware implementing Quantum Computing Inc's Entropy Quantum Computing (EQC) paradigm, Dirac-3 [Nguyen et. al. arXiv:2407.04512]. We apply CVQBoost to a fraud detection test case and benchmark its performance against XGBoost, a widely utilized ML method. Running on Dirac-3, CVQBoost demonstrates a significant runtime advantage over XGBoost, which we evaluate on high-performance hardware comprising up to 48 CPUs and four NVIDIA L4 GPUs using the RAPIDS AI framework. Our results show that CVQBoost maintains competitive accuracy (measured by AUC) while significantly reducing training time, particularly as dataset size and feature complexity increase. To assess scalability, we extend our study to large synthetic datasets ranging from 1M to 70M samples, demonstrating that CVQBoost on Dirac-3 is well-suited for large-scale classification tasks. These findings position CVQBoost as a promising alternative to gradient boosting methods, offering superior scalability and efficiency for high-dimensional ML applications such as fraud detection.

Title: Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Xuhao Jiang, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we demonstrate that SVD fails to correctly reproduce the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.

Title: On the Limits of Distributed Quantum Computing
Authors: Francesco d'Amore
Abstract: Quantum advantage is well-established in centralized computing, where quantum algorithms can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical ones. In the distributed setting, significant progress has been made in bandwidth-limited networks, where quantum distributed networks have shown computational advantages over classical counterparts. However, the potential of quantum computing in networks that are constrained only by large distances is not yet understood. We focus on the LOCAL model of computation (Linial, FOCS 1987), a distributed computational model where computational power and communication bandwidth are unconstrained, and its quantum generalization. In this brief survey, we summarize recent progress on the quantum-LOCAL model outlining its limitations with respect to its classical counterpart: we discuss emerging techniques, and highlight open research questions that could guide future efforts in the field.

Title: Nonreciprocal quantum photon-pair source with chiral ferroelectric nematics
Authors: Jin-Tao Pan, Yun-Kun Wu, Ling-Ling Ma, Ning Wang, Xin-Yu Tao, Bo-Han Zhu, Shu Wang, Fang-Wen Sun, Guang-Can Guo, Hui Jing, Xi-Feng Ren, Yan-Qing Lu
Abstract: Quantum nonreciprocity-a fundamental phenomenon enabling directional control of quantum states and photon correlations-has long been recognized as pivotal for quantum technologies. However, the experimental realization of nonreciprocal quantum photon-pair generation, as a critical prerequisite for advancing quantum systems, continues to be an outstanding challenge that remains unaddressed in practice. Here, we experimentally implement a highly-efficient nonreciprocal quantum photon source in a micro/nano-scale helical structured nonlinear optical fluid. Intriguing helical quasi-phase matching is achieved by deliberately engineering the pitch of the chiral ferroelectric structure, thus enabling spontaneous parametric down-conversion with record-high brightness (5,801.6 Hz*mW-1, 10,071% enhancement over phase-mismatched systems) and high coincidence-to-accidental ratio, rivaling state-of-the-art centimeter-scale nonlinear crystals. In particular, by tailoring the ferroelectric helix structure with orthogonally aligned head and tail polarization vectors, we demonstrate up to 22.6 dB isolation in biphoton generation coupled with nonreciprocal quantum polarization states, while maintaining classical optical reciprocity. This quantum liquid-crystal-based platform, combining flexible tunability and superior performance of purely quantum nonreciprocity at micro/nano scales, builds a bridge between a wide range of soft-matter systems, nonreciprocal physics, and emerging quantum photonic technologies.

Title: Matching Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Simulations in (2+1)-dimensional U(1) Gauge Theory
Authors: C. F. Gro√ü, S. Romiti, L. Funcke, K. Jansen, A. Kan, S. K√ºhn, C. Urbach
Abstract: At finite lattice spacing, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian predictions differ due to discretization effects. In the Hamiltonian limit, i.e. at vanishing temporal lattice spacing $a_t$, the path integral approach in the Lagrangian formalism reproduces the results of the Hamiltonian theory. In this work, we numerically calculate the Hamiltonian limit of a U$(1)$ gauge theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions. This is achieved by Monte Carlo simulations in the Lagrangian formalism with lattices that are anisotropic in the time direction. For each ensemble, we determine the ratio between the temporal and spatial scale with the static quark potential and extrapolate to $a_t \to 0$. Our results are compared with the data from Hamiltonian simulations at small volumes, showing agreement within $<2\sigma$. These results can be used to match the two formalisms.

Title: Real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices
Authors: Tian-Hua Yang, Chen Fang
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.

Title: Additive Manufacturing for Advanced Quantum Technologies
Authors: F. Wang, N. Cooper, D. Johnson, B. Hopton, T. M. Fromhold, R. Hague, A. Murray, R. McMullen, L. Turyanska, L. Hackerm√ºller
Abstract: The development of quantum technology has opened up exciting opportunities to revolutionize computing and communication, timing and navigation systems, enable non-invasive imaging of the human body, and probe fundamental physics with unprecedented precision. Alongside these advancements has come an increase in experimental complexity and a correspondingly greater dependence on compact, efficient and reliable hardware. The drive to move quantum technologies from laboratory prototypes to portable, real-world instruments has incentivized miniaturization of experimental systems relating to a strong demand for smaller, more robust and less power-hungry quantum hardware and for increasingly specialized and intricate components. Additive manufacturing, already heralded as game-changing for many manufacturing sectors, is especially well-suited to this task owing to the comparatively large amount of design freedom it enables and its ability to produce intricate three-dimensional forms and specialized components. Herein we review work conducted to date on the application of additive manufacturing to quantum technologies, discuss the current state of the art in additive manufacturing in optics, optomechanics, magnetic components and vacuum equipment, and consider pathways for future advancement. We also give an overview of the research and application areas most likely to be impacted by the deployment of additive manufacturing techniques within the quantum technology sector.

Title: Mechanical Sensors for Ultraheavy Dark Matter Searches via Long-range Forces
Authors: Juehang Qin, Dorian W. P. Amaral, Sunil A. Bhave, Erqian Cai, Daniel Carney, Rafael F. Lang, Shengchao Li, Alberto M. Marino, Claire Marvinney, Jared R. Newton, Jacob M. Taylor, Christopher Tunnell
Abstract: Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $>70\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.

Title: Exact Quantum Dynamics, Shortcuts to Adiabaticity, and Quantum Quenches in Strongly-Correlated Many-Body Systems: The Time-Dependent Jastrow Ansatz
Authors: Jing Yang, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: The description of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium presents a fundamental challenge due to the vast amount of information it requires. We introduce a generalization of the Jastrow ansatz for time-dependent wavefunctions that offers an efficient and exact description of the time evolution of various strongly correlated systems. Previously known exact solutions are characterized by scale invariance, enforcing self-similar evolution of local correlations, such as the spatial density. However, we demonstrate that a complex-valued time-dependent Jastrow ansatz (TDJA) is not restricted to scale invariance and can describe a broader class of dynamical processes lacking this symmetry. The associated time evolution is equivalent to the implementation of a shortcut to adiabaticity (STA) via counterdiabatic driving along a continuous manifold of quantum states described by a real-valued TDJA, providing a framework for engineering exact STA in strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. We illustrate our findings in systems with inverse-square interactions, such as the Calogero-Sutherland and hyperbolic models, supplemented with pairwise logarithmic interactions, as well as in the long-range Lieb-Liniger model, where bosons experience both contact and Coulomb interactions in one dimension. Our results enable the study of quench dynamics in all these models and serve as a benchmark for numerical and quantum simulations of nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems with continuous variables.

Title: Quantum memory assisted observable estimation
Authors: Liubov A. Markovich, Attaallah Almasi, Sina Zeytinoƒülu, Johannes Borregaard
Abstract: The estimation of many-qubit observables is an essential task of quantum information processing. The generally applicable approach is to decompose the observables into weighted sums of multi-qubit Pauli strings, i.e., tensor products of single-qubit Pauli matrices, which can readily be measured with single qubit rotations. The accumulation of shot noise in this approach, however, severely limits the achievable variance for a finite number of measurements. We introduce a novel method, dubbed Coherent Pauli Summation (CPS) that circumvents this limitation by exploiting access to a single-qubit quantum memory in which measurement information can be stored and accumulated. Our algorithm offers a reduction in the required number of measurements for a given variance that scales linearly with the number of Pauli strings of the decomposed observable. Our work demonstrates how a single long-coherence qubit memory can assist the operation of noisy many-qubit quantum devices in a cardinal task.

Title: Characterization of coherent errors in gate layers with robustness to Pauli noise
Authors: Noah Kaufmann, Ivan Rojkov, Florentin Reiter
Abstract: Characterization of quantum devices generates insights into their sources of disturbances. State-of-the-art characterization protocols often focus on incoherent noise and eliminate coherent errors when using Pauli or Clifford twirling techniques. This approach biases the structure of the effective noise and adds a circuit and sampling overhead. We motivate the extension of an incoherent local Pauli noise model to coherent errors and present a practical characterization protocol for an arbitrary gate layer. Notably, the coherent noise estimation is robust to Pauli noise. We demonstrate our protocol on a superconducting hardware platform and identify the leading coherent errors. To verify the characterized noise structure, we mitigate its coherent and incoherent components using a gate-level coherent noise mitigation scheme in conjunction with probabilistic error cancellation. The proposed characterization procedure opens up possibilities for device calibration, hardware development, and improvement of error mitigation and correction techniques.

Title: Trainability and Expressivity of Hamming-Weight Preserving Quantum Circuits for Machine Learning
Authors: L√©o Monbroussou, Eliott Z. Mamon, Jonas Landman, Alex B. Grilo, Romain Kukla, Elham Kashefi
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has become a promising area for real world applications of quantum computers, but near-term methods and their scalability are still important research topics. In this context, we analyze the trainability and controllability of specific Hamming weight preserving variational quantum circuits (VQCs). These circuits use qubit gates that preserve subspaces of the Hilbert space, spanned by basis states with fixed Hamming weight $k$. In this work, we first design and prove the feasibility of new heuristic data loaders, performing quantum amplitude encoding of $\binom{n}{k}$-dimensional vectors by training an $n$-qubit quantum circuit. These data loaders are obtained using controllability arguments, by checking the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM)'s rank. Second, we provide a theoretical justification for the fact that the rank of the QFIM of any VQC state is almost-everywhere constant, which is of separate interest. Lastly, we analyze the trainability of Hamming weight preserving circuits, and show that the variance of the $l_2$ cost function gradient is bounded according to the dimension $\binom{n}{k}$ of the subspace. This proves conditions of existence/lack of Barren Plateaus for these circuits, and highlights a setting where a recent conjecture on the link between controllability and trainability of variational quantum circuits does not apply.

Title: Hacking Cryptographic Protocols with Advanced Variational Quantum Attacks
Authors: Borja Aizpurua, Pablo Bermejo, Josu Etxezarreta Martinez, Roman Orus
Abstract: Here we introduce an improved approach to Variational Quantum Attack Algorithms (VQAA) on crytographic protocols. Our methods provide robust quantum attacks to well-known cryptographic algorithms, more efficiently and with remarkably fewer qubits than previous approaches. We implement simulations of our attacks for symmetric-key protocols such as S-DES, S-AES and Blowfish. For instance, we show how our attack allows a classical simulation of a small 8-qubit quantum computer to find the secret key of one 32-bit Blowfish instance with 24 times fewer number of iterations than a brute-force attack. Our work also shows improvements in attack success rates for lightweight ciphers such as S-DES and S-AES. Further applications beyond symmetric-key cryptography are also discussed, including asymmetric-key protocols and hash functions. In addition, we also comment on potential future improvements of our methods. Our results bring one step closer assessing the vulnerability of large-size classical cryptographic protocols with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and set the stage for future research in quantum cybersecurity.

Title: Optimal sampling of tensor networks targeting wave function's fast decaying tails
Authors: Marco Ballarin, Pietro Silvi, Simone Montangero, Daniel Jaschke
Abstract: We introduce an optimal strategy to sample quantum outcomes of local measurement strings for isometric tensor network states. Our method generates samples based on an exact cumulative bounding function, without prior knowledge, in the minimal amount of tensor network contractions. The algorithm avoids sample repetition and, thus, is efficient at sampling distribution with exponentially decaying tails. We illustrate the computational advantage provided by our optimal sampling method through various numerical examples, involving condensed matter, optimization problems, and quantum circuit scenarios. Theory predicts up to an exponential speedup reducing the scaling for sampling the space up to an accumulated unknown probability $\epsilon$ from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ for a decaying probability distribution. We confirm this in practice with over one order of magnitude speedup or multiple orders improvement in the error depending on the application. Our sampling strategy extends beyond local observables, e.g., to quantum magic.

Title: Bound polariton states in the Dicke-Ising model
Authors: Juan Rom√°n-Roche, √Ålvaro G√≥mez-Le√≥n, Fernando Luis, David Zueco
Abstract: We present a study of hybrid light-matter excitations in cavity QED materials using the Dicke-Ising model as a theoretical framework. Leveraging linear response theory, we derive the exact excitations of the system in the thermodynamic limit. Our results demonstrate that the cavity can localize spin excitations, leading to the formation of bound polaritons, where the cavity acts as an impurity of the two-excitation band, localizing spin-wave pairs around single-spin domains. We derive the condition for the existence of these bound states and discuss its satisfiability in different regimes. Finally, we show that these effects persist in finite systems using exact-diagonalization calculations.

Title: Linear response theory for cavity QED materials at arbitrary light-matter coupling strengths
Authors: Juan Rom√°n-Roche, √Ålvaro G√≥mez-Le√≥n, Fernando Luis, David Zueco
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for materials collectively coupled to a cavity that is valid in all regimes of light-matter coupling, including symmetry-broken phases. We present and compare two different approaches. First, using a coherent path integral formulation for the partition function to obtain thermal Green functions. This approach relies on a saddle point expansion for the action, that can be truncated in the thermodynamic limit. Second, by formulating the equations of motion for the retarded Green functions and solving them. We use a mean-field decoupling of high-order Green functions in order to obtain a closed, solvable system of equations. Both approaches yield identical results in the calculation of response functions for the cavity and material. These are obtained in terms of the bare cavity and material responses. In combination, the two techniques clarify the validity of a mean-field decoupling in correlated light-matter systems and provide complementary means to compute finite-size corrections to the thermodynamic limit. The theory is formulated for a general model that encompasses most of the systems typically considered in the field of cavity QED materials. Finally, we provide a detailed application of the theory to the Quantum Hall effect and to a collection of spin models.

Title: Error mitigation with stabilized noise in superconducting quantum processors

Abstract: Pre-fault tolerant quantum computers have already demonstrated the ability to estimate observable values accurately, at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. This has been enabled by error mitigation techniques that often rely on a representative model on the device noise. However, learning and maintaining these models is complicated by fluctuations in the noise over unpredictable time scales, for instance, arising from resonant interactions between superconducting qubits and defect two-level systems (TLS). Such interactions affect the stability and uniformity of device performance as a whole, but also affect the noise model accuracy, leading to incorrect observable estimation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that tuning of the qubit-TLS interactions helps reduce noise instabilities and consequently enables more reliable error-mitigation performance. These experiments provide a controlled platform for studying the performance of error mitigation in the presence of quasi-static noise. We anticipate that the capabilities introduced here will be crucial for the exploration of quantum applications on solid-state processors at non-trivial scales.

Title: Ground-state selection via many-body superradiant decay
Authors: Wai-Keong Mok, Stuart J. Masson, Dan M. Stamper-Kurn, Tanya Zelevinsky, Ana Asenjo-Garcia
Abstract: For a single particle, relaxation into different ground states is governed by fixed branching ratios determined by the transition matrix element and the environment. Here, we show that in many-body open quantum systems the occupation probability of one ground state can be boosted well beyond what is dictated by single-particle branching ratios. Despite the competition, interactions suppress all but the dominant decay transition, leading to a 'winner takes all' dynamic where the system primarily settles into the dominant ground state. We prove that, in the presence of permutation symmetry, this problem is exactly solvable for any number of competing channels. Additionally, we develop an approximate model for the dynamics by mapping the evolution onto a fluid continuity equation, and analytically demonstrate that the dominant transition ratio converges to unity as a power law with increasing system size, for any branching ratios. This near-deterministic preparation of the dominant ground state has broad applicability. As an example, we discuss a protocol for molecular photoassociation where collective dynamics effectively acts as a catalyst, amplifying the yield in a specific final state. Our results open new avenues for many-body strategies in the preparation and control of quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Dissipative Search via Lindbladians
Authors: Peter J. Eder, Jernej Rudi Fin≈ægar, Sarah Braun, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: Closed quantum systems follow a unitary time evolution that can be simulated on quantum computers. By incorporating non-unitary effects via, e.g., measurements on ancilla qubits, these algorithms can be extended to open-system dynamics, such as Markovian processes described by the Lindblad master equation. In this paper, we analyze the convergence criteria and speed of a Markovian, purely dissipative quantum random walk on an unstructured classical search space. Notably, we show that certain jump operators make the quantum process replicate a classical one, while others yield differences between open quantum (OQRW) and classical random walks. We also clarify a previously observed quadratic speedup, demonstrating that OQRWs are no more efficient than classical search. Finally, we analyze a dissipative discrete-time ground-state preparation algorithm with a lower implementation cost. This allows us to interpolate between the dissipative and the unitary domain and thereby illustrate the important role of coherence for the quadratic speedup.

Title: Verifying the analogy between transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems and inductively-coupled fluxoniums
Authors: Wei-Ju Lin, Hyunheung Cho, Yinqi Chen, Maxim G. Vavilov, Chen Wang, Vladimir E. Manucharyan
Abstract: We report a detailed characterization of two inductively coupled superconducting fluxonium qubits for implementing high-fidelity cross-resonance gates. Our circuit stands out because it behaves very closely to the case of two transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems. In particular, the generally unwanted static ZZ-term due to the non-computational transitions is nearly absent despite a strong qubit-qubit hybridization. Spectroscopy of the non-computational transitions reveals a spurious LC-mode arising from the combination of the coupling inductance and the capacitive links between the terminals of the two qubit circuits. Such a mode has a minor effect on our specific device, but it must be carefully considered for optimizing future designs.

Title: Preparation of high fidelity entangled cat states with composite pulses
Authors: Ge-Ge Gu, Dong-Sheng Li, Ye-Hong Chen, Bi-Hua Huang, Yan Xia
Abstract: We propose a protocol for the preparation of high-fidelity entangled cat states with composite pulses. The physical model contains two Kerr-nonlinear resonators and a cavity. By properly designing the parameters, each Kerr-nonlinear resonator is confined in the cat-state subspace and the entangled cat states can be generated efficiently. We introduce composite two-photon drives with multiple amplitudes and frequencies to improve the fidelity of the entangled cat states in the presence of parameter errors. The performance of the protocol is estimated by taking into account the parametric errors and decoherence. Numerical simulation results show that the protocol is insensitive to timing error and detuning error, and has strong robustness to decoherence. We hope the protocol may provide a method for preparing stable entangled cat states.

Title: Impurity-induced counter skin-effect and linear modes in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Nico G. Leumer, Dario Bercioux
Abstract: Non-reciprocal lattice systems are among the simplest non-Hermitian systems, exhibiting several key features absent in their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with an impurity and unveil how the impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system. We present an exact analytical solution to the problem under both open and periodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and strength. This exact solution is thoroughly validated by numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity strength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique skin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect that counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the impurity-induced counter skin-effect. These findings offer unprecedented insights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities, elucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's non-reciprocal nature. Furthermore, our results suggest potential applications in quantum sensing, where the unique characteristics of the impurity-induced counter skin-effect could be harnessed for enhanced sensitivity and precision.

Title: Deep thermalization under charge-conserving quantum dynamics
Authors: Rui-An Chang, Harshank Shrotriya, Wen Wei Ho, Matteo Ippoliti
Abstract: "Deep thermalization" describes the emergence of universal wavefunction distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wavefunction distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the limiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy principles rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This limiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and measurement basis, a `coarse-graining' that is an essential feature of bona fide thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary approaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations in either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical calculations using a `replica limit' approach, applicable when charge fluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but not both; (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the most general case. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.

Title: Designing a compact cavity-enhanced source of entangled photons
Authors: ≈Ωiga Pu≈°avec, Lara Ulƒçakar, Rainer Kaltenbaek
Abstract: Entanglement will be the key resource of future large-scale quantum networks, enabling quantum communication and advanced quantum applications like distributed quantum sensing and distributed quantum computing. To this end, entanglement will have to be distributed over large distances and efficiently coupled to quantum devices at the network nodes. This requires the entangled photons to have wavelengths and bandwidths compatible with the quantum memories in quantum repeater nodes or quantum devices at client nodes. Here, we present a novel cavity-enhanced source design using two nonlinear crystals inside a single cavity. We provide detailed considerations balancing the complexity of the cavity design with the photon bandwidth and the entanglement quality.

Title: Splitting and connecting singlets in atomic quantum circuits
Authors: Zijie Zhu, Yann Kiefer, Samuel Jele, Marius G√§chter, Giacomo Bisson, Konrad Viebahn, Tilman Esslinger
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.

Title: Thermalization rates and quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances: insights from operator hydrodynamics
Authors: Carolyn Zhang, Laimei Nie, Curt von Keyserlingk
Abstract: In thermalizing many-body quantum systems without conservation laws such as ergodic Floquet and random unitary circuits, local expectation values are predicted to decay to their equilibrium values exponentially quickly. In this work we derive a relationship between said exponential decay rate $\overline{g}$ and the operator spreading properties of a local unitary evolution. A hydrodynamical picture for operator spreading allows us to argue that, for random unitary circuits, $\overline{g}$ is encoded by the leading eigenvalue of a dynamical map obtained by enriching unitary dynamics with dissipation, in the limit of weak dissipation. We argue that the size of the eigenvalue does not depend on the details of this weak dissipation (given mild assumptions on properties of the ergodic dynamics), so long as it only suppresses large operators significantly. Our calculations are based on analytical results for random unitary circuits, but we argue that similar results hold for ergodic Floquet systems. These conjectures are in accordance with existing results which numerically obtain quantum many-body analogues of classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances [T. Prosen J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 L737 (2002), T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] by studying unitary evolutions subject to weak dissipation.

Title: Quantum Approximate Counting with Additive Error: Hardness and Optimality
Authors: Mason L. Rhodes, Sam Slezak, Anirban Chowdhury, Yiƒüit Suba≈üƒ±
Abstract: Quantum counting is the task of determining the dimension of the subspace of states that are accepted by a quantum verifier circuit. It is the quantum analog of counting the number of valid solutions to NP problems -- a problem well-studied in theoretical computer science with far-reaching implications in computational complexity. The complexity of solving the class #BQP of quantum counting problems, either exactly or within suitable approximations, is related to the hardness of computing many-body physics quantities arising in algebraic combinatorics. Here, we address the complexity of quantum approximate counting under additive error. First, we show that computing additive approximations to #BQP problems to within an error exponential in the number of witness qubits in the corresponding verifier circuit is as powerful as polynomial-time quantum computation. Next, we show that returning an estimate within error that is any smaller is #BQP-hard. Finally, we show that additive approximations to a restricted class of #BQP problems are equivalent in computational hardness to the class DQC1. Our work parallels results on additively approximating #P and GapP functions.

Title: Long optical coherence times and coherent rare earth-magnon coupling in a rare earth doped anti-ferromagnet
Authors: Masaya Hiraishi, Zachary H. Roberts, Gavin G. G. King, Luke S. Trainor, Jevon J. Longdell
Abstract: Rare-earth ions are characterised by transitions with very narrow linewidths even in solid state crystals. Exceedingly long coherence times have been shown on both spin and optical transitions of rare-earth-ion doped crystals. A key factor, and generally the limitation, for such coherence times, is the effects of electronic and nuclear spins in the host crystal. Despite the attractive prospect, a low-strain, spin-free host crystal for rare-earth-ion dopants has not yet been demonstrated. The dopants experience the lowest strain when they substitute for another rare earth (including yttrium). However every stable isotope of the trivalent rare earth ions has either an electron spin, an nuclear spin, or both. The long optical coherence times reported here with erbium dopants in antiferromagnetically ordered gadolinium vanandate suggest an alternative method to achieve the quiet magnetic environment needed for long coherence times: use a magnetic host fully concentrated in electron spins and operate at temperatures low enough for these spins to be ordered. We also observe avoided crossings in the optical spectra, caused by strong coupling between the erbium ions and gadolinium magnons in the host crystal. This suggests the exciting prospect of microwave to optical quantum transduction using the rare-earth ions in these materials mediated by magnons of the host spins.

Title: On the Significance of Intermediate Latents: Distinguishing Quantum Causal Scenarios with Indistinguishable Classical Analogs
Authors: Daniel Centeno, Elie Wolfe
Abstract: The use of graphical models to represent causal hypotheses has enabled revolutionary progress in the study of the foundations of quantum theory. Here we consider directed acyclic graphs each of which contains both nodes representing observed variables as well as nodes representing latent or hidden variables. When comparing distinct causal structure, a natural question to ask is if they can explain distinct sets of observable distributions or not. Statisticians have developed a great variety of tools for resolving such questions under the assumption that latent nodes be interpreted classically. Here we highlight how the change to a quantum interpretation of the latent nodes induces distinctions between causal scenarios that would be classically indistinguishable. We especially concentrate on quantum scenarios containing latent nodes with at least one latent parent, a.k.a. possessing intermediate latents. This initial survey demonstrates that many such quantum processes can be operationally distinguished by considerations related to monogamy of nonlocality, especially when computationally aided by a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations which we tailor for the study such scenarios. We conclude by clarifying the challenges that prevent the generalization of this work, calling attention to open problems regarding observational (in)equivalence of quantum causal structures with intermediate latents.

Title: Fully quantum inflation: quantum marginal problem constraints in the service of causal inference
Authors: Isaac D. Smith, Elie Wolfe, Robert W. Spekkens
Abstract: Consider the problem of deciding, for a particular multipartite quantum state, whether or not it is realizable in a quantum network with a particular causal structure. This is a fully quantum version of what causal inference researchers refer to as the problem of causal discovery. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum version of the inflation technique for causal inference, which leverages the quantum marginal problem. The primary example by which we illustrate the utility of this method is testing compatibility of tripartite quantum states with the quantum network known as the triangle scenario. We show, in particular, how the method yields a complete classification of pure three-qubit states into those that are and those that are not compatible with the triangle scenario. We also provide some illustrative examples involving mixed states and some where one or more of the systems is higher-dimensional. Furthermore, we examine the question of when the incompatibility of a multipartite quantum state with a causal structure can be inferred from the incompatibility of a joint probability distribution induced by implementing measurements on each subsystem. Finally, we present a family of networks, which include the triangle scenario as a special case, for which causal compatibility constraints can be derived.

Title: Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy
Authors: Eric D. Schultz, Keiichiro Furuya, Laimei Nie
Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry has seen little study. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is easily adaptable for study of symmetry in other probes of quantum chaos.

Title: Generalized Uncertainty Relation Between an Observable and Its Derivative
Authors: Tarek Yehia
Abstract: The generalized uncertainty connection between the fluctuations of a quantum observable and its temporal derivative is derived in this study, we demonstrate that the product of an observable's uncertainties and its time derivative is bounded by half the modulus of the expectation value of the commutator between the observable and its derivative, using the Cauchy Schwarz inequality and the standard definitions of operator variances. In order to connect the dynamical evolution of observables to their inherent uncertainties, we reformulate the bound in terms of a double commutator by expressing the derivative in terms of the Hamiltonian via the Heisenberg equation of motion. Next, we apply this generalized relation to a spin particle to demonstrate its usefulness in a magnetic field that changes over time, and expand the study to include observables that have a clear temporal dependence. Our findings provide greater understanding of quantum dynamics and the influence of time-dependent interactions on measurement precision in addition to recovering the traditional uncertainty relations for static systems.

Title: Noise effects on the diagnostics of quantum chaos
Authors: Tingfei Li
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of noise on the diagnostics of quantum chaos, focusing on three primary tools: the spectral form factor (SFF), Krylov complexity, and out-of-time correlators (OTOCs). Utilizing a closed quantum system model with white noise, we demonstrate that increasing noise strength leads to an exponential suppression of these diagnostic measures. Specifically, our findings reveal that in the strong noise limit, the SFF, two-point correlation function, and OTOCs become ineffective in distinguishing chaotic behavior. The SFF is particularly impacted, exhibiting a significant decay that obscures its ability to identify quantum chaos. This study highlights the challenges posed by environmental noise in accurately diagnosing quantum chaotic systems and suggests that traditional methods may require adaptation to remain effective in realistic open quantum systems. Our results underscore the need for further research into robust diagnostic techniques that can account for noise-induced effects in quantum chaotic systems.

Title: Quantum Dual Extended Hamming Code Immune to Collective Coherent Errors
Authors: En-Jui Chang
Abstract: Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit experiences evolution due to its kinetic Hamiltonian. Quantum error correction (QEC) codes are essential in protecting quantum information from both CC and stochastic Pauli errors. While stabilizer codes are designed to correct low-weight stochastic Pauli errors, they are less effective against high-weight errors. Constant excitation (CE) codes, however, are immune to CC errors by ensuring that codewords have constant excitation. However, this comes at the cost of increased qubit overhead, raising the expense of QEC hardware and logical qubit infrastructure. In this work, we propose a new family of CE stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r-(r+1), 4]]$. Compared to the existing $[[20,1,4]]$ CE stabilizer code, our smallest instance, the $[[8,1,4]]$ CE stabilizer code, significantly reduces the number of physical qubits required. Furthermore, this new CE code family improves the asymptotics code rate from $\frac{1}{8}$ in our previous work~\cite{2412.16450} to $\frac{1}{2}$, offering a more efficient trade-off between error correction and qubit overhead.

Title: Numerical security analysis for quantum key distribution with partial state characterization
Authors: Guillermo Curr√°s-Lorenzo, √Ålvaro Navarrete, Javier N√∫√±ez-Bon, Margarida Pereira, Marcos Curty
Abstract: Numerical security proofs offer a versatile approach for evaluating the secret-key generation rate of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, existing methods typically require perfect source characterization, which is unrealistic in practice due to the presence of inevitable encoding imperfections and side channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel security proof technique based on semidefinite programming that can evaluate the secret-key rate for both prepare-and-measure and measurement-device-independent QKD protocols when only partial information about the emitted states is available, significantly improving the applicability and practical relevance compared to existing numerical techniques. We demonstrate that our method can outperform current analytical approaches addressing partial state characterization in terms of achievable secret-key rates, particularly for protocols with non-qubit encoding spaces. This represents a significant step towards bridging the gap between theoretical security proofs and practical QKD implementations.

Title: Grand Unification of All Discrete Wigner Functions on $d \times d$ Phase Space
Authors: Lucky K. Antonopoulos, Dominic G. Lewis, Jack Davis, Nicholas Funai, Nicolas C. Menicucci
Abstract: We present a universal framework for defining, visualising, and transforming between all possible $d\times d$ discrete Wigner functions for a single $d$-dimensional qudit. This framework constructs valid functions by cross-correlating a naturally emerging $2d\times 2d$ discrete Wigner function with an information-reorganising function called a stencil. Validity criteria for the Wigner function translate into stencil conditions, ensuring consistency. Additionally, we identify one stencil that is valid for all even dimensions (and which coincides with Wootters' function for $d=2$) and another valid for all odd dimensions, reproducing Gross' function (as well as Wootters' for odd prime dimensions). Furthermore, we establish invertible linear transformations between all valid functions within the same dimension, enabling a systematic comparison of their structural and operational properties, such as negativity and marginalisation.

Title: Path-integral approaches to strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems
Authors: Kilian Fraboulet
Abstract: The core of this thesis is the path-integral formulation of quantum field theory and its ability to describe strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems of finite size. Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with various resummation methods (Pad√©-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...), functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail.

Title: Light Dark Matter Search with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamonds
Authors: So Chigusa, Masashi Hazumi, Ernst David Herbschleb, Norikazu Mizuochi, Kazunori Nakayama
Abstract: We propose new ideas to directly search for light dark matter, such as the axion or the dark photon, by using magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. If the dark matter couples to the electron spin, it affects the evolution of the Bloch vectors consisting of the spin triplet states, which may be detected through several magnetometry techniques. We give several concrete examples with the use of dc and ac magnetometry and estimate the sensitivity on dark matter couplings.

Title: What exactly does Bekenstein bound?
Authors: Patrick Hayden, Jinzhao Wang
Abstract: The Bekenstein bound posits a maximum entropy for matter with finite energy confined to a spatial region. It is often interpreted as a fundamental limit on the information that can be stored by physical objects. In this work, we test this interpretation by asking whether the Bekenstein bound imposes constraints on a channel's communication capacity, a context in which information can be given a mathematically rigorous and operationally meaningful definition. We study specifically the \emph{Unruh channel} that describes a stationary Alice exciting different species of free scalar fields to send information to an accelerating Bob, who is confined to a Rindler wedge and exposed to the noise of Unruh radiation. We show that the classical and quantum capacities of the Unruh channel obey the Bekenstein bound that pertains to the decoder Bob. In contrast, even at high temperatures, the Unruh channel can transmit a significant number of \emph{zero-bits}, which are quantum communication resources that can be used for quantum identification and many other primitive protocols. Therefore, unlike classical bits and qubits, zero-bits and their associated information processing capability are generally not constrained by the Bekenstein bound. However, we further show that when both the encoder and the decoder are restricted, the Bekenstein bound does constrain the channel capacities, including the zero-bit capacity.

Title: Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations
Authors: Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from solutions of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct solutions of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Apart from these we show that solutions constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions and Clifford algebras also satisfy these constraints. Furthermore it is observed that the Clifford solutions give rise to positive Boltzmann weights resulting in the possibility of physical statistical mechanics models in higher dimensions. Finally we also show that anti-Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter-like equations with a negative sign on the right hand side] can also be lifted to higher simplex solutions.

Title: Individual assembly of two-species Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers
Authors: Alexander Guttridge, Tom R. Hepworth, Daniel K. Ruttley, Aileen A. T. Durst, Matthew T. Eiles, Simon L. Cornish
Abstract: We present a new approach to investigating Rydberg molecules by demonstrating the formation and characterization of individual Rb$^{*}$Cs Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers. By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we observe molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the formation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic distances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the tweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring the effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate molecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way for state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding energies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with theory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms, expanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration of Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.

Title: Combinatorial Optimization with Quantum Computers
Authors: Francisco Chicano, Gabiel Luque, Zakaria Abdelmoiz Dahi, Rodrigo Gil-Merino
Abstract: Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to do computation with a potential advantage over classical computers. While a single classical computer transforms one particular binary input into an output after applying one operator to the input, a quantum computer can apply the operator to a superposition of binary strings to provide a superposition of binary outputs, doing computation apparently in parallel. This feature allows quantum computers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms. Unsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called quantum annealers are specially designed to solve optimization problems. In this paper, we provide an introduction to quantum optimization from a practical point of view. We introduce the reader to the use of quantum annealers and quantum gate-based machines to solve optimization problems.

Title: Three-body scattering hypervolume of two-component fermions in three dimensions
Authors: Jiansen Zhang, Zipeng Wang, Shina Tan
Abstract: We study the zero-energy collision of three fermions, two of which are in the spin-down ($\downarrow$) state and one of which is in the spin-up ($\uparrow$) state. Assuming that the two-body and the three-body interactions have a finite range, we find a parameter, $D$, called the three-body scattering hypervolume. We study the three-body wave function asymptotically when three fermions are far apart or one spin-$\uparrow$ (spin-$\downarrow$) fermion and one pair, formed by the other two fermions, are far apart, and derive three asymptotic expansions of the wave function. The three-body scattering hypervolume $D$ appears in the coefficients of such expansions at the order of $B^{-5}$, where $B=\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$ is the hyperradius of the triangle formed by the three fermions (we assume that the three fermions have the same mass), and $s_1,s_2,s_3$ are the sides of the triangle. We compute the $T$-matrix element for three such fermions colliding at low energy in terms of $D$ in the absence of two-body interactions. When the interactions are weak, we calculate $D$ approximately using the Born expansion. We also analyze the energy shift of three two-component fermions in a large periodic cube due to $D$ and generalize this result to the many-fermion system. $D$ also determines the three-body recombination rates in two-component Fermi gases, and we calculate the three-body recombination rates in terms of $D$ and the density and temperature of the gas.

Title: A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation
Authors: Paul-Louis Etienney, R√©mi Robin, Pierre Rouchon
Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution. In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.

Title: Harvesting correlations from BTZ black hole coupled to a Lorentz-violating vector field
Authors: Xiaofang Liu, Wentao Liu, Zhilong Liu, Jieci Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the \textit{entanglement shadow} region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.

Title: Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on low-intrinsic-loss coplanar lumped-element waveguide
Authors: C. W. Sandbo Chang, Arjan F. Van Loo, Chih-Chiao Hung, Yu Zhou, Christian Gnandt, Shuhei Tamate, Yasunobu Nakamura
Abstract: We present a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) based on a low-loss coplanar lumped-element waveguide architecture. By employing open-stub capacitors and Manhattan-pattern junctions, our device achieves an insertion loss below 1 dB up to 12 GHz. We introduce windowed sinusoidal modulation for phase matching, demonstrating that smooth impedance transitions effectively suppress intrinsic gain ripples. Using Tukey-windowed modulation with 8 % impedance variation, we achieve 20$-$23-dB gain over 5-GHz bandwidth under ideal matching conditions. In a more practical circuit having impedance mismatches, the device maintains 17$-$20-dB gain over 4.8-GHz bandwidth with an added noise of 0.13 quanta above standard quantum limit at 20-dB gain and $-99$-dBm saturation power, while featuring zero to negative backward gain below the bandgap frequency.
