Title: Machine learning the effects of many quantum measurements
Authors: Wanda Hou, Samuel J. Garratt, Norhan M. Eassa, Eliott Rosenberg, Pedram Roushan, Yi-Zhuang You, Ehud Altman
Abstract: Measurements are essential for the processing and protection of information in quantum computers. They can also induce long-range entanglement between unmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many non-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and using the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new approach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create short-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a superconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range entanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the others. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on observations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more general problems in quantum control.

Title: The Sound of Entanglement
Authors: Enar de Dios Rodr√≠guez, Philipp Haslinger, Johannes Kofler, Richard Kueng, Benjamin Orthner, Alexander Ploier, Martin Ringbauer, Clemens Wenger
Abstract: The advent of quantum physics has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, replacing the deterministic framework of classical physics with a paradigm dominated by intrinsic randomness and quantum correlations. This shift has not only enabled groundbreaking technologies, such as quantum sensors, networks and computers, but has also unlocked entirely new possibilities for artistic expressions. In this paper, we explore the intersection of quantum mechanics and art, focusing on the use of quantum entanglement and inherent randomness as creative tools. Specifically, we present The Sound of Entanglement, a live musical performance driven by real-time measurements of entangled photons in a Bell test. By integrating the measured quantum correlations as a central compositional element and synchronizing live visuals with experimental data, the performance offers a unique and unrepeatable audiovisual experience that relies on quantum correlations which cannot be produced by any classical device. Through this fusion of science and art, we aim to provide a deeper appreciation of quantum phenomena while expanding the boundaries of creative expression.

Title: Fast simulation of fermions with reconfigurable qubits
Authors: Nishad Maskara, Marcin Kalinowski, Daniel Gonzalez-Cuadra, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: Performing large-scale, accurate quantum simulations of many-fermion systems is a central challenge in quantum science, with applications in chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics. Despite significant progress, realizing generic fermionic algorithms with qubit systems incurs significant space-time overhead, scaling as O(N) for N fermionic modes. Here we present a method for faster fermionic simulation with asymptotic space-time overhead of O(log(N)) in the worst case, and O(1) for circuits with additional structure, including important subroutines like the fermionic fast Fourier transform. This exponential reduction is achieved by using reconfigurable quantum systems with non-local connectivity, mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedforward, to generate dynamical fermion-to-qubit mappings. We apply this technique to achieve efficient compilation for key simulation tasks, including Hamiltonian simulation of the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and periodic materials, as well as free-fermion state-preparation. Moreover, we show that the algorithms themselves can be adapted to use only the O(1)-overhead structures to further reduce resource overhead. These techniques can lower gate counts by orders of magnitude for practical system sizes and are natively compatible with error corrected computation, making them ideal for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. Our results tightly bound the computational gap between fermionic and qubit models and open new directions in quantum simulation algorithm design and implementation.

Title: Extracting and charging energy into almost unknown quantum states
Authors: Andrea Canzio, Vasco Cavina, Roberto Menta, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the amount of energy that can be extracted or charged through unitary operations when only minimal information about the state is known. Assuming knowledge of only the mean energy of the state, we start by developing optimal upper bounds for the work that can be unitarily extracted or charged in this scenario. In deriving these upper bounds, we provide a complete characterization of the minimum ergotropy and anti-ergotropy for density matrices with fixed average energy, showing that the minimum states are always passive or antipassive and the problem of finding them can be mapped to a simple linear programming algorithm. Furthermore, we show that these lower bounds directly translate into upper bounds for the energy-constrained coherent ergotropy and anti-ergotropy of a state. We continue by illustrating scenarios in which these bounds can be saturated: a simple unitary protocol is shown to saturate the bounds for relevant classes of Hamiltonians, while having access to decoherence or randomness as resources, the saturation is guaranteed for all Hamiltonians. Finally, by taking a qutrit as an example, we show and compare the performances of the various protocols identified.

Title: Asymptotic Behavior of Random Time-Inhomogeneous Markovian Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Lubashan Pathirana, Jeffrey Schenker
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of continuous-time, time-inhomogeneous Markovian quantum dynamics in a stationary random environment. Under mild faithfulness and eventually positivity-improving assumptions, the normalized evolution converges almost surely to a stationary family of full-rank states, and the normalized propagators converge almost surely to a rank-one family determined by these states. Beyond a disorder-dependent threshold, these convergences occur at exponential rates that may depend on the disorder; when the environment is ergodic, the rate itself is deterministic. When the dynamical propagators display vanishing maximal temporal stochastic correlation, convergence in stochastic expectations for the above limits is faster than any power of the time separation, and improves to exponential rates when the dynamical propagators display stochastically independent increments. These expectation bounds yield disorder-uniform high-probability estimates. The framework does not require complete positivity or trace preservation and encompasses random Lindbladian evolutions and collision-model dynamics.

Title: Quantum Error Correction in Adversarial Regimes
Authors: Rahul Arvind, Nikhil Bansal, Dax Enshan Koh, Tobias Haug, Kishor Bharti
Abstract: In adversarial settings, where attackers can deliberately and strategically corrupt quantum data, standard quantum error correction reaches its limits. It can only correct up to half the code distance and must output a unique answer. Quantum list decoding offers a promising alternative. By allowing the decoder to output a short list of possible errors, it becomes possible to tolerate far more errors, even under worst-case noise. But two fundamental questions remain: which quantum codes support list decoding, and can we design decoding schemes that are secure against efficient, computationally bounded adversaries? In this work, we answer both. To identify which codes are list-decodable, we provide a generalized version of the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Then, using tools from quantum cryptography, we build an unambiguous list decoding protocol based on pseudorandom unitaries. Our scheme is secure against any quantum polynomial-time adversary, even across multiple decoding attempts, in contrast to previous schemes. Our approach connects coding theory with complexity-based quantum cryptography, paving the way for secure quantum information processing in adversarial settings.

Title: Retrocausal capacity of a quantum channel
Authors: Kaiyuan Ji, Seth Lloyd, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: We study the capacity of a quantum channel for retrocausal communication, where messages are transmitted backward in time, from a sender in the future to a receiver in the past, through a noisy postselected closed timelike curve (P-CTC) represented by the channel. We completely characterize the one-shot retrocausal quantum and classical capacities of a quantum channel, and we show that the corresponding asymptotic capacities are equal to the average and sum, respectively, of the channel's max-information and its regularized Doeblin information. This endows these information measures with a novel operational interpretation. Furthermore, our characterization can be generalized beyond quantum channels to all completely positive maps. This imposes information-theoretic limits on transmitting messages via postselected-teleportation-like mechanisms with arbitrary initial- and final-state boundary conditions, including those considered in various black-hole final-state models.

Title: Quantum sensing with a spin ensemble in a two-dimensional material

Abstract: Quantum sensing with solid-state spin defects has transformed nanoscale metrology, offering sub-wavelength spatial resolution with exceptional sensitivity to multiple signal types. Maximizing these advantages requires minimizing both the sensor-target separation and detectable signalthreshold. However, leading platforms such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond suffer performance degradation near surfaces or in nanoscale volumes, motivating the search for optically addressable spin sensors in atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we present an experimental framework to probe a novel 2D spin ensemble, including its Hamiltonian, coherent sensing dynamics, and noise environment. Using a central spin system in a 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal, we fully map the hyperfine interactions with proximal nuclear spins, demonstrate programmable switching between magnetic and electric sensing, and introduce a robust method for reconstructing the environmental noise spectrum explicitly accounting for quantum control imperfections. We achieve a record coherence time of 80 $\mu$s and nanotesla-level AC magnetic sensitivity at a 10 nm target distance, reaching the threshold for detecting a single nuclear spin in nanoscale spectroscopy. Leveraging the broad opportunities for defect engineering in atomically thin hosts, these results lay the foundation for next-generation quantum sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity, tunable noise selectivity, and versatile quantum functionalities.

Title: Revisiting intrinsic spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride with r2SCAN
Authors: Petros-Panagis Filippatos, Tom J. P. Irons, Katherine Inzani
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide band gap, van der Waals material that is highly promising for solid-state quantum technologies as a host of optically addressable, paramagnetic spin defects. Intrinsic and extrinsic point defects provide a range of emission energies, but the atomic-level structures related to observed transitions are not fully characterised. In this work, intrinsic point defects in bulk hBN are modelled using density functional theory at the level of the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA), considering their formation energies, electronic spectra and magnetic properties. The meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional r2SCAN is found to offer a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for specific properties, while its predictive performance for bound-exciton stability is limited when compared to higher-level hybrid functionals. This implies opportunities for its use in optimised, hierarchical computational defect screening workflows. Under revised criteria, VB-, BN0, Bi+ and Ni+ defects are identified as stable colour centres with zero-phonon emission within technologically desirable wavelengths, making them promising for use in quantum networks and sensors.

Title: Generative quantum advantage for classical and quantum problems
Authors: Hsin-Yuan Huang, Michael Broughton, Norhan Eassa, Hartmut Neven, Ryan Babbush, Jarrod R. McClean
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative machine learning, powered by massive computational resources, have demonstrated unprecedented human-like capabilities. While beyond-classical quantum experiments can generate samples from classically intractable distributions, their complexity has thwarted all efforts toward efficient learning. This challenge has hindered demonstrations of generative quantum advantage: the ability of quantum computers to learn and generate desired outputs substantially better than classical computers. We resolve this challenge by introducing families of generative quantum models that are hard to simulate classically, are efficiently trainable, exhibit no barren plateaus or proliferating local minima, and can learn to generate distributions beyond the reach of classical computers. Using a $68$-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate these capabilities in two scenarios: learning classically intractable probability distributions and learning quantum circuits for accelerated physical simulation. Our results establish that both learning and sampling can be performed efficiently in the beyond-classical regime, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced generative models with provable advantage.

Title: Exploring Photon Blockade in Multimode Jaynes-Cummings Models with Two-Photon Dissipation
Authors: Caden McCollum, Imran M. Mirza
Abstract: The photon blockade phenomenon, a promising tool for realizing efficient single-photon sources, is the central focus of our work. We study this phenomenon within the context of the multimode extension of the Jaynes-Cummings model, incorporating two-photon dissipation and external coherent driving. Operating in the weak-driving regime, we confine our analysis to the two-excitation sector of the Hilbert space, initially exploring the single-mode case and then focusing on the corresponding multimode problem. Our study calculates the second-order correlation function (both numerically and analytically) for zero- and nonzero time delays in single- and multimode cases, to pinpoint and validate the conditions that lead to conventional and unconventional photon blockade. Our zero delay findings reveal that photon antibunching is comparable in both cases; however, the multimode case offers a greater degree of control and applicability. Furthermore, for non-zero delay operation, we find that when one of the multiple modes is set at the optimal conventional photon blockade conditions, the behavior of the curve mimics the single-mode problem with an overall slower rate of reaching the $g^{(2)}(\tau)=1$ value. These results highlight the practical implications of our findings for building useful single-photon sources.

Title: Furthering Free-Fermion Findability From Fratricides
Authors: Jannis Ruh, Samual J. Elman
Abstract: We present a novel graph-theoretic approach to simplifying generic many-body Hamiltonians. Our primary result introduces a recursive twin-collapse algorithm, leveraging the identification and elimination of symmetric vertex pairs (twins), as well as line-graph modules, within the frustration graph of the Hamiltonian. This method systematically block-diagonalizes Hamiltonians, significantly reducing complexity while preserving the energetic spectrum. Importantly, our approach expands the class of models that can be mapped to non-interacting fermionic Hamiltonians (free-fermion solutions), thereby broadening the applicability of classical solvability methods. Through numerical experiments on spin Hamiltonians arranged in periodic lattice configurations and Majorana Hamiltonians, we demonstrate that the twin-collapse increases the identification of simplicial and claw-free graph structures, which characterize free-fermion solvability. Finally, we extend our framework by presenting a generalized discrete Stone-von Neumann theorem. This comprehensive framework provides new insights into Hamiltonian simplification techniques, free-fermion solutions, and group-theoretical characterizations relevant for quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum computation.

Title: Quantum Dynamics and Elementary Excitations in Superfluid He4 Films at Low Temperatures
Authors: Vladimir I. Kruglov, Houria Triki
Abstract: We have formulated a novel quantum nonlinear Schrodinger equation describing of superfluid He4 in films at low temperatures. It is shown that in classical limit the found nonlinear Schrodinger equation reduces to a system of equations which are equivalent to Boussinesq equations describing the propagation of long gravity waves in incompressible fluids. This nonlinear Schrodinger equation leads to phonon-roton dispersion relation for elementary excitations in superfluid He4 films at low temperatures. The quartic soliton, dark soliton, cosine and elliptic periodic wave solutions are obtained analytically as weakly excited quantum waves propagating in He4 films. We have also shown numerically that the presented nonlinear Schrodinger equation describes the quartic and dark solitary waves in helium films. These solitary and periodic quantum waves can find numerous important practical applications.

Title: A penalty-free quantum algorithm to find energy eigenstates
Authors: Nannan Ma, Heng Dai, Jiangbin Gong
Abstract: Finding eigenstates of a given many-body Hamiltonian is a long-standing challenge due to the perceived computational complexity. Leveraging on the hardware of a quantum computer accommodating the exponential growth of the Hilbert space size with the number of qubits, more quantum algorithms to find the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians will be of wide interest with profound implications and applications. In this work, we advocate a quantum algorithm to find the ground state and excited states of many-body systems, without any penalty functions, variational steps or hybrid quantum-classical steps. Our fully quantum algorithm will be an important addition to the quantum computational toolbox to tackle problems intractable on classical machines.

Title: Exotic quantum light-matter interactions in bilayer square lattices
Authors: Xing-Liang Dong, Peng-Bo Li, Jia-Qiang Chen, Fu-Li Li, Franco Nori
Abstract: We investigate quantum emitters (QEs) interacting with a photonic structured bath made of bilayer square lattices, where the resonance anti-crossing between the energy bands opens a symmetric middle energy gap. Due to the intrinsic chiral symmetry of the bath and interactions with the square-like band-edges, the QE-photon dressed states generated in this inner bandgap are odd-neighbor, robust, and anisotropic, when the emitters' transition frequencies lie in the middle of the bandgap. We also use giant artificial atoms to engineer and modify the dressed states' patterns. Exotic bound states can lead to spin models with symmetry protection, resulting in fascinating many-body phases. As an example, we show that this proposal can be used to generate both edge states and corner states in the generalized 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This work opens up new avenues for research into innovative quantum many-body physics and quantum simulations with photonic or phononic multilayer structures.

Title: A hybrid quantum walk model unifying discrete and continuous quantum walks
Authors: Tianen Chen, Yun Shang
Abstract: Quantum walks, both discrete and continuous, serve as fundamental tools in quantum information processing with diverse applications. This work introduces a hybrid quantum walk model that integrates the coin mechanism of discrete walks with the Hamiltonian-driven time evolution of continuous walks. Through systematic analysis of probability distributions, standard deviations, and entanglement entropy on fundamental graph structures (2-vertex circles, stars, and lines), we reveal distinctive dynamical characteristics that differentiate our model from conventional quantum walk paradigms. The proposed framework demonstrates unifying capabilities by naturally encompassing existing quantum walk models as special cases. Two significant applications emerge from this hybrid architecture: (1) We develop a novel protocol for perfect state transfer(PST) in general connected graphs, overcoming the limitations of previous graph-specific approaches. A PST on a tree graph has been implemented on a quantum superconducting processor. (2) We devise a quantum algorithm for multiplying $K$ adjacency matrices of $n$-vertex regular graphs with time complexity $O(n^2d_1\cdots d_K)$, outperforming classical matrix multiplication $(O(n^{2.371552}))$ when vertex degrees $d_i$ are bounded. The algorithm's efficacy for triangle counting is experimentally validated through the quantum simulation on PennyLane. These results establish the hybrid quantum walk as a versatile framework bridging discrete and continuous paradigms while enabling practical quantum advantage in graph computation tasks.

Title: Special Issue: Commemorating the 110th Anniversary of TANG Au-chin's Birthday Calculation of the Green's function on near-term quantum computers via Cartan decomposition
Authors: Lingyun Wan, Jie Liu, Jinlong Yang
Abstract: Accurate computation of the Green's function is crucial for connecting experimental observations to the underlying quantum states. A major challenge in evaluating the Green's function in the time domain lies in the efficient simulation of quantum state evolution under a given Hamiltonian-a task that becomes exponentially complex for strongly correlated systems on classical computers. Quantum computing provides a promising pathway to overcome this barrier by enabling efficient simulation of quantum dynamics. However, for near-term quantum devices with limited coherence times and fidelity, the deep quantum circuits required to implement time-evolution operators present a significant challenge for practical applications. In this work, we introduce an efficient algorithm for computing Green's functions via Cartan decomposition, which requires only fixed-depth quantum circuits for arbitrarily long time simulations. Additionally, analytical gradients are formulated to accelerate the Cartan decomposition by leveraging a unitary transformation in a factorized form. The new algorithm is applied to simulate long-time Green's functions for the Fermi-Hubbard and transverse-field Ising models, extracting the spectral functions through Fourier transformation.

Title: Intermittent chaos in an optomechanical resonator
Authors: Yue Huo, Zhe Wang, Zhenning Yang, Xiaohe Tang, Deng-Wei Zhang, Qianchuan Zhao, Wenjie Wan, Yu-xi Liu, Xin-You L√º, Guangming Zhao, Liang Lu, Jing Zhang
Abstract: Chaos is a fundamental phenomenon in nonlinear dynamics, manifesting as irregular and unpredictable behavior across various physical systems. Among the diverse routes to chaos, intermittent chaos is a distinct transition pathway, characterized by the temporal or spatial alternation between periodic and chaotic motions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, optomechanically induced intermittent chaos in an optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. Specifically, the system evolves from stable periodic oscillation through an intermittent-chaos regime before fully developing into chaotic motion. As system parameters vary, the proportion of chaotic motion in the time-domain increases asymptotically until chaotic dynamics dominates entirely. Moreover, it is counterintuitive that, intermittent chaos can act as noise of a favorable intensity compared with purely periodic or fully chaotic states, and enhance rather than reduce system's responses in nonlinear ultrasonic detection. These findings not only deepen the comprehensive understanding of chaos formation but also broaden its potential applications in high-precision sensing and information processing.

Title: Building globally-controlled quantum processors with ZZ interactions
Authors: Roberto Menta, Francesco Cioni, Riccardo Aiudi, Francesco Caravelli, Marco Polini, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for constructing various architectures of globally driven quantum computers, with a focus on superconducting qubits. Our approach leverages static inhomogeneities in the Rabi frequencies of qubits controlled by a common classical pulse -- a technique we refer to as the "crossed-qubit" method. We detail the essential components and design principles required to realize such systems, highlighting how global control can be harnessed to perform local operations, enabling universal quantum computation. This framework offers a scalable pathway toward quantum processors by striking a balance between wiring complexity and computational efficiency, with potential applications in addressing current challenges to scalability.

Title: Toward Quantum Enabled Solutions for Real-Time Currency Arbitrage in Financial Markets
Authors: Suman Kumar Roy, Rahul Rana, M Girish Chandra, Nishant Kumar, Manoj Nambiar
Abstract: Currency arbitrage leverages price discrepancies in currency exchange rates across different currency pairs to gain risk-free profits. It involves multiple trading, where short-lived price discrepancies require real-time, high-speed processing of vast solution space, posing challenges for classical computing. In this work, we formulate an enhanced mathematical model for the currency arbitrage problem by adding simple cycle preservation constraints, which guarantee trading cycle validity and eliminate redundant or infeasible substructures. To solve this model, we use and benchmark various solvers, including Quantum Annealing (QA), gate-based quantum approaches such as Variational Quantum Algorithm with Adaptive Cost Encoding (ACE), as well as classical solvers such as Gurobi and classical meta heuristics such as Tabu Search (TS). We propose a classical multi-bit swap post-processing to improve the solution generated by ACE. Using real-world currency exchange data, we compare these methods in terms of both arbitrage profit and execution time, the two key performance metrics. Our results give insight into the current capabilities and limitations of quantum methods for real-time financial use cases.

Title: Quantum Coherence and Anomalous Work Extraction in Qubit Gate Dynamics
Authors: Francesco Perciavalle, Nicola Lo Gullo, Francesco Plastina
Abstract: We develop a framework based on the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution to quantify the contribution of coherence to work extraction during generic, cyclic quantum evolutions. In particular, we focus on ``anomalous processes'', counterintuitive scenarios in which, due to the negativity of the quasiprobability distribution, work can be extracted, even when individual processes are associated with energy gain. Applying this framework to qubits undergoing sequences of single- and two-qubit gate operations, we identify specific conditions under which such anomalous work exchanges occur. Furthermore, we analyze the quasiprobabilistic structure of deep quantum circuits and establish a compositional relation linking the work statistics of full circuits to those of their constituent gates. Our work highlights the role of coherence in the thermodynamics of quantum computation and provides a foundation for systematically studying potential thermodynamic relevance of specific quantum circuits.

Title: Minimal Help, Maximal Gain: Environmental Assistance Unlocks Encoding Strength
Authors: Snehasish Roy Chowdhury, Sutapa Saha, Subhendu B. Ghosh, Ranendu Adhikary, Tamal Guha
Abstract: For any quantum transmission line, with smaller output dimension than its input, the number of classical symbols that can be reliably encoded is strictly suboptimal. In other words, if the channel outputs a lesser number of symbols than it intakes, then rest of the symbols eventually leak into the environment, during the transmission. Can these lost symbols be recovered with minimal help from the environment? While the standard notion of environment-assisted classical capacity fails to fully capture this scenario, we introduce a generalized framework to address this question. Using an elegant example, we first demonstrate that the encoding capability of a quantum channel can be optimally restored with a minimal assistance of environment, albeit possessing suboptimal capacity in the conventional sense. Remarkably, we further prove that even the strongest two-input-two-output non-signaling correlations between sender and receiver cannot substitute for this assistance. Finally, we characterize a class of quantum channels, in arbitrary dimensions, exhibiting a sharp separation between the conventional environment-assisted capacity and the true potential for unlocking their encoding strength.

Title: Speeding up Pontus-Mpemba effects via dynamical phase transitions
Authors: Andrea Nava, Reinhold Egger, Bidyut Dey, Domenico Giuliano
Abstract: We demonstrate that open quantum systems exhibiting dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) allow for highly efficient protocols implementing the Pontus-Mpemba effect. The relaxation speed-up toward a predesignated target state is tied to the existence of a long metastable time window preceding the DPT and can be exploited in applications to systematically optimize quantum protocols. As paradigmatic example for the connection between DPTs and quantum Mpemba effects, we study one-dimensional (1D) interacting lattice fermions corresponding to a dissipative variant of the Gross-Neveu model.

Title: Impact of Force Noise on the Visibility of STA-Based Atom Interferometers
Authors: Sof√≠a Mart√≠nez-Garaot, I. Lizuain, A. Rodriguez-Prieto, J. G. Muga
Abstract: In a previous work, we designed a compact atom interferometer to measure homogeneous constant forces guiding the arms via shortcuts to adiabatic paths. Within this scheme we drive the atom by moving spin-dependent traps, and design a force $f(t)$ to compensate inertial terms in the moving frame. In this paper we analyze how robust our interferometer is against some realistic noisy deviation from the unperturbed value of the force $f(t)$. The complex overlap of the atom wave functions for each arm of the interferometer at the final time of the process is calculated. We demonstrate that the measure of the unknown force will not be affected, as there will be no contribution of the error in the phase difference of the overlap. Nevertheless, the visibility will be reduced as the modulus will no longer be one. In addition we find the optimal trajectories minimizing the effect of the noise in the visibility while keeping the sensitivity of the interferometer.

Title: Diabatic quantum annealing for training energy-based generative models
Authors: Gilhan Kim, Ju-Yeon Ghym, Daniel K. Park
Abstract: Energy-based generative models, such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), require unbiased Boltzmann samples for effective training. Classical Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, however, converge slowly and yield correlated samples, making large-scale training difficult. We address this bottleneck by applying the analytic relation between annealing schedules and effective inverse temperature in diabatic quantum annealing. By implementing this prescription on a quantum annealer, we obtain temperature-controlled Boltzmann samples that enable RBM training with faster convergence and lower validation error than classical sampling. We further identify a systematic temperature misalignment intrinsic to analog quantum computers and propose an analytical rescaling method that mitigates this hardware noise, thereby enhancing the practicality of quantum annealers as Boltzmann samplers. In our method, the model's connectivity is set directly by the qubit connectivity, transforming the computational complexity inherent in classical sampling into a requirement on quantum hardware. This shift allows the approach to extend naturally from RBMs to fully connected Boltzmann machines, opening opportunities inaccessible to classical training methods.

Title: Thermodynamic coprocessor for linear operations with input-size-independent calculation time based on open quantum system
Authors: I. V. Vovchenko, A. A. Zyablovsky, A. A. Pukhov, E. S. Andrianov
Abstract: Linear operations, e.g., vector-matrix or vector-vector multiplications, are core operations of modern neural networks. To diminish computational time, these operations are implemented by parallel computations using different coprocessors. In this work we show that open quantum system consisting of bosonic modes and interacting with bosonic reservoirs can be used as analog coprocessor implementing multiple vector-matrix multiplications with stochastic matrices in parallel. Input vectors are encoded in occupancies of reservoirs, and output result is presented by stationary energy flows. The operation takes time needed for the system's transition to non-equilibrium stationary state independently on number of the reservoirs, i.e., on the input vector dimension. The computations are accompanied by entropy growth. We construct a direct mapping between open quantum systems and electrical crossbar structures, showing that dissipation rates multiplied by OQS's modes frequencies can be seen as conductivities, reservoirs' occupancies can be seen as potentials, and stationary energy flows can be seen as electric currents.

Title: Ergotropic advantage in a measurement-fueled quantum heat engine
Authors: Sidhant Jakhar, Ramandeep S. Johal
Abstract: This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the four-stroke engine proposed by Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] by introducing an ergotropy-extracting stroke, resulting in a five-stroke cycle. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine (without the adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate for specific cases (x-x and x-z directions), a definite ordering is obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.

Title: Attributed-graphs kernel implementation using local detuning of neutral-atoms Rydberg Hamiltonian
Authors: Mehdi Djellabi, Matthias Hecker, Shaheen Acheche
Abstract: We extend the quantum-feature kernel framework, which relies on measurements of graph-dependent observables, along three directions. First, leveraging neutral-atom quantum processing units (QPUs), we introduce a scheme that incorporates attributed graphs by embedding edge features into atomic positions and node features into local detuning fields of a Rydberg Hamiltonian. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that local detuning enhances kernel expressiveness. Second, in addition to the existing quantum evolution kernel (QEK), which uses global observables, we propose the generalized-distance quantum-correlation (GDQC) kernel, based on local observables. While the two kernels show comparable performance, we show that GDQC can achieve higher expressiveness. Third, instead of restricting to observables at single time steps, we combine information from multiple stages of the quantum evolution via pooling operations. Using extensive simulations on two molecular benchmark datasets, MUTAG and PTC\_FM, we find: (a) QEK and GDQC perform competitively with leading classical algorithms; and (b) pooling further improves performance, enabling quantum-feature kernels to surpass classical baselines. These results show that node-feature embedding and kernel designs based on local observables advance quantum-enhanced graph machine learning on neutral-atom devices.

Title: Optimality of universal conclusive entanglement purification protocols
Authors: Alexandre C. Orthey, Aby Philip, Tulja Varun Kondra, Alexander Streltsov
Abstract: Entanglement purification is essential for quantum technologies; yet, rigorous bounds on the success probability for universal protocols -- those requiring no prior knowledge about the input state -- have remained underexplored. We establish such fundamental limits for conclusive protocols distilling perfect Bell states from a pure two-qubit states by deriving the optimal success probability starting with: two copies of a state with known Schmidt basis, and four copies of a state with unknown Schmidt basis. We prove that a known protocol achieves these bounds, confirming its optimality. Crucially, universality imposes an inherent efficiency trade-off, yielding an average success probability of just $2/105$ over Haar measure.

Title: Evaluating Quantum Amplitude Estimation for Pricing Multi-Asset Basket Options
Authors: Muhammad Kashif, Shaf Khalid, Nouhaila Innan, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique
Abstract: Accurate and efficient pricing of multi-asset basket options poses a significant challenge, especially when dealing with complex real-world data. In this work, we investigate the role of quantum-enhanced uncertainty modeling in financial pricing options on real-world data. Specifically, we use quantum amplitude estimation and analyze the impact of varying the number of uncertainty qubits while keeping the number of assets fixed, as well as the impact of varying the number of assets while keeping the number of uncertainty qubits fixed. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we establish and validate a hybrid quantum-classical comparison framework, benchmarking quantum approaches against classical Monte Carlo simulations and Black-Scholes methods. Beyond simply computing option prices, we emphasize the trade-off between accuracy and computational resources, offering insights into the potential advantages and limitations of quantum approaches for different problem scales. Our results contribute to understanding the feasibility of quantum methods in finance and guide the optimal allocation of quantum resources in hybrid quantum-classical workflows.

Abstract: The sensitivity of non-local optical measurements at low light intensities, such as those involved in long baseline telescope arrays, can be improved by using remote entanglement. Here, we demonstrate the use of entangled quantum memories in a quantum network of Silicon-vacancy centers in diamond nano-cavities to experimentally perform such non-local phase measurements. Specifically, we combine the generation of event-ready remote quantum entanglement, photon mode erasure that hides the "which-path" information of temporally and spatially separated incoming optical modes, and non-local, non-destructive photon heralding enabled by remote entanglement to perform a proof-of-concept entanglement-assisted differential phase measurement of weak incident light between two spatially separate stations. Demonstrating successful operation of the remote phase sensing protocol with a fiber link baseline up to 1.55 km, our results open the door for a new class of quantum enhanced imaging applications.

Title: Enhancing Optical Imaging via Quantum Computation
Authors: Aleksandr Mokeev, Babak Saif, Mikhail D. Lukin, Johannes Borregaard
Abstract: Extracting information from weak optical signals is a critical challenge across a broad range of technologies. Conventional imaging techniques, constrained to integrating over detected signals and classical post-processing, are limited in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from shot noise accumulation in the post-processing algorithms. We show that these limitations can be circumvented by coherently encoding photonic amplitude information into qubit registers and applying quantum algorithms to process the stored information from asynchronously arriving optical signals. As a specific example, we develop a quantum algorithm for imaging unresolved point sources and apply it to exoplanet detection. We demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance can be achieved under realistic imaging conditions using relatively small scale quantum processors.

Title: Bath-induced stabilization of classical non-linear response in two dimensional infrared spectroscopy
Authors: Rajesh Dutta, Mike Reppert
Abstract: Classical response functions have shown considerable promise in computational 2D IR modeling; however, a simple diagrammatic description, analogous to that for open quantum systems, has been lacking. While a promising diagrammatic approach has recently been introduced for isolated systems, the resulting nonlinear response functions remain unstable at long times, a characteristic feature of integrable classical systems. Here, we extend this framework to incorporate system-bath interactions under the weak-anharmonicity approximation and explore the resulting conditions for bath-induced stabilization. The resulting expression for the weakly anharmonic response function is remarkably simple and exhibits a one-to-one correspondence with the quantum counterpart in the $\hbar\to 0$ limit, offering potential computational advantages in extending the approach to large, multi-oscillator systems. We find that (to lowest order in anharmonicity) the bath-induced stabilization of both linear and nonlinear classical response functions depends sensitively on the nature of spectral density, particularly on the balance between low-frequency and high-frequency components. Application of this classical diagrammatic approach to 2D IR spectroscopy of the amide I band captures the characteristic population-time-dependent dynamics associated with spectral diffusion, suggesting that the approach may prove useful in describing real experimental systems at ambient temperatures.

Title: Exponential Lindbladian fast forwarding and exponential amplification of certain Gibbs state properties
Authors: Zhong-Xia Shang, Dong An, Changpeng Shao
Abstract: We investigate Lindbladian fast-forwarding and its applications to estimating Gibbs state properties. Fast-forwarding refers to the ability to simulate a system of time $t$ using significantly fewer than $t$ queries or circuit depth. While various Hamiltonian systems are known to circumvent the no fast-forwarding theorem, analogous results for dissipative dynamics, governed by Lindbladians, remain largely unexplored. We first present a quantum algorithm for simulating purely dissipative Lindbladians with unitary jump operators, achieving additive query complexity $ \mathcal{O}\left(t + \frac{\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}{\log\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ up to error~$\varepsilon$, improving previous algorithms. When the jump operators have certain structures (i.e., block-diagonal Paulis), the algorithm can be modified to achieve exponential fast-forwarding, attaining circuit depth $\mathcal{O}\left(\log\left(t + \frac{\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}{\log\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)\right)$, while preserving query complexity. Using these fast-forwarding techniques, we develop a quantum algorithm for estimating Gibbs state properties of the form $\langle \psi_1 | e^{-\beta(H + I)} | \psi_2 \rangle$, up to additive error $\epsilon$, with $H$ the Hamiltonian and $\beta$ the inverse temperature. For input states exhibiting certain coherence conditions -- e.g.,~$\langle 0|^{\otimes n} e^{-\beta(H + I)} |+\rangle^{\otimes n}$ -- our method achieves exponential improvement in complexity (measured by circuit depth), $\mathcal{O} (2^{-n/2} \epsilon^{-1} \log \beta ),$ compared to the quantum singular value transformation-based approach, with complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\epsilon^{-1} \sqrt{\beta} )$. For general $| \psi_1 \rangle$ and $| \psi_2 \rangle$, we also show how the level of improvement is changed with the coherence resource in $| \psi_1 \rangle$ and $| \psi_2 \rangle$.

Title: Entanglement phases and phase transitions in monitored free fermion system due to localizations
Authors: Yu-Jun Zhao, Xuyang Huang, Yi-Rui Zhang, Han-Ze Li, Jian-Xin Zhong
Abstract: In recent years, the presence of local potentials has significantly enriched and diversified the entanglement patterns in monitored free fermion systems. In our approach, we employ the stochastic Schr√∂dinger equation to simulate a one-dimensional spinless fermion system under continuous measurement and local potentials. By averaging the steady-state entanglement entropy over many quantum trajectories, we investigate its dependence on measurement and localization parameters. We used a phenomenological model to interpret the numerical results, and the results show that the introduction of local potentials does not destroy the universality class of the entanglement phase transition, and that the phase boundary is jointly characterized by the measurement process and the localization mechanism. This work offers a new perspective on the characterization of the entanglement phase boundary arising from the combined effects of measurement and localization, and provides criteria for detecting this novel phase transition in cold atom systems, trapped ions, and quantum dot arrays.

Title: Vacuum electromagnetic field correlations between two moving points
Authors: Michael Vaz, Herv√© Bercegol
Abstract: A renewed experimental interest in quantum vacuum fluctuations brings back the need to extend the study of electromagnetic vacuum correlations. Quantum or semi-classical models developed to understand various configurations should combine the effects of the zero-point fluctuations with those of blackbody radiation. In this paper, after a brief historical introduction and a rapid study of the electric field correlations in time domain, we propose exact and approximate expressions for the vacuum field correlations in Fourier space seen by moving points. We first present an exact computation of the electric field correlations, expressed in frequency space, between two points moving with opposite constant velocities on parallel trajectories. We also consider the electric field self-correlations, i.e. on the same moving point but at different frequencies, and comment the results related to special relativity. Then, we compute the exact main symmetrized quadratic electromagnetic field correlations between two points diametrically opposed on the same circular trajectory, with diameter r, covered at constant angular velocity {\Omega}. We derive the expressions for the electromagnetic field correlations with itself and with its spatial derivatives, still at the locations of the moving points. Since the points we consider are accelerating, both the zero-point fluctuations and the blackbody spectrum give non-trivial results, for two-point correlations as well as for self-correlations. In both cases, results are shown at any vacuum temperature. For practical uses, we provide the first-order approximations in the small parameter {\Omega}r/c with c being the speed of light.

Title: Quantum signatures of proper time in optical ion clocks
Authors: Gabriel Sorci, Joshua Foo, Dietrich Leibfried, Christian Sanner, Igor Pikovski
Abstract: Optical clocks based on atoms and ions probe relativistic effects with unprecedented sensitivity by resolving time dilation due to atom motion or different positions in the gravitational potential through frequency shifts. However, all measurements of time dilation so far can be explained effectively as the result of dynamics with respect to a classical proper time parameter. Here we show that atomic clocks can probe effects where a classical description of the proper time dynamics is insufficient. We apply a Hamiltonian formalism to derive time dilation effects in harmonically trapped clock atoms and show how second-order Doppler shifts (SODS) due to the vacuum energy (vSODS), squeezing (sqSODS) and quantum corrections to the dynamics (qSODS) arise. We also demonstrate that the entanglement between motion and clock evolution can become observable in state-of-the-art clocks when the motion of the atoms is strongly squeezed, realizing proper time interferometry. Our results show that experiments with trapped ion clocks are within reach to probe relativistic evolution of clocks for which a quantum description of proper time becomes necessary.

Title: PT symmetry-enriched non-unitary criticality
Authors: Kuang-Hung Chou, Xue-Jia Yu, Po-Yao Chang
Abstract: The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.

Title: Fault-tolerant transformations of spacetime codes
Authors: Arthur Pesah, Austin K. Daniel, Ilan Tzitrin, Michael Vasmer
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum error-correction (QEC) have shown that it is often beneficial to understand fault-tolerance as a dynamical process, a circuit with redundant measurements that help correct errors, rather than as a static code equipped with a syndrome extraction circuit. Spacetime codes have emerged as a natural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while leveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on chain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations between them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding problems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence of two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain complexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits, fault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this framework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer codes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be transformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant properties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the underlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex constructions. Our method enables the construction of cluster states from non-CSS, subsystem, and Floquet codes, as well as from logical Clifford operations on a given code.

Title: Work statistics of sudden Quantum quenches: A random matrix theory perspective on Gaussianity and its deviations
Authors: Miguel Tierz
Abstract: We show that, for sudden quenches, the work distribution reduces to the statistics of traces of powers of Haar unitaries, which are random unitary matrices drawn uniformly from the unitary group. For translation-invariant quadratic fermionic chains with interactions extending to $m$ neighbors and periodic boundary conditions, the Loschmidt amplitude admits a unitary matrix-model / Toeplitz representation, which yields a work variable of the form $W=\sum_{r\le m} a_r\,\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ (and in models with pairing terms -- superconducting pairing -- additional $b_r\,\mathrm{Im}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ terms appear). By invoking multivariate central limit theorems for vectors of traces of unitaries, we obtain a Gaussian distribution for $P(W)$ with variance $\mathrm{Var}(W)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_r r\,(a_r^2+b_r^2)$ and asymptotic independence across different powers. We also characterise the conditions under which non-Gaussian tails arise, for example from many interaction terms or their slow decay, as well as the appearance of Fisher--Hartwig singularities. We illustrate these mechanisms in the XY chain. Various numerical diagnostics support the analytical results.

Title: Resource quantification for programming low-depth quantum circuits
Authors: Entong He, Yuxiang Yang
Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices pave the way to implement quantum algorithms that exhibit supremacy over their classical counterparts. Due to the intrinsic noise and decoherence in the physical system, NISQ computations are naturally modeled as large-size but low-depth quantum circuits. Practically, to execute such quantum circuits, we need to pass commands to a programmable quantum computer. Existing programming approaches, dedicated to generic unitary transformations, are inefficient in terms of the computational resources under the low-depth assumption and remain far from satisfactory. As such, to realize NISQ algorithms, it is crucial to find an efficient way to program low-depth circuits as the qubit number $N$ increases. Here, we investigate the gate complexity and the size of quantum memory (known as the program cost) required to program low-depth brickwork circuits. We unveil a $\sim N \text{poly} \log N$ worst-case program cost of universal programming of low-depth brickwork circuits in the large $N$ regime, which is a tight characterization. Moreover, we analyze the trade-off between the cost of describing the layout of local gates and the cost of programming them to the targeted unitaries via the light-cone argument. Our findings suggest that faithful gate-wise programming is optimal in the low-depth regime.

Title: Towards A High-Performance Quantum Data Center Network Architecture
Authors: Yufeng Xin, Liang Zhang
Abstract: Quantum Data Centers (QDCs) are needed to support large-scale quantum processing for both academic and commercial applications. While large-scale quantum computers are constrained by technological and financial barriers, a modular approach that clusters small quantum computers offers an alternative. This approach, however, introduces new challenges in network scalability, entanglement generation, and quantum memory management. In this paper, we propose a three-layer fat-tree network architecture for QDCs, designed to address these challenges. Our architecture features a unique leaf switch and an advanced swapping spine switch design, optimized to handle high volumes of entanglement requests as well as a queue scheduling mechanism that efficiently manages quantum memory to prevent decoherence. Through queuing-theoretical models and simulations in NetSquid, we demonstrate the proposed architecture's scalability and effectiveness in maintaining high entanglement fidelity, offering a practical path forward for modular QDC networks.

Title: Real-Time String Dynamics in a $2+1$D Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory: String Breaking, Glueball Formation, Baryon Blockade, and Tension Reduction
Authors: Giovanni Cataldi, Simone Orlando, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.

Title: Instance-Optimal Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update and Its Quantum Applications
Authors: Weiyuan Gong, Tongyang Li, Xinzhao Wang, Zhiyu Zhang
Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex, it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret, $I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is ``free''. Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA problem, based on the imaginary error function. Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition, applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R√©nyi-$2$ correlation.

Title: Estimation of deuteron binding energy using Qiskit with renormalization group-based effective interactions
Authors: Sreelekshmi Pillai, S. Ramanan, V. Balakrishnan, S. Lakshmibala
Abstract: We have obtained the binding energy of the deuteron on a quantum simulator using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for renormalization group (RG)-based low-momentum effective interactions. The binding energy has been calculated in the truncated harmonic oscillator (HO) basis, using the Qiskit-Aer simulator in both noise-free and noisy cases. The noise models have been taken from the actual IBM quantum hardware, and the results obtained have been extrapolated to the zero noise limit. It is shown that the number of HO basis states needed for computing the binding energy to within 1 percent of the experimental value in the quantum simulator, decreases with decreasing RG parameter {$\lambda$}. The dependence of the extent of entanglement between the oscillator modes on $\lambda$ has been analysed.

Title: Multi-Qubit Golden Gates
Authors: Rahul Dalal, Shai Evra, Ori Parzanchevski
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to construct optimal topological generators for compact unitary Lie groups, extending the work of a letter of Sarnak and arXiv:1704.02106 on golden and super-golden gates to higher dimensions. To do so we consider a variant of the Sarnak--Xue Density Hypotheses in the weight aspect for definite projective unitary groups and prove it using the endoscopic classification of automorphic representations. Our main motivation is to construct efficient multi-qubit universal gate sets for quantum computers. For example, we find a set of universal gates that, for a given accuracy, can heuristically approximate arbitrary unitary operations on 2 qubits with $\approx$10 times fewer ``expensive'' $T$-type gates than the standard Clifford+$T$ set. Our framework also covers the 2-qubit Clifford+CS gate set, well-known for being particularly friendly to fault-tolerant implementation. We thereby prove tight upper bounds on the required CS count for approximations (specifically, $4.8$x fewer non-Clifford gates than Clifford+$T$).

Title: A unified framework for exceptional point pairs in non-Hermitian two-level systems
Authors: Jung-Wan Ryu, Jae-Ho Han, Chang-Hwan Yi
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems are branch singularities where eigenvalues and eigenvectors simultaneously coalesce, leading to rich topological phenomena beyond those in Hermitian systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the interplay between eigenenergy braiding and Berry phase accumulation in two-level non-Hermitian systems hosting pairs of EPs. EP pairs are classified into four distinct classes according to the vorticity of eigenenergies, the Berry phase accumulated during encircling, and the eigenstate projection onto a basis state. Their associated topological structures are analyzed using effective two-level models. These classifications are further substantiated by numerical simulations in optical microcavities with three scatterers, where EPs emerge in the complex frequency spectrum. By encircling different EP pairs in parameter space, we demonstrate that the resulting topological features such as trivial or non-trivial braiding and Berry phase accumulation are directly linked to the vorticity structure and eigenmode evolution. In particular, we show that the eigenstate projection onto a basis state near EPs manifests as chiral optical modes in microcavities, providing an experimentally accessible signature of the underlying topological structure. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding multi-EP topology and offer practical pathways toward their realization and control in photonic systems.

Title: Matrix product state classification of 1D multipole symmetry protected topological phases
Authors: Takuma Saito, Weiguang Cao, Bo Han, Hiromi Ebisu
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries are one of the new types of symmetries whose symmetry actions are position dependent. Yet exotic phases resulting from these spatially modulated symmetries are not fully understood and classified. In this work, we systematically classify one dimensional bosonic symmetry protected topological phases protected respecting multipole symmetries by employing matrix product state formalism. The symmetry action induces projective representations at the ends of an open chain, which we identify via group cohomology. In particular, for $r$-pole symmetries, for instance, $r$ = 0 (global), 1 (dipole), and 2 (quadrupole), the classification is determined by distinct components of second cohomology groups that encode the boundary projective representations.

Abstract: We present an implementation of Quantum Computing for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with an application to cosmological functions, to derive posterior distributions from cosmological probes. The algorithm proposes new steps in the parameter space via a quantum circuit whose resulting statevector provides the components of the shift vector. The proposed point is accepted or rejected via the classical Metropolis-Hastings acceptance method. The advantage of this hybrid quantum approach is that the step size and direction change in a way independent of the evolution of the chain, thus ideally avoiding the presence of local minima. The results are consistent with analyses performed with classical methods, both for a test function and real cosmological data. The final goal is to generalize this algorithm to test its application to complex cosmological computations.

Title: Quantum dots emission enhancement via coupling with an epsilon-near-zero sublayer

Abstract: Quantum emitters operating at telecom wavelengths are essential for the advancement of quantum technologies, particularly in the development of integrated on-chip devices for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Coupling resonant structures to a near-zero-index (NZI) environment has been shown to enhance their optical performance by both increasing spontaneous emission rates and improving emission directionality. In this work, we comparatively study emission characteristics of colloidal PbS/CdS (core/shell) quantum dots at telecom wavelengths on different substrates, where two different sets of quantum dots emitting within and outside the epsilon-near-zero region are deposited on both glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the epsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence lifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a relative emission cone narrowing from 17.6¬∞ to 10.3¬∞. These results underline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the spectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the potential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration into next-generation quantum photonic devices. Due to their CMOS compatibility, fabrication tunability, and high thermal and optical damage thresholds, TCO NZI materials offer a robust platform for scalable and high-performance quantum optical systems operating within the telecom bandwidth.

Title: Reconstructing the Hamiltonian from the local density of states using neural networks
Authors: Nisarga Paul, Andrew Ma, Kevin P. Nuckolls
Abstract: Reconstructing a quantum system's Hamiltonian from limited yet experimentally observable information is interesting both as a practical task and from a fundamental standpoint. We pose and investigate the inverse problem of reconstructing a Hamiltonian from a spatial map of the local density of states (LDOS) near a fixed energy. We demonstrate high-quality recovery of Hamiltonians from the LDOS using supervised learning. In particular, we generate synthetic data from single-particle Hamiltonians in 1D and 2D, train convolutional neural networks, and obtain models that solve the inverse problem with remarkably high accuracy. Moreover, we are able to generalize beyond the training distribution and develop models with strong robustness to noise. Finally, we comment on possible experimental applications to scanning tunneling microscopy, where we propose that maps of the electronic local density of states might be used to reveal a sample's unknown underlying energy landscape.

Title: Bogoliubov quasi-particles in superconductors are integer-charged particles inapplicable for braiding quantum information
Authors: Zhiyu Fan, Wei Ku
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian, one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.

Title: Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking Phases in Steady States of Quantum Operations
Authors: Niklas Ziereis, Sanjay Moudgalya, Michael Knap
Abstract: Mixed states can exhibit two distinct kinds of symmetries, either on the level of the individual states (strong symmetry), or only on the level of the ensemble (weak symmetry). Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to weak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric density matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric random quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site representation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be regarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to more general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak postselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order transition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly symmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases and their transitions for both abelian $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$ symmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with measurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent in the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum channels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the degeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries. Our results demonstrate robust SW-SSB phases and their transitions in the steady states of noisy quantum operations, and provide a framework for realizing various kinds of mixed-state quantum phases based on their symmetries.

Title: HQNET: Harnessing Quantum Noise for Effective Training of Quantum Neural Networks in NISQ Era
Authors: Muhammad Kashif, Muhammad Shafique
Abstract: Effective training of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) is crucial in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where noise accelerates the onset of barren plateaus (BPs) and limits scalability. This paper investigates how quantum noise impacts QNN trainability and demonstrates that careful selection of qubit measurement observables can mitigate these effects. We analyze PauliX, PauliY, PauliZ, and a customized Hermitian observable under both global (all-qubit measured) and local (single-qubit measured) cost functions. Our results show that with global cost function, PauliX and PauliY lead to flatter landscapes under noise, while PauliZ maintains training up to $8$ qubits before encountering BPs. The customized Hermitian observable proves most robust, enabling training up to $10$ qubits in noisy settings. For local cost function setting, PauliZ outperforms PauliX and PauliY, maintaining efficiency up to $10$ qubits. These findings highlight the importance of noise-aware observable selection, offering a practical strategy to improve QNN performance and advance quantum machine learning in noisy environments.

Title: Topological, multi-mode amplification induced by non-reciprocal, long-range dissipative couplings
Authors: Carlos Vega, Alberto Mu√±oz de las Heras, Diego Porras, Alejandro Gonz√°lez-Tudela
Abstract: Non-reciprocal couplings or drivings are known to induce steady-state, directional, amplification in driven-dissipative bosonic lattices. This amplification phenomenon has been recently linked to the existence of a non-zero topological invariant defined with the system's dynamical matrix, and thus, it depends critically on the couplings' structure. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional, non-reciprocal, long-range dissipative couplings induced by the interaction of the bosonic chain with a chiral, multimode channel, and then study their impact on topological amplification phenomena. We show that these couplings can lead to topological invariant values greater than one which induce topological, multimode amplification and metastability behaviour. Besides, we also show how these couplings can also display topological amplifying phases that are dynamically stable in the presence of local parametric drivings. Finally, we conclude by showing how such phenomena can be naturally obtained in two-dimensional topological insulators hosting multiple edge modes.

Title: Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory and Single-shot Non-Clifford Gate beyond the $n^{1/3}$ Distance Barrier
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.

Title: Lower T-count with faster algorithms
Authors: Vivien Vandaele
Abstract: Among the cost metrics characterizing a quantum circuit, the $T$-count stands out as one of the most crucial as its minimization is particularly important in various areas of quantum computation such as fault-tolerant quantum computing and quantum circuit simulation. In this work, we contribute to the $T$-count reduction problem by proposing efficient $T$-count optimizers with low execution times. In particular, we greatly improve the complexity of TODD, an algorithm currently providing the best $T$-count reduction on various quantum circuits. We also propose some modifications to the algorithm which are leading to a significantly lower number of $T$ gates. In addition, we propose another algorithm which has an even lower complexity and that achieves a better or equal $T$-count than the state of the art on most quantum circuits evaluated. We also prove that the number of $T$ gates in the circuit obtained after executing our algorithms on a Hadamard-free circuit composed of $n$ qubits is upper bounded by $n(n + 1)/2 + 1$, which improves on the worst-case $T$-count of existing optimization algorithms. From this we derive an upper bound of $(n + 1)(n + 2h)/2 + 1$ for the number of $T$ gates in a Clifford$+T$ circuit where $h$ is the number of internal Hadamard gates in the circuit, i.e. the number of Hadamard gates lying between the first and the last $T$ gate of the circuit.

Authors: Zheng Liu, Ding-hui Xu, Yi-jia Yang, Chang-shui Yu
Abstract: Noise suppression and directional signal enhancement are essential challenges in detecting weak magnetic fields in cavity electrodynamics systems. Traditional schemes struggle to reduce magnonic probe noise but lack directional sensing capabilities. We exploit an innovative and intrinsic squeezing mechanism by leveraging the geometric configuration of an anisotropic ellipsoidal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and its interaction with internal demagnetization fields. This mechanism can enhance magnetic field signals and suppress noise in the target direction while suppressing sensitivity in non-target directions to avoid disturbing the target direction, thus generating a directionally selective sensing scheme realizing high-precision detection in complex environments. In particular, the target-direction sensor performance can be optimized by adjusting the YIG sphere's geometry (e.g., aspect ratio) without complex setups, ensuring high feasibility and scalability. Our approach offers greater flexibility and directionality by tuning the YIG sphere's geometry than existing methods. This innovation provides a new approach for weak magnetic field detection in cavity magnonics systems, with potential applications in biomedical imaging, quantum sensing, precision measurement, and environmental monitoring.

Title: Tensor-based quantum phase difference estimation for large-scale demonstration
Authors: Shu Kanno, Kenji Sugisaki, Hajime Nakamura, Hiroshi Yamauchi, Rei Sakuma, Takao Kobayashi, Qi Gao, Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: We develop an energy calculation algorithm leveraging quantum phase difference estimation (QPDE) scheme and a tensor-network-based unitary compression method in the preparation of superposition states and time-evolution gates. Alongside its efficient implementation, this algorithm reduces depolarization noise affections exponentially. We demonstrated energy gap calculations for one-dimensional Hubbard models on IBM superconducting devices using circuits up to 32-system (plus one-ancilla) qubits, a five-fold increase over previous QPE demonstrations, at the 7242 controlled-Z gate level of standard transpilation, utilizing a Q-CTRL error suppression module. Additionally, we propose a technique towards molecular executions using spatial orbital localization and index sorting, verified linear polyene simulations up to 21 qubits. Since QPDE can handle the same objectives as QPE, our algorithm represents a leap forward in quantum computing on real devices.

Abstract: Protecting qubits from environmental noise while maintaining strong coupling for fast high-fidelity control is a central challenge for quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate a control scheme for superconducting fluxonium qubits that eliminates qubit decay through the control channel by suppressing the environmental density of states at the transition frequency. Adding a low-pass filter on the flux line allows for flux-biasing and, at the same time, coherently controlling the fluxonium qubit by parametrically driving it at integer fractions of its transition frequency. We compare the filtered to the unfiltered configuration and find a five times longer $T_1$, and ten times improved $T_2$-echo time in the filtered case. We demonstrate coherent control with up to 11-photon sub-harmonic drives, highlighting the strong non-linearity of the fluxonium potential. Measured Rabi frequencies and drive-induced frequency shifts show excellent agreement with numerical and analytical models. Furthermore, we show the equivalence of a 3-photon sub-harmonic drive to an on-resonance drive by benchmarking sub-harmonic gate fidelities above 99.94$\,$%. These results open up a scalable path for full qubit control through a single Purcell-protected channel, providing strong suppression of control-induced decoherence and enabling wiring-efficient superconducting quantum processors.

Title: Gaussian approximation and its corrections for driven dissipative Kerr model
Authors: K. Sh. Meretukov, A. E. Teretenkov
Abstract: We develop a systematic projection-operator technique for constructing Gaussian approximations and their perturbative corrections in bosonic nonlinear models. As a case study, we apply it to the driven dissipative Kerr oscillator. In the absence of external driving, the model can be solved exactly within a low-dimensional Fock subspace, leading to strongly non-Gaussian states. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the evolution of first- and second-order moments is captured by our Gaussian scheme with high accuracy even in this regime, providing a natural benchmark. For the general case with external driving, our approach reduces the equations of motion to a closed system for means and covariances and allows one to compute systematic corrections beyond the Gaussian level in closed form. We also calculate the dynamics of linear and quadratic combinations of creation and annihilation operators in both weak- and strong-drive regimes.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Dynamical Transition Rates in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Robson Christie, Kyunghyun Baek, Jeongho Bang, Jaewoo Joo
Abstract: Estimating transition rates in open quantum systems is hampered by computing-resource demands that grow rapidly with system size. We present a quantum-simulation framework that enables efficient estimation by recasting the transition rate, given as the time derivative of an equilibrium correlation function, into a set of independently measurable contributions. Each contribution term is evaluated as the expectation value of a parameter-tuned quantum process, thereby circumventing explicit Lindbladian numerics. We validate our method on a spin-1/2 decoherence model using an IBM quantum processor. Further, we apply the method to the Caldeira-Leggett model of quantum Brownian motion as a realistic and practically relevant setting and reaffirm the theoretical soundness and practical implementability. These results provide evidence that quantum simulation can deliver substantial computational advantages in studying open-system kinetics on a quantum computer.

Title: Selective Excitation of Superconducting Qubits with a Shared Control Line through Pulse Shaping

Spring, Shiyu Wang, Shuhei Tamate, Yutaka Tabuchi, Yasunobu Nakamura, Kazuhisa Ogawa, Makoto Negoro
Abstract: In conventional architectures of superconducting quantum computers, each qubit is connected to its own control line, leading to a commensurate increase in the number of microwave lines as the system scales. Frequency-multiplexed qubit control addresses this problem by enabling multiple qubits to share a single microwave line. However, it can cause unwanted excitation of non-target qubits, especially when the detuning between qubits is smaller than the pulse bandwidth. Here, we propose a selective-excitation-pulse (SEP) technique that suppresses unwanted excitations by shaping a drive pulse to create null points at non-target qubit frequencies. In a proof-of-concept experiment with three fixed-frequency transmon qubits, we demonstrate that the SEP technique achieves single-qubit gate fidelities comparable to those obtained with conventional Gaussian pulses while effectively suppressing unwanted excitations in non-target qubits. These results highlight the SEP technique as a promising tool for enhancing frequency-multiplexed qubit control.

Title: Topological state permutations in time-modulated non-Hermitian multiqubit systems with suppressed non-adiabatic transitions
Authors: Ievgen I. Arkhipov, Philippe Lewalle, Franco Nori, ≈ûahin K. √ñzdemir, K. Birgitta Whaley
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have been at the center of intense research for over a decade, partly due to their nontrivial energy topology formed by intersecting Riemann manifolds with branch points known as exceptional points (EPs). This spectral property can be exploited, e.g., to achieve topologically controlled state permutations that are necessary for implementing a wide class of classical and quantum information protocols. However, the complex-valued spectra of typical non-Hermitian systems lead to instabilities, losses, and breakdown of adiabaticity, which impedes the practical use of EP-induced energy topologies in quantum information protocols based on state permutation symmetries. Indeed, in a given non-Hermitian multiqubit system, the dynamical winding around EPs always results in a predetermined set of attenuated final eigenstates, due to the interplay of decoherence and non-adiabatic transitions, irrespective of the initial conditions. In this work, we address this long-standing problem by introducing a model of interacting qubits governed by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that hosts novel types of EPs while maintaining a completely real energy spectrum, ensuring the absence of losses in the system's dynamics. We demonstrate that such non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enable the realization of genuine, in general, non-Abelian permutation groups in the multiqubit system's eigenspace while dynamically encircling these EPs. Our findings indicate that, contrary to previous beliefs, non-Hermiticity can be utilized to achieve controlled topological state permutations in time-modulated multiqubit systems, thus paving the way for the advancement and development of novel quantum information protocols in real-world non-Hermitian quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Metrology in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime of Light-Matter Interactions: Leveraging Virtual Excitations without Extracting Them
Authors: Christoph Hotter, Adam Miranowicz, Karol Gietka
Abstract: Virtual excitations, inherent to ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems, induce measurable modifications in system properties, offering a novel resource for quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how these virtual excitations and their correlations can be harnessed to enhance precision measurements, without the need to extract them. Building on the paradigmatic Dicke model, which describes the interaction between an ensemble of two-level atoms and a single radiation mode, we propose a method to harness hybridized light-matter modes whose renormalized frequencies encode the effects of virtual excitations for quantum metrology. Remarkably, we find that for a fixed squeezing parameter $\xi$, exploiting virtual squeezing through oscillator frequency shifts yields a quadratic enhancement in estimation precision -- scaling as $\exp(4\xi)$ -- compared to the conventional $\exp(2\xi)$ scaling of real squeezed states. These results show that virtual excitations, though unobservable, can drive metrological performance beyond the standard quantum limit. Our approach establishes a broadly applicable framework for high-precision measurements across a wide class of ultrastrongly coupled quantum systems.

Title: Selective collective emission from a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a nanophotonic resonator
Authors: Xinchao Zhou, Deepak A. Suresh, F. Robicheaux, Chen-Lung Hung
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically study collective emission of a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a single mode in a nanophotonic microring resonator. Because many cold atoms are localized in a small volume, these trapped atoms collectively couple not only to the guided resonator mode but also to the nonguided modes in free space. Through tuning the atom-photon coupling and by adjusting the number of trapped atoms, we demonstrate superradiant emission to the microring resonator. For photon emission via the nonguided modes, our study reveals signatures of subradiance and superradiance when the system is driven to the steady state and to the timed-Dicke state, respectively. Our experimental platform thus presents the first atom-light interface with selective collective emission behavior into a guided mode and the environment. Our observation and methodology could shed light on future explorations of collective emission with densely packed quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic light-matter interfaces.

Title: Two-Photon Resonance Fluorescence in a Three-Level Ladder-Type Atom
Authors: Jacob Ngaha, Scott Parkins, Howard J. Carmichael
Abstract: In this work, we consider a three-level ladder-type atom driven by a coherent field, inspired by the experimental work of Gasparinetti et al. [Phys. Rev. A 100, 033802 (2019)]. When driven on two-photon resonance, the atom is excited into its highest energy state $| f \rangle$ by absorbing two photons simultaneously. The atom then de-excites via a cascaded decay $| f \rangle \rightarrow | e \rangle \rightarrow | g \rangle$. Here we present a theoretical study of the atomic fluorescence spectrum where, upon strong coherent driving, the spectrum exhibits seven distinct frequencies corresponding to transitions amongst the atomic dressed states. We characterize the quantum statistics of the emitted photons by investigating the second-order correlation functions of the emitted field. We do so by considering the total field emitted by the atom and focusing on each of the dressed-state components, taking in particular a secular-approximation and deriving straightforward, transparent analytic expressions for the second-order auto- and cross-correlations.

Title: Quantum-Assisted Machine Learning Models for Enhanced Weather Prediction
Authors: Saiyam Sakhuja, Shivanshu Siyanwal, Abhishek Tiwari, Britant, Savita Kashyap
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents as a revolutionary approach to weather forecasting by using quantum computing to improve predictive modeling capabilities. In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.

Title: All-to-all connectivity of Rydberg-atom-based quantum processors with messenger qubits
Authors: Ivan V. Dudinets, Stanislav S. Straupe, Aleksey K. Fedorov, Oleg V. Lychkovskiy
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays are a front-running platform for quantum processors. A major challenge threatening the scalability of this platform is the limited qubit connectivity due to the finite range of interatomic interactions. We explore an approach to realize dynamical all-to-all connectivity with the use of moving "messenger" atomic qubits that couple distant "computational" qubits held in a static tweezer array. We detail and compare four specific architectures based on this concept, each presenting distinct advantages and challenges tied to the efficacy of techniques used to couple, move and measure atomic qubits. We demonstrate that, though technologically demanding, the messenger-qubit paradigm opens a promising avenue to a truly scalable quantum processor based on Rydberg atoms.

Title: QubitHammer: Remotely Inducing Qubit State Change on Superconducting Quantum Computers
Authors: Yizhuo Tan, Navnil Choudhury, Kanad Basu, Jakub Szefer
Abstract: To address the rapidly growing demand for cloud-based quantum computing, various researchers are proposing shifting from the existing single-tenant model to a multi-tenant model that expands resource utilization and improves accessibility. However, while multi-tenancy enables multiple users to access the same quantum computer, it introduces potential for security and reliability vulnerabilities. It therefore becomes important to investigate these vulnerabilities, especially considering realistic attackers who operate without elevated privileges relative to ordinary users. To address this research need, this paper presents and evaluates QubitHammer, the first attack to demonstrate that an adversary can remotely induce unauthorized changes to a victim's quantum circuit's qubit's state within a multi-tenant model by using custom qubit control pulses that are generated within constraints of the public interfaces and without elevated privileges. Through extensive evaluation on real-world superconducting devices from IBM and Rigetti, this work demonstrates that QubitHammer allows an adversary to significantly change the output distribution of a victim quantum circuit. In the experimentation, variational distance is used to evaluate the magnitude of the changes, and variational distance as high as 0.938 is observed. Cross-platform analysis of QubitHammer on a number of quantum computing devices exposes a fundamental susceptibility in superconducting hardware. Further, QubitHammer was also found to evade all currently proposed defenses aimed at ensuring reliable execution in multi-tenant superconducting quantum systems.

Title: Field emission tunnelling as a window onto fundamental issues in quantum mechanics
Authors: Richard G. Forbes
Abstract: Field electron emission (FE) and electrostatic field ionization (ESFI) are quantum-mechanical tunnelling processes that provide basic theory for important technologies. However, the basic theories of FE and ESF1 are not yet completely understood. This paper attempts to identify related fundamental quantum mechanical issues, problems and relevances. The following topics have been identified as deserving closer investigation or discussion. (a) The implication that if a "real electron" cannot have negative kinetic energy, then this necessarily implies that a "real electron" is a distributed object rather than a point object. (b) The implication that the language we use to discuss quantum mechanics needs to be changed in order to avoid referring to the "position of a (point) electron". (c) The idea that "quantum mathematics" (i.e., the mathematics of quantum mechanics) has different utilisations, namely the "matter distribution" and "pathway choice" utilisations, with "measurement" being observed pathway choice. (d) Difficulties with the present formulations of the uncertainty principle and wave-particle duality. (e) Fundamental difficulties in the exact calculation of exchange-and-correlation effects in both FE and ESFI theory. (f) Conceptual problems associated with "seeing electrons" in the field electron (emission) microscope. (g) Field emission tunnelling and the arrow of time. (h) The choice between tunnelling-integral and overlap-integral formulations of tunnelling theory, and the apparent incompleteness of both types of formulation.

Title: Achieving the Heisenberg limit of metrology via measurement on an ancillary qubit
Authors: Peng Chen, Jun Jing
Abstract: In the scenario of the probe-ancilla interaction, we propose a quantum metrology protocol by the unconditional measurement on the ancillary qubit after an optimized period of joint evolution from product state. Its key element is the construction of two parallel evolution paths by the measurement that can transform the probe system (a spin ensemble) from an eigenstate of a collective angular momentum operator $|j,m\rangle$ to a superposed state $(|j,m\rangle+|j,-m\rangle)/\sqrt2$. With synchronous parametric encoding and qubit measurement, the quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system with optimized initial states can exactly attain the Heisenberg scaling $N^2$ with respect to the probe size (spin number) $N$. The quadratic scaling behavior is not sensitive to the imprecise control over the joint evolution time, the time delay between encoding and measurement, and the coherence in the probe ensemble or the ancillary system that would be degraded by local dephasing. The classical Fisher information of the spin ensemble is found to saturate with its quantum counterpart, irrespective of the idle joint evolution after the parametric encoding. We suggest that both Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states and nonlinear Hamiltonian are {\em not} necessary resources for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision since in our protocol even thermal states can hold an asymptotic quadratic scaling.

Title: Quantum Error-Corrected Computation of Molecular Energies

Abstract: We present the first demonstration of an end-to-end pipeline with quantum error correction (QEC) for a quantum computation of the electronic structure of molecular systems. We calculate the ground-state energy of molecular hydrogen, using quantum phase estimation (QPE) on qubits encoded with the $[[7,1,3]]$ color code on Quantinuum H2-2. We obtain improvements in computational fidelity by (1) introducing several partially fault-tolerant (FT) techniques for the Clifford+$R_{Z}$ (arbitrary-angle single-qubit rotation) gate set, and (2) integrating Steane QEC gadgets for real-time error correction. In particular, the latter enhances the QPE circuits' performance despite the complexity of the extra QEC circuitry. The encoded circuits contain up to 1585 (546) fixed and 7202 (1702) conditional physical two-qubit gates (mid-circuit measurements), and $\sim$3900 ($\sim$760) total operations are applied on average. The energy $E$ is experimentally estimated to within $E - E_{\mathrm{FCI}} = 0.001(13)$ hartree, where $E_{\mathrm{FCI}}$ denotes the exact ground state energy within the given basis set. Additionally, we conduct numerical simulations with tunable noise parameters to identify the dominant sources of noise. We find that orienting the QEC protocols towards higher memory noise protection is the most promising avenue to improve our experimental results.

Title: One application of Duistermaat-Heckman measure in quantum information theory
Authors: Lin Zhang, Xiaohan Jiang, Bing Xie
Abstract: While the exact separability probability of 8/33 for two-qubit states under the Hilbert-Schmidt measure has been reported by Huong and Khoi [\href{this https URL}{J.Phys.A:this http URL.{\bf57}, 445304(2024)}], detailed derivations remain inaccessible for general audiences. This paper provides a comprehensive, self-contained derivation of this result, elucidating the underlying geometric and probabilistic structures. We achieve this by developing a framework centered on the computation of Hilbert-Schmidt volumes for key components: the quantum state space, relevant flag manifolds, and regular (co)adjoint orbits. Crucially, we establish and leverage the connection between these Hilbert-Schmidt volumes and the symplectic volumes of the corresponding regular co-adjoint orbits, formalized through the Duistermaat-Heckman measure. By meticulously synthesizing these volume computations -- specifically, the ratios defining the relevant probability measures -- we reconstruct and rigorously verify the 8/33 separability probability. Our approach offers a transparent pathway to this fundamental constant, detailing the interplay between symplectic geometry, representation theory, and quantum probability.

Title: Beyond Copenhagen: Following the Trail of Decoherence in Feynman's Light Microscope
Authors: Brian C. Odom
Abstract: Feynman's light microscope invites us to reconsider what we thought we knew about quantum reality. Rather than invoking wavefunction collapse to predict the loss of fringes in a monitored interferometer, Feynman analyzes the problem in terms of a disturbance. This approach raises the question of whether the classical world, including its localized particles and definite measurement outcomes, might emerge as the universe evolves smoothly according to Schr√∂dinger's equation. Treating the particle and its environment as an entangled system, unmodified quantum mechanics shows remarkable success toward this end. This is the purview of decoherence theory. How we then think about macroscopic reality becomes dependent on how we think about microscopic reality. Is quantum mechanics successful because it describes what microscopic particles are really doing, such as traveling both interferometer paths at the same time? Or is the wavefunction only a mathematical tool which predicts measurement outcomes but does not describe microscopic reality? Both options are uncomfortable. The first implies that each moment in time branches into a vast number of divergent macroscopic realities. The second represents, for many practitioners, a weakened view of science. This article is written to be accessible to anyone with an undergraduate course in quantum mechanics.

Title: Random-projector quantum diagnostics of Ramsey numbers and a prime-factor heuristic for $R(5,5)=45$
Authors: Fabrizio Tamburini
Abstract: We introduce a statistical framework for estimating Ramsey numbers by embedding two-color Ramsey instances into a $Z_2 \times Z_2$-graded Majorana algebra. This approach replaces brute-force enumeration with two randomized spectral diagnostics applied to operators of a given dimension d associated with Ramsey numbers: a linear projector $P_{lin}$ and an exponential map $P_{exp}(\alpha)$, suitable for both classical and quantum computation. In the diagonal case, both diagnostics identify R(5,5) at n=45. The quantum realizations act on a reduced module and therefore require only five data qubits plus a few ancillas via block-encoding/qubitization for R(5,5)=45, in stark contrast to the $\binom{n}{2} \approx 10^3$ logical qubits demanded by direct edge encodings. We also provide few-qubit estimates for R(6,6) and R(7,7), and propose a simple "prime-sequence" consistency heuristic that connects R(5,5)=45 to constrained diagonal growth. Our method echoes Erd≈ës's probabilistic paradigm, emphasizing randomized arguments rather than explicit colorings, and parallels the classical coin-flip approach to Ramsey bounds. Finally, we discuss potential applications of this framework to machine learning with a limited number of qubits.

Title: Quantum Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Spin Chains at Criticality
Authors: Zijun Wei, Mingdi Xu, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Haiping Hu, Lei Pan
Abstract: The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.

Title: Efficient quantum state tomography with Chebyshev polynomials
Authors: Hao Su, Shiying Xiong, Yue Yang
Abstract: Quantum computing shows promise for addressing computationally intensive problems but is constrained by the exponential resource requirements of general quantum state tomography (QST), which fully characterizes quantum states through parameter estimation. We introduce the QST with Chebyshev polynomials, an approximate tomography method for pure quantum states encoding complex-valued functions. This method reformulates tomography as the estimation of Chebyshev expansion coefficients, expressed as inner products between the target quantum state and Chebyshev basis functions, measured using the Hadamard test circuit. By treating the truncation order of the Chebyshev polynomials as a controllable parameter, the method provides a practical balance between efficiency and accuracy. For quantum states encoding functions dominated by large-scale features, such as those representing fluid flow fields, appropriate truncation enables faithful reconstruction of the dominant components via quantum circuits with linear depth, while keeping both measurement repetitions and post-processing independent of qubit count, in contrast to the exponential scaling of full measurement-based QST methods. Validation on analytic functions and numerically generated flow-field data demonstrates accurate reconstruction and effective extraction of large-scale features, indicating the method's suitability for systems governed by macroscopic dynamics.

Title: Rules and Meaning in Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Iulian D. Toader
Abstract: This book concerns the metasemantics of quantum mechanics (QM). Roughly, it pursues an investigation at the intersection of philosophy of physics and philosophy of language, and it offers a critical analysis of rival explanations of the semantic facts of standard QM. Two problems for such explanations are discussed: categoricity and permanence. New results include 1) a reconstruction of Einstein's incompleteness argument, which concludes that a local, separable, and categorical QM cannot exist, 2) a reinterpretation of Bohr's principle of correspondence, grounded in the principle of permanence, 3) a meaning-variance argument for quantum logic, which follows a line of critical reflections initiated by Weyl, and 4) an argument for semantic indeterminacy leveled against inferentialism about QM, inspired by Carnap's work in the philosophy of classical logic.

Title: Satisfiability of commutative vs. non-commutative CSPs
Authors: Andrei A. Bulatov, Stanislav ≈Ωivn√Ω
Abstract: The Mermin-Peres magic square is a celebrated example of a system of Boolean linear equations that is not (classically) satisfiable but is satisfiable via linear operators on a Hilbert space of dimension four. A natural question is then, for what kind of problems such a phenomenon occurs? Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini answered this question for all Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): For 0-Valid-SAT, 1-Valid-SAT, 2-SAT, Horn-SAT, and Dual Horn-SAT, classical satisfiability and operator satisfiability is the same and thus there is no gap; for all other Boolean CSPs, these notions differ as there are gaps, i.e., there are unsatisfiable instances that are satisfiable via operators on Hilbert spaces. We generalize their result to CSPs on arbitrary finite domains and give an almost complete classification: First, we show that NP-hard CSPs admit a separation between classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Second, we show that tractable CSPs of bounded width have no satisfiability gaps of any kind. Finally, we show that tractable CSPs of unbounded width can simulate, in a satisfiability-gap-preserving fashion, linear equations over an Abelian group of prime order $p$; for such CSPs, we obtain a separation of classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, if $p=2$, such CSPs also have gaps separating classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Title: Identification of soft modes in amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ via first-principles
Authors: Alexander C. Tyner, Joshuah T. Heath, Thue Christian Thann, Vincent P. Michal, Peter Krogstrup, Mark Kamper Svendsen, Alexander V. Balatsky
Abstract: Amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ is a fundamental component of modern superconducting qubits. While amphorphous oxides offer distinct advantages, such as directional isotropy and a consistent bulk electronic gap, in realistic systems these compounds support two-level systems (TLSs) which couple to the qubit, expediting decoherence. In this work, we perform a first-principles study of amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and identify low-energy modes in the electronic and phonon spectra as a possible origin for TLSs.

Title: Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons
Authors: Julius Bohm, Hugo Gerlitz, Christina J√∂rg, Michael Fleischhauer
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength.

Title: Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry
Authors: Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the R√©nyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.
