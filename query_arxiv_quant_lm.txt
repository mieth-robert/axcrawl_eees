Title: Broadband spectral manipulation of single photons using cross-phase modulation
Authors: Kate L. Fenwick, Frédéric Bouchard, Guillaume Thekkadath, Philip J. Bustard, Duncan England, Benjamin J. Sussman
Abstract: Manipulating the frequency and bandwidth of light is crucial in classical and quantum applications including communication, spectroscopy, imaging, and signal processing. Such capabilities also offer potential for interfacing disparate quantum systems in quantum networking and for quantum information processing. We experimentally demonstrate deterministic, broadband frequency control of heralded telecom-band single photons via cross-phase modulation in a short length of single-mode fiber. An intense, ultrafast pump pulse imposes a transient, intensity-dependent refractive-index gradient which imparts a tunable phase shift on the single photons. We present absolute frequency shifts of up to $+6.46\pm0.01$\,THz and $-5.74\pm0.01$\,THz, and bandwidth manipulation ranging from a factor of $0.66\pm0.03$ to $8.4\pm0.3$ times that of the input. Spectral measurements are acquired with a time-of-flight spectrometer and superconducting nanowire detectors. Our scheme offers a compact and scalable route to spectral routing and bandwidth engineering for ultrafast quantum networking and quantum information processing.

Title: Breaking global symmetries with locality-preserving operations
Authors: Michele Mazzoni, Luca Capizzi, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: In the general framework of quantum resource theories, one typically only distinguishes between operations that can or cannot generate the resource of interest. In many-body settings, one can further characterize quantum operations based on underlying geometrical constraints, and a natural question is to understand the power of resource-generating operations that preserve locality. In this work, we address this question within the resource theory of asymmetry, which has recently found applications in the study of many-body symmetry-breaking and symmetry-restoration phenomena. We consider symmetries corresponding to both abelian and non-abelian compact groups with a homogeneous action on the space of $N$ qubits, focusing on the prototypical examples of $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$. We study the so-called $G$-asymmetry $\Delta S^{G}_N$, and present two main results. First, we derive a general bound on the asymmetry that can be generated by locality-preserving operations acting on product states. We prove that, in any spatial dimension, $\Delta S^{G}_N\leq (1/2)\Delta S^{G, \rm max}_N[1+o(1)]$, where $\Delta S^{G, \rm max}_N$ is the maximum value of the $G$-asymmetry in the full many-body Hilbert space. Second, we show that locality-preserving operations can generate maximal asymmetry, $\Delta S^{G}_N\sim\Delta S^{G, \rm max}_N$, when applied to symmetric states featuring long-range entanglement. Our results provide a unified perspective on recent studies of asymmetry in many-body physics, highlighting a non-trivial interplay between asymmetry, locality, and entanglement.

Title: Learning measurement-induced phase transitions using attention
Authors: Hyejin Kim, Abhishek Kumar, Yiqing Zhou, Yichen Xu, Romain Vasseur, Eun-Ah Kim
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) epitomize new intellectual pursuits inspired by the advent of quantum hardware and the emergence of discrete and programmable circuit dynamics. Nevertheless, experimentally observing this transition is challenging, often requiring non-scalable protocols, such as post-selecting measurement trajectories or relying on classical simulations. We introduce a scalable data-centric approach using Quantum Attention Networks (QuAN) to detect MIPTs without requiring post-selection or classical simulation. Applying QuAN to dynamics generated by Haar random unitaries and weak measurements, we first demonstrate that it can pinpoint MIPTs using their interpretation as "learnability" transitions, where it becomes possible to distinguish two different initial states from the measurement record, locating a phase boundary consistent with exact results. Motivated by sample efficiency, we consider an alternative "phase recognition" task-classifying weak- and strong-monitoring data generated from a single initial state. We find QuAN can provide an efficient and noise-tolerant upper bound on the MIPT based on measurement data alone by coupling Born-distribution-level (inter-trajectory) and dynamical (temporal) attention. In particular, our inspection of the inter-trajectory scores of the model trained with minimal sample size processing test data confirmed that QuAN paid special attention to the tail of the distribution of the Born probabilities at early times. This reassuring interpretation of QuAN's learning implies the phase-recognition approach can meaningfully signal MIPT in an experimentally accessible manner. Our results lay the groundwork for observing MIPT on near-term quantum hardware and highlight attention-based architectures as powerful tools for learning complex quantum dynamics.

Title: The Quantum Ensemble Variational Optimization Algorithm: Applications to Molecular Inverse Design
Authors: Francesco Calcagno, Delmar G. A. Cabral, Ivan Rivalta, Victor S. Batista
Abstract: Designing molecules with optimized properties remains a fundamental challenge due to the intricate relationship between molecular structure and properties. Traditional computational approaches that address the combinatorial number of possible molecular designs become unfeasible as the molecular size increases, suffering from the so-called `curse of dimensionality' problem. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware present new opportunities to address this problem. Here, we introduce the Quantum Ensemble Variational Optimization (QEVO) method for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. QEVO efficiently maps molecular structures onto an orthonormal basis of Pauli strings and samples from a superposition state generated by a variational ansatz. The ansatz is iteratively optimized to identify molecular candidates with the desired property. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the potential of QEVO in designing drug-like molecules with anticancer properties, employing a shallow quantum circuit that requires only a modest number of qubits. We envision that QEVO could be applied to a wide range of complex problems, offering practical solutions to problems with combinatorial complexity.

Title: Orthocomplemented subspaces and partial projections on a Hilbert space
Authors: Iosif Petrakis
Abstract: We introduce the notion of an orthocomplemented subspace of a Hilbert space H, that is, a pair of orthogonal closed subspaces of H, as a two-dimensional counterpart to the one-dimensional notion of a closed subspace of H. Orthocomplemented subspaces are the Hilbert space-analogue to Bishop's complemented subsets. To complemented subsets correspond their characteristic functions, which are partial, Boolean-valued functions. Similarly, to orthocomplemented subspaces of H correspond partial projections on H. Previous work of Bridges and Svozil on constructive quantum logic is an one-dimensional approach to the subject. The lattice-properties of the orthocomplemented subspaces of a Hilbert space is a two-dimensional approach to constructive quantum logic, that we call complemented quantum logic. Since the negation of an orthocomplemented subspace is formed by swapping its components, complemented quantum logic, although constructive, is closer to classical quantum logic than the constructive quantum logic of Bridges and Svozil. The introduction of orthocomplemented subspaces and their corresponding partial projections allows a new approach to the constructive theory of Hilbert spaces. For example, the partial projection operator of an orthocomplemented subspace and the construction of the quotient Hilbert space bypass the standard restrictive hypothesis of locatedness on a subspace. Located subspaces correspond to total orthocomplemented subspaces.

Title: Quantum Higher Order Fourier Analysis and the Clifford Hierarchy
Authors: Kaifeng Bu, Weichen Gu, Arthur Jaffe
Abstract: We propose a mathematical framework that we call quantum, higher-order Fourier analysis. This generalizes the classical theory of higher-order Fourier analysis, which led to many advances in number theory and combinatorics. We define a family of quantum measures on a Hilbert space, that reduce in the case of diagonal matrices to the classical uniformity norms. We show that our quantum measures and our related theory of quantum higher-order Fourier analysis characterize the Clifford hierarchy, an important notion of complexity in quantum information. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient analytic condition that a unitary is an element of the k-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy for Battery Materials
Authors: Alexander Kunitsa, Diksha Dhawan, Stepan Fomichev, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Minghao Zhang, Torin F. Stetina
Abstract: The dynamic structure factor (DSF) is a central quantity for interpreting a vast array of inelastic scattering experiments in chemistry and materials science, but its accurate simulation is a considerable challenge for classical computational methods. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm and an end-to-end simulation framework to compute the DSF, providing a general approach for simulating momentum-resolved spectroscopies. We apply this approach to the simulation of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the core-level electronic excitation regime, a spectroscopic technique offering sub-nanometer spatial resolution and capable of resolving element-specific information, crucial for analyzing battery materials. We derive a quantum algorithm for computing the DSF for EELS by evaluating the off-diagonal terms of the time-domain Green's function, enabling the simulation of momentum-resolved spectroscopies. To showcase the algorithm, we study the oxygen K-edge EELS spectrum of lithium manganese oxide ($Li_2MnO_3$), a prototypical cathode material for investigating the mechanisms of oxygen redox in battery materials. For a representative model of an oxygen-centered cluster of $Li_2MnO_3$ with an active space of 18 active orbitals, the algorithm requires a circuit depth of $3.25\times10^{8}$ T gates, 100 logical qubits, and roughly $10^4$ shots.

Title: Teleportation based detection of quantum critical points using small spin chains
Authors: G. A. P. Ribeiro, Gustavo Rigolin
Abstract: We show for the models here investigated that the teleportation based quantum critical point (QCP) detectors can properly estimate the locations of the QCPs when we are not even close to the thermodynamic limit (infinite spin chains) and when we only have access to finite temperature data. Specifically, by working with spin chains with about ten qubits and in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature T, we show that it is possible to locate with an error of only a few percents the correct spots of the QCPs for almost all the models studied here. The spin chains we investigate are given by the XXZ model with or without an external longitudinal magnetic field as well as the XX model, the XY model, and the Ising model, all of them subjected to an external transverse magnetic field.

Title: Parallel Architecture of a Frequency Comb Qudit Quantum Processor
Authors: Duncan L. MacFarlane, Hiva Shahoei, Murphy V. Paul, R. Mason Tuller, Mitchell A. Thornton
Abstract: Quantum optical frequency combs provide an intriguing approach to high-dimensional quantum states. Because of the need to move probabilities among different colors, the realization of gates appropriate to multicolor photons requires nonlinear or electro-optic mixing. This paper describes a novel architecture for such gates. The parallel arrangement of mixers by dimension allows graceful scaling beyond two-dimensional qubits. The parallelism of the implementation simplifies the programming of the gate for a particular operation. As an example, we demonstrate the design of a four-dimensional Chrestenson operator.

Title: Probing Local Branching Dynamics with Stern-Gerlach Interferometers and Dual Sensing
Authors: Xing M. Wang
Abstract: We propose a new experimental program to empirically distinguish the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) from the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) and Many-Worlds Interpretations (MWI) by examining the dynamics of local quantum branching. Our approach uses Stern-Gerlach interferometers (SGIs) equipped with a novel dual sensing technique, combining non-destructive transparent sensors (TSs) and projective opaque detectors (ODs), to test foundational principles in a closed system. The first stage employs a single SGI with dual sensors to search for anomalous "delayed-choice" events that challenge the instantaneous collapse of CI and the global branching of MWI. The second stage involves a full-loop SGI with two TSs and one OD to investigate recoherence phenomena, which would violate both CI and MWI if observed. Finally, the third stage introduces a second full-loop SGI with a test ion to generate an electromagnetic phase shift, enabling discrimination between retrocausal and unitary recoherence mechanisms. Successfully observing these rare anomalies, while without breaking any conservation laws, would offer strong evidence for the local branching framework of BHSI, showing a fuzzy quantum-classical boundary within dual sensing. The proposed experiments are feasible with current trapped-ion and quantum sensing technologies, offering a promising path forward in the ongoing debate over quantum interpretations.

Title: Quantum Optimal Control with Geodesic Pulse Engineering
Authors: Dylan Lewis, Roeland Wiersema, Sougato Bose
Abstract: Designing multi-qubit quantum logic gates with experimental constraints is an important problem in quantum computing. Here, we develop a new quantum optimal control algorithm for finding unitary transformations with constraints on the Hamiltonian. The algorithm, geodesic pulse engineering (GEOPE), uses differential programming and geodesics on the Riemannian manifold of $\textrm{SU}(2^n)$ for $n$ qubits. We demonstrate significant improvements over the widely used gradient-based method, GRAPE, for designing multi-qubit quantum gates. Instead of a local gradient descent, the parameter updates of GEOPE are designed to follow the geodesic to the target unitary as closely as possible. We present numerical results that show that our algorithm converges significantly faster than GRAPE for a range of gates and can find solutions that are not accessible to GRAPE in a reasonable amount of time. The strength of the method is illustrtated with varied multi-qubit gates in 2D neutral Rydberg atom platforms.

Title: Unified trajectory criterion for quantum and classical non-Markovianity
Authors: Le Hu, Archana Kamal
Abstract: We propose a simple criterion for non-Markovianity: a quantum master equation is non-Markovian if and only if its \textit{trajectory set} contains a \textit{self-intersecting trajectory} (defined in the main text). Since self-intersection is invariant under time reversal, our criterion implies that Markovianity itself is time-reversal invariant: This property is not possessed by many existing criteria based on information flow or complete positivity. For a given quantum master equation, the set of trajectories generated from all initial states encodes its essential dynamical features. Thus, Markovianity can be determined directly from the trajectory set, reducing the problem to a general mathematical one: determing the non-Markovianity of the set itself, regardless of whether it originates from a quantum or classical process. Here, we solve this problem and classify the trajectory sets into three types: \textit{strictly Markovian}, \textit{initial-state Markovian}, and \textit{non-Markovian}. Through multiple examples, we compare our criterion with existing ones and show how they fail to capture Markovianity and non-Markovianity in various cases.

Title: Entanglement generation across exceptional points in two-qubit open quantum system -- the role of initial states
Authors: B. A. Tay, Yee Shean H'ng
Abstract: We study an open quantum system of two qubits that are coupled by swapping interaction. Using the coupling strength between the qubits as a time scale, the Liouvillian of the system has exceptional points that depend on the disparity between the decay rates of the qubits. We find that the configuration of the initial states plays an important role in deciding the character of the entanglement dynamics at the initial stage of evolution. Depending on whether or not the initial excitations of the qubits can be swapped by the interaction that couples them, a change in the total decay rate can be either consistently unfavorable to entanglement generation, or shift the dynamics from hindering to enhancing entanglement generation, or vice versa, as the system traverses the exceptional points. The shift could also occur in a wide range of mixed states. We clarify the origin of the behavior in this work.

Title: Protocol for Purifying Noisy Preparation and Measurements of Qubits
Authors: Jaemin Kim, Seungchan Seo, Jiyoung Yun, Benjamin Lienhard, Joonwoo Bae
Abstract: Noise affecting qubit preparation and measurements accounts for a significant fraction of errors in quantum information processing. This is especially critical in tasks like variational quantum algorithms, quantum error correction, and entanglement distribution through repeaters. In this work, we present a protocol to purify noisy SPAM, effectively suppressing these errors to an arbitrarily low level. For instance, in a realistic scenario where qubits contain error rates around $0.05$ in both preparation and measurement, the protocol can suppress error rates up to $10^{-3}$ with a single ancilla and $10^{-6}$ with four ancillas. We show how to distill error-free SPAM by repeating noisy SPAMs. The protocol is also feasible with superconducting qubits. We envisage that our results can be used to realize quantum information tasks in computing and communication with negligible SPAM errors.

Title: Quantum Communication Complexity of L2-Regularized Linear Regression Protocols
Authors: Sayaki Matsushita
Abstract: Linear regression is fundamental to statistical analysis and machine learning, but its application to large-scale datasets necessitates distributed computing. The problem also arises in quantum computing, where handling extensive data requires distributed approaches. This paper investigates distributed linear regression in the quantum coordinator model. Building upon the distributed quantum least squares protocol developed by Montanaro and Shao, we propose improved and extended quantum protocols for solving both ordinary (unregularized) and L2-regularized (Tikhonov) least squares problems. For ordinary least squares methods, our protocol reduces the quantum communication complexity compared to the previous protocol. In particular, this yields a quadratic improvement in the number of digits of precision required for the generated quantum states. This improvement is achieved by incorporating advanced techniques such as branch marking and branch-marked gapped phase estimation developed by Low and Su. Additionally, we introduce a quantum protocol for the L2-regularized least squares problem and derive its quantum communication complexity.

Title: Time-Optimal Control of Finite Dimensional Open Quantum Systems via a Model Predictive Strategy
Authors: Yunyan Lee, Ian R. Petersen, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: To mitigate dissipative effects from environmental interactions and efficiently stabilize quantum states, time-optimal control has emerged as an effective strategy for open quantum systems. This paper extends the framework by incorporating Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) into the control process, enabling quantum measurements to guide control updates at each step. To address uncertainties in measurement outcomes, we derive a lower bound on the probability of obtaining a desired outcome from POVM-based measurements and establish stability conditions that ensure a monotonic decrease in the cost function. The proposed method is applied to finite-level open quantum systems, and we also present a detailed analysis of two-level systems under depolarizing, phase-damping, and amplitude-damping channels. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the strategy in preserving coherence and achieving high fidelity across diverse noise environments.

Title: Autonomous conversion of particle-exchange to quantum self-oscillations
Authors: Sofia Sevitz, Federico Cerisola, Karen V. Hovhannisyan, Janet Anders
Abstract: Particle-exchange machines utilize electronic transport to continuously transfer heat between fermionic reservoirs. Here, we couple a quantum mechanical resonator to a particle-exchange machine hosted in a quantum dot and let the system run autonomously. This way, part of the energy exchanged between the reservoirs can be stored in the resonator in the form of self-oscillations. Our analysis goes well beyond previous works by exploring the slow transport regime and accessing arbitrarily strong dot--resonator coupling. First, we introduce a faithful measure of self-oscillations, and use it to certify that they can occur in the slow-transport regime. We furthermore show that the electrical current through the dot can be used to witness self-oscillations. Finally, we establish that, under realistic conditions, self-oscillations occur only when the machine operates as a heater. We define an experimentally measurable performance metric characterizing the efficiency of current--to--self-oscillations conversion. It reveals that, counterintuitively, strong dot--resonator coupling is detrimental to the conversion performance. The framework developed here can be readily implemented in a variety of nanoscale devices, such as a suspended carbon nanotube with an embedded quantum dot.

Title: Universal quantum control over Majorana zero modes
Authors: Zhu-yao Jin, Jun Jing
Abstract: Majorana zero mode (MZM) exhibits inherent resilience to local parametric fluctuations in quantum information processing, due to a topological protection mechanism in the non-Abelian braiding statistics of the anyonic quasiparticles. In this paper, we construct the braiding operations between arbitrary pair of three MZMs under the framework of universal quantum control (UQC). Largely detuned driving fields on the mediator, a local defect of lattice, enable indirect and tunable exchange interaction among arbitrary two MZMs. The braiding operations can then present through the evolution along the universal nonadiabatic passages, whose robustness against the driving-field errors can be substantially enhanced by rapid modulation of the passage-dependent global phase. Moreover, a chiral population transfer on MZMs along the universal passage can be perfectly demonstrated in both clockwise and counterclockwise manners. Our scale-free protocol therefore provides an avenue towards the universal quantum control over MZMs, which is fundamental and essential for topological quantum computation.

Title: Fault-tolerant quantum computations of vibrational wave functions
Authors: Marco Majland, Rasmus Berg Jensen, Patrick Ettenhuber, Irfansha Shaik, Nikolaj Thomas Zinner, Ove Christiansen
Abstract: Quantum computation of vibrational properties of molecules is a promising platform to obtain computational advantages for computational chemistry. However, fault-tolerant quantum computations of vibrational properties remain a relatively unexplored field in quantum computing. In this work, we present different algorithms for efficient encodings of vibrational Hamiltonians using qubitization. Specifically, we investigate different encoding representations, high order tensor decomposition to obtain low rank approximations for the vibrational Hamiltonian, rectilinear and polyspherical coordinate systems, parallelization and grouping algorithms. To investigate the performance of the different methods, we perform benchmark computations for both small and large molecules with more than one hundred vibrational modes.

Title: Dissipation-Driven Topological Phase Transition in Quantum Open Systems Independent of system Hamiltonian
Authors: Tian-Shu Deng, Fan Yang
Abstract: We investigate dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in one-dimensional quantum open systems governed by the Lindblad equation with linear dissipation operators, which ensure the density matrix retains its Gaussian form throughout the dynamics. By employing the modular Hamiltonian framework, we rigorously demonstrate that the $\rm{Z}_2$ topological invariant characterizing steady states in one-dimensional class D systems is exclusively dependent on the dissipation operators, rather than the system Hamiltonian. Through a quench protocol where the system evolves from the steady state of one Lindbladian to another, we reveal that topological transitions can occur at analytically predictable critical times, even when the initial and final steady states share identical topological indices. These transitions are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to depend solely on dissipation parameters. Entanglement spectrum analysis demonstrates bulk-edge correspondence in non-equilibrium density matrices via coexisting single-particle gap closures (periodic boundaries) and topologically protected zero modes (open boundaries), directly underpinning the detection of dissipation-induced topology in quantum simulators.

Title: Statistics-encoded tensor network approach in disordered quantum many-body spin chains
Authors: Hao Zhu, Ding-Zu Wang, Shi-Ju Ran, Guo-Feng Zhang
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems with disorder is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose a general approach -- the statistics-encoded tensor network (SeTN) -- to study such systems. By encoding disorder into an auxiliary layer and averaging separately, SeTN restores translational invariance, enabling a well-defined transfer matrix formulation. We derive a universal criterion, $n \gg \alpha^2 t^2$, linking discretization $n$, disorder strength $\alpha$, and evolution duration $t$. This sets the resolution required for faithful disorder averaging and shows that encoding is most efficient in the weak-disorder, typically chaotic regime. Applied to the disordered transverse-field Ising model, SeTN shows that the spectral form factor is governed by the leading transfer-matrix eigenvalue, in contrast to the kicked Ising model. SeTN thus provides a novel framework for probing the disorder-driven dynamical phenomena in many-body quantum systems.

Title: Robust Control and Entanglement of Qudits in Neutral Atom Arrays
Authors: Amir Burshtein, Shachar Fraenkel, Moshe Goldstein, Ran Finkelstein
Abstract: Quantum devices comprised of elementary components with more than two stable levels - so-called qudits - enrich the accessible Hilbert space, enabling applications ranging from fault-tolerant quantum computing to simulating complex many-body models. While several quantum platforms are built from local elements that are equipped with a rich spectrum of stable energy levels, schemes for the efficient control and entanglement of qudits are scarce. Importantly, no experimental demonstration of multi-qudit control has been achieved to date in neutral atom arrays. Here, we propose a general scheme for controlling and entangling qudits and perform a full analysis for the case of qutrits, encoded in ground and metastable states of alkaline earth atoms. We find an efficient implementation of single-qudit gates via the simultaneous driving of multiple transition frequencies. For entangling operations, we provide a concrete and intuitive recipe for the controlled-Z (CZ) gate for any local dimension d, realized through alternating single qudit and entangling pulses that simultaneously drive up to two Rydberg transitions. We further prove that two simultaneous Rydberg tones are, in general, the minimum necessary for implementing the CZ gate with a global drive. The pulses we use are optimally-controlled, smooth, and robust to realistic experimental imperfections, as we demonstrate using extensive noise simulations. This amounts to a minimal, resource-efficient, and practical protocol for realizing a universal set of gates. Our scheme for the native control of qudits in a neutral atom array provides a high-fidelity route toward qudit-based quantum computation, ready for implementation on near-term devices.

Title: Hybrid Classical-Quantum Supercomputing: A demonstration of a multi-user, multi-QPU and multi-GPU environment
Authors: Mateusz Slysz, Piotr Rydlichowski, Krzysztof Kurowski, Omar Bacarezza, Esperanza Cuenca Gomez, Zohim Chandani, Bettina Heim, Pradnya Khalate, William R. Clements, James Fletcher
Abstract: Achieving a practical quantum advantage for near-term applications is widely expected to rely on hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. To deliver this practical advantage to users, high performance computing (HPC) centers need to provide a suitable software and hardware stack that supports algorithms of this type. In this paper, we describe the world's first implementation of a classical-quantum environment in an HPC center that allows multiple users to execute hybrid algorithms on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) and GPUs. Our setup at the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PCSS) aligns with current HPC norms: the computing hardware including QPUs is installed in an active data center room with standard facilities; there are no special considerations for networking, power, and cooling; we use Slurm for workload management as well as the NVIDIA CUDA-Q extension API for classical-quantum interactions. We demonstrate applications of this environment for hybrid classical-quantum machine learning and optimisation. The aim of this work is to provide the community with an experimental example for further research and development on how quantum computing can practically enhance and extend HPC capabilities.

Title: Quantum-Enhanced Optimization by Warm Starts
Authors: Ieva Čepaitė, Niam Vaishnav, Leo Zhou, Ashley Montanaro
Abstract: We present an approach, which we term quantum-enhanced optimization, to accelerate classical optimization algorithms by leveraging quantum sampling. Our method uses quantum-generated samples as warm starts to classical heuristics for solving challenging combinatorial problems like Max-Cut and Maximum Independent Set (MIS). To implement the method efficiently, we introduce novel parameter-setting strategies for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), qubit mapping and routing techniques to reduce gate counts, and error-mitigation techniques. Experimental results, including on quantum hardware, showcase runtime improvements compared with the original classical algorithms.

Title: Rethinking Quantum Repeaters: Balancing Scalability, Feasibility, and Interoperability
Authors: Javier Rey-Domínguez, Mohsen Razavi
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are enabling technologies for long-distance quantum communications. Despite the significant progress in the field, we still not only face implementation challenges but also need theoretical solutions that better meet all the desired design criteria. Preliminary solutions for quantum repeaters often do not scale well, while the most advanced solutions are so demanding that their implementation may take a long time and require substantial changes to current telecom infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a compromise solution that is not only scalable in the mid-to-long term but also adapts well to the realities of the backbone networks in the current Internet infrastructure. The key ideas behind our solution are twofold. First, we use a connectionless approach to entanglement swapping, allowing our solution to benefit from the same features as packet-switched networks. Second, we employ simple error detection, rather than more complicated error correction, techniques to make our solution sufficiently scalable in the face of errors. This is achieved without requiring overly demanding specifications for the physical devices needed in the network. We test this idea in a quantum key distribution (QKD) setting over a repeater chain and demonstrate how trust-free continental QKD can be achieved through several stages of development.

Title: Characterization of Strain Parameters in a Diamond Nanophotonic Structure
Authors: Ayan Majumder, Vivek K Shukla, Anuj Bathla, Brajesh S. Yadav, Nanhey Singh, Padmnabh Rai, Kasturi Saha
Abstract: Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^-$) centers and other color centers in diamonds have emerged as promising platforms for quantum communication, quantum information processing, and nanoscale sensing, owing to their long spin coherence times, fast spin control, and efficient photon coupling. Deterministic placement of individual color centers into nanophotonic structures is critical for scalable device integration, and ion implantation is the most viable technique. Nanofabrication processes, including diamond etching, are essential to realize these structures but can introduce crystal strain through lattice damage. In this work, we investigate the impact of ion implantation and nanofabrication-induced strain on the electronic spin levels of NV$^-$ centers. We demonstrate that the zero-field continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) spectrum serves as a sensitive probe of local crystal strain, providing both quantitative and directional information. Furthermore, we present a model that explains the strain-induced features observed in the ODMR spectra of the single NV$^-$ center, offering a framework to characterize the strain effects in diamond-based nanophotonic devices.

Title: Quantum detectors as autonomous machines: assessing the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of information acquisition
Authors: Emanuel Schwarzhans, Tony J. G. Apollaro, Ilia Khomchenko, Maximilian P. E. Lock, Mark T. Mitchison, Marcus Huber
Abstract: We formulate a minimal model of a quantum particle detector as an autonomous quantum thermal machine. Our goal is to establish how entropy production, which is needed to maintain the detector out of equilibrium, is linked to the quality of the measurement process. Using our model, we perform a detailed investigation of the detector's key performance characteristics: namely, detection efficiency, gain, jitter, dead time, and dark counts. We find that entropy production constrains both the efficiency and temporal precision of the detection process, in the sense that improved performance generally requires more dissipation. We also find that reducing either the detection jitter or dead time unavoidably increases the rate of dark counts. Our work establishes a quantitative connection between entropy production and the quality of the irreversible detection process, highlights fundamental tradeoffs in the performance of particle detectors, and provides a framework for further investigations of the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum measurement and amplification.

Title: Parrondo paradox in quantum image encryption
Authors: Łukasz Pawela
Abstract: We present a quantum image encryption protocol that harnesses discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on cycles and explicitly examines the role of the Parrondo paradox in security. Using the NEQR representation, a DTQW-generated probability mask is transformed into a quantum key image and applied via CNOT to encrypt grayscale images. We adopt an efficient circuit realization of DTQWs based on QFT-diagonalization and coin-conditioned phase layers, yielding low depth for $N=2^n$ positions and $t$ steps. On $64\times 64$ benchmark images, the scheme suppresses adjacent-pixel correlations to near zero after encryption, produces nearly uniform histograms, and achieves high ciphertext entropy close to the 8-bit ideal. Differential analyses further indicate strong diffusion and confusion: NPCR exceeds $99\%$ and UACI is around $30\%$, consistent with robust sensitivity to small plaintext changes. Crucially, we identify parameter regimes in which alternating coin operations induce the Parrondo paradox and degrade security-raising correlations, lowering entropy, and reducing NPCR/UACI, thereby constituting practical failure modes. Our results provide both a performant DTQW-based quantum image cipher and clear guidance on coin/message parameter selection to avoid paradox-dominated regimes. We discuss implications for hardware implementations and extensions to higher-dimensional walks.

Title: Quantum Fisher information as a witness of non-Markovianity and criticality in the spin-boson model
Authors: Daniele Parlato, Grazia Di Bello, Fabrizio Pavan, Giulio De Filippis, Carmine Antonio Perroni
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing because of its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian serve as a genuine witness of bipartite entanglement and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point. In the paradigmatic spin-boson model, the non-monotonic features of the quantum Fisher information matrix signal changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates, and qubit readout is critical for building scalable, error-corrected quantum computers. However, device parameters that enhance one operation often degrade the others, making simultaneous optimization challenging. Here, we demonstrate that careful tuning of qubit-coupler coupling strengths in a superconducting circuit with two transmon qubits coupled via a tunable coupler enables high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates, without compromising readout performance. As a result, we achieve a 40h-averaged CZ gate fidelity of 99.93%, simultaneous single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.98%, and readout fidelities over 99.94% in a single device. These results are enabled by optimized coupling parameters, an efficient CZ gate calibration experiment based on our new Phased-Averaged Leakage Error Amplification (PALEA) protocol, and a readout configuration compatible with high coherence qubits. Our results demonstrate a viable path toward scaling up superconducting quantum processors while maintaining consistently high fidelities across all core operations.

Title: Clifford Accelerated Adaptive QAOA
Authors: Théo Lisart-Liebermann, Arcesio Castañeda Medina
Abstract: Clifford Circuit Initializaton improves on initial guess of parameters on Parametric Quantum Circuits (PQCs) by leveraging efficient simulation of circuits made out of gates from the Clifford Group. The parameter space is pre-optimized by exploring the Hilbert space in a reduced ensemble of Clifford-expressible points (Clifford Points), providing better initialization. Simultaneously, dynamical circuit reconfiguration algorithms, such as ADAPT-QAOA, improve on QAOA performances by providing a gate re-configuration routine while the optimization is being executed. In this article, we show that Clifford Point approximations at multiple levels of ADAPT allow for multiple improvements while increasing quantum-classical integration opportunities. First we show numerically that Clifford Point preoptimization offers non-trivial gate-selection behavior in ADAPT with some possible convergence improvement. Second, that Clifford Point approximations allows for more suited, fully parallel and fully classical ADAPT operator selection for MaxCut and the TFIM problem. Finally, we show that applying 10 to 30\% error approximation on T-gates using low-rank stabilizer decomposition can provide significative improvements in convergence quality for the MaxCut and TFIM problem. The latter hints at significant T-gate over-representation in antsatz design, opening opportunities for aggressive compilation optimizations.

Title: Analytic Tools for Harvesting Magic Resource in Curved Spacetime
Authors: Jiayue Yang, Dyuman Bhattacharya, Ming Zhang, Robert B. Mann
Abstract: The quantum vacuum is not really empty; it is a reservoir of operationally accessible non-classical resources. Understanding how to extract these resources to fuel information processing is a core objective in quantum technologies and lies at the heart of relativistic quantum information (RQI). While earlier studies of quantum resource harvesting protocols relied primarily on numerical methods, we present, for the first time, exact analytic results for the transition probability and coherence of a qutrit Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a scalar field in anti-de Sitter spacetime of arbitrary dimension. Leveraging these results, we analytically investigate the harvesting of non-stabilizerness and demonstrate that stronger spacetime curvature and higher dimensionality significantly suppress the amount of extractable magic resource from the vacuum. Our analytic framework is readily applicable to other scenarios, laying the groundwork for further analytic studies in RQI.

Title: Modeling of Far-Field Quantum Coherence by Dielectric Bodies Based on the Volume Integral Equation Method
Authors: Chengnian Huang, Hangyu Ge, Yijia Cheng, Zi He, Feng Liu, Wei E. I. Sha
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is a hallmark of nonclassical photon interference. Accurate modeling of angle-resolved two-photon correlations in complex dielectric structures remains challenging because no efficient numerical framework directly links classical electromagnetic quantities to quantum correlation functions. We present a unified theoretical and computational framework for evaluating far-field HOM interference from arbitrary dielectric bodies. By quantizing plane-wave scattering modes and computing their far-field responses with a volume integral equation (VIE) solver, we determine the second-order normalized correlation function without near-to-far-field transformations or perfectly matched layers. This enables efficient evaluation of frequency-domain correlations and time-domain coincidence counts for photon wave packets. The approach is validated against analytical results for dielectric spheres and applied to a polarization-converting Pancharatnam-Berry-phase metasurface, revealing strong angular dependence of quantum interference that correlates with the characteristics of the HOM dip. The framework offers a computationally efficient and physically transparent tool for exploring structure-dependent quantum correlations, with applications to quantum antennas, metasurface-based quantum state engineering, and quantum inverse design.

Title: Decoherent histories with(out) objectivity in a (broken) apparatus
Authors: Benoît Ferté, Davide Farci, Xiangyu Cao
Abstract: We characterize monitored quantum dynamics in a solvable model exhibiting a phase transition between a measurement apparatus and a scrambler. We show that approximate decoherent histories emerge in both phases with respect to a coarse-grained extensive observable. However, the apparatus phase, where quantum Darwinism emerges, is distinguished by the non-ergodicity of the histories and their correlation with the measured qubit, which selects an ensemble of preferred pointer states. Our results demonstrate a clear distinction between two notion of classicality, decoherent histories and environment-induced decoherence.

Title: Manifestations of flow topology in a quantum driven-dissipative system
Authors: Kilian Seibold, Greta Villa, Javier del Pino, Oded Zilberberg
Abstract: In driven-dissipative bosonic systems, the interplay between coherent driving, inter-particle interactions and dissipation leads to a rich variety of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS). In the semiclassical limit, the flow topology of phase-space dynamics governs the stability and structure of these dynamical phases. Consequently, topological transitions occur when the number of NESS, their chirality, or their connectivity changes, reflecting global reorganization in the system's dynamical phase-space landscape. Here, we study the corresponding topological signatures in a driven-dissipative quantum Kerr oscillator. Employing a Lindblad master equation and quantum trajectory methods, we reveal that quantum dynamics retain key topological features of the underlying classical flows, with clear signatures accessible via quantum state tomography and linear response. In this manner, we predict new phases that are not signaled by Liouvillian gap closing, thereby generalizing the conventional criteria for diagnosing phase transitions. Our findings position phase-space flow topology as a powerful tool to identify and control robust quantum phases, enabling advances in error correction and sensing.

Title: Automated discovery of heralded ballistic graph state generators for fusion-based photonic quantum computation
Authors: Gavin S. Hartnett, Dave Kielpinski, Smarak Maity, Pranav S. Mundada, Yuval Baum, Michael R. Hush
Abstract: Designing photonic circuits that prepare graph states with high fidelity and success probability is a central challenge in linear optical quantum computing. Existing approaches rely on hand-crafted designs or fusion-based assemblies. In the absence of multiplexing/boosting, both post-selected ballistic circuits and sequential fusion builds exhibit exponentially decreasing single-shot yields, motivating automated discovery of higher-success circuits. We present a general-purpose optimization framework for automated photonic circuit discovery using a novel polynomial-based simulation approach, enabling efficient strong simulation and gradient-based optimization. Our framework employs a two-pass optimization procedure: the first pass identifies a unitary transformation that prepares the desired state with perfect fidelity and maximal success probability, while the second pass implements a novel sparsification algorithm that reduces this solution to a compact photonic circuit with minimal beamsplitter count while preserving performance. This sparsification procedure often reveals underlying mathematical structure, producing highly simplified circuits with rational reflection coefficients. We demonstrate our approach by discovering optimized circuits for $3$-, $4$-, and $5$-qubit graph states across multiple equivalence classes. For 4-qubit states, our circuits achieve success probabilities of $2.053 \times 10^{-3}$ to $7.813 \times 10^{-3}$, outperforming the fusion baseline by up to $4.7 \times$. For 5-qubit states, we achieve $5.926 \times 10^{-5}$ to $1.157 \times 10^{-3}$, demonstrating up to $7.5 \times$ improvement. These results include the first known state preparation circuits for certain 5-qubit graph states.

Title: Emergent statistical mechanics in holographic random tensor networks
Authors: Shozab Qasim, Jens Eisert, Alexander Jahn
Abstract: Recent years have enjoyed substantial progress in capturing properties of complex quantum systems by means of random tensor networks (RTNs), which form ensembles of quantum states that depend only on the tensor network geometry and bond dimensions. Of particular interest are RTNs on hyperbolic geometries, with local tensors typically chosen from the unitary Haar measure, that model critical boundary states of holographic bulk-boundary dualities. In this work, we elevate static pictures of ensemble averages to a dynamical one, to show that RTN states exhibit equilibration of time-averaged operator expectation values under a highly generic class of Hamiltonians with non-degenerate spectra. We prove that RTN states generally equilibrate at large bond dimension and also in the scaling limit for three classes of geometries: Those of matrix product states, regular hyperbolic tilings, and single "black hole" tensors. Furthermore, we prove a hierarchy of equilibration between finite-dimensional instances of these classes for bulk and boundary states with small entanglement. This suggests an equivalent hierarchy between corresponding many-body phases, and reproduces a holographic degree-of-freedom counting for the effective dimension of each system. These results demonstrate that RTN techniques can probe aspects of late-time dynamics of quantum many-body phases and suggest a new approach to describing aspects of holographic dualities using techniques from statistical mechanics.

Title: Optimal Hamiltonian for a quantum state with finite entropy
Authors: M.E.Shirokov
Abstract: We consider the following task: how for a given quantum state $\rho$ to find a grounded Hamiltonian $H$ such that $\mathrm{Tr}H\rho\leq E_0<+\infty$ in such a way that the von Neumann entropy of the Gibbs state $\gamma_H(E)$ corresponding to a given energy $E>0$ be as small as possible. We show that for any mixed state $\rho$ with finite entropy and any $E>0$ there is a unique solution $H(\rho,E_0,E)$ of the above problem which we call optimal Hamiltonian for this state. Explicit expressions for $H(\rho,E_0,E)$ and $S(\gamma_H(E))$ with $H=H(\rho,E_0,E)$ are obtained. Several examples are considered. A brief overview of possible applications is given (with the intention to give a detailed description in a separate article).

Title: Dagger-Drazin Inverses
Authors: Robin Cockett (University of Calgary), Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay (Macquarie University), Priyaa Varshinee Srinivasan (Tallinn University of Technology)
Abstract: Drazin inverses are a special kind of generalized inverses that can be defined for endomorphisms in any category. A natural question to ask is whether one can somehow extend the notion of Drazin inverse to arbitrary maps - not simply endomorphisms. It turns out that this is possible and, indeed, natural to do so for dagger categories. This paper, thus, introduces the notion of a dagger-Drazin inverse, which is a new kind of generalized inverse appropriate for arbitrary maps in a dagger category. This inverse is closely related to the Drazin inverse, for having dagger-Drazin inverses is equivalent to asking that positive maps have Drazin inverses. Moreover, dagger-Drazin inverses are also closely related to Moore-Penrose inverses as we observe that a map has a Moore-Penrose inverse if and only if it is a Drazin inverse. Furthermore, we explain how Drazin inverses of opposing pairs correspond precisely to dagger-Drazin inverses in cofree dagger categories. We also give examples of dagger-Drazin inverses for matrices over (involutive) fields, bounded linear operators, and partial injections.

Title: On Traces in Categories of Contractions
Authors: Aaron David Fairbanks (Dalhousie University), Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University)
Abstract: Traced monoidal categories are used to model processes that can feed their outputs back to their own inputs, abstracting iteration. The category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces with the direct sum tensor is not traced. But surprisingly, in 2014, Bartha showed that the monoidal subcategory of isometries is traced. The same holds for coisometries, unitary maps, and contractions. This suggests the possibility of feeding outputs of quantum processes back to their own inputs, analogous to iteration. In this paper, we show that Bartha's result is not specifically tied to Hilbert spaces, but works in any dagger additive category with Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses (a natural dagger-categorical generalization of inverses).

Title: A Complete and Natural Rule Set for Multi-Qutrit Clifford Circuits
Authors: Sarah Meng Li (University of Amsterdam, University of Waterloo), Michele Mosca (University of Waterloo), Neil J. Ross (Dalhousie University), John van de Wetering (University of Amsterdam), Yuming Zhao (University of Copenhagen, University of Waterloo)
Abstract: We present a complete set of rewrite rules for n-qutrit Clifford circuits where n is any non-negative integer. This is the first completeness result for any fragment of quantum circuits in odd prime dimensions. We first generalize Selinger's normal form for n-qubit Clifford circuits to the qutrit setting. Then, we present a rewrite system by which any Clifford circuit can be reduced to this normal form. We then simplify the rewrite rules in this procedure to a small natural set of rules, giving a clean presentation of the group of qutrit Clifford unitaries in terms of generators and relations.

Title: Between Myth and History: von Neumann on Consciousness in Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Federico Laudisa
Abstract: The von Neumann attitude on such a deep interpretational question as the role of a human observer in order for the quantum description of measurement to be consistent has been long misrepresented. The large majority of the subsequent literature ascribed to von Neumann a radical view, according to which not only the collapse was in itself a truly physical process, but also the only way to accomodate it within a quantum description of a typical measurement was the introduction of human consciousness as a kind of 'causal' factor. Inspired by the work of reconstruction pursued by the phenomenological reading of the London-Bauer approach, started by Steven French more than twenty years ago, the account I propose substantiates a significantly more cautious attitude by von Neumann: the time seems then ripe to tell a more balanced story on the relation between the notion of consciousness and the foundations of quantum mechanics in the work of the first scientist - Janos von Neumann - who explicitly and rigorously addressed the implication of a really universal formulation of quantum physics.

Title: Entanglement entropy as a probe of topological phase transitions
Authors: Manish Kumar, Bharadwaj Vedula, Suhas Gangadharaiah, Auditya Sharma
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet its role in identifying topological transitions in disordered systems remains underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase -- a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter.

Title: Clustering of quantum correlations at low temperature
Authors: Arka Adhikari, Joscha Henheik, Marius Lemm, Tom Wessel
Abstract: Identifying conditions for the clustering of correlations in thermal states is a central problem in quantum many-body physics. In the low temperature regime, the problem is subtle, because it is intimately connected to phase transitions. Here we investigate quantum lattice Hamiltonians that are sums of on-site terms and relatively bounded perturbations. We present a direct proof that the thermal state satisfies exponential decay of correlations at low temperature, with a correlation length that stays uniformly bounded as $T\to0$. The proof develops a quantum many-body adaptation of a probabilistic swapping trick of the first author and Cao (Ann. Probab. 53, 2025) for lattice gauge theories.

Title: Gaussian filters in quantum lattice systems: Applications to spectral flow, local perturbations, clustering, and the quantum Hall effect
Authors: Sven Bachmann, Zhiqian (Simon)Du, Martin Fraas, Tom Wessel
Abstract: We consider the locality and spectral properties of the smearing \[ \tau_f(A) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty dt \, f(t) \, \tau_t(A) \] when applied to the dynamics $\tau_t$ of quantum spin systems. While recent applications of this map have used superpolynomially but not exponentially decaying functions $f$ to ensure exact spectral properties, we use here Gaussian filters. This improves the locality at the expense of errors on the spectral side. We propose a number of concrete applications, from quasi-adiabatic continuation to correlation decay, and exponential stability away from impurities. Finally, we discuss an application to the quantum Hall effect.

Title: High temporal stability of niobium superconducting resonators by surface passivation with organophosphonate self-assembled monolayers
Authors: Harsh Gupta, Rui Pereira, Leon Koch, Niklas Bruckmoser, Moritz Singer, Benedikt Schoof, Manuel Kompatscher, Stefan Filipp, Marc Tornow
Abstract: One main limiting factor towards achieving high coherence times in superconducting circuits is two level system (TLS) losses. Mitigating such losses requires controlling the formation of native oxides at the metal-air interface. Here, we report the growth of alkyl-phosphonate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Nb thin films following oxide removal. The impact of passivation was evaluated via the performance of coplanar waveguide resonators at 10mK, in terms of quality factor and resonant frequency, over six days of air exposure. Un-passivated resonators exhibited an ~80% increase in loss at single-photon power levels, whereas SAM-passivated resonators maintained excellent temporal stability, attributed to suppressed oxide regrowth. By employing a two-component TLS model, we discern distinct prominent loss channels for each resonator type and quantified the characteristic TLS loss of the SAMs to be ~5x10^-7. We anticipate our passivation methodology to offer a promising route toward industrial-scale qubit fabrication, particularly where long-term device stability is critical.

Title: Universal Entanglement Pattern Formation via a Quantum Quench
Authors: Lihui Pan, Jie Chen, Chun Chen, Xiaoqun Wang
Abstract: We identify a universal short-time structure in symmetry-resolved entanglement dynamics -- the entanglement channel wave (ECW) -- arising from the decomposition of entanglement into conserved-quantum-number sectors that host robust, channel-specific patterns. Focusing on domain-wall melting, we conduct a systematic investigation across three paradigmatic classes of many-body systems: U(1) fermions, U(1) bosons, and SU(2) spinful fermions. For each class, we explore four distinct regimes defined by the presence or absence of interactions and disorder, employing both the Krylov-subspace iterative method and the correlation matrix approach. The ECW emerges universally across all cases, establishing its independence from particle statistics, interaction strength and disorder. In free fermions, the ECW formalism further enables analytical determination of the correlation matrix spectrum. The subsequent melting of the ECW exhibits symmetry- and statistics-dependent signatures, revealing finer structures in the growth of symmetry-resolved entanglement.

Title: Exploring null-entropy events: What do we learn when nothing happens?
Authors: Abhaya S. Hegde, André M. Timpanaro, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish that thermodynamic processes at the microscale can occasionally result in negative entropy production. At the microscale, another distinct possibility becomes more likely: processes where no entropy is produced overall. In this work, we explore the constraints imposed by such null-entropy events on the fluctuations of thermodynamic currents. By incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation theorems. We validate this framework using an example of a qudit SWAP engine.

Title: Microscopic field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect
Authors: Vinay Patil, Archi Banerjee, Ashley M. Cook
Abstract: We construct effective field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect from matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N$ electrons, corresponding to matrix dimension $N$. We first consider a quantum Hall droplet within finite $N$ matrix Chern-Simons theory. Taking into account the differential geometry of the matrix Chern-Simons droplet for a partially-filled fuzzy two-sphere, we first generalize the quantization procedure by replacing the Poisson bracket, a classical Lie derivative, with a quantum counterpart, the Lie derivative for a deformed fuzzy sphere. This yields the topological invariant introduced in earlier works on the quantum skyrmion Hall effect and previously unidentified fusion rules. This is consistent with treatment of a spin $S$ of multiplicity $2S+1$ as a quantum Hall droplet within matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N=2S+1$ spinless electrons and a generalization of a Jain composite particle for a Laughlin state. We then construct $D$-dimensional arrays of coupled small $N$ matrix Chern-Simons droplets as effective field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. In higher-symmetry constructions, this yields what appears to be a D+1 dimensional $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory, but actually contains $\delta$ extra fuzzy dimensions from the finite $N$ MCS theory as well as deformations from $U(N)$ due to partial filling of the fuzzy spheres. In this construction, the Chern-Simons level is $k+1$ for each small $N$ droplet, while the entire array can be interpreted as an unbounded matrix Chern-Simons theory at level $k$. Such constructions at $k=2$ are consistent with earlier results for the multiplicative Chern insulator. We also formulate the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in terms of a Lagrangian for an array of potentially distinct, small $N$ droplets within anisotropic fuzzification. We discuss the relevance of these results to spin lattice models and lattice gauge theories.

Title: A Universal Quantum Certainty Relation for Arbitrary Number of Observables
Authors: Ao-Xiang Liu, Ma-Cheng Yang, Cong-Feng Qiao
Abstract: We derive by lattice theory a universal quantum certainty relation for arbitrary $M$ observables in $N$-dimensional system, which provides a state-independent maximum lower bound on the direct-sum of the probability vectors in terms of majorization relation. While the utmost lower bound coincides with $(1/N,...,1/N)$ for any two observables with orthogonal bases, the majorization certainty relation for $M\geqslant3$ is shown to be nontrivial. The universal majorization bounds for three mutually complementary observables and a more general set of observables in dimension-2 are achieved. It is found that one cannot prepare a quantum state with probability vectors of incompatible observables spreading out arbitrarily. Moreover, we also explore the connections between quantum uncertainty and quantum coherence, and obtain a complementary relation for the quantum coherence as well, which characterizes a trade-off relation of quantum coherence with different bases and is illustrated by an explicit example.

Title: A Fast and Stable Marginal-Likelihood Calibration Method with Application to Quantum Characterization
Authors: Mohammad Motamed, N. Anders Petersson
Abstract: We propose a marginal likelihood strategy within the Kennedy-O'Hagan (KOH) Bayesian framework, where a Gaussian process (GP) models the discrepancy between a physical system and its simulator. Our approach introduces a novel marginalized likelihood by integrating out the degenerate eigenspace of the covariance matrix, rather than approximating the original likelihood. Unlike approximation methods that compromise accuracy for computational efficiency, our method defines an exact likelihood -- distinct from the original but preserving all relevant information. This formulation achieves computational efficiency and stability, even for large datasets where the covariance matrix nears degeneracy. Applied to the characterization of a superconducting quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the approach enhances the predictive accuracy of the Lindblad master equations for modeling Ramsey measurement data by effectively quantifying uncertainties consistent with the quantum data.

Title: Deterministic generation of hybrid entangled states using quantum walks
Authors: Jaskaran Singh, Vikash Mittal, Soumyakanti Bose
Abstract: In recent times, hybrid-entanglement (HE) between a qubit and a coherent state has demonstrated superior performance in various quantum information processing tasks, particularly in quantum key distribution. Despite its theoretical advantages, efficient generation of such states in the laboratory has been a challenge. Here, we introduce a deterministic and efficient approach for generating HE states using quantum walks. Our method achieves a remarkable fidelity of $99.9\%$ with just $20$ time steps in a one-dimensional split-step quantum walk. This represents a significant improvement over prior approaches for probabilistic generation of HE states with fidelity as low as $80\%$. Our scheme not only provides a robust solution to the generation of HE states but also highlights a unique advantage of quantum walks, thereby contributing to the advancement of this burgeoning field. Moreover, our scheme is experimentally feasible with the current technology.

Title: Quantum-enhanced Green's function Monte Carlo for excited states of nuclear shell model
Authors: Yongdan Yang, Ruyu Yang, Xiaosi Xu
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) algorithm for estimating the excited states of the nuclear shell model. The conventional GFMC method, widely used to find the ground state of a quantum many-body system, is plagued by the sign problem, which leads to an exponentially increasing variance with the growth of system size and evolution time. This issue is typically mitigated by applying classical constraints but at the cost of introducing bias. Our approach uses quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) on a quantum computer to prepare a quantum trial state, replacing the classical trial state in the GFMC process. We also incorporated a modified classical shadow technique in the implementation of QSD to optimize quantum resource utilization. Besides, we extend our hybrid GFMC algorithm to find the excited states of a given quantum system. Numerical results suggest our method largely enhances accuracy in determining excited state energies, offering an improvement over the conventional method.

Title: Vulnerabilities of quantum key distribution systems in visible range
Authors: Boris Nasedkin, Azat Ismagilov, Vladimir Chistiakov, Andrei Gaidash, Aleksandr Shimko, Alexei D. Kiselev, Anton Tcypkin, Vladimir Egorov, Anton Kozubov
Abstract: In this paper we investigate spectral vulnerabilities in quantum key distribution systems arising from the use of shorter-wavelength radiation in the 400-800 nm range, with particular focus on the induced photorefraction attack (IPA). Crucial elements influenced by IPA include various types of modulators, both phase and intensity modulators. In the following paper, we consider different scenarios and their implications. Through combined theoretical and experimental analysis, we demonstrate that optical components commonly used as countermeasures in the telecom band (1000-2100 nm) exhibit significantly reduced effectiveness at shorter wavelengths. The efficiency of IPA is shown to increase as the wavelength decreases, posing a substantial threat to phase-modulation-based QKD protocols. We analyze the impact of IPA across different QKD architectures and assess the feasibility of potential countermeasures under realistic implementation scenarios. Our results highlight the necessity of broadband security evaluations and wavelength-aware component design in future QKD systems.

Title: Quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the mesoscopic-leads formulation
Authors: Laetitia P. Bettmann, Michael J. Kewming, Gabriel T. Landi, John Goold, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method to sample the distributions of charge, heat, and entropy production in open quantum systems coupled strongly to macroscopic reservoirs, with both temporal and energy resolution and beyond the linear-response regime. Our method exploits the mesoscopic-leads formulation, where macroscopic reservoirs are modeled by a finite collection of modes that are continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium by an appropriate Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. Focussing on non-interacting fermionic systems, we access the time-resolved full counting statistics through a trajectory unraveling of the master equation. We show that the integral fluctuation theorems for the total entropy production, as well as the martingale and uncertainty entropy production, hold. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuations of the dissipated heat in finite-time information erasure. Conceptually, our approach extends the continuous-time trajectory description of quantum stochastic thermodynamics beyond the regime of weak system-environment coupling.

Title: Qudit Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Inequality and Nonlocality from Wigner Negativity
Authors: Uta Isabella Meyer, Ivan Šupić, Damian Markham, Frédéric Grosshans
Abstract: Nonlocality is an essential concept that distinguishes quantum from classical models and has been extensively studied in systems of qubits. For higher-dimensional systems, certain results for their two-level counterpart, like Bell violations with stabilizer states and Clifford operators, do not generalize. On the other hand, similar to continuous variable systems, Wigner negativity is necessary for nonlocality in qudit systems. We propose a new generalization of the CHSH inequality for qudits by inquiring correlations related to the Wigner negativity of stabilizer states under the adjoint action of a generalization of the qubit $\pi/8$-gate. A specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states based on its Wigner negativity. The Bell operator not only serves as a measure for the singlet fraction but also quantifies the volume of Wigner negativity. Additionally, we show how a bipartite entangled qudit state can serve as a witness for contextuality when it exhibits Wigner negativity. Furthermore, we identify rational-phase diagonal unitaries as the key resource that exactly reproduce the CGLMP violation with the maximally entangled state through simple phase-difference alignment.

Title: Photon-instanton scattering in a superconducting circuit: Beyond the very high impedance regime
Authors: Amir Burshtein, David Shuliutsky, Roman Kuzmin, Vladimir E. Manucharyan, Moshe Goldstein
Abstract: Instantons, semi-classical trajectories of quantum tunneling in imaginary time, have long been used to study thermodynamic and transport properties in a myriad of condensed matter and high energy systems. A recent experiment in superconducting circuits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 197701, (2021)] provided first evidence for direct dynamical signatures of instantons (phase slips), manifested by order-unity inelastic decay probabilities for photons with which they interact, motivating the development of a scattering theory of instantons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 137701, (2021)]. While this framework successfully predicted the measured inelastic decay rates of the photons for several experimental devices, it is valid only if the tunneling time of the instantons is much shorter than the relaxation time due to the environment in which they are embedded, and requires a closed analytical expression for the instanton trajectory. Here, we alleviate these restrictions by incorporating numerical methods that eliminate some of the previously applied approximations. Our results improve the agreement with the experimental measurements, also for devices with lower impedances and thus shorter relaxation times, without fitting parameters. This framework should be useful in many other quantum field theoretical contexts.

Title: Emergent unitary designs for encoded qubits from coherent errors and syndrome measurements
Authors: Zihan Cheng, Eric Huang, Vedika Khemani, Michael J. Gullans, Matteo Ippoliti
Abstract: Unitary $k$-designs are distributions of unitary gates that match the Haar distribution up to its $k$-th statistical moment. They are a crucial resource for randomized quantum protocols. However, their implementation on encoded logical qubits is nontrivial due to the need for magic gates, which can require a large resource overhead. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to generate unitary designs for encoded qubits in surface codes by applying local unitary rotations ("coherent errors") on the physical qubits followed by syndrome measurement and error correction. We prove that under some conditions on the coherent errors (notably including all single-qubit unitaries) and on the error correcting code, this process induces a unitary transformation of the logical subspace. We numerically show that the ensemble of logical unitaries (indexed by the random syndrome outcomes) converges to a unitary design in the thermodynamic limit, provided the density or strength of coherent errors is above a finite threshold. This "unitary design" phase transition coincides with the code's coherent error threshold under optimal decoding. Furthermore, we propose a classical algorithm to simulate the protocol based on a "staircase" implementation of the surface code encoder and decoder circuits. This enables a mapping to a 1+1D monitored circuit, where we observe an entanglement phase transition (and thus a classical complexity phase transition of the decoding algorithm) coinciding with the aforementioned unitary design phase transition. Our results provide a practical way to realize unitary designs on encoded qubits, with applications including quantum state tomography and benchmarking in error correcting codes.

Title: A practical guide to feedback control for Pound-Drever-Hall laser linewidth narrowing
Authors: Wance Wang, Sarthak Subhankar, Joseph W. Britton
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique for laser linewidth narrowing is widely used by AMO experimentalists. However, achieving a high-performance PDH locking requires substantial engineering experience, which is scattered across literature and often lacks a cohesive control-theory perspective. Excellent pedagogical papers exist on the theory of the PDH error signal but they rarely cover feedback control. General-purpose control theory literature seldom discuss PDH laser locking specifically. Although excellent PDH review articles provide thorough knowledge and practice on both aspects but they are not reader-friendly. We extend prior works by addressing component choice and loop tuning using modern tools like a vector network analyzer. We organize multifaceted engineering considerations systematically, grounded in feedback control principles. Our target reader is researchers setting up a PDH laser lock for the first time; we eschew advanced topics like minimizing residual amplitude modulation (RAM). Our guidance is illustrated by step-by-step optimization of the lock for a 1650 nm ECDL.

Title: Quantum teleportation of cat states with binary-outcome measurements
Authors: Jingyan Feng, Mohan Zhang, Matteo Fadel, Tim Byrnes
Abstract: We propose a teleportation protocol involving beam splitting operations and binary-outcome measurements, such as parity measurements. These operations have a straightforward implementation using the dispersive regime of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, making our protocol suitable for a broad class of platforms, including trapped ions, circuit quantum electrodynamics and acoustodynamics systems. In these platforms homodyne measurements of the bosonic modes are less natural than dispersive measurements, making standard continuous variable teleportation unsuitable. In our protocol, Alice is in possession of two bosonic modes and Bob a single mode. An entangled mode pair between Alice and Bob is created by performing a beam splitter operation on a cat state. An unknown qubit state encoded by cat states is then teleported from Alice to Bob after a beamsplitting operation, measurement sequence, and a conditional correction. In the case of multiple measurements, near-perfect fidelity can be obtained. We discuss the optimal parameters in order to maximize the fidelity under a variety of scenarios.

Title: Developing a practical model for noise in entangled photon detection
Authors: Taman Truong, Christian Arenz, Joseph M. Lukens
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive model for the effective two-photon density matrix produced by a parametric source of entangled photon pairs under a variety of detector configurations commonly seen in a laboratory setting: two and four photon number-resolving (PNR) and threshold detectors. We derive the probability of obtaining a single coincidence assuming Poisson-distributed photon pairs, non-unit detection efficiency, and dark counts; obtain the effective density matrix; and use this quantity to compute the fidelity of the generated quantum state. The 4 PNR case admits an analytic result valid for any combination of parameters, while all other cases leverage low-efficiency approximations to arrive at closed-form expressions. Interestingly, our model reveals appreciable fidelity improvements from four detectors as opposed to two yet minimal advantages for PNR over threshold detectors in the regimes explored. Overall, our work provides a valuable tool for the quantitative design of two-photon experiments under realistic nonidealities.

Title: Low-temperature Gibbs states with tensor networks
Authors: Denise Cocchiarella, Mari Carmen Bañuls
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (towards lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well-suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical 1D case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a CFT.

Title: Classical post-processing approach for quantum amplitude estimation
Authors: Yongdan Yang, Ruyu Yang
Abstract: We propose an approach for quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) designed to enhance computational efficiency while minimizing the reliance on quantum resources. Our method leverages quantum computers to generate a sequence of signals, from which the quantum amplitude is inferred through classical post-processing techniques. Unlike traditional methods that use quantum phase estimation (QPE), which requires numerous controlled unitary operations and the quantum Fourier transform, our method avoids these complex and resource-demanding steps. By integrating quantum computing with classical post-processing techniques, our method significantly reduces the need for quantum gates and qubits, thus optimizing the utilization of quantum hardware. We present numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of our method and provide a comprehensive analysis of its computational complexity and error. This hybrid strategy not only improves the practicality of QAE but also broadens its applicability in quantum computing.

Title: Optimization of path-integral tensor-multiplication schemes in open quantum systems
Authors: L. M. J. Hall, A. Gisdakis, E. A. Muljarov
Abstract: Path-integral techniques are a powerful tool used in open quantum systems to provide an exact solution for the non-Markovian dynamics. However, the exponential scaling of the tensor size with quantum memory length of these techniques limits the applicability when applied to systems with long memory times. Here we provide a general optimization of tensor multiplication schemes for systems with pair correlations and finite memory times. This optimization effectively reduces the tensor sizes by using a matrix representation of tensors combined with singular value decomposition to filter out negligible contributions. This approach dramatically reduces both computational time and memory usage of the traditional tensor-multiplication schemes. Calculations that would require over 50 million GB of RAM in the original approach are now available on standard computers, allowing access to new regimes and more complex systems. While more memory-efficient representations exist, this approach enables an extrapolation scheme that other techniques do not offer. As a demonstration, we apply it to the Trotter decomposition with linked cluster expansion technique, and use it to investigate a quantum dot-microcavity system at larger coupling strengths than previously achieved. We also apply the optimization in a case where the memory time is very long -- specifically in a system containing two spatially separated quantum dots in a common phonon bath.

Title: Disentangling quantum autoencoder
Authors: Adithya Sireesh, Abdulla Alhajri, M.S. Kim, Tobias Haug
Abstract: Entangled quantum states are highly sensitive to noise, which makes it difficult to transfer them over noisy quantum channels or to store them in quantum memory. Here, we propose the disentangling quantum autoencoder (DQAE) to encode entangled states into single-qubit product states. The DQAE provides an exponential improvement in the number of copies needed to transport entangled states across qubit-loss or leakage channels compared to unencoded states. The DQAE can be trained in an unsupervised manner from entangled quantum data. For general states, we train via variational quantum algorithms based on gradient descent with purity-based cost functions, while stabilizer states can be trained via a Metropolis algorithm. For particular classes of states, the number of training data needed to generalize is surprisingly low: For stabilizer states, DQAE generalizes by learning from a number of training data that scales linearly with the number of qubits, while only $1$ training sample is sufficient for states evolved with the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian. Our work provides practical applications for enhancing near-term quantum computers.

Title: Dependence of Krylov complexity on the initial operator and state
Authors: Sreeram PG, J. Bharathi Kannan, Ranjan Modak, S. Aravinda
Abstract: Krylov complexity, a quantum complexity measure which uniquely characterizes the spread of a quantum state or an operator, has recently been studied in the context of quantum chaos. However, the definitiveness of this measure as a chaos quantifier is in question in light of its strong dependence on the initial condition. This article clarifies the connection between the Krylov complexity dynamics and the initial operator or state. We find that the Krylov complexity depends monotonically on the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the initial condition in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian. We explain the reversal of the complexity saturation levels observed in \href{this https URL}{ Phys.Rev.E.107,024217, 2023} using the initial spread of the operator in the Hamiltonian eigenbasis. IPR dependence is present even in the fully chaotic regime, where popular quantifiers of chaos, such as out-of-time-ordered correlators and entanglement generation, show similar behavior regardless of the initial condition. Krylov complexity averaged over many initial conditions still does not characterize chaos.

Title: Maximal coin-position entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect in discrete-time quantum walks
Authors: Ding Cheng, Yi Li, Hao Zhao, Haijun Kang, Cui Kong, Jiguo Wang, Feng Mei, Chuanjia Shan, Jibing Liu
Abstract: A distinctive feature of non-Hermitian systems is the skin effect, which has attracted widespread attention in recent studies. Quantum walks provide a powerful platform for exploring the underlying mechanisms of the non-Hermitian skin effect. Additionally, the generation of hybrid entanglement in quantum walks is recognized as another crucial property. However, the experimentally exploring the influence of skin effect on the evolution of entanglement dynamical in the non-Hermitian system remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a flexible photonic implementation of discrete-time quantum walks over 20 evolution steps using an optimized time-multiplexed loop configuration. Through optimizing the coin parameter, we achieve maximal coin-position entanglement in 20-steps quantum walks. Moreover, we experimentally measure the polarization-averaged growth rates and the evolution of coin-position entanglement for specific coin and loss parameters. We observe the asymmetric Lyapunov exponent profiles and the suppression of entanglement induced by the skin effect in non-Hermitian systems. Interestingly, this entanglement suppression weakens with increasing coin parameters and enhances with increasing loss parameters and evolution steps. Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum walks as a powerful platform for investigating hybrid entanglement properties and skin effect in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Energy spectrum and quantum phase transition of the coupled single spin and an infinitely coordinated Ising chain
Authors: S.S. Seidov, N.G. Pugach, A.S. Sidorenko
Abstract: We consider a spin model, composed of a single spin, connected to an infinitely coordinated Ising chain. Theoretical models of this type arise in various fields of theoretical physics, such as theory of open systems, quantum control and quantum computations. In the thermodynamic limit of infinite chain, we map the chain Hamiltonian to the Hamiltonian of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glik model and the system as a whole is described by a generalized Rabi Hamiltonian. Next the effective Hamiltonian is obtained using Foulton-Gouterman transformation. In thermodynamic limit we obtain the spectrum of the whole system and study the properties of the ground state quantum phase transition.

Title: Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries
Authors: Zijian Liang, Jens Niklas Eberhardt, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $6 \leq k\leq13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.

Title: Improved belief propagation is sufficient for real-time decoding of quantum memory
Authors: Tristan Müller, Thomas Alexander, Michael E. Beverland, Markus Bühler, Blake R. Johnson, Thilo Maurer, Drew Vandeth
Abstract: We introduce a new heuristic decoder, Relay-BP, targeting real-time quantum circuit decoding for large-scale quantum computers. Relay-BP achieves high accuracy across circuit-noise decoding problems: significantly outperforming BP+OSD+CS-10 for bivariate-bicycle codes and comparable to min-weight-matching for surface codes. As a lightweight message-passing decoder, Relay-BP is inherently parallel, enabling rapid low-footprint decoding with FPGA or ASIC real-time implementations, similar to standard BP. A core aspect of our decoder is its enhancement of the standard BP algorithm by incorporating disordered memory strengths. This dampens oscillations and breaks symmetries that trap traditional BP algorithms. By dynamically adjusting memory strengths in a relay approach, Relay-BP can consecutively encounter multiple valid corrections to improve decoding accuracy. We observe that a problem-dependent distribution of memory strengths that includes negative values is indispensable for good performance.

Title: Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
Authors: Baptiste Claudon, Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pierre Monmarché
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.

Title: STABSim: A Parallelized Clifford Simulator with Features Beyond Direct Simulation
Authors: Sean Garner, Chenxu Liu, Meng Wang, Samuel Stein, Ang Li
Abstract: The quantum stabilizer formalism became foundational for understanding error correction soon after the realization of the first useful quantum error correction codes. Stabilizers provide a way to describe sets of quantum states which are valid codewords within a quantum error correction (QEC) scheme. Existing stabilizer simulators are single threaded applications used to sample larger codes than is possible with other methods. However, there is an outstanding gap in the scaling and accuracy of current simulators for QEC as quantum computing exceeds hundreds of qubits, along with an under-utilization of the capabilities of highly-efficient stabilizer simulation across other quantum domains. In this work, we present the first GPU-accelerated tableau stabilizer simulator to scale better than CPU methods in QEC workloads, by trivializing Clifford gates and exploiting the large parallelism of dedicated GPUs with CUDA warp-level primitives to quickly overcome costly measurement gates. We then implement a new error model that captures non-unitarity in T1/T2 error channels much faster and with exact accuracy for most physical qubits, demonstrate a chemistry use case, and present a new Clifford+T to Pauli-Based Computing (PBC) transpilation optimization through our simulator.

Title: Current-based metrology with two-terminal mesoscopic conductors
Authors: Shishir Khandelwal, Gabriel T. Landi, Géraldine Haack, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: The traditional approach to quantum parameter estimation focuses on the quantum state, deriving fundamental bounds on precision through the quantum Fisher information. In most experimental settings, however, performing arbitrary quantum measurements is highly unfeasible. In open quantum systems, an alternative approach to metrology involves the measurement of stochastic currents flowing from the system to its environment. However, the present understanding of current-based metrology is mostly limited to Markovian master equations. Considering a parameter estimation problem in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor, we identify the key elements that determine estimation precision within the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. Crucially, this approach allows us to address arbitrary coupling and temperature regimes. Furthermore, we obtain analytical results for the precision in linear-response and zero-temperature regimes. For the specific parameter estimation task that we consider, we demonstrate that the boxcar transmission function is optimal for current-based metrology in all parameter regimes.

Title: High-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation using phase-matched spectral islands in a zero-added-loss multiplexing architecture
Authors: Jeffrey H. Shapiro, Clark Embleton, Michael G. Raymer, Brian J. Smith
Abstract: While photonic entanglement generation and distribution are well developed, their demonstrated rates are far below what is needed for a quantum internet. The present paper proposes and analyzes a scheme for spectral multiplexing that provides entanglement-distribution rates well in excess of the state of the art. It builds on the idea presented by Chen~\emph{et al}.~[Phys. Rev. Appl. {\bf 19}, 054209 (2023)], who proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) as a means for high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation. Unfortunately, Chen \emph{et al}.'s ZALM requires a large number (800) of spectral channels to achieve its claimed high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic, high-rate entanglement generation. Our modified version of ZALM affords major performance improvements over the original. It draws on Morrison~\emph{et al}.~[APL Photon. {\bf 7}, 066102 (2022)], who domain engineered a $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal to realize a biphoton wave function with 8 discrete and spectrally-factorable frequency bins. Our ZALM SPDCs each have a modest number ($N_I\ll$ 800) of these phase-matched spectral islands each generating two-mode squeezed-vacuum states, permitting our analysis, unlike Chen~\emph{et al.}'s, to account for multipairs of all orders, losses in the partial BSM, and propagation losses en route to the receivers. A major innovation in our proposal is to employ both same-island heralding and cross-island heralding, which allows the entanglement-delivery rate to approximately scale as $N_I^2$ rather than $N_I$ in the weak squeezing regime required for the reception of photon pairs with a high Bell-state fidelity under realistic losses. This heralding scheme uses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels, which may enable near-term implementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based ZALM architectures.

Title: Caustics in a Near-Resonant Quantum Kicked Rotor
Authors: Yi Cao, Shaowen Lan, Bin Sun, Jie Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum kicked rotor in the near-resonant regime and observe some interesting caustic structures in the distribution of wave amplitudes, such as recurring cusps, cusp oscillations, and even reticular cusps for high-order resonant cases. We derive the path integral expression for the quantum evolution of the wave functions and analytically determine the locations of the caustic singularity and its recurring (or oscillating) period. A scaling power law with an Arnold index of $1/4$, which relates the wave amplitude enhancement to the kicking strength and the resonant detuning parameter, has been derived and verified. We also discuss the classical-quantum correspondence of the caustic singularity and find that chaos can disrupt the phase matching, leading to the destruction of the caustic structure. Finally, possible experimental observations and some implications of these findings are discussed.

Title: Almost fault-tolerant quantum machine learning with drastic overhead reduction
Authors: Haiyue Kang, Younghun Kim, Eromanga Adermann, Martin Sevior, Muhammad Usman
Abstract: Errors in the current generation of quantum processors pose a significant challenge towards practical-scale implementations of quantum machine learning (QML) as they lead to trainability issues arising from noise-induced barren plateaus, as well as performance degradations due to the noise accumulation in deep circuits even when QML models are free from barren plateaus. Quantum error correction (QEC) protocols are being developed to overcome hardware noise, but their extremely high spacetime overheads, mainly due to magic state distillation, make them infeasible for near-term practical implementation. This work proposes the idea of partial quantum error correction (QEC) for quantum machine learning (QML) models and identifies a sweet spot where distillations are omitted to significantly reduce overhead. By assuming error-corrected two-qubit CNOTs (Clifford operations), we demonstrate that the QML models remain trainable even when single-qubit gates are subjected to $\approx0.2\%$ depolarizing noise, corresponding to a gate error rate of $\approx0.13\%$ under randomized benchmarking. Further analysis based on various noise models, such as phase-damping and thermal-dissipation channels at low temperature, indicates that the QML models are trainable independent of the mean angle of over-rotation, or can even be improved by thermal damping that purifies a quantum state away from depolarizations. While it may take several years to build quantum processors capable of fully fault-tolerant QML, our work proposes a resource-efficient solution for trainable and high-accuracy QML implementations in noisy environments.

Title: Efficient LCU block encodings through Dicke states preparation
Authors: Filippo Della Chiara, Martina Nibbi, Yizhi Shen, Roel Van Beeumen
Abstract: With the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) emerging as a unifying framework for diverse quantum speedups, the efficient construction of block encodings -- their fundamental input model -- has become increasingly crucial. However, devising explicit block encoding circuits remains a significant challenge. A widely adopted strategy is the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) method. While general, its practical utility is often limited by substantial gate overhead. To address this, we introduce the Fast One-Qubit-Controlled Select LCU (FOQCS-LCU), a compact LCU formulation that requires only a linear number of ancilla qubits and is explicitly decomposed into one- and two-qubit gates. By exploiting the underlying Hamiltonian structure, we design a parametrized family of efficient Dicke state preparation routines, enabling systematic realization of the state preparation oracle at substantially reduced gate cost. The check matrix formalism further yields a constant-depth SELECT oracle, implemented as two fully parallelizable layers of singly controlled Pauli gates. We construct explicit block encoding circuits for representative spin models such as the Heisenberg and spin glass Hamiltonians and provide detailed, non-asymptotic gate counts. Our numerical benchmarks confirm the efficiency of the FOQCS-LCU approach, illustrating over an order-of-magnitude reduction in CNOT count compared to conventional LCU. This framework opens a pathway toward practical, low-depth block encodings for a broad class of structured matrices beyond those considered here.

Title: $Λ$-Type Giant Atom Mediated Controllable Single-Photon Transport in a One-Dimensional Chiral Waveguide
Authors: Yimei Wang, Jing Li, Lan Zhou, Jing Lu
Abstract: We investigate the single-photon scattering spectrum of a driven $\Lambda$-type giant atom system chirally coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide. By employing a real-space scattering approach, we obtain analytical solutions for the scattering amplitudes that remain valid in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. We observe that an external driving field induces a splitting of the transmission spectrum's dip into double dips, with the distance between the two dips increasing as the strength of the driving field increases. The chiral nature of the coupling allows for controlled switching between complete transmission and perfect reflection of incident photons. In the Markovian limit, we predict robust perfect transmission at specific phase values, independent of the driving field this http URL, in the non-Markovian regime, as the size of the giant atom increases, the oscillatory behavior of the scattering spectrum becomes more pronounced. Adjusting the giant atom size enables control over the number of decoupling points as well as the number of complete reflection points.

Title: Hyperbolic Spin Liquids
Authors: Patrick M. Lenggenhager, Santanu Dey, Tomáš Bzdušek, Joseph Maciejko
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices present a unique opportunity to venture beyond the conventional paradigm of crystalline many-body physics and explore correlated phenomena in negatively curved space. As a theoretical benchmark for such investigations, we extend Kitaev's spin-1/2 honeycomb model to hyperbolic lattices and exploit their non-Euclidean space-group symmetries to solve the model exactly. We elucidate the ground-state phase diagram on the $\{8,3\}$ lattice and find a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with Abelian anyons, a gapped chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and chiral edge states, and a Majorana metal whose finite low-energy density of states is dominated by non-Abelian Bloch states.

Title: Topological resilience of optical skyrmions in local decoherence
Authors: Li-Wen Wang, Sheng Liu, Cheng-Jie Zhang, Geng Chen, Yong-Sheng Zhang, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo
Abstract: The topologically protected configuration embedded in skyrmions has prompted some investigations into their fundamental properties and versatile applications, sparking interest and guiding ongoing development. The topological protection associated with skyrmions was initially observed in systems with interactions. It is widely believed that skyrmions are stable yet relevant confirmation and empirical research remain limited. A pertinent question is whether skyrmion configurations formed by a single classical beam with two coupled degrees of freedom also exhibit topological stability. In this study, we affirm this hypothesis by investigating the effects of local decoherence. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the topological resilience of skyrmions and the occurrence of transition points of skyrmion numbers in local decoherence across three typical decoherence channels. On the other hand, we show that these qualities are independent of the initial state. From the numerical results, we find that inhomogeneous but continuous decoherence channels also have the same behaviors and maintain topological stability of skyrmions as homogeneous decoherence channels do. These properties of skyrmions contribute to further applications in various areas, including communication and imaging.

Title: Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states
Authors: Liang Mao, Fan Yang
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.

Title: Adiabatic charge transport in extended SSH models
Authors: Dharana Joshi, Tanay Nag
Abstract: We explore the topological properties of extended SSH models, considering four sub-lattices in a unit cell and second-nearest-neighbor intercell hopping for SSH4 and SSH long-range (SSHLR) models, respectively. The additional tuning parameters cause the SSH4 (SSHLR) model to host chiral symmetry protected two (two and four) zero-energy modes producing a richer phase diagram that we characterize by momentum space, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space winding numbers. We introduce time to study charge transport in the periodically driven SSH4 and SSHLR models under the adiabatic limit. We remarkably find that the whole parameter space turned topological for a certain choice of the remaining parameters leading to always finite quantized value of pumped charge at the end of a complete cycle. Considering time as another variable, we characterize these new phases of the driven models by momentum space Chern number, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space Bott index. We also investigate the time evolution of pumped charge for these models and connect it with the intriguing windings of the mid-gap energy levels with time. Interestingly, the maximum value of Chern number or Bott index for the driven models is more than that of the winding number associated with the static model indicating the fact that there exist more zero-energy modes during the full course of a driving cycle compared to the underlying static models. We further extend our study to the quantum metric where the fluctuations in the above quantity can identify the presence of a topological phase boundary.

Title: Heatpipe-cooled in-vacuum electromagnet for quantum science experiment
Authors: Kenneth Nakasone, Paola Luna, Andrei Zhukov, Matthew Tao, Garrett Louie, Cristian D. Panda
Abstract: Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.

Title: Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures
Authors: Xiao Chai, Eber Nolasco-Martinez, Xuanwei Liang, Jeremy L. Tanlimco, E. Quinn Simmons, Eric Zhu, Roshan Sajjad, Hector Mas, S. Nicole Halawani, Alec Cao, David M. Weld
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, noise in the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate an intrinsically noise-tolerant Floquet-engineered platform for continuously trapped atom interferometry. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet band synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.

Title: Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions in Large $N$ Matrix Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Minjae Cho
Abstract: It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence, uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.

Title: Quantum spacetime from constraints: wave equations and fields
Authors: Tommaso Favalli
Abstract: In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schrödinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.

Abstract: We apply the Renormalization Group Procedure for Effective Particles (RGPEP) to the front form Yukawa Hamiltonian, yielding a renormalized (effective) Hamiltonian, accurate up to second order in the coupling strength. Subsequently, we examine the spectrum and parton distribution functions produced by the renormalized Hamiltonian, and show that the addition of counterterms leads to finite results. Resource estimates for quantum simulation are calculated for a single `Ladder Operator Block Encoding' (LOBE), and show that the cost to block encode the renormalized Hamiltonian is comparable to block encoding the bare Hamiltonian.
