Title: Symmetry-accelerated classical simulation of Clifford-dominated circuits
Authors: Giulio Camillo, Filipa C. R. Peres, Markus Heinrich, Juani Bermejo-Vega
Abstract: Classical simulation of quantum circuits plays a crucial role in validating quantum hardware and delineating the boundaries of quantum advantage. Among the most effective simulation techniques are those based on the stabilizer extent, which quantifies the overhead of representing non-Clifford operations as linear combinations of Clifford unitaries. However, finding optimal decompositions rapidly becomes intractable as it constitutes a superexponentially large optimization problem. In this work, we exploit symmetries in the computation of the stabilizer extent, proving that for real, diagonal, and real-diagonal unitaries, the optimization can be restricted to the corresponding subgroups of the Clifford group without loss of optimality. This ``strong symmetry reduction'' drastically reduces computational cost, enabling optimal decompositions of unitaries on up to seven qubits using a standard laptop--far beyond previous two-qubit limits. Additionally, we employ a ``weak symmetry reduction'' method that leverages additional invariances to shrink the search space further. Applying these results, we demonstrate exponential runtime improvements in classical simulations of quantum Fourier transform circuits and measurement-based quantum computations on the Union Jack lattice, as well as new insights into the non-stabilizer properties of multi-controlled-phase gates and unitaries generating hypergraph states. Our findings establish symmetry exploitation as a powerful route to scale classical simulation techniques and deepen the resource-theoretic understanding of quantum advantage.

Title: Noise-Assisted Feedback Control of Open Quantum Systems for Ground State Properties
Authors: Kasturi Ranjan Swain, Rajesh K. Malla, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: Intrinsic noise in pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices poses a major challenge to the reliable realization of unitary dynamics in quantum algorithms and simulations. To address this, we present a method for simulating open quantum system dynamics on a quantum computer, including negative dissipation rates in the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation. Our approach lies beyond the standard Markovian approximation, enabling the controlled study of non-Markovian processes within a quantum simulation framework. Using this method, we develop a quantum algorithm for calculating ground-state properties that exploits feedback-controlled, noise-assisted dynamics. In this scheme, Lyapunov-based feedback steers the system toward a target virtual state under engineered noise conditions. This framework offers a promising strategy for harnessing current quantum hardware and advancing robust control protocols based on open system dynamics.

Title: Noise-tolerant tripartite entanglement and quantum coherence via saturation effects
Authors: P. Djorwé, J.-X. Peng, S. Adbel-Khalek, A.-H. Abdel-Aty
Abstract: Engineering quantum resources that survive against environmental temperature is of great interest for modern quantum technologies. However, it is a tricky task to synthetize such quantum states. Here, we propose a scheme to generate highly resilient tripartite entanglement and quantum coherence against thermal fluctuations. Our benchmark model consists of a mechanical resonator driven by two electromagnetic fields, which are optically coupled. A modulated photon hopping $J$ captures the optical coupling, and each optical cavity hosts saturable gain or loss. When the saturable gain/loss are off, we observe a slightly enhancement of both tripartite entanglement and quantum coherence for an appropriate tuning of the phase modulation. When the saturation effects are turned on, we observe a significant enhancement of the tripartite entanglement, up to one order of magnitude, together with a moderate improvement of the quantum coherence. More interestingly, our results show that the threshold thermal phonon mumber for preserving tripartite entanglement in our proposal has been postponed up to two order of magnitude stronger than when the saturation effects are not accounted. The inclusion of saturable gain/loss in our proposal induces noise-tolerant quantum resources, and may lead to room temperature quantum applications such as quantum information processing, and quantum computional tasks. Our findings are quite general, and suggest saturation nonlinear effects as a tool for engineering thermal-immune quantum correlations.

Title: High-Fidelity Scalable Quantum State Preparation via the Fusion Method
Authors: Matthew Patkowski, Onat Ayyildiz, Matjaž Kebrič, Katharine L. C. Hunt, Dean Lee
Abstract: Robust and efficient eigenstate preparation is a central challenge in quantum simulation. The Rodeo Algorithm (RA) offers exponential convergence to a target eigenstate but suffers from poor performance when the initial state has low overlap with the desired eigenstate, hindering the applicability of the original algorithm to larger systems. In this work, we introduce a fusion method that preconditions the RA state by an adiabatic ramp to overcome this limitation. By incrementally building up large systems from exactly solvable subsystems and using adiabatic preconditioning to enhance intermediate state overlaps, we ensure that the RA retains its exponential convergence even in large-scale systems. We demonstrate this hybrid approach using numerical simulations of the spin- 1/2 XX model and find that the Rodeo Algorithm exhibits robust exponential convergence across system sizes. We benchmark against using only an adiabatic ramp as well as using the unmodified RA, finding that for state preparation precision at the level of $10^{-3}$ infidelity or better there a decisive computational cost advantage to the fusion method. These results together demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the fusion method for practical quantum simulations.

Title: Colloquium: Quantum optics of intense light--matter interaction
Authors: P. Stammer, J. Rivera-Dean, P. Tzallas, M.F. Ciappina, M. Lewenstein
Abstract: Intense light-matter interaction largely relies on the use of high-power light sources, creating fields comparable to, or even stronger than, the field keeping the electrons bound in atoms. Under such conditions, the interaction induces highly nonlinear processes such as high harmonic generation, in which the low-frequency photons of a driving laser field are upconverted into higher-frequency photons. These processes have enabled numerous groundbreaking advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and they form the foundation of attosecond science. Until recently, however, such processes were typically described using semi-classical approximations, since the quantum properties of the light field were not required to explain the observables. This has changed in the recent past. Ongoing theoretical and experimental advances show that fully quantized descriptions of intense light-matter interactions, which explicitly incorporate the quantum nature of the light field, open new avenues for both fundamental research and technological applications at the fully quantized level. These advances emerge from the convergence of quantum optics with strong-field physics and ultrafast science. Together, they have given rise to the field of quantum optics and quantum electrodynamics of strong-field processes.

Title: Simulating high-accuracy nuclear motion Hamiltonians in discrete variable representation using Walsh-Hadamard QROM with fault-tolerant quantum computers
Authors: Michał Szczepanik, Ákos Nagy, Emil Żak
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating rovibrational Hamiltonians on fault-tolerant quantum computers. The method integrates exact curvilinear kinetic energy operators and general-form potential energy surfaces expressed in a hybrid finite-basis/discrete-variable representation. The Hamiltonian is encoded as a unitary quantum circuit using a quantum read-only memory construction based on the Walsh--Hadamard transform, enabling high-accuracy quantum phase estimation of rovibrational energy levels. Our technique provides asymptotic reductions in both logical-qubit count and T-gate complexity that are exponential in the number of atoms and at least polynomial in the total Hilbert-space size, relative to existing block-encoding techniques based on linear combinations of unitaries. Compared with classical variational methods, it offers exponential memory savings and polynomial reductions in time complexity. The quantum volume required for computing the rovibrational spectrum of water can be reduced by up to $10^{5}$ times compared with other quantum methods, increasing to at least $10^{6}$ for a 30-dimensional (12-atom) model system. For this case with a six-body coupled potential, estimating spectroscopic-accuracy energy levels would require about three months on a $1~\mathrm{MHz}$ fault-tolerant quantum processor with fewer than 300 logical qubits, versus over 30,000 years on the fastest current classical supercomputer. These estimates are approximate and subject to technological uncertainties, and realizing the asymptotic advantage will require substantial quantum resources and continued algorithmic progress.

Title: Practical Noise Mitigation for Quantum Annealing via Dynamical Decoupling -- Towards Industry-Relevant Optimization using Trapped Ions
Authors: Sebastian Nagies, Chiara Capecci, Marcel Seelbach Benkner, Javed Akram, Sebastian Rubbert, Dimitrios Bantounas, Michael Moeller, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems. While it offers a promising path towards a practical application of quantum hardware, its performance in real-world devices is severely limited by environmental noise that can degrade solution quality. We investigate the suppression of local field noise in quantum annealing protocols through the periodic application of dynamical decoupling pulses implementing global spin flips. As test problems, we construct minimal Multiple Object Tracking QUBO instances requiring only five and nine qubits, as well as cutting stock instances of five and six qubits. To further place our results in a practical context, we consider a trapped-ion platform based on magnetic gradient-induced coupling as a reference architecture, using it to define experimentally realistic noise and coupling parameters. We show that external magnetic field fluctuations, typical in such setups, significantly degrade annealing fidelity, while moderate dynamical decoupling pulse rates, which are achievable in current experiments, restore performance to near-ideal levels. Our analytical and numerical results reveal a universal scaling behavior, with fidelity determined by a generalized parameter combining noise amplitude and dynamical decoupling pulse interval. While our analysis is grounded in the trapped-ion platform, the proposed noise mitigation strategy and resulting performance improvements are applicable to a broad range of quantum annealing implementations and establish a practical and scalable route for error mitigation in near-term devices.

Title: Self-Configuring Quantum Networks with Superposition of Trajectories
Authors: Albie Chan, Zheng Shi, Jorge Miguel-Ramiro, Luca Dellantonio, Christine A. Muschik, Wolfgang Dür
Abstract: Quantum networks are a backbone of future quantum technologies thanks to their role in communication and scalable quantum computing. However, their performance is challenged by noise and decoherence. We propose a self-configuring approach that integrates superposed quantum paths with variational quantum optimization techniques. This allows networks to dynamically optimize the superposition of noisy paths across multiple nodes to establish high-fidelity connections between different parties. Our framework acts as a black box, capable of adapting to unknown noise without requiring characterization or benchmarking of the corresponding quantum channels. We also discuss the role of vacuum coherence, a quantum effect central to path superposition that impacts protocol performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach remains beneficial even in the presence of imperfections in the generation of path superposition.

Title: Generalised Pinching Inequality
Authors: Andreas Winter
Abstract: Hayashi's Pinching Inequality, which establishes a matrix inequality between a semidefinite matrix and a multiple of its "pinched" version via a projective measurement, has found many applications in quantum information theory and beyond. Here, we show a very simple proof of it, which lends itself immediately to natural generalisations where the different projections of the measurement have different weights, and where the matrix inequality can be reversed. As an application we show how the generalised pinching inequality in the case of binary measurements gives rise to a novel gentle measurement lemma, where matrix ordering replaces approximation in trace norm.

Title: Variational Quantum Algorithm for Unitary Dilation
Authors: S. X. Li, Keren Li, J. B. You, Y.-H. Chen, Clemens Gneiting, Franco Nori, X. Q. Shao
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework for efficiently implementing approximate unitary dilations of non-unitary operators with enhanced noise resilience. The method embeds a target non-unitary operator into a subblock of a unitary matrix generated by a parameterized quantum circuit with universal expressivity, while a classical optimizer adjusts circuit parameters under the global unitary constraint. As a representative application, we consider the non-unitary propagator of a Lindbladian superoperator acting on the vectorized density matrix, which is relevant for simulating open quantum systems. We further validate the approach experimentally on superconducting devices in the Quafu quantum cloud computing cluster. Compared with standard dilation protocols, our method significantly reduces quantum resource requirements and improves robustness against device noise, achieving high-fidelity simulation. Its generality also enables compatibility with non-Markovian dynamics and Kraus-operator-based evolutions, providing a practical pathway for the noise-resilient simulation of non-unitary processes on near-term quantum hardware.

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Eigensolver with Real-Space Sampling and Symmetric Subspace Measurements
Authors: Lei Xu, Ling Wang
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver to address the computational challenges of simulating strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, where the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement render classical methods intractable. Our approach combines real-space sampling of tensor-network-bridged quantum circuits with symmetric subspace measurements, effectively constraining the wavefunction within a substaintially reduced Hilbert space for efficient and scalable simulations of versatile target states. The system is partitioned into equal-sized subsystems, where quantum circuits capture local entanglement and tensor networks reconnect them to recover global correlations, thereby overcoming partition-induced limitations. Symmetric subspace measurements exploit point-group symmetries through a many-to-one mapping that aggregates equivalent real-space configurations into a single symmetric state, effectively enhancing real-space bipartition entanglement while elimilating redundant degrees of freedom. The tensor network further extends this connectivity across circuits, restoring global entanglement and correlation, while simultaneously enabling generative sampling for efficient optimization. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to the periodic $J_1\!-\!J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, incorporating translation, reflection, and inversion symmetries. With a small matrix product state bond dimension of up to 6, the method achieves an absolute energy error of $10^{-5}$ for a 64-site periodic chain and a $6\times6$ torus after bond-dimension extrapolation. These results validate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid eigensolver and demonstrate its strong potential for scalable quantum simulations of strongly correlated systems.

Title: Photonic scattering in 2D waveguide QED: Quantum Goos-Hänchen shift
Authors: Yongguan Ke, Zhenzhi Peng, Muhib Ullah, Chaohong Lee
Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to traveling photons in waveguides, known as waveguide quantum electrodynamics (WQED), offer a powerful platform for understanding light-matter interactions and underpinning emergent quantum technologies. While WQED has been extensively studied in one dimension, two-dimensional (2D) WQED remains largely unexplored, where novel photonic scattering phenomena unique to higher dimensions are expected. Here, we present a comprehensive scattering theory for 2D WQED based on the Green function method. We show that the mean displacement between emitted and injected photons serves as a quantum analogue of the Goos-Hänchen shift. When a photon is injected into a single off-centered port, the quantum Goos-Hänchen (QGH) shift can be enhanced in backward scattering under resonant conditions with subradiant states. When a photon is injected into the center port, there is no QGH shift due to the mirror symmetry of structure. However, for multiple-port injection with transverse momentum, the QGH shift is recovered and proportional to the derivative of phase with respect to transverse momentum. Unlike the classical Goos-Hänchen shift, these effects can be flexibly tuned by the injected photon's frequency. Our work provides a general framework for exploring and manipulating photonic scattering in complex WQED networks.

Title: Decoherence of a dissipative Brownian charged magneto-anharmonic oscillator: an information theoretic approach
Authors: Suraka Bhattacharjee, Koushik Mandal, Supurna Sinha
Abstract: We study the decoherence of an anisotropic anharmonic oscillator in a magnetic field, coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators at high and low temperatures. We solve the anharmonic oscillator problem using perturbative techniques and derive the non-Markovian master equation in the weak coupling limit. The anharmonicity parameter {\alpha} enhances decoherence due to the deconfining effect of anharmonicity. The oscillatory nature of the time evolution of heating function indicates information backflow. The von-Neumann entropy is also calculated for the system, which increases with {\alpha}, consistent with the deconfining effect noted in the decoherence analysis. We have also proposed a cold ion experimental set up for testing our theoretical predictions. The study is of relevance to the domain of quantum technology where decoherence significantly affects the performance of a quantum computer.

Title: Universality and Optimal Architectures for Layered Programmable Unitary Decompositions
Authors: Javier Álvarez-Vizoso, David Barral
Abstract: The decomposition of arbitrary unitary transformations into sequences of simpler, physically realizable operations is a foundational problem in quantum information science, quantum control, and linear optics. We establish a 1D Quantum Field Theory model for justifying the universality of a broad class of such factorizations. We consider parametrizations of the form $U = D_1 V_1 D_2 V_2 \cdots V_{M-1}D_M$, where $\{D_j\}$ are programmable diagonal unitary matrices and $\{V_j\}$ are fixed mixing matrices. By leveraging concepts like the anomalies of our effective model, we establish criteria for universality given the set of mixer matrices. This approach yields a rigorous proof grounded on physics for the conditions required for the parametrization to cover the entire group of special unitary matrices. This framework provides a unified method to verify the universality of various proposed architectures and clarifies the nature of the ``generic'' mixers required for such constructions. We also provide a geometry-aware optimization method for finding the parameters of a decomposition.

Title: Krylov Complexity Under Hamiltonian Deformations and Toda Flows
Authors: Kazutaka Takahashi, Pratik Nandy, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a complex system can be efficiently described in Krylov space, the minimal subspace in which the dynamics unfolds. We apply the Krylov subspace method for Hamiltonian deformations, which provides a systematic way of constructing solvable models from known instances. In doing so, we relate the evolution of deformed and undeformed theories and investigate their complexity. For a certain class of deformations, the resulting Krylov subspace is unchanged, and we observe time evolutions with a reorganized basis. The tridiagonal form of the generator in the Krylov space is maintained, and we obtain generalized Toda equations as a function of the deformation parameters. The imaginary-time-like evolutions can be described by real-time unitary ones. As possible applications, we discuss coherent Gibbs states for thermodynamic systems, for which we analyze the survival probability, spread complexity, Krylov entropy, and associated time-averaged quantities. We further discuss the statistical properties of random matrices and supersymmetric systems for quadratic deformations.

Title: Accelerating Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Good qLDPC Codes
Authors: Guo Zhang, Yuanye Zhu, Ying Li
Abstract: We propose a fault-tolerant quantum computation scheme that is broadly applicable to quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. The scheme achieves constant qubit overhead and a time overhead of $O(d^{a+o(1)})$ for any $[[n,k,d]]$ qLDPC code with constant encoding rate and distance $d = \Omega(n^{1/a})$. For good qLDPC codes, the time overhead is minimized and reaches $O(d^{1+o(1)})$. In contrast, code surgery based on gauging measurement and brute-force branching requires a time overhead of $O(dw^{1+o(1)})$, where $d\leq w\leq n$. Thus, our scheme is asymptotically faster for all codes with $a < 2$. This speedup is achieved by developing techniques that enable parallelized code surgery under constant qubit overhead and leverage classical locally testable codes for efficient resource state preparation. These results establish a new paradigm for accelerating fault-tolerant quantum computation on qLDPC codes, while maintaining low overhead and broad applicability.

Title: Sequential Semi-Device-Independent Quantum Randomness Certification
Authors: Carles Roch I Carceller, Hanwool Lee, Jonatan Bohr Brask, Kieran Flatt, Joonwoo Bae
Abstract: Quantum measurements under realistic conditions reveal only partial information about a system. Yet, by performing sequential measurements on the same system, additional information can be accessed. We investigate this problem in the context of semi-device-independent randomness certification using sequential maximum confidence measurements. We develop a general framework and versatile numerical methods to bound the amount of certifiable randomness in such scenarios. We further introduce a technique to compute min-tradeoff functions via semidefinite programming duality, thus making the framework suitable for bounding the certifiable randomness against adaptive attacking strategies through entropy accumulation. Our results establish sufficient criteria showing that maximum confidence measurements enable the distribution and certification of randomness across a sequential measurement chain.

Title: Absence of measurement- and unraveling-induced entanglement transitions in continuously monitored one-dimensional free fermions
Authors: Clemens Niederegger, Tatiana Vovk, Elias Starchl, Lukas M. Sieberer
Abstract: Continuous monitoring of one-dimensional free fermionic systems can generate phenomena reminiscent of quantum criticality, such as logarithmic entanglement growth, algebraic correlations, and emergent conformal invariance, but in a nonequilibrium setting. However, whether these signatures reflect a genuine phase of nonequilibrium quantum matter or persist only over finite length scales is an active area of research. We address this question in a free fermionic chain subject to continuous monitoring of lattice-site occupations. An unraveling phase $\varphi$ interpolates between measurement schemes, corresponding to different stochastic unravelings of the same Lindblad master equation: For $\varphi = 0$, measurements disentangle lattice sites, while for $\varphi = \pi/2$ they act as unitary random noise, yielding volume-law steady-state entanglement. Using replica Keldysh field theory, we obtain a nonlinear sigma model describing the long-wavelength physics. This analysis shows that for $0 \leq \varphi < \pi/2$, entanglement ultimately obeys an area law, but only beyond the exponentially large scale $\ln(l_{\varphi,*}) \sim J/[\gamma \cos(\varphi)]$, where $J$ is the hopping amplitude and $\gamma$ the measurement rate. Resolving $l_{\varphi, *}$ in numerical simulations is difficult for $\gamma/J \to 0$ or $\varphi \to \pi/2$. However, the theory also predicts that critical-like behavior appears below a crossover scale that grows only algebraically in $J/\gamma$, making it numerically accessible. Our simulations confirm these predictions, establishing the absence of measurement- or unraveling-induced entanglement transitions in this model.

Title: Low overhead circuit cutting with operator backpropagation
Authors: Debarthi Pal, Ritajit Majumdar
Abstract: Current quantum computers suffer from noise due to lack of error correction. Several techniques to mitigate the effect of noise have been studied, in particular to extract the expectation value of observables. One such technique, circuit cutting, partitions large circuits into smaller, less noisy subcircuits, but the exponential increase in the number of circuit executions limits its scalability. Another method, operator backpropagation (OBP) reduces circuit depth by classically simulating parts of it, yet often escalates the number of circuit executions by some factor due to additional non-commuting terms in the updated observable. This paper introduces an optimized approach for minimizing noise in quantum circuits using operator backpropagation (OBP) combined with circuit cutting. We demonstrate that the strategic use of OBP with circuit cutting can mitigate the execution overhead. By employing simulated annealing, our proposed method identifies the optimal backpropagation parameter for specific circuits and observables, maximizing resource reduction in cutting. Results show a 3x and 10x decrease in resource requirements for Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Hamiltonian simulation circuits respectively, while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. This approach also yields similar savings for other circuits from the Benchpress database and various observable weights, providing an efficient method to lower circuit cutting overhead without compromising performance.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning methods for Fourier-based distribution estimation with application in option pricing
Authors: Fernando Alonso, Álvaro Leitao, Carlos Vázquez
Abstract: The ongoing progress in quantum technologies has fueled a sustained exploration of their potential applications across various domains. One particularly promising field is quantitative finance, where a central challenge is the pricing of financial derivatives-traditionally addressed through Monte Carlo integration techniques. In this work, we introduce two hybrid classical-quantum methods to address the option pricing problem. These approaches rely on reconstructing Fourier series representations of statistical distributions from the outputs of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models based on Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). We analyze the impact of data size and PQC dimensionality on performance. Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) is employed as a benchmark to quantitatively assess the proposed models in terms of computational cost and accuracy in the extraction of Fourier coefficients. Through the numerical experiments, we show that the proposed methods achieve remarkable accuracy, becoming a competitive quantum alternative for derivatives valuation.

Title: Revealing the quantum nature of memory in non-Markovian dynamics on IBM Quantum
Authors: Charlotte Bäcker, Krishna Palaparthy, Walter T. Strunz
Abstract: We investigate memory effects in non-Markovian dynamics on superconducting quantum processors provided by IBM Quantum. We use a collision-model approach to implement suitable single- and two-qubit dynamics with a gate-based quantum circuit. Coupling the system of interest to an ancilla allows for a characterization of the process with respect to non-Markovian memory effects in general, as well as concerning the quantumness of that memory. We demonstrate that current noisy quantum hardware is capable of verifying quantum memory in single-qubit dynamics. We then discuss why a generalization of this dynamics to the two-qubit case cannot directly be simulated in a way that allows quantum memory to be observed. Nevertheless, we present an alternative toy example that demonstrates how quantum memory of two-qubit dynamics can be witnessed using current noisy quantum computers.

Enriquez, C. Erickson, V. S. Ferreira, M. Flores, L. Flores Burgos, E. Forati, J. Ford
Abstract: Quantum-information-inspired experiments in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy may yield a pathway towards determining molecular structure and properties that are otherwise challenging to learn. We measure out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) [1-4] on two organic molecules suspended in a nematic liquid crystal, and investigate the utility of this data in performing structural learning tasks. We use OTOC measurements to augment molecular dynamics models, and to correct for known approximations in the underlying force fields. We demonstrate the utility of OTOCs in these models by estimating the mean ortho-meta H-H distance of toluene and the mean dihedral angle of 3',5'-dimethylbiphenyl, achieving similar accuracy and precision to independent spectroscopic measurements of both quantities. To ameliorate the apparent exponential classical cost of interpreting the above OTOC data, we simulate the molecular OTOCs on a Willow superconducting quantum processor, using AlphaEvolve-optimized [5] quantum circuits and arbitrary-angle fermionic simulation gates. We implement novel zero-noise extrapolation techniques based on the Pauli pathing model of operator dynamics [6], to repeat the learning experiments with root-mean-square error $0.05$ over all circuits used. Our work highlights a computational protocol to interpret many-body echoes from nuclear magnetic systems using low resource quantum computation.

Title: Quantum charging advantage based on power bounds can be deceptive
Authors: Sreeram PG, J. Bharathi Kannan, M. S. Santhanam
Abstract: We demonstrate that an all-to-all coupled spin-chain model of a quantum battery with 2-local interactions exhibits superextensive charging when analysed using the upper bound derived from the uncertainty principle. Unlike the previously studied models in the literature, the contribution to this apparent quantum advantage arises from both the battery and the charger, and it does not require long-range couplings. However, on closer analysis of the charging using the battery evolution in the energy eigenspace, the advantage vanishes. Moreover, this tighter bound can also fail in certain physical situations. One has to exercise caution and compute the actual power transferred before claiming a quantum advantage.

Title: Zero-field identification and control of hydrogen-related electron-nuclear spin registers in diamond
Authors: Alexander Ungar, Hao Tang, Andrew Stasiuk, Bo Xing, Boning Li, Ju Li, Alexandre Cooper, Paola Cappellaro
Abstract: Spin defects in diamond serve as powerful building blocks for quantum technologies, especially for applications in quantum sensing and quantum networks. Electron-nuclear defects formed in the environment of optically active spins, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, can be harnessed as qubits to construct larger hybrid quantum registers. However, many of these defects have yet to be characterized, limiting their integration into scalable devices. Here, we introduce an approach to identify the hyperfine components and nuclear spin species of spin defects through measurements on a nearby NV center. This approach combines double electron-electron resonance performed at zero field (ZF-DEER) with nuclear-electron-electron triple resonance (NEETR), which we use to characterize two unknown defects at the single-spin level, yielding self-consistent results. These results provide a guide to resolving the defect structures using $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations, leading to the identification of a new hydrogen defect structure and an accurate match to a previously identified nitrogen defect. Building on the NEETR protocol, we then demonstrate initialization, unitary control, and long-lived coherence of the nuclear spin qubit of the hydrogen defect with $T_2 = 1.0(3)\,\mathrm{ms}$. Our characterization and control tools establish a framework to expand the accessible defect landscape for hybrid electron-nuclear registers and enable applications in quantum sensing, networks, and atomic-scale magnetic resonance imaging at room temperature.

Title: Twisted superconducting quantum diodes: Towards anharmonicity and high fidelity
Authors: Han Zhong, Denis Kochan, Igor Zutic, Yingying Wu
Abstract: As quantum technologies advance, a fundamental challenge is mitigating noise and backscattering in superconducting circuits to achieve scalable, high-fidelity operations. Conventional superconducting components lack directionality, causing energy loss and decoherence. Superconducting diodes, that allow dissipationless current in one direction and resistive flow in the other, offer a potential remedy, yet their efficiency and quantum integration remain limited. Here, we realize a quantum diode in twisted NbSe2 bilayers under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A mere 1 degree twist yields an efficiency enhancement over pristine devices, reaching 27.6 percent. Quantum simulations reveal that this intermediate efficiency, well below 100 percent ideal, is both experimentally practical and optimal for preserving qubit anharmonicity and stabilizing two-level systems. These findings show that maximal rectification is not always beneficial for quantum information, establishing a new principle for designing the fundamental properties of twisted superconductors towards low-power, high-fidelity quantum circuits.

Title: Heisenberg-Limited Quantum Eigenvalue Estimation for Non-normal Matrices
Authors: Yukun Zhang, Yusen Wu, Xiao Yuan
Abstract: Estimating the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices is a foundational problem with far-reaching implications, from modeling non-Hermitian quantum systems to analyzing complex fluid dynamics. Yet, this task remains beyond the reach of standard quantum algorithms, which are predominantly tailored for Hermitian matrices. Here we introduce a new class of quantum algorithms that directly address this challenge. The central idea is to construct eigenvalue signals through customized quantum simulation protocols and extract them using advanced classical signal-processing techniques, thereby enabling accurate and efficient eigenvalue estimation for general non-normal matrices. Crucially, when supplied with purified quantum state inputs, our algorithms attain Heisenberg-limited precision--achieving optimal performance. These results extend the powerful guided local Hamiltonian framework into the non-Hermitian regime, significantly broadening the frontier of quantum computational advantage. Our work lays the foundation for a rigorous and scalable quantum computing approach to one of the most demanding problems in linear algebra.

Title: Universal bound on the Lyapunov spectrum of quantum master equations
Authors: Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi, Gen Kimura, Frederik vom Ende, Dariusz Chruściński
Abstract: The spectral properties of positive maps provide pivotal information for understanding the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with their environment. Furthermore, central problems in quantum information such as the characterization of entanglement may be reformulated in terms of spectral properties of positive maps. The present work aims to contribute to a better understanding of the spectrum of positive maps. Specifically, our main result is a new proof of a universal bound on the $d^{2}-1$ generically non vanishing decay rates $\Gamma_{i}$ of time-autonomous quantum master equations on a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space: $$ \Gamma_{\mathrm{max}}\,\leq\,c_{d}\,\sum_{i=1}^{d^{2}-1}\Gamma_{i} \nonumber $$ The prefactor $c_{d}$ , which we explicitly determine, depends only on the dimension $d$ and varies depending on the sub-class of positive maps to which the semigroup solution of the master equation belongs. We provide a brief but self-consistent survey of these concepts. We obtain our main result by resorting to the theory of Lyapunov exponents, a central concept in the study of dynamical systems, control theory, and out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We thus show that progress in understanding positive maps in quantum mechanics may require ideas at the crossroads between different disciplines. For this reason, we adopt a notation and presentation style aimed at reaching readers with diverse backgrounds.

Title: Addressing spins at the clock transitions with a frequency- and bandwidth-tunable superconducting resonator
Authors: Yutian Wen, V. Ranjan, T. Lorriaux, D. Vion, B. Huard, A. Bienfait, E. Flurin, P. Bertet
Abstract: Solid-state spin ensembles addressed via superconducting circuits are promising candidates for quantum memory applications, offering multimodal storage capability and second-long coherence times at their clock transition. Implementing practical memory schemes requires dynamic control over both the resonator frequency and bandwidth. In this letter, we report measurements of a superconducting resonator whose frequency can be tuned by passing a DC current through the high-kinetic-inductance thin film, and whose bandwidth can be tuned by parametric coupling to a low-Q buffer resonator. Using this resonator, we address an ensemble of bismuth donors at their clock transition, measuring a Hahn-echo coherence time of 450 ms. We demonstrate RF driving of the bismuth donor hyperfine transitions, as well as dynamic bandwidth control of the resonator.

Title: Classical theories of gravity produce entanglement
Authors: Joseph Aziz, Richard Howl
Abstract: The unification of gravity and quantum mechanics remains one of the most profound open questions in science. With recent advances in quantum technology, an experimental idea first proposed by Richard Feynman is now regarded as a promising route to testing this unification for the first time. The experiment involves placing a massive object in a quantum superposition of two locations and letting it gravitationally interact with another mass. If the two objects subsequently become entangled, this is considered unambiguous evidence that gravity obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. This conclusion derives from theorems that treat a classical gravitational interaction as a local interaction capable of only transmitting classical, not quantum, information. Here, we extend the description of the gravitational interaction used in these theorems to the full framework of quantum field theory, finding that theories with classical gravity can then transmit quantum information, and thus generate entanglement through physical, local processes. The effect scales differently to that predicted by theories of quantum gravity, providing information on the parameters and form of the experiment required to robustly evidence the quantum nature of gravity.

Title: Entanglement production in the decay of a metastable state
Authors: Sergei Khlebnikov
Abstract: When a metastable state decays into radiation, there must be entanglement between the radiation and the decaying system, as well as between radiation collected at late and early times. We study the interplay between these two types of entanglement in simple Gaussian models. We define, via a windowed Fourier transform, multimode quantum states associated with radiation fragments produced at different times and compute the corresponding entanglement entropy increments. On the basis of these results, we argue that such entropy increments are useful entanglement measures, especially in cases, such as Hawking radiation, where one wishes to separate the radiation into ``old'' and ``new.''

Title: Explicitly Quantum-parallel Computation by Displacements
Authors: Uchenna Chukwu, Mohammad-Ali Miri, Nicholas Chancellor
Abstract: We introduce an encoding of information in the relative displacement or photon number of different optical modes. Since the loss rate to interference is insensitive to squeezing and many non-Gaussian fluctuations, such a space is relatively protected from imperfections. We show that photon subtraction protocols can be used to create high-quality quantum superpositions of squeezed states with much higher fidelity than when the protocol is restricted to producing only cat states (superpositions of coherent states). We also show that the amount of squeezing and anti-squeezing introduced is moderate, and unlikely to dominate the photon number. This parallel processing allows for explicit use of non-Gaussian interference as opposed to the more incidental role played by non-Gaussianity in all-optical coherent Ising machines. A key observation we make is that displacements of optical states provide a convenient degree of freedom to encode information for quantum parallel processing. Furthermore, we discuss important considerations for realizing an optical quantum annealer based on differential photon number encoding. In particular, we discuss the need to perform quantum erasure on loss channels from interference, as well as the ability to correct degrees of freedom not used for the encoding without disrupting the processed quantum information.

Abstract: Abrikosov vortices, where the superconducting gap is completely suppressed in the core, are dissipative, semi-classical entities that impact applications from high-current-density wires to superconducting quantum devices. In contrast, we present evidence that vortices trapped in granular superconducting films can behave as two-level systems, exhibiting microsecond-range quantum coherence and energy relaxation times that reach fractions of a millisecond. These findings support recent theoretical modeling of superconductors with granularity on the scale of the coherence length as tunnel junction networks, resulting in gapped vortices. Using the tools of circuit quantum electrodynamics, we perform coherent manipulation and quantum non-demolition readout of vortex states in granular aluminum microwave resonators, heralding new directions for quantum information processing, materials characterization, and sensing.

Title: Passive quantum error correction of photon loss at breakeven
Authors: Shruti Shirol, Sean van Geldern, Hanzhe Xi, Chen Wang
Abstract: Physical qubits in a quantum computer are often represented by superposition states of single particles or excitations. Decay of the excitation itself is a fundamental error channel that is difficult to overcome via external drive or control techniques. Quantum error correcting codes, which encode information in superpositions involving multiple excitations, provide a path to preserve information beyond the capacity of individual excitations, but typically require exquisite active operations on the system. Here, we demonstrate a steady-state driven dissipative quantum system, composed of a superconducting cavity and a transmon ancilla, that preserves a logical qubit beyond the photon-lifetime limit by about 5% using a binomial encoding. This realization of continuous quantum error correction at the breakeven point highlights the quantitative competitiveness of passive correction strategies while circumventing some demanding hardware requirements of its active counterparts.

Title: Good quantum codes with addressable and parallelizable non-Clifford gates
Authors: Virgile Guemard
Abstract: We revisit a family of good quantum error-correcting codes presented in He $\textit{et al.}$ (2025), and we show that various sets of addressable and transversal non-Clifford multi-control-$Z$ gates can be performed in parallel. The construction relies on the good classical codes of Stichtenoth (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2006), which were previously instantiated in He $\textit{et al.}$ (2025), to yield quantum CSS codes over which addressable logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates can be performed at least one at a time. Here, we show that for any $m$, there exists a family of good quantum error-correcting codes over qudits for which logical $\mathsf{C}^{m}\mathsf{Z}$ gates can address specific logical qudits and be performed in parallel. This leads to a significant advantage in the depth overhead of multi-control-$Z$ circuits.

Title: Atomic-superfluid heat engines controlled by twisted light
Authors: Aritra Ghosh, Nilamoni Daloi, M. Bhattacharya
Abstract: We theoretically propose a quantum heat engine using a setup consisting of a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate placed in a Fabry--Pérot cavity where the optical fields carry orbital angular momentum. We first show that the cavity-enhanced light-atom coupling leads to the emergence of polaritonic modes, whose character can be reversibly switched between photonlike and phononlike by detuning sweeps allowing work extraction governed by distinct reservoirs. We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its ideal-operation value, despite finite-time challenges. Finally, for lower values of the orbital angular momentum, we describe an alternate scheme for operating quantum heat engines based on the adiabatic elimination of a mechanical mode. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as an experimentally-accessible control knob that can reconfigure the performance of such quantum heat engines as desired.

Title: Quantum walks as a tool to design robust quantum batteries: the role of topology and chirality
Authors: Simone Cavazzoni, Giovanni Ragazzi, Paolo Bordone, Matteo G. A. Paris
Abstract: The maximum work that can be extracted from a quantum battery is bounded by the ergotropy of the system, which is determined by the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we employ the formalism of quantum walks to investigate how the topology of the battery and the chirality of the Hamiltonian influence its performance as an energy storage unit. We analyze architectures of battery cells based on ring, complete, and wheel graph structures and analyze their behavior in the presence of noise. Our results show that these structures exhibit distinct ergotropy scaling, with the interplay between chirality and topology providing a tunable mechanism to optimize work extraction and enhance robustness against decoherence. In particular, chirality enhances ergotropy for complete quantum cells, without altering the linear scaling with size, whereas in ring cells, it bridges the performance gap between configurations with odd and even number of units. Additionaly, chirality may be exploited to force degeneracies in the Hamiltonian, a condition that can spare the ergotropy to vanish in the presence of pure dephasing. We conclude that topology and chirality are key resources for improving ergotropy, offering guidelines to optimize quantum energy devices and protocols.

Title: Lieb-Robinson causality and non-Fermi liquids
Authors: Subham Dutta Chowdhury, Sean A. Hartnoll, Aditya Hebbar
Abstract: Quantum mechanical lattice models with local, bounded interactions obey Lieb-Robinson causality. We show that this implies a domain of analyticity of the retarded Green's function $G^R(\omega,{\bf k})$ of local lattice operators as a function of complex frequency $\omega$ and momentum ${\bf k}$, similar to the lightcone analyticity property of relativistic field theories. Low-energy effective descriptions of the dynamics must be consistent with this microscopic analyticity constraint. We consider two canonical low-energy fermionic Green's functions describing non-Fermi liquids, the marginal Fermi liquid and the `Hertz liquid'. The pole in these Green's functions must be outside of the Lieb-Robinson domain of analyticity for all complex momenta captured by the low-energy theory. We show that this constraint upper bounds the magnitude of the dimensionless non-Fermi liquid coupling in certain Hertz liquids. We furthermore obtain, from causality, an upper bound on the magnitude $|G^R(\omega,{\bf k})|$ within the analytic domain. We use this bound to constrain the quasiparticle residue of the non-Fermi liquids.

Title: On the stabilizer complexity of Hawking radiation
Authors: Ritam Basu, Onkar Parrikar, Suprakash Paul, Harshit Rajgadia
Abstract: We study the complexity of Hawking radiation for an evaporating black hole from the perspective of the stabilizer theory of quantum computation. Specifically, we calculate Wigner negativity -- a magic monotone which can be interpreted as a measure of the stabilizer complexity, or equivalently, the complexity of classical simulation -- in various toy models for evaporating black holes. We first calculate the Wigner negativity of Hawking radiation in the PSSY model directly using the gravitational path integral, and show that the negativity is $O(1)$ before the Page transition, but becomes exponentially large past the Page transition. We also derive a universal, information theoretic formula for the negativity which interpolates between the two extremes. We then study the Wigner negativity of radiation in a dynamical model of black hole evaporation. In this case, the negativity shows a sharp spike at early times resulting from the coupling between the black hole and the radiation system, but at late times when the system settles down, we find that the negativity satisfies the same universal formula as in the PSSY model. Finally, we also propose a geometric formula for Wigner negativity in general holographic states using intuition from fixed area states and random tensor networks, and argue that a python's lunch in the entanglement wedge implies a stabilizer complexity which is exponentially large in $\frac{1}{8G_N}$ times the difference between the areas corresponding to the outermost and minimal extremal surfaces.

Title: Broadband Thermal Noise Correlations Induced by Measurement Back-Action
Authors: Jiaxing Ma, Thomas J. Clark, Vincent Dumont, Jack C. Sankey
Abstract: Modern mechanical sensors increasingly measure motion with precision sufficient to resolve the fundamental thermal noise floor over a broad band. Compared to traditional sensors -- achieving this limit only near resonance -- this capability provides massive gains in acquisition rates along with access to otherwise obscured transient signals. However, these stronger measurements of motion are naturally accompanied by increased back-action. Here we show how resolving the broadband thermal noise spectrum reveals back-action-induced correlations in the noise from many mechanical modes, even those well-separated in frequency. As a result, the observed spectra can deviate significantly from predictions of the usual single-mode and (uncorrelated) multimode models over the broad band, notably even at the mechanical resonance peaks. This highlights that these effects must be considered in all systems exhibiting measurement back-action, regardless of whether the resonances are spectrally isolated or the readout noise is high enough that the noise peaks appear consistent with simpler models. Additionally, these correlations advantageously allow the thermal noise spectrum to reach a minimum -- equivalent to that of a single mode -- in a band far from the resonance peak, where the mechanical susceptibility is comparatively stable against frequency noise.

Title: Active tuning of ENZ resonances in meta-antenna through phase modulation of optical pulse
Authors: Elif Ozturk, Hira Asif, Mehmet Gunay, Mehmet Emre Tasgin, Ramazan Sahin
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoantennas offer new avenues to manipulate the propagation of light in materials due to their near field enhancement and ultrafast response time. Here we investigate the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) response in an L-shaped nanoantenna structure under the phenomenon of plasmonic analog of enhancement in the index of refraction. Using a quantum mechanical approach, we analyze the modulation in the response of probe field and emergence of ENZ frequency region both in the linear and nonlinear plasmonic system. We also demonstrate the active tuning of ENZ frequency region in a nanoantenna structure by modulating the phase of control pulse. The analytical and 3D FDTD simulation results show a significant spectral shift in the ENZ modes. Our proposed method offers the possibility to design and control optical tunable ENZ response in plasmonic metasurfaces without the use of ENZ material. Such metasurfaces can be used in on-chip photonic integrated circuits, further localization of incident fields, slow light operations and various quantum technologies.

Title: Ab Initio Free Energy Surfaces for Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer
Authors: Ethan Abraham, Martin Z. Bazant, Troy Van Voorhis
Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as electrochemical interfaces or biomolecular structures, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.

Title: Calculating the Luttinger liquid parameter for an interacting Kitaev chain quantum simulator
Authors: Troy Losey, Jin Zhang, S.-W. Tsai
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a solid-state platform for building quantum simulators using implanted spin centers in solid-state materials. We build upon the proposal for an $S=1$ chain of spin centers coupled through the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and subjected to an external magnetic field as a quantum simulator for critical floating phases. We introduce another magnetic field and map the system to the interacting Kitaev chain. This setup, tunable through the applied fields and the orientation of the spin centers within the crystal, exhibits a variety of rich quantum behavior which notably includes floating phases, a $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking phase, and lines of both Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and Pokrovsky-Talapov transitions. Furthermore, we employ several novel methods to calculate the Luttinger liquid parameter in our model with incommensurate correlations. We find that these methods provide a route to identify BKT transitions with less computational resources than utilizing entanglement entropy and central charge.

Title: A Probabilistic Computing Approach to the Closest Vector Problem for Lattice-Based Factoring
Authors: Max O. Al-Hasso, Marko von der Leyen
Abstract: The closest vector problem (CVP) is a fundamental optimization problem in lattice-based cryptography and its conjectured hardness underpins the security of lattice-based cryptosystems. Furthermore, Schnorr's lattice-based factoring algorithm reduces integer factoring (the foundation of current cryptosystems, including RSA) to the CVP. Recent work has investigated the inclusion of a heuristic CVP approximation `refinement' step in the lattice-based factoring algorithm, using quantum variational algorithms to perform the heuristic optimization. This coincides with the emergence of probabilistic computing as a hardware accelerator for randomized algorithms including tasks in combinatorial optimization. In this work we investigate the application of probabilistic computing to the heuristic optimization task of CVP approximation refinement in lattice-based factoring. We present the design of a probabilistic computing algorithm for this task, a discussion of `prime lattice' parameters, and experimental results showing the efficacy of probabilistic computing for solving the CVP as well as its efficacy as a subroutine for lattice-based factoring. The main results found that (a) this approach is capable of finding the maximal available CVP approximation refinement in time linear in problem size and (b) probabilistic computing used in conjunction with the lattice parameters presented can find the composite prime factors of a semiprime number using up to 100x fewer lattice instances than similar quantum and classical methods.

Title: Dynamic control of dipole decay rate via graphene plexcitons
Authors: Hira Asif, Taner Tarik Aytas, Ramazan Sahin
Abstract: Active control of the radiative properties of quantum emitters through engineered light-matter interactions is a key challenge in nanophotonics and quantum optics. In this work, we demonstrate dynamic modulation of dipole's decay rate by exploiting the tunable plexcitonic modes (graphene plasmons and QD-excitons) in the strong coupling regime. By integrating a quantum dot inside a graphene spherical shell and tuning the local optical response of hybrid modes via voltage-bias, we achieve continuous and reversible control over the decay rate, leading to significant enhancement or suppression of dipole emission from near- to far-infrared regime. Furthermore, the plexcitonic peaks shows much sharper linewidths in contrast to bare graphene plasmons even in the off-resonant coupling which indicates higher sensitivity of the systems at tuned wavelengths. We demonstrate the phenomenon with the numerical solution of 3D Maxwell's equations using MNPBEM tool. Our approach demonstrate a versatile platform for programmable emission control and offer a promising pathway for developing reconfigurable quantum photonic devices, such as tunable single-photon sources and ultrafast optical switches.

Title: Lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network renormalization group with entanglement filtering in two and three dimensions
Authors: Xinliang Lyu, Naoki Kawashima
Abstract: Tensor-network renormalization group (TNRG) is an efficient real-space renormalization group method for studying the criticality in both classical and quantum lattice systems. Exploiting symmetries of a system in a TNRG algorithm can simplify the implementation of the algorithm and can help produce correct tensor RG flows. Although a general framework for considering a global on-site symmetry has been established, it is still unclear how to incorporate a lattice symmetry like rotation or reflection in TNRG. As a first step for lattice symmetries, we propose a method to incorporate the lattice-reflection symmetry in the context of a TNRG with entanglement filtering in both two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). To achieve this, we write down a general definition of lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language. Then, we introduce a transposition trick for exploiting and imposing the lattice-reflection symmetry in two basic TNRG operators: projective truncations and entanglement filtering. Using the transposition trick, the detailed algorithms of the TNRG map in both 2D and 3D are laid out, where the lattice-reflection symmetry is preserved and imposed. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct the linearization of the TNRG maps in a given lattice-reflection sector, with the help of which it becomes possible to extract scaling dimensions in each sector separately. Our work paves the way for understanding the lattice-rotation symmetry in TNRG.

Title: On the maximum purity of absolutely separable bipartite states
Authors: Hoang Phi Dung, Vu The Khoi
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of determining the maximum purity for absolutely separable and absolutely PPT quantum states. From the geometric viewpoint, this problem is equivalent to asking for the exact Euclidean radius of the smallest ball around the maximally mixed state that encompasses the set of all absolutely separable or absolutely PPT states. Our results provide an analytic solution for two qubit states. Based on numerical computation, we propose a conjectured maximum purity for absolutely separable qubit-qudit states and absolutely PPT qutrit-qudit states.

Title: Fock space fragmentation in quenches of disordered interacting fermions
Authors: Ishita Modak, Rajesh Narayanan, Ferdinand Evers, Soumya Bera
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation, as it is currently investigated, primarily originates from specific kinematic constraints or emergent conservation laws in many-body systems with translation invariance. It leads to non-ergodic dynamics and possible breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that also in disordered systems, such as the XXZ model with random on-site fields, fragmentation appears as a natural concept offering fresh perspectives, for example, on many-body delocalization (MBdL). Specifically, we split the Fock-space into subspaces, potential-energy shells, which contain the accessible phase space for the relaxation of a quenched initial state. In this construction, dynamical observables reflect properties of the shell geometry, e.g., the drastic sample-to-sample fluctuations observed in the weak disorder regime, $W<W_c$, represent fluctuations of the mass of the shell. Upon crossing over from weak to strong disorder, $W>W_c$, the potential-energy shell decays into fragments; we argue that, unlike percolation, fragmentation is a strong-coupling scenario with turn-around flow: $W_c(L)$ diverges with increasing system size. We conjecture that the slowing down of the relaxation dynamics reported in traditional MBdL studies is (essentially) a manifestation of Fock-space fragmentation introduced here.

Title: Single-Scale Magnetoelastic Landau Quantization: Thermodynamics, Quantum Oscillations, and Metrology
Authors: Denise Assafrão, Faizuddin Ahmed, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: We develop a unified, single-scale description of thermodynamics and quantum oscillations in electronic systems with a uniform areal density of screw dislocations under a uniform magnetic field. A single tunable gap, $\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ with $\omega_{eff}=\omega_{c}+\omega_{cl}$, organizes all equilibrium observables obtained from a compact harmonic-oscillator partition function: free energy, internal energy, entropy, heat capacity, magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and magnetocaloric responses collapse onto universal hyperbolic kernels in $x=\hbar|\omega_{eff}|/(2k_{B}T)$. We identify a compensated-field regime where the transverse gap closes and the heat capacity reaches an equipartition plateau, providing a sharp signature of magnetoelastic interference. In transport and torque, the same scale rigidly shifts the Hall fan and compresses the $1/B$ period of de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations when expressed in $1/B_{eff}$, enabling a phase-unwarping protocol that metrologizes the dislocation density from a single field sweep. In mesoscopic samples, boundary corrections to the Landau degeneracy generate finite-size calorimetric oscillations that diagnose the effective magnetic length. Moderate disorder and weak interactions preserve the kernel structure while smoothing amplitudes. We outline an experimental roadmap combining on-chip calorimetry, torque magnetometry, and transport, and discuss device-level opportunities in caloritronics and strain engineering, magnetocaloric microcooling, magnetoelastic heat switching, and dilatometric transduction, where the single scale $\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ enables rational design and optimization.

Title: Single Sr Atoms in Optical Tweezer Arrays for Quantum Simulation
Authors: Veronica Giardini, Luca Guariento, Andrea Fantini, Shawn Storm, Massimo Inguscio, Jacopo Catani, Giacomo Cappellini, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani
Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 uK and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(1)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ uK for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.

Title: Indefinite causal order and quantum coordinates
Authors: Anne-Catherine de la Hamette, Viktoria Kabel, Marios Christodoulou, Časlav Brukner
Abstract: Classically the causal order of two timelike separated events A and B is fixed -- either A before B or B before A. This is no longer true in quantum theory, where it is possible to encounter superpositions of causal orders. The quantum switch is one of the most prominent processes with indefinite causal order. Optical realizations of the quantum switch have been successfully implemented in experiments, but, some argue this merely simulates a process with indefinite causal order and that a superposition of spacetime metrics is required for a true realization. Here, we provide a relativistic definition of causal order between operationally defined events that defines a meaningful observable in both the general relativistic and quantum mechanical sense. Importantly, this observable does not distinguish between the indefinite causal order implemented on an optical bench and the gravitational quantum switch, a gedankenexperiment where the indefinite causal order is achieved by a quantum superposition of gravitational fields. Therefore, our results support the thesis that the optical quantum switch is just as much a realization of indefinite causal order as its gravitational counterpart, which makes use of the quantum mechanical behavior of spacetime.

Title: Data-driven Quantum Dynamical Embedding Method for Long-term Prediction on Near-term Quantum Computers
Authors: Tai-Ping Sun, Zhao-Yun Chen, Cheng Xue, Huan-Yu Liu, Xi-Ning Zhuang, Yun-Jie Wang, Shi-Xin Ma, Hai-Feng Zhang, Yu-Chun Wu, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: The increasing focus on long-term time series prediction across various fields has been significantly strengthened by advancements in quantum computation. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven method designed for time series prediction with quantum dynamical embedding (QDE). This approach enables a trainable embedding of the data space into an extended state space, allowing for the recursive retrieval of time series information. Based on its independence of time series length, this method achieves depth-efficient quantum circuits that are crucial for near-term quantum computers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's capability to predict not only wave signals but also more complex signals such as NARMA. Prediction accuracy improves with model scaling, and notably, the model achieves better accuracy on wave signal tasks with fewer parameters compared to QRC. Additionally, the model shows promising potential for denoising classical noise in wave signals, and when combined with error mitigation techniques for typical quantum noise, it enables reliable long-term prediction of wave signals. We implement this model, restricted to 2 qubits, on the Origin ``Wukong" superconducting quantum processor as a simple proof-of-concept on NISQ devices. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis of the QDE's dynamical properties for the 2-qubit case and discuss its potential universality. Overall, this study represents our first step towards leveraging near-term quantum devices for time series forecasting, offering insights into integrating data-driven learning with quantum dynamical embeddings.

Title: Effectiveness of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum hardware
Authors: Younghun Kim, Hansol Kim, Jeongsoo Kang, Wonjae Choi, Younghun Kwon
Abstract: Large scale quantum circuits are required to exploit the advantages of quantum computers. Despite significant advancements in quantum hardware, scalability remains a challenge, with errors accumulating as more qubits and gates are added. To overcome this limitation, quantum error-correction codes have been introduced. Although the success of quantum error correction codes has been demonstrated on superconducting quantum processors and neutral atom-based systems, there have been no experimental reports of error suppression using flag qubits on a quantum processor. IBM's quantum hardware features a non-topological coupling map, and past developments of quantum error correction codes on this platform have primarily explored the use of flag qubits. Here, we report the successful implementation of a syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum computers. Moreover, we demonstrate its effectiveness by considering the repetition code as a test code among the quantum error-correcting codes. Even though the data qubit is not adjacent to the syndrome qubit, logical error rates diminish as the distance of the repetition code increases from three to nine. Even when two flag qubits exist between the data and syndrome qubits, the logical error rates decrease as the distance increases similarly. This confirms the successful implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on the IBM quantum computer.

Title: General quantum resources provide advantages in work extraction tasks
Authors: Chung-Yun Hsieh, Manuel Gessner
Abstract: In developing quantum science and technologies, it is essential to demonstrate the so-called quantum advantages, which are performances that can be achieved only with the assistance of quantum resources. Most of the time, different quantum features lead to different advantages. Interestingly, there are certain classes of tasks where quantum advantages are achievable by general quantum resources. This work reports such a class of tasks in thermodynamics -- we provide a work extraction task that certifies general quantum resources of both states and channels, suggesting general quantum effects can provide non-classical advantages in work extraction. We also show that such work extraction tasks can be applied to certify quantum entanglement in a one-sided device-independent way. As an application, we report a novel type of anomalous energy flow -- a type of locally extractable energy that is attributed to the globally distributed entanglement. Finally, we show that the existence of this novel anomalous energy flow is equivalent to measurement incompatibility.

Title: Transient dynamics of the quantum Stuart-Landau oscillator
Authors: Hendry M. Lim, Donny Dwiputra, M Shoufie Ukhtary, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha
Abstract: We investigate the transient dynamics of the quantum Stuart-Landau oscillator, a paradigmatic quantum system exhibiting a quantum limit cycle and synchronization. From the energy dynamics, we determine a condition for the classical regime of transient dynamics and the limit cycle. Additionally, we formulate a guess function that fits the classical-regime steady-state Wigner function. The equation of motion for the Wigner function is derived and compared to the Kramers-Moyal equation for stochastic processes. We then characterize the classical-like behavior as the system evolves from a coherent state, noting the slow decay of neighboring-level coherence. We also study the evolution of the Wigner negativity as an indicator of nonclassicality, showing its temporary increase for some specific cases. To quantify the evolution speed, we examined the system's Lindbladian spectra, particularly the Liouvillian gap. Finally, we record the time it takes to reach the steady state for some Fock, thermal, and coherent states. The parameter dependence of the steady-state time may differ from the Liouvillian gap, and the limit-cycle attraction is significantly slower for coherent states compared to Fock or thermal states. For the diagonal states, there are \revision{fast convergence regimes} for which the steady-state time is locally minimized. This study provides a deeper insight into the transient behavior of self-sustained quantum systems.

Title: Nonlocal interaction and quantum friction in sliding Bi$_2$Se$_3$ topological surfaces
Authors: Feiyi Liu, Ming Guo, Mingyang Liu, Ruanjing Zhang, Yang Wang
Abstract: Topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films exhibit unique electronic properties arising from their topologically protected surface states. In a theoretical model capturing the essential physics of Dirac electrons in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. By using experimental Fermi velocities of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, our results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.

Title: A Criterion for Post-Selected Quantum Advantage
Authors: Chaitanya Karamchedu, Matthew Fox, Daniel Gottesman
Abstract: Assuming the polynomial hierarchy is infinite, we prove a sufficient condition for determining if uniform and polynomial size quantum circuits over a non-universal gate set are not efficiently classically simulable in the weak multiplicative sense. Our criterion exploits the fact that subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})$ are essentially either discrete or dense in $\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})$. Using our criterion, we give a new proof that both instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits and conjugated Clifford circuits (CCCs) afford a quantum advantage. We also prove that both commuting CCCs and CCCs over various fragments of the Clifford group afford a quantum advantage, which settles two questions of Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Koh. Our results imply that circuits over just $(U^\dagger \otimes U^\dagger) \mathrm{CZ} (U \otimes U)$ afford a quantum advantage for almost all $U \in \mathrm{U}(2)$.

Title: No quantum advantage for violating fixed-order inequalities?
Authors: Veronika Baumann, Ämin Baumeler, Eleftherios-Ermis Tselentis
Abstract: In standard quantum theory, the causal relations between operations are fixed. One can relax this notion by allowing for dynamical arrangements, where operations may influence the causal relations of future operations, as certified by violation of fixed-order inequalities, e.g., the k-cycle inequalities. Another, non-causal, departure further relaxes these limitations, and is certified by violations of causal inequalities. In this paper, we explore the interplay between dynamic and indefinite causality. We study the k-cycle inequalities and show that the quantum switch violates these inequalities without exploiting its indefinite nature. We further introduce non-adaptive strategies, which effectively remove the dynamical aspect of any process, and show that the k-cycle inequalities become novel causal inequalities; violating k-cycle inequalities under the restriction of non-adaptive strategies requires non-causal setups. The quantum switch is known to be incapable of violating causal inequalities, and it is believed that a device-independent certification of its causal indefiniteness requires extended setups incorporating spacelike separation. This work reopens the possibility for a device-independent certification of the quantum switch in isolation via fixed-order inequalities instead of causal inequalities. The inequalities we study here, however, turn out to be unsuitable for such a device-independent certification. In this work, we initiate the question posed by the title. This question, however, remains unanswered.

Title: The exact convex roof for GHZ-W mixtures for three qubits and beyond
Authors: Andreas Osterloh
Abstract: I present an exact solution for the convex roof of the square root of the threetangle for all states within the Bloch sphere. The working horse that optimal decompositions contain as many states from the zero-polytope as possible which can be called zero-state locking is proved and an inequality is derived which decides about the optimality of the decompositions under consideration here. The footprint of the measure of entanglement consists in a characteristic pattern for the fixed pure states on the surface which form the optimal solution. The solution is subject to transformation properties due to the SL-invariance of the entanglement measure.

Title: Low-temperature Gibbs states with tensor networks
Authors: Denise Cocchiarella, Mari Carmen Bañuls
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory.

Title: Three-Body Non-Locality in Particle Decays
Authors: Paweł Horodecki, Kazuki Sakurai, Abhyoudai S. Shaleena, Michael Spannowsky
Abstract: The exploration of entanglement and Bell non-locality among multi-particle quantum systems offers a profound avenue for testing and understanding the limits of quantum mechanics and local real hidden variable theories. In this work, we examine non-local correlations among three massless spin-1/2 particles generated from the three-body decay of a massive particle, utilizing a framework based on general four-fermion interactions. By analyzing several inequalities, we address the detection of deviations from quantum mechanics as well as violations of two key hidden variable theories: fully local-real and bipartite local-real theories. Our approach encompasses the standard Mermin inequality and the tight $4 \times 4 \times 2$ inequality, providing a comprehensive framework for probing three-partite non-local correlations. Our findings provide deeper insights into the boundaries of classical and quantum theories in three-particle systems, advancing the understanding of non-locality in particle decays and its relevance to particle physics and quantum foundations.

Title: Superdiffusion resilience in Heisenberg Chains with 2D interactions on a quantum processor
Authors: Keerthi Kumaran, Manas Sajjan, Bibek Pokharel, Kevin Wang, Joe Gibbs, Jeffrey Cohn, Barbara Jones, Sarah Mostame, Sabre Kais, Arnab Banerjee
Abstract: Observing superdiffusive scaling in the spin transport of the integrable 1D Heisenberg model is one of the key discoveries in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Despite this remarkable theoretical development and the subsequent experimental observation of the phenomena in KCuF$_3$, real materials are often imperfect and contain integrability breaking interactions. Understanding the effect of such terms on the superdiffusion is crucial in identifying connections to such materials. Current quantum hardware has already ascertained its utility in studying such non-equilibrium phenomena by simulating the superdiffusion of the 1D Heisenberg model. In this work, we perform a quantum simulation of the superdiffusion breakdown by generalizing the superdiffusive Floquet-type 1D Heisenberg model to a general 2D model. We comprehensively study the effect of different 2D interactions on the superdiffusion breakdown by tuning up their strength from zero, corresponding to the 1D Heisenberg chain, to finite nonzero values. We observe that certain 2D interactions are more resilient against superdiffusion breakdown than others and that the $SU(2)$ preserving 2D interaction has the highest resilience among all the 2D interactions we study. Importantly, this observed resilience has direct implications for sustaining superdiffusive spin transport in two-dimensional lattices. We reason out the relative resilience against the superdiffusion breakdown through an analysis of the scattering coefficients off the 2D interaction in otherwise 1D chains. The relative resilience of different interaction types against superdiffusion breakdown was also captured in quantum hardware with remarkable accuracy, further establishing the current quantum hardware's applicability in simulating interesting non-equilibrium quantum many-body phenomena.

Title: Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions
Authors: Brij Mohan, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla, Manabendra Nath Bera
Abstract: Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Additionally, our autonomous refrigerators with negative temperature baths significantly outperform previously studied autonomous and non-autonomous refrigerators in terms of cooling ability without requiring any additional energy resources, as they cool the cold bath to much lower temperature, which is forbidden for others refrigerators. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.

Title: Family of self-dual quasicrystals with critical Phases
Authors: Wenzhi Wang, Wei Yi, Tianyu Li
Abstract: We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of one dimensional quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-André-Harper models on one end, to those featuring long-range hoppings with varied quasiperiodic modulations on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with richly structured mobility edges separating them. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward critical phases from self-duality considerations, and would facilitate the experimental simulation of these exotic states.

Title: Entanglement islands in 1D and 2D lattices with defects
Authors: Ivan P. Christov
Abstract: We investigate the spatial structure of quantum entanglement in one- and two-dimensional lattice systems containing structural defects, using the Time-Dependent Quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method. By constructing reduced density matrices from ensembles of guide waves, we resolve spatial variations in both Coulomb-mediated entanglement and coherence without requiring full many-body wavefunctions. This approach reveals localized regions, entanglement islands, where quantum correlations are enhanced or suppressed due to the presence of vacancies or interaction inhomogeneities. In 1D systems, entanglement tends to concentrate near defects, while in 2D we observe bridge-like and radially symmetric domains. Our results demonstrate that TDQMC offers a scalable and physically transparent framework for real-space quantum information analysis, with implications for information transfer in atomic-size structures, quantum materials, entanglement-based sensing, and coherent state engineering.

Title: Quantum correlations in molecular cavity optomechanics
Authors: E. Kongkui Berinyuy, D.R. Kenigoule Massembele, P. Djorwe, R. Altuijri, A.-H. Abdel-Aty, S. G. Nana Engo
Abstract: Quantum correlations are interesting resources for modern quantum technologies such as quantum information processing, quantum communication, quantum teleportation, and quantum computation tasks. However, engineering these quantum states turns to be not an easy task. Here, we unveil a theoretical framework for generating and controlling quantum correlations within a double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system. Our approach leverages strong interactions between confined optical fields and collective molecular vibrations, creating a versatile environment for exploring robust quantum correlations. Our findings reveal that by judiciously optimizing the coupling strength between the cavity field and the molecular collective mode leads to significant enhancement of entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord. We demonstrate that cavity-cavity quantum correlations can be effectively mediated by the molecular collective mode, enabling a unique pathway for inter-cavity quantum connectivity. Moreover, the quantum entanglement generated in our McOM system exhibits robustness against thermal noise, persisting up to temperatures approaching $1000 K$. This strong resilience, qualifies molecular optomechanics as a compelling architecture for scalable, room-temperature quantum information processing and the practical realization of quantum networks. Additionally, the phase-dependent behaviour of quantum discord provides a fundamental basis for developing ultra-sensitive gas sensors, with potential applications in environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and industrial safety.

Title: QPPG: Quantum-Preconditioned Policy Gradient for Link Adaptation in Rayleigh Fading Channels
Authors: Oluwaseyi Giwa, Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Folarin Jubril Adesola, Muhammad Ali Jamshed
Abstract: Reliable link adaptation is critical for efficient wireless communications in dynamic fading environments. However, reinforcement learning (RL) solutions often suffer from unstable convergence due to poorly conditioned policy gradients, hindering their practical application. We propose the quantum-preconditioned policy gradient (QPPG) algorithm, which leverages Fisher-information-based preconditioning to stabilise and accelerate policy updates. Evaluations in Rayleigh fading scenarios show that QPPG achieves faster convergence, a 28.6% increase in average throughput, and a 43.8% decrease in average transmit power compared to classical methods. This work introduces quantum-geometric conditioning to link adaptation, marking a significant advance in developing robust, quantum-inspired reinforcement learning for future 6G networks, thereby enhancing communication reliability and energy efficiency.

Title: Entanglement swapping for partially entangled qudits and the role of quantum complementarity
Authors: Diego S. Starke, Marcos L. W. Basso, Lucas C. Céleri, Jonas Maziero
Abstract: We extend the entanglement swapping protocol (ESP) to partially entangled qudit states and analyze the process within the framework of complete complementarity relations (CCRs). Building on previous results for qubits, we show that the average distributed entanglement between two parties via ESP is bounded above by the initial entanglement of one of the input pairs, and also by the product of the initial entanglements. Notably, we find that using initial states with vanishing local quantum coherence is sufficient to capture the essential features of the protocol, simplifying the analysis. By exploring the cases of qubits and qutrits, we observe that the upper bound on the average distributed entanglement -- expressed in terms of the product of the initial entanglements -- can be improved, and we conjecture what this tighter bound might be. Finally, we discuss the role of quantum complementarity in the ESP and show how local predictability constrains the entanglement that can be operationally distributed via ESP.

Title: Efficient Non-Adaptive Quantum Algorithms for Tolerant Junta Testing
Authors: Zongbo Bao, Yuxuan Liu, Penghui Yao, Zekun Ye, Jialin Zhang
Abstract: We consider the problem of deciding whether an $n$-qubit unitary (or $n$-bit Boolean function) is $\varepsilon_1$-close to some $k$-junta or $\varepsilon_2$-far from every $k$-junta, where $k$-junta unitaries act non-trivially on at most $k$ qubits and as the identity on the rest, and $k$-junta Boolean functions depend on at most $k$ variables. For constant numbers $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2$ such that $0 < \varepsilon_1 < \varepsilon_2 < 1$, we show the following. (1) A non-adaptive $O(k\log k)$-query tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for $k$-junta unitaries when $2\sqrt{2}\varepsilon_1 < \varepsilon_2$. (2) A non-adaptive tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for Boolean functions with $O(k \log k)$ quantum queries when $4\varepsilon_1 < \varepsilon_2$. (3) A $2^{\widetilde{O}(k)}$-query tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for $k$-junta unitaries for any $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2$. The first algorithm provides an exponential improvement over the best-known quantum algorithms. The second algorithm shows an exponential quantum advantage over any non-adaptive classical algorithm. The third tester gives the first tolerant junta unitary testing result for an arbitrary gap. Besides, we adapt the first two quantum algorithms to be implemented using only single-qubit operations, thereby enhancing experimental feasibility, with a slightly more stringent requirement for the parameter gap.

Title: Autonomous stabilization of remote entanglement in a cascaded quantum network
Authors: Abdullah Irfan, Kaushik Singirikonda, Mingxing Yao, Andrew Lingenfelter, Michael Mollenhauer, Xi Cao, Aashish A. Clerk, Wolfgang Pfaff
Abstract: Remote entanglement between widely separated qubits is a fundamental quantum phenomenon and a critical resource for quantum information applications. Generating entanglement between independent qubits separated by arbitrary, potentially large distances requires propagating quantum states, and is typically achieved using pulsed protocols combining distinct steps of local entanglement generation followed by distribution. This necessity raises an intriguing question: Can remote entanglement can be stabilized indefinitely, instead of only periodically regenerated and redistributed after decay? Here, we demonstrate that this is indeed possible, reporting autonomous stabilization of entanglement between two separate superconducting-qubit devices. Combining nonreciprocal waveguide coupling and local driving, we experimentally realize a symmetry-based coherent quantum-absorber scheme in a cascaded network. We quantify the degree of entanglement through quantum state tomography, finding that the protocol's entangling power is severely limited by imperfections that break the required symmetry. We show, however, that a modified protocol based on an alternate symmetry is far more robust, enabling us to achieve a concurrence approaching 0.5, a limit set only by local loss in the network. Our results enable on-demand delivery of high-fidelity entanglement in modular quantum processors and networks and pave the way for autonomously protecting distributed quantum information.

Title: Joint momenta-coordinates states as pointer states in quantum decoherence
Authors: Nomenjanahary Tanjonirina Manampisoa, Ravo Tokiniaina Ranaivoson, Roland Raboanary, Raoelina Andriambololona, Rivo Herivola Manjakamanana Ravelonjato, Naivo Rabesiranana
Abstract: Quantum decoherence provides a framework to study the emergence of classicality from quantum systems by showing how interactions with the environment suppress interferences and select robust states known as pointer states. Earlier studies have linked Gaussian coherent states to pointer states. More recently, it was conjectured that more general quantum states called joint momenta-coordinates states may serve as more suitable candidates to be pointer states. These states are associated to the concept of quantum phase space and saturate, by definition, generalized uncertainty relations. In this work, we rigorously prove this conjecture. Building on the Lindblad framework for the damped harmonic oscillator, and applying Zurek's predictability-sieve criterion, we analyze both underdamped and overdamped regimes. We show that only in the underdamped case do joint momenta-coordinates states remain pure and robust for all times, establishing them as the true pointer states. This extends Isar's earlier underdamped treatment, generalizes the concept beyond Gaussian approximations, and embeds classical robustness in the quantum phase space formalism, with potential applications in error-resistant quantum information.

Title: Hyper-optimized Quantum Lego Contraction Schedules
Authors: Balint Pato, June Vanlerberghe, Kenneth R. Brown
Abstract: Calculating the quantum weight enumerator polynomial (WEP) is a valuable tool for characterizing quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes, but it is computationally hard for large or complex codes. The Quantum LEGO (QL) framework provides a tensor network approach for WEP calculation, in some cases offering superpolynomial speedups over brute-force methods, provided the code exhibits area law entanglement, that a good QL layout is used, and an efficient tensor network contraction schedule is found. We analyze the performance of a hyper-optimized contraction schedule framework across QL layouts for diverse stabilizer code families. We find that the intermediate tensors in the QL networks for stabilizer WEPs are often highly sparse, invalidating the dense-tensor assumption of standard cost functions. To address this, we introduce an exact, polynomial-time Sparse Stabilizer Tensor (SST) cost function based on the rank of the parity check matrices for intermediate tensors. The SST cost function correlates perfectly with the true contraction cost, providing a significant advantage over the default cost function, which exhibits large uncertainty. Optimizing contraction schedules using the SST cost function yields substantial performance gains, achieving up to orders of magnitude improvement in actual contraction cost compared to using the dense tensor cost function. Furthermore, the precise cost estimation from the SST function offers an efficient metric to decide whether the QL-based WEP calculation is computationally superior to brute force for a given QL layout. These results, enabled by PlanqTN, a new open-source QL implementation, validate hyper-optimized contraction as a crucial technique for leveraging the QL framework to explore the QEC code design space.

Title: Guess your neighbor's input: Quantum advantage in Feige's game
Authors: Simon Schmidt, Sigurd A. L. Storgaard, Michael Walter, Yuming Zhao
Abstract: In this article, we study a nonlocal game with two questions and three answers per player, which was first considered by Feige in 1991, and show that there is quantum advantage in this game. We prove that the game is a robust self-test for the $3$-dimensional maximally entangled state. Furthermore, we show that the game can be seen as the "or" of two games that each do not have quantum advantage. Lastly, we investigate the behavior of the game with respect to parallel repetition in the classical, quantum and non-signalling case and obtain perfect parallel repetition of the non-signalling value if Feige's game is repeated an even amount of times.

Title: Orders matter: tight bounds on the precision of sequential quantum estimation for multiparameter models
Authors: Gabriele Fazio, Jiayu He, Matteo G. A. Paris
Abstract: In multiparameter quantum metrology, the ultimate precision of joint estimation is dictated by the Holevo Cramér-Rao bound. In this paper, we discuss and analyze in detail an alternative approach: the stepwise estimation strategy. In this approach, parameters are estimated sequentially, using an optimized fraction of the total available resources allocated to each step. We derive a tight and achievable precision bound for this protocol, the stepwise separable bound, and provide its closed-form analytical expression, revealing a crucial dependence on the chosen measurement ordering. We provide a rigorous comparison with the joint measurement strategy, deriving analytical conditions that determine when the stepwise approach offers superior precision. Through the analysis of several paradigmatic SU(2) unitary encoding models, we demonstrate that the stepwise strategy can indeed outperform joint measurements, particularly in scenarios characterized by non-optimal probes or models with a high degree of sloppiness. Our findings establish stepwise estimation as a powerful alternative to joint and collective measurements, proving that sequential protocols can provide a genuine metrological advantage, especially in resource-constrained or imperfect experimental settings.

Title: Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries
Authors: Pei-Yao Liu
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d{-}1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p{+}1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d{-}p{-}2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product, symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the bipartite entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. The framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the factorization, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.

Title: Optimal quantum learning in proximity to universality
Authors: Moein N. Ivaki, Matias Karjula, Tapio Ala-Nissila
Abstract: The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.

Title: Universal distributions of overlaps from generic dynamics in quantum many-body systems
Authors: Alexios Christopoulos, Amos Chan, Andrea De Luca
Abstract: We study the distribution of overlaps with the computational basis of a quantum state generated under generic quantum many-body chaotic dynamics, without conserved quantities, for a finite time $t$. We argue that, scaling time logarithmically with the system size $t \propto \log L$, the overlap distribution converges to a universal form in the thermodynamic limit, forming a one-parameter family that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. The form of the overlap distribution only depends on the spatial dimensionality and, remarkably, on the boundary conditions. This picture is justified in general by a mapping to Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and corroborated by the exact solution of a random quantum circuit. Our results derive from an analysis of arbitrary overlap moments, enabling the reconstruction of the distribution. Our predictions also apply to Floquet circuits, i.e., in the presence of mild quenched disorder. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.

Title: Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localization systems
Authors: Shuo Liu, Hao-Kai Zhang, Shuai Yin, Shi-Xin Zhang, Hong Yao
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems has attracted increasing attention owing to a variety of intriguing phenomena absent in equilibrium physics. A prominent example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where subsystem symmetry is restored more rapidly under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. In this work, we investigate symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems for a range of initial states. We show that symmetry can still be restored in the many-body localization regime without approaching thermal equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quantum Mpemba effect emerges universally for any tilted product state, in contrast to chaotic systems where its occurrence depends sensitively on the choice of the initial state. We further provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect using an effective model for many-body localization. Overall, this paper fills an important gap in establishing a unified understanding of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in generic many-body systems, and it advances our understanding of many-body localization.

Title: Maximally Extendable Product Codes are Good Coboundary Expanders
Authors: Gleb Kalachev, Pavel Panteleev
Abstract: We investigate the coboundary expansion property of tensor product codes, known as product expansion, which plays an important role in recent constructions of good quantum LDPC codes and classical locally testable codes. Prior research has shown that this property is equivalent to agreement testability and robust testability for products of two codes with linear distance. However, for products of more than two codes, product expansion is a strictly stronger property. In this paper, we prove that a collection of an arbitrary number of random codes over a sufficiently large field has good product expansion. We believe that, in the case of four codes, the same ideas can be used to construct good quantum locally testable codes, in a way similar to the current constructions that use only products of two codes.

Title: Magnetizing weak links by time-dependent spin-orbit interactions: momentum conserving and non-conserving processes
Authors: Debashree Chowdhury, O. Entin-Wohlman, A. Aharony, R. I. Shekhter, M. Jonson
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit interactions generated by time-dependent electric fields acting on weak links (that couple together non-magnetic macroscopic leads) can magnetize the junction. The Rashba spin-orbit interaction that affects the spins of electrons tunneling through the weak links changes their momentum concomitantly. We establish the connection between the magnetization flux induced by processes that conserve the momentum and the magnetization created by tunneling events that do not. Control of the induced magnetization can be achieved by tuning the polarization of the AC electric field responsible for the spin-orbit Rashba interaction (e.g., from being circular to linear), by changing the applied bias voltage, and by varying the degree of a gate voltage-induced asymmetry of the device.

Title: Probing New Forces with Nuclear Clocks
Authors: Cédric Delaunay, Seung J. Lee, Roee Ozeri, Gilad Perez, Wolfram Ratzinger, Bingrong Yu
Abstract: Clocks based on nuclear isomer transitions promise exceptional stability and precision. The low transition energy of the thorium-229 isomer makes it an ideal candidate, as it has been excited by a vacuum-ultraviolet laser and is highly sensitive to subtle interactions. This enables the development of powerful tools for probing new forces, which we call {\it quintessometers}. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of nuclear clocks, particularly solid-state variants, to surpass existing limits on scalar field couplings, exceeding the sensitivity of current fifth-force searches at submicron distances and significantly improving equivalence-principle tests at kilometer scales and beyond. Additionally, we highlight the capability of transportable nuclear clocks to detect scalar interactions at distances beyond $10\,$km, complementing space-based missions.

Title: Ground states of quasi-two-dimensional correlated systems via energy expansion
Authors: Sam Mardazad, Nicolas Laflorencie, Johannes Motruk, Adrian Kantian
Abstract: We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.

Title: Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers
Authors: Daniel González-Cuadra, Alejandro Bermudez
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.

Title: TunnElQNN: A Hybrid Quantum-classical Neural Network for Efficient Learning
Authors: A. H. Abbas
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) represent a promising frontier in machine learning, leveraging the complementary strengths of both models. In this work, we propose the development of TunnElQNN, a non-sequential architecture composed of alternating classical and quantum layers. Within the classical component, we employ the Tunnelling Diode Activation Function (TDAF), inspired by the I-V characteristics of quantum tunnelling. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid model on a synthetic dataset of interleaving half-circle for multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of class overlap. The model is compared against a baseline hybrid architecture that uses the conventional ReLU activation function (ReLUQNN). Our results show that the TunnElQNN model consistently outperforms the ReLUQNN counterpart. Furthermore, we analyse the decision boundaries generated by TunnElQNN under different levels of class overlap and compare them to those produced by a neural network implementing TDAF within a fully classical architecture. These findings highlight the potential of integrating physics-inspired activation functions with quantum components to enhance the expressiveness and robustness of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning architectures.

Title: One rig to control them all
Authors: Chris Heunen, Robin Kaarsgaard, Louis Lemonnier
Abstract: We introduce a theory for computational control, consisting of eight naturally interpretable equations. Adding these to a prop of base circuits constructs controlled circuits, borne out in examples of reversible Boolean circuits and quantum circuits. We prove that this syntactic construction semantically corresponds to taking the free rig category on the base prop.

Title: Disorder-Induced Anomalous Diffusion in a 3D Spin Network
Authors: Andrew Stasiuk, Garrett Heller, Lance Berkey, Bo Xing, Paola Cappellaro
Abstract: Emergent hydrodynamics (EHD) bridges short-time unitarity with late-time thermodynamics, universal transport phenomena characterize the manner and speed of transport and thermalization. Typical non-integrable systems with few conserved local quantities are expected to be diffusive. In contrast, strongly disordered systems which admit phases such as many-body localization, are predicted to inhibit thermalization and thus slow dynamical transport. Disordered systems represent a uniquely poised platform to probe the quantum-to-classical transition and the emergence of irreversible thermodynamics from the underlying unitary structure. Here, we study a strongly disordered nuclear spin ensemble, using local measurements enabled by the disordered-state technique. We observe an apparent phase transition into a sub-diffusive regime, which we model as a random walk on the emergent fractal structure of a percolating network in the dipolar spin ensemble. Our novel theoretical model provides a framework for characterizing the emergence of thermalization in closed quantum systems, even in the presence of strong disorder.
