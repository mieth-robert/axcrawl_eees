Title: Electron-positron pair creation induced by multi-pulse train of electric fields: effect of randomness in time-delay
Authors: Deepak Sah, Manoranjan P. Singh
Abstract: We investigate the creation of electron-positron pairs (EPPs) in a sequence of alternating-sign, time-dependent electric field pulse trains by solving the quantum Vlasov equations. Specifically, we focus on Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays between successive pulses, drawn from a Gaussian distribution wherein the extent of fluctuations is controlled by the standard deviation $\sigma_T$ of the distribution. We find that increasing $\sigma_T$ leads to a dramatic transformation in the longitudinal momentum spectrum. The well-known fringe pattern, akin to that in the multi-slit interference, gets significantly modified. The averaged spectra exhibit a robust Gaussian-like envelope with residual oscillations, which are much more prominent in the central momentum region. Notably, we find that in certain cases, stochastic time delays lead to a pronounced enhancement in the central peak of the distribution function for pulse train containing $N$ pulses. For example, for $N=20$ pulses, $\sigma_T \approx 31$ $[m^{-1}]$(about $17\%$ of the mean time delay) yields nearly a tenfold increase in the central peak, which for $\sigma_T \approx 50$ $[m^{-1}]$ (about $27\%$ of the mean time delay), scales up to $10^3.$ This may open up new possibilities for optimizing multi-pulse field configurations and guide future experimental designs aimed at maximizing EPPs creation.

Title: A Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Quantum-Classical Graph Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Urban Taxi Destination Prediction
Authors: Xiuying Zhang, Qinsheng Zhu, Xiaodong Xing
Abstract: We propose a Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Quantum Graph Convolutional Network (H-STQGCN) algorithm by combining the strengths of quantum computing and classical deep learning to predict the taxi destination within urban road networks. Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, validating the unique advantages of the quantum-enhanced mechanism in capturing high-dimensional spatial dependencies.

Title: Quantum simulation using Trotterized disorder Hamiltonians in a single-mode optical cavity
Authors: Rahel Lea Baumgartner, Pietro Pelliconi, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Francesca Orsi, Philipp Hauke, Jean-Philippe Brantut, Julian Sonner
Abstract: All-to-all interacting and disordered many-body systems are notoriously hard to simulate on quantum platforms, as interactions are commonly mediated by auxiliary degrees of freedom that lower the amount of disorder, introducing undesired correlations. In this work, we show how a Trotterization scheme can be effectively utilized to densify the disorder of the model. In particular, we study the statistical properties of the resulting model, as well as Trotterization errors in the simulation that affect the time evolution and dynamical observables. As a concrete example, we propose an implementation via a single-mode cavity QED platform of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We analyze several features of the effective model, such as the distribution of the effective couplings, the number of interacting sites, state preparation, and the behavior of quantum chaos probes. We conclude this work with a detailed investigation of the robustness of our findings against dissipation, both analytically and numerically.

Title: Transversal Clifford-Hierarchy Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes
Authors: Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We present a purely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\pi/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.

Title: Search Smarter, Not Harder: A Scalable, High-Quality Zoned Neutral Atom Compiler
Authors: Yannick Stade, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille
Abstract: Zoned neutral atom architectures are emerging as a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing. Their growing scale, however, creates a critical need for efficient and automated compilation solutions. Yet, existing methods fail to scale to the thousands of qubits these devices promise. State-of-the-art compilers, in particular, suffer from immense memory requirements that limit them to small-scale problems. This work proposes a scalable compilation strategy that "searches smarter, not harder". We introduce Iterative Diving Search (IDS), a goal-directed search algorithm that avoids the memory issues of previous methods, and relaxed routing, an optimization to mitigate atom rearrangement overhead. Our evaluation confirms that this approach compiles circuits with thousands of qubits and, in addition, even reduces rearrangement overhead by 28.1% on average. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at this https URL.

Title: Freeness Reined in by a Single Qubit
Authors: Alexander Altland, Francisco Divi, Tobias Micklitz, Maedeh Rezaei
Abstract: Free probability provides a framework for describing correlations between non-commuting observables in complex quantum systems whose Hilbert-space states follow maximum-entropy distributions. We examine the robustness of this framework under a minimal deviation from freeness: the coupling of a single ancilla qubit to a Haar-distributed quantum circuit of dimension $D0 \gg 1$. We find that, even in this setting, the correlation functions predicted by free probability theory receive corrections of order $O(1)$. These modifications persist at long times, when the dynamics of the coupled system is already ergodic. We trace their origin to non-uniformly distributed stationary quantum states, which we characterize analytically and confirm numerically.

Title: Universal Statistics of Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids
Authors: Kabir Khanna, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We study the statistics of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) after partial measurement on a class of one-dimensional quantum critical states described by Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids at low energies. Using a replica trick to average over measurement outcomes in the charge basis and tools from conformal field theory (CFT), we derive closed-form expressions for the cumulants of MIE. We show that exact Born-averaging over microscopic measurement outcomes becomes equivalent at low energy to averaging over conformal boundary conditions weighted by their corresponding partition functions. Our results yield distinctive critical behavior across all cumulants in the regime where the unmeasured parts of the system are maximally separated. We also obtain the full distribution of the post-measurement entanglement entropy, finding that it is generically bimodal and exhibits fat-tails. We corroborate our analytical predictions by numerical calculations and find good agreement between them.

Title: Fractional decay in the spontaneous emission of a two-level system
Authors: Hiroki Nakabayashi, Hayato Kinkawa, Takano Taira, Naomichi Hatano
Abstract: We find that when the environment of a two-level system has an energy spectrum with a lower bound but without an upper one, the survival probability of the spontaneous emission of the two-level system scales with the spatial dimension $D$ and the exponent $n$ of the energy dispersion $|\vec{k}|^n$ of the environment in the form $1-\alpha t^{2-D/n}$ in the short-time and in the form $\alpha t^{D/n-2}$ in the long-time regime. The former fractional scaling of the survival probability leads to a quantum Zeno effect with a different scaling of the Zeno time.

Title: Optical Downlink Modeling for LEO and MEO Satellites under Atmospheric Turbulence with a Quantum State Tomography Use Case
Authors: Artur Czerwinski, Jakub J. Borkowski, Saeed Haddadi
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the link budget for free-space optical systems involving Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. We develop a detailed model of the satellite-to-ground channel that accounts for the primary physical processes affecting transmittance: atmospheric absorption and scattering, free-space diffraction, and turbulence-induced fluctuations. The study introduces a general method for computing transmittance along a slant path between a satellite and an optical ground station, incorporating zenith angle, slant range, and altitude-dependent attenuation. The proposed framework is intended to support the design and evaluation of space-based optical links and serves as a critical tool for defining technical specifications in satellite communication demonstrators and simulations. Numerical estimates are provided to illustrate the magnitude of losses under typical operational conditions, including the role of aperture averaging. In addition to the link budget analysis, we introduce a satellite-based quantum use case. We propose a scheme for quantum state tomography performed on states generated by an onboard photon source on an LEO or MEO satellite and transmitted to the optical ground station. This approach enables continuous verification of the quality of quantum resources that can be used to perform quantum protocols within quantum information networks.

Title: Microwave-free vector magnetometry and crystal orientation determination with Nitrogen-Vacancy centers using Bayesian inference
Authors: Hilario Espinós, Omkar Dhungel, Arne Wickenbrock, Dmitry Budker, Ricardo Puebla, Erik Torrontegui
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide a solid-state platform for quantum sensing. While optically detected magnetic resonance techniques offer high sensitivity, their reliance on microwaves introduces heating and stray electromagnetic fields that can perturb nearby samples. Optical approaches based on cross-relaxation between differently oriented NV centers remove this constraint but have so far required stringent alignment of the external field with crystallographic axes, restricting their practicality. Here we introduce a general framework for microwave-free vector magnetometry at near-zero field that leverages Bayesian inference to extract both the magnetic field vector and the NV orientation directly from photoluminescence maps. An analytical model of cross-relaxation resonances enables efficient inference under arbitrary field and orientation configurations, while naturally incorporating the discrete degeneracies of the NV symmetry. We experimentally demonstrate robust orientation determination and vector-field reconstruction, establishing a general route toward compact and alignment-free NV magnetometers for practical sensing applications.

Title: Achieving $10^{-5}$ level relative intensity crosstalk in optical holographic qubit addressing via a double-pass digital micromirror device
Authors: Shilpa Mahato, Rajibul Islam
Abstract: Holographic beam shaping is a powerful approach for generating individually addressable optical spots for controlling atomic qubits, such as those in trapped-ion quantum processors. However, its application in qubit control is limited by residual intensity crosstalk at neighboring sites and by a nonzero background floor in the far wings of the addressing beam, leading to accumulated errors from many exposed qubits. Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\,\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit. These results provide a compact, DMD-based solution for low-crosstalk optical holographic qubit addressing that is directly applicable to trapped ions and other spatially ordered quantum systems.

Title: Implementing the Koopman-von Neumann approach on continuous-variable photonic quantum computers
Authors: Xinfeng Gao, Olivier Pfister, Stefan Bekiranov
Abstract: The Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism recasts classical mechanics in a Hilbert space framework using complex wavefunctions and linear operators, akin to quantum mechanics. Instead of evolving probability densities in phase space (as in Liouville's equation), KvN uses a Schrödinger-like equation for a classical wavefunction, with commuting position and momentum operators. Mapped to quantum computing, KvN offers a promising route to simulate classical dynamical systems using quantum algorithms by leveraging unitary evolution and quantum linear algebra tools, potentially enabling efficient classical-to-quantum mappings without invoking full quantum uncertainty. In this work, we specifically explore the implementation of the KvN approach on continuous-variable photonic quantum computing architectures, with the goals of leveraging quantum simulation for both sampling and computing intractable nonlinear dynamics. We will demonstrate its implementation and feasibility with two problems: the harmonic oscillator and a 1D partial differential equation governing nonlinear dynamics.

Title: Group-Theoretic Reinforcement Learning of Dynamical Decoupling Sequences
Authors: Charles Marrder, Shuo Sun, Murray J. Holland
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling seeks to mitigate phase decoherence in qubits by applying a carefully designed sequence of effectively instantaneous electromagnetic pulses. Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise.

Title: Quantum Anticodes
Authors: ChunJun Cao, Giuseppe Cotardo, Brad Lackey
Abstract: This work introduces a symplectic framework for quantum error correcting codes in which local structure is analyzed through an anticode perspective. In this setting, a code is treated as a symplectic space, and anticodes arise as maximal symplectic subspaces whose elements vanish on a prescribed set of components, providing a natural quantum analogue of their classical counterparts. This framework encompasses several families of quantum codes, including stabilizer and subsystem codes, provides a natural extension of generalized distances in quantum codes, and yields new invariants that capture local algebraic and combinatorial features. The notion of anticodes also naturally leads to operations such as puncturing and shortening for symplectic codes, which in turn provide algebraic interpretations of key phenomena in quantum error correction, such as the cleaning lemma and complementary recovery and yield new descriptions of weight enumerators.

Title: Regulated reconstruction of long-time spin--boson dynamics and emergent zero-bias transverse measurement primitive
Authors: Dragomir Davidovic
Abstract: Time--convolutionless (TCL) master equations can break down at long times: time-local perturbative generators develop secular growth in correlation-dominated regimes. We mitigate this by a regulated, partially resummed reconstruction of the dynamical map around a Davies reference semigroup, expressed through a non--Markovian density-matrix correlator C(t) that remains bounded at late times. An exactly solvable rotating-wave benchmark links generator growth to interference-induced near-zeros of the coherence and shows how the reconstruction regulates the map. Applying the method to the unbiased spin--boson model reveals an emergent transverse measurement primitive: bath memory and counter--rotating terms induce phase lock-in that irreversibly erases the relative phase between $\sigma_x$ eigenspaces on a finite timescale $t_P$, yielding an effective zero-bias transverse ($\sigma_x$) measurement channel. The selected transverse basis is not assumed a priori; it follows from the reconstructed reduced dynamics. The effect disappears in the rotating-wave approximation and in the Davies weak-coupling limit, demonstrating its non--Markovian interference origin.

Goeders, Edward C. Gonzales, Raja Gosula, Stijn J. de Graaf, Alejandro Grajales Dau
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires a universal gate set, but the necessary non-Clifford gates represent a significant resource cost for most quantum error correction architectures. Magic state cultivation offers an efficient alternative to resource-intensive distillation protocols; however, testing the proposal's assumptions represents a challenging departure from quantum memory experiments. We present an experimental study of magic state cultivation on a superconducting quantum processor. We implement cultivation, including code-switching into a surface code, and develop a fault-tolerant measurement protocol to bound the magic state fidelity. Cultivation reduces the error by a factor of 40, with a state fidelity of 0.9999(1) (retaining 8% of attempts). Our results experimentally establish magic state cultivation as a viable solution to one of quantum computing's most significant challenges.

Title: Q-IRIS: The Evolution of the IRIS Task-Based Runtime to Enable Classical-Quantum Workflows
Authors: Narasinga Rao Miniskar, Mohammad Alaul Haque Monil, Elaine Wong, Vicente Leyton-Ortega, Jeffrey S. Vetter, Seth R. Johnson, Travis S. Humble
Abstract: Extreme heterogeneity in emerging HPC systems are starting to include quantum accelerators, motivating runtimes that can coordinate between classical and quantum workloads. We present a proof-of-concept hybrid execution framework integrating the IRIS asynchronous task-based runtime with the XACC quantum programming framework via the Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE). IRIS orchestrates multiple programs written in the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) across heterogeneous backends (including multiple quantum simulators), enabling concurrent execution of classical and quantum tasks. Although not a performance study, we report measurable outcomes through the successful asynchronous scheduling and execution of multiple quantum workloads. To illustrate practical runtime implications, we decompose a four-qubit circuit into smaller subcircuits through a process known as quantum circuit cutting, reducing per-task quantum simulation load and demonstrating how task granularity can improve simulator throughput and reduce queueing behavior -- effects directly relevant to early quantum hardware environments. We conclude by outlining key challenges for scaling hybrid runtimes, including coordinated scheduling, classical-quantum interaction management, and support for diverse backend resources in heterogeneous systems.

Title: Coherence-Sensitive Readout Models for Quantum Devices: Beyond the Classical Assignment Matrix
Authors: Zachariah Malik, Zain Saleem
Abstract: Readout error models for noisy quantum devices almost universally assume that measurement noise is classical: the measurement statistics are obtained from the ideal computational-basis populations by a column-stochastic assignment matrix $A$. This description is equivalent to assuming that the effective positive-operator-valued measurement (POVM) is diagonal in the measurement basis, and therefore completely insensitive to quantum coherences. We relax this assumption and derive a fully general expression for the observed measurement probabilities under arbitrary completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) noise preceding a computational-basis measurement. Writing the ideal post-circuit stat $\tilde{\rho}$ in terms of its populations $x$ and coherences $y$, we show that the observed probability vector $z$ satisfies $z = A x + C y$, where $A$ is the familiar classical assignment matrix and $C$ is a coherence-response matrix constructed from the off-diagonal matrix elements of the effective POVM in the computational basis. The classical model $z = A x$ arises if and only if all POVM elements are diagonal; in this sense $C$ quantifies accessible information about coherent readout distortions and interference between computational-basis states, all of which are invisible to models that retain only $A$. This work therefore provides a natural, fully general framework for coherence-sensitive readout modeling on current and future quantum devices.

Title: A non-linear quantum neural network framework for entanglement engineering
Authors: Adriano Macarone-Palmieri, Alberto Ferrara, Rosario Lo Franco
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its scalable generation in noisy quantum devices remains challenging. Here, we propose a low-depth quantum neural network architecture with linear scaling, inspired by memory-enabled photonic components, for variational entanglement engineering. The network incorporates physically motivated non-linear activation functions, enhancing expressivity beyond linear variational circuits at fixed depth. By Monte Carlo sampling over circuit topologies, we identify architectures that efficiently generate highly entangled pure states, approaching the GHz limit, and demonstrate a clear advantage of non-linear networks up to 20 qubits. For the noisy scenario, we employ the experimentally accessible Meyer-Wallach global entanglement as a surrogate optimization cost and certify entanglement using bipartite negativity. For mixed states of up to ten qubits, the optimized circuits generate substantial entanglement across both symmetric and asymmetric bipartitions. These results establish an experimentally motivated and scalable variational framework for engineering multipartite entanglement on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the combined role of non-linearity and circuit topology.

Title: Quantifying electron-nuclear spin entanglement dynamics in central-spin systems using one-tangles
Authors: Isabela Gnasso, Khadija Sarguroh, Dorian Gangloff, Sophia E. Economou, Edwin Barnes
Abstract: Optically-active solid-state systems such as self-assembled quantum dots, rare-earth ions, and color centers in diamond and SiC are promising candidates for quantum network, computing, and sensing applications. Although the nuclei in these systems naturally lead to electron spin decoherence, they can be repurposed, if they are controllable, as long-lived quantum memories. Prior work showed that a metric known as the one-tangling power can be used to quantify the entanglement dynamics of sparse systems of spin-1/2 nuclei coupled to color centers in diamond and SiC. Here, we generalize these findings to a wide range of electron-nuclear central-spin systems, including those with spin > 1/2 nuclei, such as in III-V quantum dots (QDs), rare-earth ions, and some color centers. Focusing on the example of an (In)GaAs QD, we offer a procedure for pinpointing physically realistic parameter regimes that yield maximal entanglement between the central electron and surrounding nuclei. We further harness knowledge of naturally-occurring degeneracies and the tunability of the system to generate maximal entanglement between target subsets of spins when the QD electron is subject to dynamical decoupling. We also leverage the one-tangling power as an exact and immediate method for computing QD electron spin dephasing times with and without the application of spin echo sequences, and use our analysis to identify coherence-sustaining conditions within the system.

Title: Frozen Gaussian sampling algorithms for simulating Markovian open quantum systems in the semiclassical regime
Authors: Limin Xu, Zhen Huang, Zhennan Zhou
Abstract: Simulating Markovian open quantum systems in the semiclassical regime poses a grand challenge for computational physics, as the highly oscillatory nature of the dynamics imposes prohibitive resolution requirements on traditional grid-based methods. To overcome this barrier, this paper introduces an efficient Frozen Gaussian Sampling (FGS) algorithm based on the Wigner-Fokker-Planck phase-space formulation. The proposed algorithm exhibits two transformative advantages. First, for the computation of physical observables, its sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter $\varepsilon$, thus fundamentally breaking the prohibitive computational scaling faced by grid methods in the semiclassical limit. Second, its mesh-free nature entirely eliminates the boundary-induced instabilities that constrain long-time grid-based simulations. Leveraging these capabilities, the FGS algorithm serves as a powerful investigatory tool for exploring the long-time behavior of open quantum systems. Specifically, we provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of steady states in strongly non-harmonic potentials-a regime where rigorous analytical results are currently lacking.

Title: Integrability Breaking and Coherent Dynamics in Hermitian and Non-Hermitian Spin Chains with Long-Range Coupling
Authors: Y. S. Liu, X. Z. Zhang
Abstract: Unraveling the mechanisms of ergodicity breaking in complex quantum systems is a central pursuit in nonequilibrium physics. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems.

Title: Group Theory and Representation Theory for Identical Particles
Authors: James Daniel Whitfield
Abstract: Few, if any, applications of quantum technology are as widely known as the quantum simulation of quantum matter. Consequently, many interesting questions have been sparked at the intersection of condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing. Given the common mathematical foundation of these subjects, we walk through the necessary group theory and representation theory serving as background in all of these fields. Our discussion will include a full development of the mathematics of identical particles and the mechanics of describing systems of identical particles in both first and second quantization schemes. This chapter is an offshoot of a larger work that provides a graduate-level introduction to quantum information science. This chapter is being released separately because it is not explicitly focused on quantum information. It has grown beyond a short digression into a full-fledged journey into the symmetries and representations of identical particles that we invite you, the reader, to join.

Title: QBism, Polishing Some Points
Authors: Christopher A. Fuchs, Blake C. Stacey
Abstract: QBism pursues the real by first eliminating the elements of quantum theory too fragile to be ontologies on their own. Thereafter, it seeks an "ontological lesson" from whatever remains. Here, we explore this program by highlighting three tenets of QBism. First, the Born Rule is a normative statement. It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should strive for, not a descriptive "law of nature." Second, all probabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they never tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum states thus have no "ontic hold" on the world, which implies a more radical kind of indeterminism in quantum theory than other interpretations understand. Third, quantum measurement outcomes just are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Thus all quantum measurement outcomes are local in the sense of the agent enacting them. Through these tenets, we explain four points better than previously: 1) how QBism contrasts with Bohr's concern over unambiguous language, 2) how QBism contrasts with the Everett interpretation, 3) how QBism understands the meaning of Bell inequality violations, and 4) how QBism responds to Wigner's "suspended animation" argument. Finally, we consider the ontological lesson of the tenets and ask what it might mean for the next one hundred years of quantum theory and humankind more generally.

Title: Quantum Fisher Information Measure in a Strongly Confined Harmonic Paul Trap Lattice System
Authors: Precious Ogbonda Amadi, Paphon Pewkhom, Pruet Kalasuwan, Norshamsuri Ali, Syed Alwee Aljunid, Rosdisham Endut
Abstract: In this work, we examine how the informational and structural properties of a single ion respond to controlled changes of the effective potential in a Paul trap modified by an optical lattice. We consider the ground state of the system where confinement is strongest. And by treating the trap frequency $\omega$ and lattice $\kappa$ as independent tunning parameters, we show that Fisher information, Shannon entropy, and Fisher-Shannon complexity track the curvature of the effective potential $\omega_{\mathrm{eff}}=\omega^2\,\sqrt{1-\kappa}$. The $\omega$ and $\kappa$ sweeps confirm that curvature and not the choice of control parameter determines the behaviour of the system. This gives the trapped-ion platform a clear advantage that the curvature can be engineered without altering the harmonic characteristics of the system. The interplay between $\omega$ and $\kappa$ thus provides a practical route for precision quantum control and offers Information-theoretic framework for experiments that probe confinement, quantization scale, and information flow in engineered ion traps.

Title: High-Order Harmonic Generation with Beyond-Semiclassical Emitter Dynamics: A Strong-Field Quantum Optical Heisenberg Picture Approach
Authors: Christian Saugbjerg Lange, Ella Elisabeth Lassen, Rasmus Vesterager Gothelf, Lars Bojer Madsen
Abstract: Quantum-optical descriptions of strong-field processes have attracted significant attention in recent years. Typically, the theoretical modeling has been conducted in the Schrödinger picture, where results are only obtainable under certain approximations, while, in contrast, the Heisenberg picture has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we develop an accurately controlled perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture and derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to the emitter dynamics due to the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field, capturing effects of the quantum fluctuations present in the latter. We focus on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), where the approach is accurate in parameter regimes of current interest and it gives closed-form expressions for key observables. This formulation not only simplifies numerical calculations compared to the Schrödinger-picture approach but also provides a clear correspondence between nonclassical features of the emitted light and the underlying induced dynamics of the generating medium including quantum fluctuations. Moreover, the Heisenberg framework naturally yields scaling relations with the number of independent emitters, enabling us to assess whether nonclassical behavior should persist under typical experimental conditions involving large emitter ensembles. Interestingly, we find that the degree of squeezing increases with the number of emitters, whereas the photon statistics approaches a classical Poissonian distribution in the many-emitter limit. We also find that the beyond-semiclassical emitter dynamics significantly enhances the degree of squeezing of the emitted light. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum-optical HHG and introduces an accessible and well-controlled framework to describe realistic experiments.

Title: Towards Explainable Quantum AI: Informing the Encoder Selection of Quantum Neural Networks via Visualization
Authors: Shaolun Ruan, Feng Liang, Rohan Ramakrishna, Chao Ren, Rudai Yan, Qiang Guan, Jiannan Li, Yong Wang
Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) represent a promising fusion of quantum computing and neural network architectures, offering speed-ups and efficient processing of high-dimensional, entangled data. A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders.

Title: Discrete time crystals enabled by Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation
Authors: Ling-Zhi Tang, Xiao Li, Z. D. Wang, Dan-Wei Zhang
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases of matter that break the discrete time-translation symmetry and is characterized by a robust subharmonic response in periodically driven quantum systems. Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $\pi$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning for Climate Modelling
Authors: Mierk Schwabe, Lorenzo Pastori, Valentina Sarandrea, Veronika Eyring
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is making rapid progress, and QML-based models hold the promise of quantum advantages such as potentially higher expressivity and generalizability than their classical counterparts. Here, we present work on using a quantum neural net (QNN) to develop a parameterization of cloud cover for an Earth system model (ESM). ESMs are needed for predicting and projecting climate change, and can be improved in hybrid models incorporating both traditional physics-based components as well as machine learning (ML) models. We show that a QNN can predict cloud cover with a performance similar to a classical NN with the same number of free parameters and significantly better than the traditional scheme. We also analyse the learning capability of the QNN in comparison to the classical NN and show that, at least for our example, QNNs learn more consistent relationships than classical NNs.

Title: Information-efficient decoding of surface codes
Authors: Long D.H. My, Shao-Hen Chiew, Jing Hao Chai, Hui Khoon Ng
Abstract: Surface codes are a popular error-correction route to fault-tolerant quantum computation. The so-called exponential backlog problem that can arise when one has to do logical $T$-gates within the surface code demands real-time decoding of the syndrome information to diagnose the appropriate Pauli frame in which to do the gate. This in turn puts a minimum requirement on the communication rate between the quantum processing unit, where the syndrome information is collected, and the classical processor, where the decoding algorithm is run. This minimum communication rate can be difficult to achieve while preserving the quality of the quantum processor. Here, we present two decoders that make use of a reduced syndrome information volume, relying on a number of syndrome bits that scale only as the width -- and not the usual area -- of the surface-code patch. This eases the communication requirements necessary for real-time decoding.

Title: Engineering Anisotropic Rabi Model in Circuit QED
Authors: S. Mojtaba Tabatabaei, Babak Zare Rameshti, Mohsen Akbari
Abstract: The anisotropic Rabi model (ARM), which features tunable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) and anti-Jaynes-Cummings (AJC) interactions, has remained challenging to realize fully. We present a circuit QED implementation that provides static control over the ARM parameters. By simultaneously coupling a qubit to a resonator's voltage and current antinodes, we geometrically tune the interaction from pure JC to pure AJC. This control enables novel quantum measurement capabilities, including dispersive shift cancellation and Purcell-suppressed readout. Our work establishes a direct platform for exploring the ARM's full parameter space and its applications in quantum information processing.

Title: General Quantum Instruction for Communication via Maximally Entangled $n$-Qubit States
Authors: Saba Arife Bozpolat
Abstract: This study presents a generalized $n$-bit superdense coding protocol that enables the transmission of n classical bits of information using an entangled n--qubit quantum system and the transmission of $n-1$ qubits. The protocol involves creating a maximally entangled n--qubit state, encoding the classical message with Pauli--Z and Pauli--X gates, and then transmitting and decoding the message via quantum communication, quantum operations, and measurements. The key novelty of this work lies in the proposed n--bit encoding routine, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first explicit and scalable recipe for constructing quantum circuits for n--bit Superdense Coding, minimizing errors through a simple circuit design. The protocol was tested on real quantum hardware using Qiskit 2.0 and the IBM--Torino quantum computer for message lengths of 4, 6, 8, and 10 bits. Results show that success rates decrease as message length, circuit depth, and gate count increase, largely due to increased Pauli--X gate usage for messages with more ``1" bits. Strategies to improve performance include sending messages in shorter segments and advances in qubit coherence and gate fidelity. This work offers a practical and easily scalable quantum communication instruction with potential applications in quantum networks and communication systems.

Title: Universal Structure of Nonlocal Operators for Deterministic Navigation and Geometric Locking
Authors: Jia Bao, Bin Guo, Shu Qu, Fanqin Xu, Zhaoyu Sun
Abstract: We establish a universal geometric framework that transforms the search for optimal nonlocal operators from a combinatorial black box into a deterministic predict-verify operation. We discover that the principal eigenvalue governing nonlocality is rigorously dictated by a low-dimensional manifold parameterized by merely two fundamental angular variables, $\theta$ and $\phi$, whose symmetry leads to further simplification. This geometric distillation establishes a precise mapping connecting external control parameters directly to optimal measurement configurations. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the geometric angles against the principal eigenvalue spectrum, including its magnitude, susceptibility, and nonlocal gap, reveals a fundamental dichotomy in quantum criticality. While transitions involving symmetry sector rotation manifest as geometric criticality with drastic operator reorientation, transitions dominated by strong anisotropy exhibit geometric locking, where the optimal basis remains robust despite clear signatures of phase transitions in the spectral indicators. This distinction offers a novel structural classification of quantum phase transitions and provides a precision navigation chart for Bell experiments.

Title: Steering Alternative Realities through Local Quantum Memory Operations
Authors: Xiongfeng Ma
Abstract: Quantum measurement resolves a superposition into a definite outcome by correlating it with an observer's memory -- a reality register. While the global quantum state remains coherent, the observer's local reality becomes singular and definite. This work introduces reality steering, a protocol that allows an observer to probabilistically access a different reality already supported by the initial quantum state, without reversing decoherence on the environment. The mechanism relies on locally erasing the 'which-outcome' information stored in the observer's brain. Here, 'local' means operations confined to the observer's memory, excluding the environment, which may be cosmically large. Reality steering nevertheless faces intrinsic constraints: successful navigation requires coherent participation from the observer's counterparts across the relevant branches, and any transition is operationally indistinguishable from non-transition. After arriving in a new reality, all memory records are perfectly consistent with that reality, leaving no internal evidence that a switch occurred. This makes conscious confirmation impossible within standard quantum mechanics. We show that nonlinear operations beyond the standard theory could, in principle, enable verifiable and deliberate navigation. Our results shift multi-reality exploration from philosophical speculation toward a concrete -- though fundamentally constrained -- quantum-informational framework.

Title: Geometric quantum thermodynamics: A fibre bundle approach
Authors: T. Pernambuco, L. C. Céleri
Abstract: Classical thermodynamics is a theory based on coarse-graining, meaning that the thermodynamic variables arise from discarding information related to the microscopic features of the system at hand. In quantum mechanics, however, where one has a high degree of control over microscopic systems, information theory plays an important role in describing the thermal properties of quantum systems. Recently, a new approach has been proposed in the form of a quantum thermodynamic gauge theory, where the notion of redundant information arises from a group of physically motivated gauge transformations called the thermodynamic group. In this work, we explore the geometrical structure of quantum thermodynamics. Particularly, we do so by explicitly constructing the relevant principal fibre bundle. We then show that there are two distinct (albeit related) geometric structures associated with the gauge theory of quantum thermodynamics. In this way, we express thermodynamics in the same mathematical (geometric) language as the fundamental theories of physics. Finally, we discuss how the geometric and topological properties of these structures may help explain fundamental properties of thermodynamics.

Title: Ground State Energy via Adiabatic Evolution and Phase Measurement for a Molecular Hamiltonian on an Ion-Trap Quantum Computer
Authors: Ludwig Nützel, Michael J. Hartmann, Henrik Dreyer, Etienne Granet
Abstract: Estimating molecular ground-state energies is a central application of quantum computing, requiring both the preparation of accurate quantum states and efficient energy readout. Understanding the effect of hardware noise on these experiments is crucial to distinguish errors that have low impact, errors that can be mitigated, and errors that must be reduced at the hardware level. We ran a state preparation and energy measurement protocol on an ion-trap quantum computer, without any non-scalable off-loading of computational tasks to classical computers, and show that leakage errors are the main obstacle to chemical accuracy. More specifically, we apply adiabatic state preparation to prepare the ground state of a six-qubit encoding of the H3+ molecule and extract its energy using a noise-resilient variant of iterative quantum phase estimation. Our results improve upon the classical Hartree-Fock energy. Analyzing the effect of hardware noise on the result, we find that while coherent and incoherent noise have little influence, the hardware results are mainly impacted by leakage errors. Absent leakage errors, noisy numerical simulations show that with our experimental settings we would have achieved close to chemical accuracy, even shot noise included. These insights highlight the importance of targeting leakage suppression in future algorithm and hardware development.

Title: Adiabatic-Inspired Hybrid Quantum-Classical Methods for Molecular Ground State Preparation
Authors: Sean Thrasher, Ioannis Kolotouros, Julien Michel, Petros Wallden
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to efficiently and accurately solve many important problems in quantum chemistry which elude classical solvers, such as the electronic structure problem of highly correlated materials. Two leading methods in solving the ground state problem are the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) algorithms. VQE often struggles with convergence due to the energy landscape being highly non-convex and the existence of barren plateaux, and implementing AQC is beyond the capabilities of current quantum devices as it requires deep circuits. Adiabatically-inspired algorithms aim to fill this gap. In this paper, we first present a unifying framework for these algorithms and then benchmark the following methods: the Adiabatically Assisted VQE (AAVQE) (Garcia-Saez and Latorre (2018)), the Variational Adiabatic Quantum Computing (VAQC) (Harwood et al (2022)), and the Adiabatic Quantum Computing with Parametrized Quantum Circuits (AQC-PQC) (Kolotouros et al (2025)) algorithms. Second, we introduce a novel hybrid approach termed G-AQC-PQC, which generalizes the AQC-PQC method, and combines adiabatic-inspired initialization with the low-memory BFGS optimizer, reducing the quantum computational cost of the method. Third, we compare the accuracy of the methods for chemistry applications using the beryllium hydride molecule (BeH$_2$). We compare the approaches across a number of different choices (ansätze types, depth, discretization steps, initial Hamiltonian, adiabatic schedules and method used). Our results show that the G-AQC-PQC outperforms conventional VQE. We further discuss limitations such as the zero-gradient problem and identify regimes where adiabatically-inspired methods offer a tangible advantage for near-term quantum chemistry applications.

Title: Super-Heisenberg-limited Sensing via Collective Subradiance in Waveguide QED
Authors: Xin Wang, Zeyang Liao
Abstract: We explore the quantum-metrological potential of subwavelength-spaced emitter arrays coupled to a one-dimensional nanophotonic waveguide. In this system, strong dipole--dipole interactions profoundly modify the collective optical response, leading to the emergence of ultranarrow subradiant resonances. Through an eigenmode analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive a universal scaling law for the decay rate of the most subradiant state, which exhibits an $ N^{-3} $ scaling with even-odd oscillatory behavior in the deep-subwavelength regime. This scaling is directly observable in the single-photon scattering spectrum, enabling the detection of minute changes in atomic separation with a figure of merit that scales as $ N^3 $. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) scales as $N^6$ and can be closely approached by measuring spectral shifts near the steepest slope of the most subradiant resonance. These enhancements remain robust under realistic positional disorder, confirming that dipole--dipole-engineered subradiance provides a viable resource for quantum metrology. Our work bridges many-body waveguide quantum electrodynamics and high-precision sensing, opening a route toward scalable quantum sensors on integrated nanophotonic platforms.

Title: Nonlocal contributions to ergotropy: A thermodynamic perspective
Authors: B. Vigneshwar, R. Sankaranarayanan
Abstract: Nonlocality is a defining feature of quantum mechanics and has long served as a key indicator of quantum resources since the formulation of Bell's inequalities. Identifying the contribution of nonlocality to extractable work remains a central problem in quantum thermodynamics. We address this by introducing a quantifier of nonlocal contributions to extractable work in bipartite systems. It is shown that closed form expressions can be calculated for our quantity in terms of the Schmidt coefficients. Further for strictly non-interacting Hamiltonian, the direct relationship between ergotropy and correlations is established. Our results reveal that nonlocal resources invariably enhance extractable work under non-interacting Hamiltonians, while in the presence of interactions, their contribution can either increase or diminish depending on the structure of the state and the Hamiltonian.

Title: Large circuit execution for NMR spectroscopy simulation on NISQ quantum hardware
Authors: Artemiy Burov, Julien Baglio, Clément Javerzac-Galy
Abstract: With the latest advances in quantum computing technology, we are gradually moving from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era characterized by hardware limited in the number of qubits and plagued with quantum noise, to the age of quantum utility where both the newest hardware and software methods allow for tackling problems which have been deemed difficult or intractable with conventional classical methods. One of these difficult problems is the simulation of one-dimensional (1D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, a major tool to learn about the structure of molecules, helping the design of new materials or drugs. Using advanced error mitigation and error suppression techniques from Q-CTRL together with the latest commercially available superconducting-qubit quantum computer from IBM and trapped-ion quantum computer from IonQ, we present the quantum Hamiltonian simulation of liquid-state 1D NMR spectra in the high-field regime for spin systems up to 34 spins. Our pipeline has a major impact on the ability to execute deep quantum circuits with the reduction of quantum noise, improving mean square error by a factor of 22. It allows for the execution of deep quantum circuits and obtaining salient features of the 1D NMR spectra for both 16-spin and 22-spin systems, as well as a 34-spin system, which lies beyond the regime where unrestricted full Liouvillespace simulations are practical (32 spins, the Liouville limit). Our work is a step toward near-term quantum utility in NMR spectroscopy.

Title: Finite-Time Protocols Stabilize Charging in Noisy Ising Quantum Batteries
Authors: Riccardo Grazi, Henrik Johannesson, Dario Ferraro, Niccolò Traverso Ziani
Abstract: Reliable charging protocols are crucial for advancing quantum batteries toward practical use. We investigate a transverse-field Ising chain as a quantum battery, focusing on the combined role of qubit interactions in the battery model and finite charging time. This interplay yields smoother and more controllable charging compared to sudden protocols or non-interacting batteries. Introducing stochastic noise reveals a strong dependence on the charging trajectory. Protocols that weakly excite the system gain energy under noise but lose extractable work. In contrast, protocols that strongly excite many modes show the opposite trend: noise reduces stored energy yet improves efficiency, defined as the ratio of ergotropy to stored energy. These findings demonstrate that finite-time ramps stabilize charging and highlight that noise can either hinder or enhance quantum-battery performance depending on the protocol.

Title: Continuous Accumulation of Cold Atoms in an Optical Cavity
Authors: Edward Gheorghita, Sebastian Wald, Andrea Pupić, Onur Hosten
Abstract: Continuously operating atom-light interfaces represent a key prerequisite for steady-state quantum sensors and efficient quantum processors. Here, we demonstrate continuous accumulation of sub-Doppler-cooled atoms in a shallow intracavity dipole trap, realizing this regime. The key ingredient is a light-shift manipulation that creates spatially varying cooling parameters, enabling efficient capture and accumulation of atoms within a cavity mode. Demonstrated with rubidium atoms, a continuous flux from a source cell is funneled through the magneto-optical trap into the cavity mode, where the atoms are cooled and maintained below $10~\mu\text{K}$ in steady state without time-sequenced operation. We characterize the resulting continuously maintained ensemble of millions of atoms and its collective coupling to the cavity field, establishing a route toward continuously operated cavity-QED systems and long-duration atomic and hybrid quantum sensors.

Title: A Graph-Based Forensic Framework for Inferring Hardware Noise of Cloud Quantum Backend
Authors: Subrata Das, Archisman Ghosh, Swaroop Ghosh
Abstract: Cloud quantum platforms give users access to many backends with different qubit technologies, coupling layouts, and noise levels. The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Adaptive Constraints for Multi-Qubit Quantum Tomography
Authors: Changchun Feng, Laifa Tao, Lin Chen
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) faces exponential measurement requirements and noise sensitivity in multi-qubit systems, bottlenecking practical quantum technologies. We present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework integrating quantum mechanical constraints via adaptive weighting, a residual-and-attention-enhanced architecture, and differentiable Cholesky parameterization for physical validity. Evaluations on 2--5 qubit systems and arbitrary-dimensional states show PINN consistently outperforms traditional neural networks (TNNs), achieving highest fidelity across all dimensions. PINN outperforms baselines, with marked improvements in moderately high-dimensional systems, superior noise robustness (slower performance degradation), and consistent dimensional robustness. Theoretical analysis shows physical constraints reduce Rademacher complexity and mitigate the curse of dimensionality via constraint-induced dimension and sample complexity reduction, effective regardless of qubit number. While experiments are limited to 5-qubit systems due to computational constraints, our theoretical framework (convergence guarantees, generalization bounds, scalability theorems) justifies PINN's advantages will persist and strengthen in larger systems (6+ qubits), where constraint-induced dimension reduction benefits grow with system size. Practically, this advances quantum error correction and gate calibration by reducing measurement requirements from O(4^n) to O(2^n) while maintaining high fidelity, enabling faster error correction cycles and accelerated calibration critical for scalable quantum computing.

Title: Fair sampling of ground-state configurations using hybrid quantum-classical MCMC algorithms
Authors: Yuichiro Nakano, Keisuke Fujii
Abstract: We study the fair sampling properties of hybrid quantum-classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems with degenerate ground states. While quantum optimization heuristics such as quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are known to induce biased sampling, hybrid quantum-classical MCMC incorporates quantum dynamics only as a proposal transition and enforces detailed balance through classical acceptance steps. Using small Ising models, we show that MCMC post-processing corrects the sampling bias of quantum dynamics and restores near-uniform sampling over degenerate ground states. We then apply the method to random $k$-SAT problems near the satisfiability threshold. For random 2-SAT, a hybrid MCMC combining QAOA-assisted neural proposals with single spin-flip updates achieves fairness comparable to that of PT-ICM. For random 3-SAT, where such classical methods are no longer applicable, the hybrid MCMC still attains approximately uniform sampling. We also examine solution counting and find that the required number of transitions is comparable to that of WalkSAT. These results indicate that hybrid quantum-classical MCMC provides a viable framework for fair sampling and solution enumeration.

Title: Entanglement measure for the W-class states
Authors: Reza Hamzehofi
Abstract: The structure and quantification of entanglement in the W-class states are investigated under physically motivated transformations that induce mixed-state dynamics. A rigorous condition is established linking global separability to the behavior of pairwise entanglement, showing that the absence of pairwise entanglement is sufficient to guarantee complete separability of the system, provided the Hilbert-space basis is preserved. This result motivates the identification of the sum of two-tangles as a natural and effective entanglement quantifier for the W-class states. Furthermore, the commonly used $\pi$-tangle becomes ineffective for the maximally entangled $n$-qubit W state as the system size increases, vanishing in the large-$n$ limit. To address this limitation, the sum of $\pi$-tangles is introduced, which, like the sum of two-tangles, successfully quantifies the entanglement of the maximally entangled $n$-qubit W state in the large-$n$ limit. In addition, a new condition for entanglement measures is introduced, which facilitates the formulation of a well-behaved and physically meaningful entanglement measure.

Title: Exploiting Reset Operations in Cloud-based Quantum Computers to Run Quantum Circuits for Free
Authors: Jakub Szefer
Abstract: This work presents the first thorough exploration of how reset operations in cloud-based quantum computers could be exploited to run quantum circuits for free. This forms a new type of attack on the economics of cloud-based quantum computers. All major quantum computing companies today offer access to their hardware through some type of cloud-based service. Due to the noisy nature of quantum computers, a quantum circuit is run many times to collect the output statistics, and each run is called a shot. The fees users pay for access to the machines typically depend on the number of these shots of a quantum circuit that are executed. Per-shot pricing is a clean and straightforward approach as users are charged a small fee for each shot of their circuit. This work demonstrates that per-shot pricing can be exploited to get circuits to run for free when users abuse recently implemented mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset operations. Through evaluation on real, cloud-based quantum computers this work shows how multiple circuits can be executed together within a shot, by separating each user circuit by set of reset operations and submitting all the circuits, and reset operations, as one larger circuit. As a result, the user is charged per-shot pricing, even though inside each shot are multiple circuits. Total per-shot cost to run certain circuits could be reduced by up to $900$\% using methods proposed in this work, leading to significant financial losses to quantum computing companies. To address this novel finding, this work proposes a clear approach for how users should be charged for their execution, while maintaining the flexibility and usability of the mid-circuit measurement and reset~operations.

Title: Reading Qubits with Sequential Weak Measurements: Limits of Information Extraction
Authors: Cesar Lema, Aleix Bou-Comas, Atithi Acharya, Vadim Oganesyan, Anirvan Sengupta
Abstract: Quantum information processing and computation requires high accuracy qubit configuration readout. In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes.

Title: Sequential realization of Quantum Instruments
Authors: Soham Sau, Michal Sedlák
Abstract: In adaptive quantum circuits classical results of mid-circuit measurements determine the upcoming gates. This allows POVMs, quantum channels or more generally quantum instruments to be implemented sequentially, so that fewer qubits need to be used at each of the $N$ measurement steps. In this paper, we mathematically describe these problems via adaptive sequence of instruments (ASI) and show how any instrument can be decomposed into it. Number of steps $N$ and number of ancillary qubits $n_A$ needed for actual implementation are crucial parameters of any such ASI. We show an achievable lower bound on the product $N.n_A$ and we determine in which situations this tradeoff is likely to be optimal. Contrary to common intuition we show that for quantum instruments which transform $n$ to $m(>n)$ qubits, there exist $N$-step ASI implementing them just with $(m-n)$ ancillary qubits, which are remeasured $(N-1)$ times and finally used as output qubits.

Title: Improved Lower Bounds for QAC0
Authors: Malvika Raj Joshi, Avishay Tal, Francisca Vasconcelos, John Wright
Abstract: In this work, we establish the strongest known lower bounds against QAC$^0$, while allowing its full power of polynomially many ancillae and gates. Our two main results show that: (1) Depth 3 QAC$^0$ circuits cannot compute PARITY regardless of size, and require at least $\Omega(\exp(\sqrt{n}))$ many gates to compute MAJORITY. (2) Depth 2 circuits cannot approximate high-influence Boolean functions (e.g., PARITY) with non-negligible advantage in depth $2$, regardless of size. We present new techniques for simulating certain QAC$^0$ circuits classically in AC$^0$ to obtain our depth $3$ lower bounds. In these results, we relax the output requirement of the quantum circuit to a single bit (i.e., no restrictions on input preservation/reversible computation), making our depth $2$ approximation bound stronger than the previous best bound of Rosenthal (2021). This also enables us to draw natural comparisons with classical AC$^0$ circuits, which can compute PARITY exactly in depth $2$ using exponential size. Our proof techniques further suggest that, for inherently classical decision problems, constant-depth quantum circuits do not necessarily provide more power than their classical counterparts. Our third result shows that depth $2$ QAC$^0$ circuits, regardless of size, cannot exactly synthesize an $n$-target nekomata state (a state whose synthesis is directly related to the computation of PARITY). This complements the depth $2$ exponential size upper bound of Rosenthal (2021) for approximating nekomatas (which is used as a sub-circuit in the only known constant depth PARITY upper bound).

Title: Testing electron-photon exchange-correlation functional performance for many-electron systems under weak and strong light-matter coupling
Authors: Iman Ahmadabadi, I-Te Lu, Leonardo A. Cunha, Michael Ruggenthaler, Johannes Flick, Angel Rubio
Abstract: We present results of a photon-free exchange-correlation functional within the local density approximation (pxcLDA) for quantum electrodynamics density functional theory (QEDFT) that efficiently describes the electron density of many-electron systems across weak to strong light-matter coupling. Building on previous work [I-Te. Lu et al., Phys. Rev. A 109, 052823 (2024)] that captured electron-photon correlations via an exchange-correlation functional derived from the nonrelativistic Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and tested on one-electron systems, we use a simple procedure to compute a renormalization factor describing electron-photon correlations and inhomogeneity in the weak-coupling regime by comparing it with quantum electrodynamics coupled-cluster, and previous QEDFT optimized effective potential methods. Across various atoms and molecules, pxcLDA reproduces cavity-modified densities in close agreement with these references. The renormalization factor approaches unity as the system size or collective coupling increases, reflecting an electron-photon exchange-dominated behavior and improved accuracy for larger systems. This approach now offers a practical route to applying QEDFT functionals based on electron density to realistic electron systems.

Title: Interferometric probe for the zeros of the many-body wavefunction
Authors: Wayne J. Chetcuti, Anna Minguzzi, Juan Polo, Luigi Amico
Abstract: The nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction are fundamental geometric features that encode critical information regarding particle statistics and their interaction. Directly probing these structures, particularly in correlated quantum systems, remains a significant experimental challenge. Here, we provide rigorous results on the structure of the many-body wavefunction and propose to use an interferometric technique to probe its zeros in ultra-cold atomic systems. Specifically, we refer to the so-called heterodyne interferometric reconstruction of the phase of the many-body wavefunction. We prove that the sought nodal surfaces show up as specific discontinuities in the interference fringes. Following Leggett, both `symmetry-dictated' nodal surfaces, due to particle statistics, and `non-symmetry dictated' nodal surfaces emerging from interaction effects, can be probed. We demonstrate how the spin degrees of freedom, effectively modifying the structure of the nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction, leave distinct fingerprints in the resulting interference pattern. Our work addresses important features of the structure of the many-body wavefunction that are broadly relevant for quantum science ranging from conceptual aspects to computational questions of extended systems and quantum simulation.

Title: Non-hermitian Density Matrices from Time-like Entanglement and Wormholes
Authors: Jonathan Harper, Taishi Kawamoto, Ryota Maeda, Nanami Nakamura, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.

Title: Algorithmic aspects of gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states
Authors: Itay Gomelski, Jonathan Elyovich, Ariel Kelman, Erez Zohar, Patrick Emonts
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying non-perturbative phenomena in gauge theories. However, conventional approaches such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in imaginary time are limited, as they do not allow real time evolution and suffer from a sign problem in many important cases. Using Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) as a variational ground state ansatz offers an alternative for studying LGTs through a sign-problem-free variational MC. As this method is extended to larger and more complex systems, understanding its numerical behavior becomes essential. While conventional action based MC has been extensively studied, the performance and characteristics of non-action-based MC within the GGFPEPS framework are far less explored. In this work, we investigate these algorithmic aspects, identifying an optimal update size for GGFPEPS-based MC simulations for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in $2+1$ dimensions. We show that gauge fixing generally slows convergence, and demonstrate that not exploiting the translation-invariance can, in some cases, improve the computational time scaling of error convergence. We expect that these improvements will allow advancing the simulation to larger and more complex systems.

Title: Quasiparticle projection method for dynamically unstable Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Asier Izquierdo, Maria Arazo, Sofía Martínez-Garaot, Michele Modugno
Abstract: We present a general formalism for performing a time-dependent Bogoliubov analysis of a dynamically unstable Bose-Einstein condensate, which extends the quasiparticle projection method of Morgan et al. [Phys. Rev. A 57, 3818 (1998)] to cases with a complex spectrum. By introducing the proper left eigenvectors associated with each regime, we construct a biorthogonal basis. While the usual Bogoliubov normalization $\langle u | u \rangle - \langle v | v \rangle = 1$ may not hold in this basis, it still allows for a complete mode decomposition and an accurate reconstruction of arbitrary perturbations over time. This approach extends the applicability of the Bogoliubov framework beyond the stable regime, providing a consistent analysis of the time evolution of unstable condensates. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to a one-dimensional condensate with attractive interactions, which is dynamically unstable and evolves into nonstationary localized structures seeded by small perturbations.

Title: Quantum fields in a cold atomic simulator: relaxation and phase locking in tunnel-coupled 1D bosonic quasi-condensates
Authors: B. Fitos, G. Takács
Abstract: We consider a prime example of simulating interacting relativistic QFT with cold atoms: the realisation of the sine-Gordon model by tunnel-coupled quasi-1D Bose gases. While experiments have shown that it can realise the sine-Gordon model in equilibrium, studies of non-equilibrium dynamics have revealed a phase-locking behaviour that stands in contrast to predictions from sine-Gordon field theory. Here, we examine a one-dimensional field-theoretic model of the system and find that the phase-locking behaviour can be understood in terms of the presence of the longitudinal harmonic trap, and that the additional degrees of freedom known to be present in the experiment do not appear to play a significant role. Therefore, the experimental setup provides a good simulator of the sine-Gordon quantum field theory, even out of equilibrium, if the inhomogeneous background induced by the trap is taken into account. Furthermore, our results support the idea that modifying the longitudinal trap to a box shape should result in agreement with standard sine-Gordon dynamics. The main remaining open issues are to account for 3D corrections and model the effect of the boundaries.

Title: Capturing reduced-order quantum many-body dynamics out of equilibrium via neural ordinary differential equations
Authors: Patrick Egenlauf, Iva Březinová, Sabine Andergassen, Miriam Klopotek
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems exhibit rapid correlation buildup that underlies many emerging phenomena. Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.

Title: A sine-square deformation approach to quantum critical points in one-dimensional systems
Authors: Yuki Miyazaki, Shiori Tanigawa, Giacomo Marmorini, Nobuo Furukawa, Daisuke Yamamoto
Abstract: We propose a method to determine the quantum phase boundaries of one-dimensional systems using sine-square deformation (SSD). Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that ``if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit," we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes.

Title: Quantum-Inspired Approach to Analyzing Complex System Dynamics
Authors: Parsa Kafashi, Mozhgan Orujlu
Abstract: We present a quantum information-inspired framework for analyzing complex systems through multivariate time series. In this approach the system's state is encoded into a density matrix, providing a compact representation of higher-order correlations and dependencies. This formulation enables precise quantification of the relative influence among time series, tracking of their response to external perturbations and also the definition of a recovery timescale without need for dimensional reduction. By leveraging tools such as fidelity from quantum information theory, our method naturally captures higher-order co-fluctuations beyond pairwise statistics, offering a holistic characterization of resilience and similarity in high-dimensional dynamics. We validate this approach on synthetic data generated by a 9-dimensional modified Lorenz-96 model and demonstrate its utility on real-world climate data, analyzing global temperature anomalies across nine regions, quantifying the dissimilarity of each 288-month time window up to July 2025 relative to the 1850-1874 baseline period.

Title: Acoustic horizons and the Hawking effect in polariton fluids of light
Authors: Elisabeth Giacobino, Maxime J. Jacquet
Abstract: These lecture notes develop polariton fluids of light as programmable simulators of quantum fields on tailored curved spacetimes, with emphasis on acoustic horizons and the Hawking effect. After introducing exciton-polariton physics in semiconductor microcavities, we detail the theoretical tools to study the mean field and the quantum hydrodynamics of this driven-dissipative quantum system. We derive the mapping to relativistic field theories and cast horizon physics as a pseudounitary stationary scattering problem. We present the Gaussian optics circuit that describes observables and fixes detection weights for the horizon modes in near- and far-field measurements. We provide a practical experimental toolkit (phase-imprinted flows, coherent pump-probe spectroscopy, balanced and homodyne detection) and a step-by-step workflow to extract amplification, quadrature squeezing, and entanglement among correlations. Finally, we discuss the potential of this platform to investigate open questions in quantum field theory in curved spacetime, such as near horizon effects and quasinormal modes, as well as other phenomena universal to rotating geometries, from rotational superradiance to dynamical instabilities. We further outline the interplay between rotational superradiance and the Hawking effect, proposing to spatially resolve measurements as a roadmap for `dumb hole spectroscopy' and the study of entanglement dynamics in curved spacetimes.

Title: Cosmic Lockdown: When Decoherence Saves the Universe from Tunneling
Authors: Robson Christie, Jaewoo Joo, Greg Kaplanek, Vincent Vennin, David Wands
Abstract: We investigate how quantum decoherence influences the tunneling dynamics of quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes. Specifically, we study a scalar field in an asymmetric double well potential during inflation, coupled to environmental degrees of freedom provided either by heavy spectator fields or by short-wavelength modes as they cross out the Hubble scale. This setup enables a systematic derivation of both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations, along with their stochastic unravelings, which we solve numerically. We find that, while decoherence is essential for suppressing quantum interference between vacua, its impact on the relative vacuum populations is limited. Fields heavier than the Hubble scale relax adiabatically toward the true vacuum with high probability, while lighter fields exhibit non-adiabatic enhancements of false-vacuum occupation. Once the system has decohered, quantum tunneling between vacua becomes strongly suppressed, effectively locking the system into the stochastically selected local minimum. This ``cosmic lockdown'' mechanism is a manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect: environmental monitoring stabilizes enhanced false-vacuum occupation for light fields by preventing them from tunneling.

Title: Analogue gravity with Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Adrià Delhom, Luca Giacomelli
Abstract: Analogue gravity explores how collective excitations in condensed matter systems can reproduce the behavior of fields in curved spacetimes. An important example is the acoustic black holes that can occur for sound in a moving fluid. In these lecture notes, we focus on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), quantum fluids that provide an interesting platform for analogue gravity studies thanks to their accurate theoretical description, remarkable experimental control, and ultralow temperatures that allow the quantum nature of sound to emerge. We give a pedagogical introduction to analogue black holes and the theoretical description of BECs and their elementary excitations, which behave as quantum fields in curved spacetimes. We then apply these tools to survey the current understanding of black-hole superradiance and analogue Hawking radiation, including explicit examples and numerical methods.

Title: Dipolar quantum gases: from 3D to Low dimensions
Authors: Yifei He, Haoting Zhen, Gyu-Boong Jo
Abstract: Dipolar quantum gases, encompassing atoms and molecules with significant dipole moments, exhibit unique long-range and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions (DDI), distinguishing them from systems dominated by short-range contact interactions. This review explores their behavior across dimensions, focusing on magnetic atoms in quasi-2D in comparison to 3D. In 3D, strong DDI leads to phenomena like anisotropic superfluidity, quantum droplets stabilized by Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, and supersolid states with density modulations. In 2D, we discuss a new scenario where DDI induces angle-dependent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions and potential supersolidity, as suggested by recent experimental realizations of strongly dipolar systems in quasi-2D geometries. We identify key challenges for future experimental and theoretical work on strongly dipolar 2D systems. The review concludes by highlighting how these unique 2D dipolar systems could advance fundamental research as well as simulate novel physical phenomena.

Title: Another 100 Years of Quantum Interpretation?
Authors: Karen Crowther
Abstract: Interpretation is not the only way to explain a theory's success, form and features, and nor is it the only way to solve problems we see with a theory. This can also be done by giving a reductive explanation of the theory, by reference to a newer, more accurate, and/or more fundamental theory. We are seeking a theory of quantum gravity, a more fundamental theory than both quantum mechanics and general relativity, yet, while this theory is supposed to explain general relativity, it's not typically been thought to be necessary, or able, to explain quantum mechanics -- a task instead assigned to interpretation. Here, I question why this is. I also present a new way of assessing the various interpretations of quantum mechanics, in terms of their heuristic and unificatory potential in helping us find a more fundamental theory.

Title: Hybrid acousto-optical spin control in quantum dots
Authors: Mateusz Kuniej, Paweł Machnikowski, Michał Gawełczyk
Abstract: Mechanical degrees of freedom very weakly couple to spins in semiconductors. The inefficient coupling between phonons and single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) hinders their integration into on-chip acoustically coupled quantum hybrid systems. We propose a hybrid acousto-optical spin control method that circumvents this problem and effectively introduces acoustic spin rotation to QDs, complementing their rich couplings with external fields and quantum registers. We show that combining continuous-wave detuned optical coupling to a trion state and acoustic modulation results in spin rotation around an axis defined by the acoustic field. The optical field breaks spin conservation, allowing phonons to drive transitions between disrupted spin states when at resonance with the Zeeman frequency. Our method is compatible with pulse sequences that mitigate quasi-static noise effects, which makes trion recombination the primary limitation to gate fidelity under cooled nuclear-spin conditions. Numerical simulations indicate that spin rotation fidelity can be very high, if the trion lifetime is long and Zeeman splitting is sufficiently large, with a currently feasible 50~ns lifetime and 44~GHz splitting giving 99.9\% fidelity. Applying our advancement could enable acoustic QD spin state transfer to diverse solid-state systems and transduction between acoustic, optical, and microwave domains, all within an on-chip integration-ready setting.

Title: A Compact Incubation Platform for Long-Term Cultivation of Biological Samples for Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Widefield Microscopy
Authors: A. Pointner, D. Thalheim, S. Belasi, L. Heinen, L. R. Carnell, C. Janko, R. Tietze, C. Alexiou, R. Schneider-Stock, R. Nagy
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide a versatile quantum sensing platform for biological imaging through magnetic field detection, offering unlimited photostability and the ability to perform long-term observations without photobleaching or phototoxicity. However, conventional stage-top incubators are incompatible with the unique requirements for NV widefield magnetometry to study cellular dynamics. Here, we present a purpose-built compact incubation platform that maintains precise environmental control of temperature, CO$_2$ atmosphere, and humidity while accommodating the complex constraints of NV widefield microscopy. The system employs a 3D-printed biocompatible chamber with integrated heating elements, temperature control, and humidified gas flow to create a stable physiological environment directly on the diamond sensing surface. We demonstrate sustained viability and proliferation of HT29 colorectal cancer cells over 90 hours of continuous incubation, with successful magnetic field imaging of immunomagnetically labeled cells after extended cultivation periods. This incubation platform enables long-term cultivation and real-time monitoring of biological samples on NV widefield magnetometry platforms, opening new possibilities for studying dynamic cellular processes using quantum sensing technologies.

Title: Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor junctions as thermoelectric bolometers
Authors: Leonardo Lucchesi, Federico Paolucci
Abstract: We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $\tau_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $\tau_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,\mu{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.

Title: Multimode Jahn-Teller Effect in Negatively Charged Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond
Authors: Jianhua Zhang, Jun Liu, Z. Z. Zhu, K. M. Ho, V. V. Dobrovitski, C. Z. Wang
Abstract: Multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in its excited state is studied by first-principles calculations based on density function theory (DFT). The activation pathways of the JT distortions are analyzed to elucidate and quantify the contribution of different vibrational modes. The results show that the dominant vibrational modes in the JT distortions are closely related to the phonon sideband observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), consistent with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation results. Our calculations provide a new way to understand the origin and the mechanism of the vibronic coupling of the system. The obtained dominant vibrational modes coupled to the NV centre and their interactions with electronic states provides new insights into dephasing, relaxation and optically driven quantum effects, and are critical for the application to quantum information, magnetometry and sensing.

Title: From few- to many-body physics: Strongly dipolar molecular Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum fluids
Authors: Andreas Schindewolf, Jens Hertkorn, Ian Stevenson, Matteo Ciardi, Phillip Gross, Dajun Wang, Tijs Karman, Goulven Quemener, Sebastian Will, Thomas Pohl, Tim Langen
Abstract: Recent advances in molecular cooling have enabled the realization of strongly dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of molecules, and BECs of many different molecular species may become experimentally accessible in the near future. Here, we explore the unique properties of such BECs and the new insights they may offer into dipolar quantum fluids and many-body physics. We explore which parameter regimes can realistically be achieved using currently available experimental techniques, discuss how to implement these techniques, and outline which molecular species are particularly well suited to explore exotic new states of matter. We further determine how state-of-the-art beyond mean-field theories, originally developed for weakly dipolar magnetic gases, can be pushed to their limits and beyond, and what other long-standing questions in the field of dipolar physics may realistically come within reach using molecular systems.

Title: Microwave control of photonic spin Hall effect in atomic system
Authors: Muhammad Waseem
Abstract: The photonic Spin Hall Effect (SHE) causes a polarization-dependent transverse shift of light at an interface. There is a significant research interest in controlling and enhancing the photonic SHE. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the microwave field control of the photonic SHE in a closed-loop $\Lambda$-type atomic system. We demonstrate that both the magnitude and angular position of the photonic SHE can be controlled by varying the relative phase $\phi$ between the driving optical fields and the strength of the microwave coupling $\Omega_{\mu}$. At zero probe field detuning ($\Delta_p = 0$) and $\phi=0,\pi$, the photonic SHE magnitude reaches to upper limit equal to the half of the incident beam waist, and remains largely unaffected by the microwave strength $\Omega_{\mu}$, but its angular position shifts linearly with increasing $\Omega_{\mu}$. At intermediate phases, especially at $\phi = \pi/2$, the magnitude of the photonic SHE exponentially decreases with the increase of $\Omega_{\mu}$. Interestingly, we observed microwave-controlled switching of photonic SHE by tuning the relative phase $\phi$ at an optimized value of $\Omega_{\mu}$ and $\Omega_{c}$. In contrast, at $\Delta_p = \pm \Omega_c$, a maximum photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist occurs at $\phi \leq \pi$ and $\Omega_{\mu} \geq \Omega_p$, where both real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility vanish, yielding a unit refractive index. Our results may have potential applications in microwave quantum sensing and quantum optical switches based on the photonic SHE.

Title: Simulation of quantum computation with magic states via Jordan-Wigner transformations
Authors: Michael Zurel, Lawrence Z. Cohen, Robert Raussendorf
Abstract: Negativity in certain quasiprobability representations is a necessary condition for a quantum computational advantage. Here we define a quasiprobability representation exhibiting this property with respect to quantum computations in the magic state model. It is based on generalized Jordan-Wigner transformations, and it has a close connection to the probability representation of universal quantum computation based on the $\Lambda$ polytopes. For each number of qubits, it defines a polytope contained in the $\Lambda$ polytope with some shared vertices. It leads to an efficient classical simulation algorithm for magic state quantum circuits for which the input state is positively represented, and it outperforms previous representations in terms of the states that can be positively represented.

Title: Multi-Objective Quantum Power System Redispatch
Authors: Loong Kuan Lee, Johannes Knaute, Florian Gerhardt, Patrick Völker, Tomislav Maras, Alexander Dotterweich, Nico Piatkowski
Abstract: The rising energy production costs and the increasing reliance on volatile renewable sources have driven the need for more efficient power system redispatch strategies. In this work, we re-interpret the redispatch problem as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization task within the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) framework, suitable for adiabatic quantum computing. Our contributions include a novel normalized unbalanced penalty method that integrates inequality constraints via a quadratic Taylor expansion and an alpha-expansion algorithm that allows us to address large-scale redispatch instances and to integrate temporal adjacent state switching constraints directly into the algorithm. Our experiments are conducted on open data of the German power system. Our results, obtained via numerical simulation and from an actual D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer, validate the viability of our formulation and demonstrate that our algorithm scales to large problem instances.

Title: QCircuitBench: A Large-Scale Dataset for Benchmarking Quantum Algorithm Design
Authors: Rui Yang, Ziruo Wang, Yuntian Gu, Tianyi Chen, Yitao Liang, Tongyang Li
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all, QCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm design, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.

Title: Semidefinite optimization of the quantum relative entropy of channels
Authors: Gereon Koßmann, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for calculating the quantum relative entropy of channels, an essential quantity in quantum channel discrimination and resource theories of quantum channels. By building on recent developments in the optimization of relative entropy for quantum states [Koßmann and Schwonnek, arXiv:2404.17016], we introduce a discretized linearization of the integral representation for the relative entropy of states, enabling us to handle maximization tasks for the relative entropy of channels. Our approach here extends previous work on minimizing relative entropy to the more complicated domain of maximization. It also provides efficiently computable upper and lower bounds that sandwich the true value with any desired precision, leading to a practical method for computing the relative entropy of channels.

Title: A decompositional framework for process theories in spacetime
Authors: Matthias Salzger, John H. Selby
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest within the field of quantum foundations regarding incorporating ideas from general relativity and quantum gravity. However, many quantum information tools remain agnostic to the underlying spacetime. For instance, whenever we draw a quantum circuit the effective spacetime imposed by the connectivity of the physical qubits which will realize this circuit is not taken into account. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by extending the framework of process theories to include a background spacetime structure. We introduce the notion of process implementations, i.e., decompositions of a process. A process is then embeddable if and only if one of its implementations can be embedded in such a way that all the component processes are localized and all wires follow timelike paths. While conceptually simple, checking for embeddability is generally computationally intractable. We therefore work towards simplifying this problem as much as possible, identifying a canonical subset of implementations that determine both the embeddability of a process and the causal structures distinguishable at least in some process theory. Notably, we discover countably infinite ''zigzag'' causal structures beyond those typically considered. While these can be ignored in classical theory, they seem to be essential in quantum theory, as the quantum CNOT gate can be implemented by all zigzag structures but not in a standard causal structure, except in the trivial undecomposed way. These zigzags could be significant for quantum causal modeling and the study of novel quantum resources.

Title: Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System
Authors: Harshit Sharma, Udaysinh T. Bhosale
Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N>12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.

Title: Exponential advantage in continuous-variable quantum state learning
Authors: Eugen Coroi, Changhun Oh
Abstract: We consider the task of learning quantum states in bosonic continuous-variable (CV) systems. We present an experimentally feasible protocol that uses entangled measurements and reflected states to efficiently learn, up to sign, the characteristic function of CV quantum states, with sample complexity independent of the number of modes $n$. We prove that any adaptive scheme without entangled measurements requires exponentially many samples in $n$ for this learning task, thereby demonstrating an exponential advantage from entangled measurements. Remarkably, we also prove that any entanglement-assisted scheme that does not have access to reflected states requires exponentially many samples in $n$. Together, these results establish a rigorous exponential advantage that jointly relies on entangled measurements and reflected states. Finally, we relate the sample-complexity bounds to the input state's classicality, revealing a classicality-complexity tradeoff: entanglement-free schemes suffice for highly classical states, whereas in the genuinely nonclassical regime the sample cost can be reduced only by providing both entanglement and reflected states.

Title: Readout-induced leakage of the fluxonium qubit
Authors: Aayam Bista, Matthew Thibodeau, Ke Nie, Kaicheung Chow, Bryan K. Clark, Angela Kou
Abstract: Dispersive readout is widely used to perform high-fidelity measurement of superconducting qubits. Much work has been focused on the qubit readout fidelity, which depends on the achievable signal-to-noise ratio and the qubit relaxation time. As groups have pushed to increase readout fidelity by increasing readout photon number, dispersive readout has been shown to strongly affect the post-measurement qubit state. Such effects hinder the effectiveness of quantum error correction, which requires measurements that both have high readout fidelity and are quantum non-demolition (QND). Here, we experimentally investigate non-QND effects in the fluxonium. We map out the state evolution of fluxonium qubits in the presence of resonator photons and observe that these photons induce transitions in the fluxonium both within and outside the qubit subspace. We numerically model our system and find that transitions to higher-excited states and coupling to an external spurious mode are necessary to explain observed non-QND effects.

Title: Non-Markovian Quantum Jump Method for Driven-Dissipative Two-Level Systems
Authors: Huanyuan Zhang, Jiasen Jin
Abstract: We propose a modified non-Markovian quantum jump method to overcome the obstacle of dramatically increased trajectory number in conventional quantum trajectory simulations. In our method the trajectories are classified into the trajectory classes characterized by the number of quantum jumps. We derive the expression of the existence probability of each trajectory (class), which is essential to construct the density matrix of the open quantum system. This modified method costs less computational resources and is more efficient than the conventional quantum trajectory approach. As applications we investigate the dynamics of spin-1/2 systems subject to Lorentzian reservoirs with considering only the no-jump and one-jump trajectories. The revival of coherence and entanglement induced by the memory effect is observed.

Title: Ladder Operator Block-Encoding
Authors: William A. Simon, Carter M. Gustin, Kamil Serafin, Alexis Ralli, Gary R. Goldstein, Peter J. Love
Abstract: We describe and analyze LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding), a framework for block-encoding ladder operators that act upon fermionic and bosonic modes. In this framework, we achieve efficient block-encodings by applying the desired action of the operator onto the quantum state and pushing any undesired effects outside of the encoded subspace. This direct approach avoids any overhead caused by expanding the operators in another basis. We numerically benchmark these constructions using models arising in quantum field theories including the quartic harmonic oscillator, and $\phi^4$ and Yukawa Hamiltonians on the light front. These benchmarks show that LOBE often produces block-encodings with fewer non-Clifford operations, fewer block-encoding ancillae and overall number of qubits, and lower rescaling factors for various operators as compared to frameworks that expand the ladder operators in the Pauli basis. LOBE constructions also demonstrate favorable scaling with respect to key parameters, including the maximum occupation of bosonic modes, the total number of fermionic and bosonic modes, and the locality of the operators. LOBE is implemented as an open-source python package to enable further applications.

Title: Nonlinear Domain Engineering for Quantum Technologies
Authors: Tim F. Weiss, Alberto Peruzzo
Abstract: The continuously growing effort towards developing real-world quantum technological applications has come to demand an increasing amount of flexibility from its respective platforms. This review presents a highly adaptable engineering technique for photonic quantum technologies based on the artificial structuring of the material nonlinearity. This technique, while, in a simple form, already featured across the full breadth of photonic quantum technologies, has undergone significant development over the last decade, now featuring advanced, aperiodic designs. This review gives an introduction to the three-wave-mixing processes lying at the core of this approach, and illustrates, on basis of the underlying quantum-mechanical description, how they can artificially be manipulated to engineer the corresponding photon characteristics. It then describes how this technique can be employed to realize a number of very different objectives which are expected to find application across the full range of photonic quantum technologies, and presents a summary of the research done towards these ends to date.

Title: Probing Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model using Quantum Computers
Authors: Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Kwangmin Yu, Raza Sabbir Sufian
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to be vital for exploring complex dynamics in many-body quantum systems. Thus, validating established results on current quantum computers is essential for evaluating their future utility. Hence, we investigate the entanglement entropy of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, in current IBM's superconducting quantum computers. We implement optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol and randomized measurement protocol tailored for IBM quantum computers' limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, we employ quantum multi-programming that parallelizes circuit execution to improve the results obtained by the randomized measurement protocol. Finally, by incorporating the quantum error mitigation techniques into our implementation of the entropy measurement protocols on IBM quantum hardware, we show that the current noisy quantum computer can yield results aligned with theoretical expectations, therefore affirming its capability to explore chaotic quantum dynamics in complex quantum systems.

Authors: Aaron Miller, Joachim Favre, Zoë Holmes, Özlem Salehi, Rahul Chakraborty, Anton Nykänen, Zoltán Zimborás, Adam Glos, Guillermo García-Pérez
Abstract: We introduce Majorana Propagation, an algorithmic framework for the classical simulation of Fermionic circuits. Inspired by Pauli Propagation, Majorana Propagation operates by applying successive truncations throughout the Heisenberg evolution of the observable. We identify monomial length as an effective truncation strategy for typical, unstructured circuits by proving that high-length Majorana monomials are exponentially unlikely to contribute to expectation values and the backflow of high-length monomials to lower-length monomials is quadratically suppressed. We provide performance guarantees by proving analytically that approximation errors decrease exponentially with the truncation threshold and that only polynomial resources are required to compute the expectation value of observables up to a fixed error for an ensemble of circuits relevant to quantum chemistry. Majorana Propagation can be used either independently, or in conjunction with quantum hardware, to simulate Fermionic systems relevant to quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We exemplify this by using Majorana Propagation to find circuits that approximate ground states for strongly correlated systems of up to 52 Fermionic modes. Our results indicate that Majorana Propagation is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art tensor-network-based circuit simulators.

Title: Fault-tolerant protocols through spacetime concatenation
Authors: Yichen Xu, Arpit Dua
Abstract: We introduce a framework called spacetime concatenation for fault-tolerant compilation of syndrome extraction circuits of stabilizer codes. Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.

Title: An Exact Link between Nonlocal Nonstabilizerness and Operator Entanglement
Authors: Faidon Andreadakis, Paolo Zanardi
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness is a quantum property of states associated with the non-Clifford resources required for their preparation. As a resource, nonstabilizerness complements entanglement, and the interplay between these two concepts has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this work, we establish an exact correspondence between the generation of nonlocal nonstabilizerness and operator entanglement under unitary evolutions. Nonlocal nonstabilizerness refers to nonstabilizerness that cannot be erased via local operations, while operator entanglement generalizes entanglement to operator space, characterizing the complexity of operators across a bipartition. Specifically, we prove that a unitary map generates nonlocal nonstabilizerness if and only if it generates operator entanglement on Pauli strings. Guided by this result, we introduce an average measure of a unitary's Pauli-entangling power, serving as a proxy for nonlocal nonstabilizerness generation. We derive analytical formulas for this measure and examine its properties, including its typical value and upper bounds in terms of the nonstabilizerness properties of the evolution.

Title: Cooling mechanical motion with polaritons
Authors: Xuan Zuo, Zi-Xu Lu, Jie Li
Abstract: The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which enables the control of mechanical motion via manipulating polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and explicitly show how two polaritons can be used to simultaneously cool two mechanical modes. The unique advantage of our protocol lies in the fact that the continuous tunability of the polariton frequencies over a wide range allows for the cooling of any two mechanical modes with their frequency difference falling within this range. We further discuss how to extend the theory to cool multiple mechanical modes. The protocol is designed for cooling mechanical motion in various emerging polaromechanical platforms, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems, which is the first step towards quantum states generation in these hybrid systems.

Title: Security analysis of orthogonal state attack on a high-speed quantum key distribution system
Authors: Jialei Su, Jialin Chen, Fengyu Lu, Zihao Chen, Junxuan Liu, Deyong He, Shuang Wang, Anqi Huang
Abstract: High-speed quantum key distribution (QKD) systems have achieved repetition frequencies above gigahertz through advanced technologies and devices, laying an important foundation for the deployment of high-key-rate QKD system. Although these advanced systems may introduce potential loopholes, an eavesdropper Eve is challenging to exploit them by performing the intercept-resend attacks due to the limited time window under high repetition frequency. However, here, we propose a security analysis model of orthogonal state attacks that do not require intercept-resend operation on the key rate of a QKD system. Under this framework, we propose a muted attack and experimentally verify the feasibility of the attack using a 1 GHz single-photon avalanche detector (SPAD). By sending hundreds of photons each time, Eve can mute Bob's SPADs to control the overall detection response of the QKD receiver, allowing her to learn nearly all the keys. Furthermore, we use this security model to simulate the overestimated key rates of the QKD system under orthogonal state attacks, including both the muted attack and the dead-time attack. This work theoretically and experimentally shows a timely case of the security vulnerability in the high-speed QKD system.

Title: Eigenlogic and Probabilistic Inference; when Bayes meets Born
Authors: François Dubois (LMSSC), Zeno Toffano (L2S)
Abstract: This paper shows how inference is treated within the context of Eigenlogic projection operators in linear algebra. In Eigenlogic operators represent logical connectives, their eigenvalues the truth-values and the associated eigenvectors the logical models. By extension, a probabilistic interpretation is proposed using vectors outside the eigensystem of the Eigenlogic operators. The probability is calculated by the quantum mean value (Born rule) of the logical projection operators. We look here for possible connections between the Born rule in quantum mechanics and Bayes' theorem from probability theory and show that Eigenlogic offers an innovative approach to address the probabilistic version of logical inference (material implication) in a quantum context.

Title: Many-Body Neural Network Wavefunction for a Non-Hermitian Ising Chain
Authors: Lavoisier Wah, Remmy Zen, Flore K. Kunst
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems have emerged as a powerful framework for describing open quantum systems, non-equilibrium dynamics, and engineered quantum optical materials. However, solving the ground-state properties of NH systems is challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space, and exotic phenomena such as the emergence of exceptional points. Another challenge arises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization (ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NNs) have shown promise in approximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore different NN architectures to investigate the ground-state properties of a parity-time-symmetric, one-dimensional NH, transverse field Ising model with a complex spectrum by employing a recurrent neural network (RNN), a restricted Boltzmann machine~(RBM), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We construct the NN-based many-body wavefunctions and validate our approach by recovering the ground-state properties of the model for small system sizes, finding excellent agreement with ED. Furthermore, for larger system sizes, we demonstrate that the RNN outperforms both the RBM and MLP. However, we show that the accuracy of the RBM and MLP can be significantly improved through transfer learning, allowing them to perform comparably to the RNN for larger system sizes. These results highlight the potential of neural network-based approaches--particularly for accurately capturing the low-energy physics of NH quantum systems in case of both weak and strong non-Hermiticity.

Title: Q2SAR: A Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning Approach for Drug Discovery
Authors: Alejandro Giraldo, Daniel Ruiz, Mariano Caruso, Javier Mancilla, Guido Bellomo
Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics classification tasks.

Title: Robust Variational Ground-State Solvers via Dissipative Quantum Feedback Models
Authors: Yunyan Lee, Ian R. Petersen, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: We propose a variational framework for solving ground-state problems of open quantum systems governed by quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). This formulation naturally accommodates bosonic operators, as commonly encountered in quantum chemistry and quantum optics. By parameterizing a dissipative quantum optical system, we minimize its steady-state energy to approximate the ground state of a target Hamiltonian. The system converges to a unique steady state regardless of its initial condition, and the design inherently guarantees physical realizability. To enhance robustness against persistent disturbances, we incorporate H-infinity control into the system architecture. Numerical comparisons with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) highlight the method's structural advantages, stability, and physical implementability. This framework is compatible with experimental platforms such as cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and photonic crystal circuits.

Title: Operational reconstruction of Feynman rules for quantum amplitudes via composition algebras
Authors: Jens Köplinger, Michael Habeck, Philip Goyal
Abstract: This article explores an operational model for transition amplitudes between measurements proposed by Goyal et al. within the quantum reconstruction program. To classify suitable amplitude algebras, we distinguish mathematical axioms, physical choices, and their consequences. This leads to several improvements on the published work: Our coordinate-independent approach requires no two-dimensional amplitudes a priori. All scalar field and vector space axioms are traced from model axioms and observer choices, including additive and multiplicative units and inverses. Existing mathematical characterizations identify allowable amplitude algebras as the real associative composition algebras, namely the complex numbers and the quaternions, as well as their split forms. Observed probabilities are quadratic in amplitudes, akin to the Born rule. We examine selected implications of the proposed axioms, reformulate observer questions, and highlight the broad applicability of our framework to subsequent discovery.

Title: Probing the Ground State of the Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Model on the Kagome Lattice using Geometrically Informed Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Abdellah Tounsi, Nacer Eddine Belaloui, Abdelmouheymen Rabah Khamadja, Takei Eddine Fadi Lalaoui, Mohamed Messaoud Louamri, David E. Bernal Neira, Mohamed Taha Rouabah
Abstract: This work investigates the nature of the ground state of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on fundamental kagome cells -- a triangle and a star -- using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on real quantum hardware. We demonstrate that the ground state preparation is achievable using a shallow hardware-efficient quantum circuit with a naturally Euclidean parameter space. Our custom ansatz is capable of accurately recovering meaningful properties of the ground state such as the spin-spin correlation terms and static structure factor without explicit error mitigation. These features are found to be resilient to noise. We exploited the Fubini-Study metric in constructing the ansatz, ensuring a singularity-free parameter space. With this ansatz design, our adaptive optimizer, I-AQNGD, achieves faster convergence -- in the number of iterations -- compared to simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). We further apply error mitigation techniques, including zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and qubit-wise readout error mitigation (REM). While ZNE does not obey the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle, the conditions under which REM preserves it are discussed.

Authors: Franciscus H. B. Somhorst, Jason Saied, Eleanor G. Rieffel, Jelmer J. Renema
Abstract: We present a method to extract the photon indistinguishability error from Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements, accounting for the combined effects of loss and multiphoton noise that contaminate the single-photon Hilbert space. Our analysis resolves apparent inconsistencies in previous interpretations of such measurements. The reported method applies to a wide range of single-photon sources, including quantum dots.

Title: Error-correcting codes and absolutely maximally entangled states for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces
Authors: Simeon Ball, Raven Zhang
Abstract: A major difficulty in quantum computation is the ability to implement fault tolerant computations, protecting information against undesired interactions with the environment. Stabiliser codes were introduced as a means to protect information when storing or applying computations in Hilbert spaces where the local dimension is fixed, i.e. in Hilbert spaces of the form $({\mathbb C}^D)^{\otimes n}$. If $D$ is a prime power then one can consider stabiliser codes over finite fields \cite{KKKS2006}, which allows a deeper mathematical structure to be used to develop stabiliser codes. However, there is no practical reason that the subsystems should have the same local dimension and in this article we introduce a stabiliser formalism for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces, i.e. of the form ${\mathbb C}^{D_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes {\mathbb C}^{D_n}$. More generally, we define and prove a Singleton bound for quantum error-correcting codes of mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces. We redefine entanglement measures for these Hilbert spaces and follow \cite{HESG2018} and define absolutely maximally entangled states as states which maximise this entanglement measure. We provide examples of absolutely maximally entangled states in spaces of dimensions not previously known to have absolutely maximally entangled states.

Title: Quantum resource degradation theory within the framework of observational entropy decomposition
Authors: Xiang Zhou
Abstract: We introduce a theory of quantum resource degradation grounded in a decomposition of observational entropy, which partitions the total resource into inter-block coherence ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$) and intra-block noise ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$). Under free operations, the total quantum resource is transformed into classical noise while its overall quantity remains conserved. We demonstrate that the metric $\eta$ functions as a diagnostic indicator, providing a new lens on optimization stagnation, particularly the barren plateau phenomenon in variational quantum algorithms. We substantiate this framework through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, and we explore how these channels can be physically implemented in real quantum systems. Our approach offers a unified viewpoint on quantum thermalization, measurement-induced disturbance, and the degradation of quantum advantage in practical devices, while also improving optimization strategies for current and near-term noisy quantum hardware.

Title: A contextual advantage for conclusive exclusion: repurposing the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph construction
Authors: Yìlè Yīng, David Schmid, Robert W. Spekkens
Abstract: The task of conclusive exclusion for a set of quantum states is to find a measurement such that for each state in the set, there is an outcome that allows one to conclude with certainty that the state in question was not prepared. Defining classicality of statistics as realizability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model, we show that there is a quantum-over-classical advantage for how well one can achieve conclusive exclusion. This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these. Finally, we show that this bound also constitutes a classical causal compatibility inequality within the bilocality scenario, and that its violation in quantum theory yields a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in that scenario.

Title: Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations
Authors: Sridhar Tayur
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases. Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics. A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Diósi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity-motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.

Title: Tianyan: Cloud services with quantum advantage
Authors: Tianyan Quantum Group
Abstract: Tianyan Quantum Cloud Platform offers cloud services demonstrating quantum advantage capabilities with a Zuchongzhi 3.0-like superconducting quantum processor. This cloud-accessible superconducting quantum prototype, named Tianyan-287, features 105 qubits and achieves high operational fidelities, with single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates, and readout fidelity at 99.90%, 99.56%, 98.7%, respectively. For a specific benchmark task involving random circuit sampling on a 74-qubit system over 24 cycles, the platform completes one million samples in just 18.4 minutes. In contrast, state-of-the-art classical supercomputers would require approximately 16,000 years to complete the equivalent calculation. To facilitate this, the platform provides access via Cqlib, an open-source SDK designed for working with quantum systems at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives. The cloud service aims to democratize access to high-performance quantum hardware, enabling the community to validate and explore practical quantum advantages.

Title: The PPKN Gate: An Optimal 1-Toffoli Input-Preserving Full Adder for Quantum Arithmetic
Authors: G. Papakonstantinou
Abstract: Efficient arithmetic operations are a prerequisite for practical quantum computing. Optimization efforts focus on two primary metrics: Quantum Cost (QC), determined by the number of non-linear gates, and Logical Depth, which defines the execution speed. Existing literature identifies the HNG gate as the standard for Input-Preserving Reversible Full Adders. HNG gate typically requires a QC of 12 and a logical depth of 5, in the area of classical reversible circuits. This paper proposes the PPKN Gate, a novel design that achieves the same inputpreserving functionality using only one Toffoli gate and five CNOT gates. With a Quantum Cost of 10 and a reduced logical depth of 4, the PPKN gate outperforms the standard HNG gate in both complexity and speed. Furthermore, we present a modular architecture for constructing an n-bit Ripple Carry Adder by cascading PPKN modules.

Title: Measurement as Sheafification: Context, Logic, and Truth after Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Partha Ghose
Abstract: Quantum measurement is commonly posed as a dynamical tension between linear Schrödinger evolution and an ad hoc collapse rule. I argue that the deeper conflict is logical: quantum theory is inherently contextual, whereas the classical tradition presupposes a single global, Boolean valuation. Building on Bohr's complementarity, the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen argument and Bell's theorem, I recast locality and completeness as the existence of a global section of a presheaf of value assignments over the category of measurement contexts. The absence of global sections expresses the impossibility of context-independent description, and Čech cohomology measures the resulting obstruction. The internal logic of the presheaf topos is intuitionistic, and the seven-valued contextual logic proposed by Ghose and Patra is exhibited as a finite Heyting algebra capturing patterns of truth, falsity and indeterminacy across incompatible contexts. Classical physics corresponds to the sheaf case, where compatible local data glue and Boolean logic is effectively restored. Measurement is therefore reinterpreted as sheafification of presheaf-valued truth rather than as a physical breakdown of unitarity. Finally, a $\sigma$--$\lambda$ dynamics motivated by stochastic mechanics provides a continuous interpolation between strongly contextual and approximately classical regimes, dissolving the usual measurement paradoxes and apparent nonlocality as artefacts of an illegitimate demand for global truth.

Title: Operational Derivation of Born's Rule from Causal Consistency in Generalized Probabilistic Theories
Authors: Enso O. Torres Alegre
Abstract: We present an operational derivation of Born's rule within finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), without assuming Hilbert-space structure. From a single causal requirement, namely causal consistency, together with sharp measurements, reversible symmetries, and no-signaling, we show that any admissible state-to-probability map must be affine under mixing; otherwise, its curvature enables superluminal signaling via steering. Using standard reconstruction results, affinity forces the probability assignment to coincide with the quadratic transition function of complex quantum theory. Our three-stage argument (operational assignment, causal-consistency constraints, and structural reconstruction) recovers complex quantum theory and identifies Born's rule as a causal fixed point among admissible probabilistic laws. We discuss limitations of the derivation and outline steering-based experiments that could bound deviations from affinity.

Title: Actual and weak actual values in Bohmian mechanics
Authors: Weixiang Ye
Abstract: A fundamental question in Bohmian mechanics concerns whether observables other than position possess definite values. We introduce a condition of operational robustness as a criterion for when an observable can be attributed an actual value in a given Bohmian state. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition: under appropriate regularity conditions, an actual value can be consistently assigned if and only if the wave function satisfies a local eigencondition of the corresponding operator at the particle's configuration. For general states, we define a weak actual value as a derived theoretical construct to characterize the local average behavior of an observable along a trajectory. We prove that its ensemble average equals the standard quantum expectation value and derive its evolution equation. Furthermore, we establish that the weak actual value equals the real part of the quantum weak value when post-selecting on position. This work extends and formalizes earlier discussions on the definability of observables in Bohmian mechanics, develops a conceptual and mathematical framework for discussing the ontological status of observables, and establishes a theoretical correspondence with weak measurement experiments.

Title: Quantum Chaos as an Essential Resource for Full Quantum State Controllability
Authors: Lukas Beringer, Mathias Steinhuber, Klaus Richter, Steven Tomsovic
Abstract: Using the key properties of chaos, i.e. ergodicity and exponential instability, as a resource to control classical dynamics has a long and considerable history. However, in the context of controlling "chaotic" quantum unitary dynamics, the situation is far more tenuous. The classical concepts of exponential sensitivity to trajectory initial conditions and ergodicity do not directly translate into quantum unitary evolution. Nevertheless properties inherent to quantum chaos can take on those roles: i) the dynamical sensitivity to weak perturbations, measured by the fidelity decay, serves a similar purpose as the classical sensitivity to initial conditions; and ii) paired with the fact that quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to be statistically described by random matrix theory, implies a method to translate the ergodic feature into the control of quantum dynamics. With those two properties, it can be argued that quantum chaotic dynamical systems, in principle, allow for full controllability beyond a characteristic time that scales only logarithmically with system size and $\hbar^{-1}$. In the spirit of classical targeting, it implies that it is possible to fine tune the immense quantum interference with weak perturbations and steer the system from any initial state into any desired target state, subject to constraints imposed by conserved quantities. In contrast, integrable dynamics possess neither ergodicity nor exponential instability, and thus the weak perturbations apparently must break the integrability for control purposes. The main ideas are illustrated with the quantum kicked rotor. The production of revivals, cat-like entangled states, and the transition from any random state to any other random state is possible as demonstrated.

Title: Certified-Everlasting Quantum NIZK Proofs
Authors: Nikhil Pappu
Abstract: We study non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) for NP satisfying: 1) statistical soundness, 2) computational zero-knowledge and 3) certified-everlasting zero-knowledge (CE-ZK). The CE-ZK property allows a verifier of a quantum proof to revoke the proof in a way that can be checked (certified) by the prover. Conditioned on successful certification, the verifier's state can be efficiently simulated with only the statement, in a statistically indistinguishable way. Our contributions regarding these certified-everlasting NIZKs (CE-NIZKs) are as follows: - We identify a barrier to obtaining CE-NIZKs in the CRS model via generalizations of known interactive proofs that satisfy CE-ZK. - We circumvent this by constructing CE-NIZK from black-box use of NIZK for NP satisfying certain properties, along with OWFs. As a result, we obtain CE-NIZKs for NP in the CRS model, based on polynomial hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) assumption. - In addition, we observe that the aforementioned barrier does not apply to the shared EPR model. Consequently, we present a CE-NIZK for NP in this model based on any statistical binding hidden-bits generator, which can be based on LWE. The only quantum computation in this protocol involves single-qubit measurements of the shared EPR pairs.

Title: Complexity Growth and the Krylov-Wigner function
Authors: Ritam Basu, Anirban Ganguly, Souparna Nath, Onkar Parrikar
Abstract: For any state in a $D$-dimensional Hilbert space with a choice of basis, one can define a discrete version of the Wigner function -- a quasi-probability distribution which represents the state on a discrete phase space. The Wigner function can, in general, take on negative values, and the amount of negativity in the Wigner function has an operational meaning as a resource for quantum computation. In this note, we study the growth of Wigner negativity for a generic initial state under time evolution with chaotic Hamiltonians. We introduce the Krylov-Wigner function, i.e., the Wigner function defined with respect to the Krylov basis (with appropriate phases), and show that this choice of basis minimizes the early time growth of Wigner negativity in the large $D$ limit. We take this as evidence that the Krylov basis (with appropriate phases) is ideally suited for a dual, semi-classical description of chaotic quantum dynamics at large $D$. We also numerically study the time evolution of the Krylov-Wigner function and its negativity in random matrix theory for an initial pure state. We observe that the negativity rises gradually for a time of $O(D)$ and then saturates close to its upper bound of $\sqrt{D}$.

Title: Coupling Light with Matter for Identifying Dominant Subnetworks
Authors: Airat Kamaletdinov, Natalia G. Berloff
Abstract: We introduce DOMINO, a light-matter computing platform that exploits the full complex amplitude of coupled condensate networks to solve maximum-weight clique problems and reveal hidden indirect correlations in large graphs. By embedding network structure directly into a gain-controlled polaritonic (or photonic) oscillator array, DOMINO performs analog optimization, directly solving the maximum-weight clique problem via the gain-controlled minimisation, through a physically enforced global-intensity constraint, allowing the system to converge rapidly to dominant subnetworks while simultaneously extracting phase, encoded co- and counter-regulation patterns. This gain-based mechanism unlocks capabilities inaccessible to conventional Ising-type simulators: all degrees of freedom (amplitude and phase) participate in the computation, dramatically expanding the class of problems that can be efficiently encoded. Our approach is inherently ultrafast, energy-efficient, and naturally robust to noise, requiring no digital post-processing. Applied to real gene-gene coexpression data, DOMINO reliably identifies biologically meaningful transcription-regulator modules and exposes latent regulatory relationships. Because the method applies generically to any weighted network, it establishes a scalable physical route to solving high-value graph-analytic tasks across biology, finance, social systems, and engineered networks.

Title: Quantum-interference-induced pairing in bosonic doped antiferromagnets
Authors: Hao-Kai Zhang, Jia-Xin Zhang, Ji-Si Xu, Hong-Chen Jiang, Zheng-Yu Weng
Abstract: The pairing mechanism in doped antiferromagnets is essential for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the pairing mechanism in bosonic doped antiferromagnets via large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations of the bosonic $t$-$J$ model. We discover a pair density wave (PDW) coexists with the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping. The pairing is attributed to a hidden many-body Berry phase that introduces the sole ``sign problem'' into this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration to the spin-charge interference pattern. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as the Berry phase is trivialized in the ferromagnetic condensate at larger doping or switched off into the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$. The present pairing mechanism -- distinct from the conventional mechanisms based on Fermi surface instabilities -- may provide a different perspective and new insights for understanding the complex nature of doped Mott insulators and is promising to be probed on qudit-based quantum simulators such as ultracold Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Generalized Coulomb-type interaction embedded in a non-inertial cosmic string spacetime in a slow-rotation limit
Authors: M. Baradaran, L.M. Nieto, S. Zarrinkamar
Abstract: Motivated by the great interest in studying quantum and gravitational phenomena in a unified way, scalar bosons are considered in a cosmic string spacetime and in a non-inertial frame, with a generalized Coulomb-type interaction containing both inverse quadratic and inverse cubic corrections. Solutions for this generalized interaction are shown for an arbitrary state in the slow rotation limit in a quasi-exact manner and a discussion is given of the structure of the problem, whose special case appears in the form of a doubly confluent Heun differential equation. The previously known solution for the simplest case of this problem, corresponding to the ordinary Coulomb interaction, is recovered.

Title: Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability
Authors: Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.

Title: Strongly coupled photonic molecules as doubly-coupled oscillators
Authors: Kevin C. Smith, Austin G. Nixon, David J. Masiello
Abstract: In this work, we present a field-theoretic model of strongly coupled photonic molecules composed of interacting dielectric cavities in a closed, perfect-electric-conductor domain. Within this setting, we treat the resulting inter-mode couplings non-perturbatively. We demonstrate the predictive power of this framework by showing that supermode eigenfrequencies, field profiles, and mode volumes can be obtained directly from the isolated-cavity modes and dielectric environment, without electromagnetic simulations of the composite structure or numerical fitting. While our model affirms the phenomenological approach of modeling coupled cavity modes as simple coordinate-coupled oscillators in the weak coupling regime, we show that this intuition remarkably breaks down for strong coupling. Instead, we demonstrate that strongly coupled cavity modes are analogous to harmonic oscillators we term as \emph{doubly} coupled, with interactions via electric and magnetic fields appearing as independent coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum couplings, respectively. We show that this distinction is not merely cosmetic, but gives rise to observable properties while providing deep insights into the physical mechanism behind previously observed phenomena, such as coupling induced frequency shifts. Finally, we illustrate that the complex interplay of these dual couplings suggests the possibility to realize exotic phenomena that typically only occur in the ultrastrong coupling regime, here predicted to emerge for comparably modest mode splittings within a regime we term pseudo-ultrastrong coupling.

Title: A framework for fluctuating times and counting observables in stochastic excursions
Authors: Guilherme Fiusa, Pedro E. Harunari, Abhaya S. Hegde, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit dynamics characterized by alternating phases or recurring sets of states. Describing the fluctuations of such systems over stochastic trajectories is necessary across diverse fields, from biological motors to quantum thermal machines. In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic excursions$-$a framework to analyze out of equilibrium processes via sub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights into thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest, such as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance this formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently compute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit formulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as well as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion statistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation between fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the steady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation theorem for individual excursions and show that it implies a modified thermodynamic uncertainty relation at the excursion level. In addition, we explore how analyzing excursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three problems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular sensing, and birth-and-death processes.

Title: Emergent Viscous Hydrodynamics From a Single Quantum Particle
Authors: Zhi-Li Zhou, Mauricio Hippert, Nicki Mullins, Jorge Noronha
Abstract: We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in open quantum systems where a system with few degrees of freedom is coupled to a large thermal environment.

Title: Ultimate Quantum Precision Limit at Colliders: Conditions and Case Studies
Authors: Tengyu Ai, Qi Bi, Yuxin He, Jia Liu, Xiao-Ping Wang
Abstract: We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\tau \to \pi \nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.

Title: Kinetic magnetism in the crossover between the square and triangular lattice Fermi-Hubbard models
Authors: Darren Pereira, Erich J. Mueller
Abstract: We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.

Title: Quantum Coulomb Blockade in Orbital Resolved Phosphorus Triple-Donor Molecule
Authors: Soumya Chakraborty, Pooja Sudha, Hemant Arora, Daniel Moraru, Arup Samanta
Abstract: Multi-donor architecture in silicon offers a promising direction towards scalable solid-state qubits and quantum technologies operating at practical conditions. However, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions develops a complex internal electronic configuration with several discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete-correlated states is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards their practical implementations in quantum-technologies. We have experimentally demonstrated quantum Coulomb blockade mediated systematic filling of several electrons into orbital-resolved molecular states within multi-phosphorous-donor molecules accompanied by a correlated decrement in charging energies for higher hybridized orbitals due to expanded Bohr radii and electron delocalization. Corresponding, first-principle density functional theory calculations offer microscopic insight into the orbital configurations, while the rate equation simulations of quantum Coulomb blockade faithfully reproduce the experimental stability diagrams. This comprehensive characterization advances and discusses the role of donor-molecules in silicon in scalable building blocks for quantum technologies operable at elevated temperatures.

Title: Krylov complexity, path integrals, and instantons
Authors: Cameron Beetar, Eric L Graef, Jeff Murugan, Horatiu Nastase, Hendrik J R Van Zyl
Abstract: Krylov complexity has emerged as an important tool in the description of quantum information and, in particular, quantum chaos. Here we formulate Krylov complexity $K(t)$ for quantum mechanical systems as a path integral, and argue that at large times, for classical chaotic systems with at least two minima of the potential, that have a plateau for $K(t)$, the value of the plateau is described by quantum mechanical instantons, as is the case for standard transition amplitudes. We explain and test these ideas in a simple toy model.

Title: Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems
Authors: Mengjie Yang, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that, in the simplest time-reversal-symmetric setting, strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb Z_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are rendered with negligible gain while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes -- without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.

Title: A Hybrid Anyon-Otto thermal machine
Authors: Mohit Lal Bera, Joyce Kwan, Armando Pérez, Miguel A. García-March, Ravindra Chhajlany, Tobias Grass, Maciej Lewenstein, Utso Bhattacharya, Sourav Bhattacharjee
Abstract: We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low-temperature work, in the absence of any interactions, is maximized in the pseudo-fermionic limit, where the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or pseudo-fermionic extremes but instead peaks at intermediate statistical angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions, in this regime. Furthermore, we also outline an experimental protocol to realize the HAO cycle using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice.

Title: Supernematic
Authors: Dan Mao, Eun-Ah Kim
Abstract: Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.

Title: Tensor Network Fluid Simulations in Structured Domains Using the Lattice Boltzmann Method
Authors: Lukas Gross, Elie Mounzer, David M. Wawrzyniak, Josef M. Winter, Nikolaus A. Adams
Abstract: High-fidelity fluid simulations are central to understanding transport phenomena, yet resolving large or geometrically complex systems remains computationally prohibitive with existing methods. Recently, methods based on tensor-networks, commonly known as a quantum-inspired approach, were proposed to efficiently simulate flow in simple domains, where complexity emerges mostly from turbulence. Here, we substantially extend the understanding of such methods by demonstrating for the first time that also flows governed by translational or approximate symmetries of the geometry exhibit very low effective complexity in matrix product state (MPS) form. To this end, we introduce a tensor-network formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method based on MPS and demonstrate the generality of the method on three-dimensional flows through structured media and complex vascular geometries, establishing that tensor-network techniques can efficiently resolve fluid dynamics in complex domains previously inaccessible to MPS approaches. We show that in structured media, MPS representation yields compression ratios exceeding two orders of magnitude while preserving physical structure and dynamical fidelity. This reduction enables systematic numerical exploration of regimes that were previously intractable. Our results position tensor networks as a scalable paradigm for continuum mechanics.
