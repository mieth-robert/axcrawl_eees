Title: Resource-Efficient Quantum Optimization via Higher-Order Encoding
Authors: Frederik Koch, Shahram Panahiyan, Rick Mukherjee, Joseph Doetsch, Dieter Jaksch
Abstract: Quantum approaches to combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are often limited by the resource demands of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) encodings, which enlarge circuits through penalty terms and increase qubit and gate counts. We show that Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) enables a more resource-efficient formulation. Our method systematically constructs HUBO Hamiltonians and, compared to QUBO in benchmarks on Gate Assignment (GAP), Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph (MkCS), and Integer Programming (IP) problems, exponentially reduces qubit requirements and decreases CNOT gate counts by at least 89.6% after compilation to single- and two-qubit gates for all tested instances. These results highlight HUBO as a practical alternative for current and near-term devices. To promote adoption, we release an open-source Python library that automates HUBO model construction, broadening access to resource-efficient quantum optimization.

Title: On fast charged particle scattering by periodic atomic planes: quadratic potential corrections
Authors: Viktoriia Omelchenko
Abstract: In this paper, the approach for considering fast charged particles scattering on targets of complex structure, which contains some isolated substructures, was expanded to account quadratic potential terms. Based on this approach, the differential cross section for scattering on the set of parallel planes with uniformly distributed atoms in each plane was obtained. It was shown that for this case the differential scattering cross section splits into coherent and incohent cross sections in the eikonal approximation analogously with the Born approximation.

Title: Entanglement Witnesses of Condensation for Enhanced Quantum Sensing
Authors: Lilian I. Payne Torres, Irma Avdic, Anna O. Schouten, Olivia C. Wedig, Gregory S. Engel, David A. Mazziotti
Abstract: Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.

Title: Certifying Majorana Fermions with Elegant-Like Bell Inequalities and a New Self-Testing Equivalence
Authors: Patryk Michalski, Arturo Konderak, Wojciech Bruzda, Remigiusz Augusiak
Abstract: Bell inequalities provide a fundamental tool for probing nonlocal correlations, yet their quantum bound, that is, the maximal value attainable through quantum strategies, is rarely accessible analytically. In this work, we introduce a general construction of Bell inequalities for which this bound can be computed exactly. Our framework generalizes both the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Gisin's elegant inequalities, yielding Bell expressions maximally violated by any number of pairwise anticommuting Clifford observables together with the corresponding maximally entangled state. Under suitable assumptions, our inequalities also enable the device-independent certification of Majorana fermions, understood as multiqubit realizations of Clifford algebra generators. Importantly, we identify an additional equivalence that must be incorporated into the definition of self-testing beyond invariance under local isometries and transposition. This equivalence arises from partial transposition applied to the shared state and to the measurements, which in specific cases leaves all observed correlations unchanged.

Title: Asymptotic dynamics in the Heisenberg picture: attractor subspace and Choi-Effros product
Authors: Daniele Amato, Paolo Facchi, Arturo Konderak
Abstract: We study the asymptotic dynamics of open quantum systems in the Heisenberg picture. We find an explicit expression for the attractor subspace and the dynamics that takes place in it. We present the relationship between the attractor subspaces in the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures and, in particular, the connection between their algebraic structures. An unfolding theorem of the asymptotics, as well as the fine structure of the recently introduced Choi-Effros decoherence-free algebra, are also discussed. Finally, we show how to extend all the results to the class of Schwarz maps.

Title: Probing Antiferromagnetic Hysteresis on Programmable Quantum Annealers
Authors: Elijah Pelofske, Pratik Sathe, Cristiano Nisoli, Frank Barrows
Abstract: Using programmable analog quantum annealing processors, we implement a sampling-based magnetic hysteresis protocol to probe the counterintuitive notion of magnetic memory of antiferromagnets. A key component of this protocol responsible for the hysteresis is a transverse field, which enables state transitions, while the magnetic field sweep is done via a longitudinal control field. We present evidence of full saturation and reversal of the hysteresis curve, as well as emergent magnetic domain mediated by quantum fluctuations that give rise to the magnetic memory effect in antiferromagnets.

Title: Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Gibbs Free Energy and Entropy via Energy Derivatives
Authors: Shangjie Guo, Corneliu Buda, Nathan Wiebe
Abstract: Estimating vibrational entropy is a significant challenge in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics due to its reliance on quantum mechanical properties. This paper introduces a quantum algorithm designed to estimate vibrational entropy via energy derivatives. Our approach block encodes the exact expression for the second derivative of the energy and uses quantum linear systems algorithms to deal with the reciprocal powers of the gaps that appear in the expression. We further show that if prior knowledge about the values of the second derivative is used then our algorithm can $\epsilon$-approximate the entropy using a number of queries that scales with the condition number $\kappa$, the temperature $T$, error tolerance $\epsilon$ and an analogue of the partition function $\mathcal{Z}$, as $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{\mathcal{Z}\kappa^2 }{\epsilon T}\right)$. We show that if sufficient prior knowledge is given about the second derivative then the query scales quadratically better than these results. This shows that, under reasonable assumptions of the temperature and a quantum computer can be used to compute the vibrational contributions to the entropy faster than analogous classical algorithms would be capable of. Our findings highlight the potential of quantum algorithms to enhance the prediction of thermodynamic properties, paving the way for advancements in fields such as material science, molecular biology, and chemical engineering.

Title: Kicked-Ising Quantum Battery
Authors: Sebastián V. Romero, Xi Chen, Yue Ban
Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising candidates capable of outperforming classical counterparts by utilizing entangled operators. Spin chains, in particular, exhibit unique {charging} properties across diverse settings. Here, we introduce the kicked-Ising model as a QB and analytically characterize its charging dynamics within the self-dual operator regime, valid for arbitrary system sizes and Floquet cycles. Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms.

Title: Unified Bulk-Entanglement Correspondence in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Xudong Zhang, Zhaoyu Sun, Bin Guo
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) fundamentally invalidates the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), leading topological diagnostics into a crisis. While the non-Bloch polarization $P_{\beta}$ defined on the generalized Brillouin zone restores momentum-space topology, a direct, robust real-space bulk probe has remained elusive. We resolve this by establishing a universal correspondence between $P_{\beta}$ and the entanglement polarization $\chi$ of the biorthogonal ground state. Introducing a quasi-reciprocal Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ that removes the NHSE while preserving bulk topology, we rigorously prove the fundamental identity $P_{\beta} \equiv \chi(\tilde{H})\pmod 1$ in the thermodynamic limit under the quasi-locality assumption. Crucially, we demonstrate that this equivalence transcends the locality constraints that limit traditional topological invariants. While the conventional Resta polarization fails when $\tilde{H}$ becomes non-local due to the divergence of position variance, we reveal that $\chi(\tilde{H})$ remains robustly quantized, protected by the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators. Our work thus identifies entanglement as the unique real-space diagnostic capable of capturing non-Bloch topology beyond the breakdown of locality, successfully restoring the BBC across diverse non-Hermitian systems such as line-gap, point-gap, and gapless phases, thereby unifying the geometric and entanglement paradigms in non-Hermitian physics.

Title: Exact Non-Identity Check and Gate-Teleportation-Based Indistinguishability Obfuscation are NP-hard for Low-T-Depth Quantum Circuits
Authors: Joshua Nevin
Abstract: In 2021, Broadbent and Kazmi developed a gate-teleportation-based protocol for computational indistinguishability obfuscation of quantum circuits. This protocol is efficient for Clifford+T circuits with logarithmically many T-gates, where the limiting factor in the efficiency of the protocol is the difficulty, on input a quantum circuit $C$, of the classical task of producing a description of the unitary obtained by conjugating a Pauli $P$ (corresponding to a Bell-measurement outcome) by $C$, where this description only depends on the input-output functionality of $CPC^{\dagger}$. The task above, in turn, is at least as hard as the problem of determining whether two $n$-qubit quantum circuits are perfectly equivalent up to global phase. In 2009, Tanaka defined the corresponding decision problem Exact Non-Identity Check (ENIC) and showed that ENIC is NQP-complete in general. Motivated by this, we consider in this work what happens when we pass from low T-count to low T-depth. In particular, we show that, for Clifford+T circuits of T-depth $O(\log(n))$, deciding ENIC is NP-hard. This effectively rules out the possibility, for Clifford+T circuits of logarithmic T-depth, of either efficient ENIC or efficient gate-teleportation based computational indistinguishability obfuscation, unless P=NP.

Title: Entanglement Generation via Hamiltonian Dynamics Having Limited Resources
Authors: Moein Naseri
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of entanglement generation under bipartite Hamiltonian dynamics when only finite physical resources-specifically, bounded energy variance-are available. Using the relative entropy of entanglement, we derive a closed analytical expression for the instantaneous entanglement generation rate for arbitrary pure states and Hamiltonians expressed in the Schmidt basis. We find that constraints based solely on the mean energy of the Hamiltonian are insufficient to bound the entanglement generation rate, whereas imposing a variance constraint ensures a finite and well-defined maximum. We fully characterize the Hamiltonians that achieve this optimal rate, establishing a direct relation between their imaginary components in the Schmidt basis and the structure of the optimal initial states. For systems without ancillas, we obtain a closed-form expression for the maximal rate in terms of the surprisal variance of the Schmidt coefficients and identify the family of optimal states and Hamiltonians. We further extend our analysis to scenarios where Alice and Bob may employ local ancillary systems: using a matrix-analytic framework and a refined description of the Hamiltonians allowed by the physical constraints, we derive an explicit optimization formula and characterize the attainable enhancement in entanglement generation.

Abstract: Verifying prepared quantum states is crucial for hybrid systems whose subsystems may have different local dimensions. We present a generalized stabilizer framework and associated test that apply to general multi-qudit states, including composite-dimensional and hybrid architectures. Using only adaptive local measurements, our method verifies qutrit-qubit states, arbitrary two-qubit pure states, Bell/Bell-like, GHZ/GHZ-like, graph, hypergraph, multigraph, and multihypergraph states, with efficiencies matching or surpassing the best known schemes.

Title: Computational Quantum Anamorphic Encryption and Quantum Anamorphic Secret-Sharing
Authors: Sayantan Ganguly, Shion Samadder Chaudhury
Abstract: The concept of anamorphic encryption, first formally introduced by Persiano et al. in their influential 2022 paper titled ``Anamorphic Encryption: Private Communication Against a Dictator,'' enables embedding covert messages within ciphertexts. One of the key distinctions between a ciphertext embedding a covert message and an original ciphertext, compared to an anamorphic ciphertext, lies in the indistinguishability between the original ciphertext and the anamorphic ciphertext. This encryption procedure has been defined based on a public-key cryptosystem. Initially, we present a quantum analogue of the classical anamorphic encryption definition that is based on public-key encryption. Additionally, we introduce a definition of quantum anamorphic encryption that relies on symmetric key encryption. Furthermore, we provide a detailed generalized construction of quantum anamorphic symmetric key encryption within a general framework, which involves taking any two quantum density matrices of any different dimensions and constructing a single quantum density matrix, which is the quantum anamorphic ciphertext containing ciphertexts of both of them. Subsequently, we introduce a definition of computational anamorphic secret-sharing and extend the work of Çakan et al. on computational quantum secret-sharing to computational quantum anamorphic secret-sharing, specifically addressing scenarios with multiple messages, multiple keys, and a single share function. This proposed secret-sharing scheme demonstrates impeccable security measures against quantum adversaries.

Title: Brute-force positivization of $J_1-J_2$ model ground states
Authors: P. A. Bannykh, O. M. Sotnikov, V. V. Mazurenko
Abstract: Exploring sign structures of quantum wave functions attracts considerable attention due to the potential for advances in modeling complex phases of matter. This stimulates developing different optimization procedures for imitating and manipulating sign structures of quantum states. In this work, utilizing a brute force approach based on a set of single-qubit transformations we evaluate protocols enabling positivization of the one-dimensional $J_1 -J_2$ model ground states in the regime of strong frustration. Based on the obtained positivization results, we show the difference between the cases of periodic and open boundary conditions, and also establish the dependence of the sign structure on parity of the simulated spin chains.

Title: The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm with qutrits
Authors: Tushti Patel, V. S. Prasannaa
Abstract: We extend the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, which is well-studied in the qubit framework, to its qutrit counterpart (which we call qutrit HHL, as opposed to qubit HHL, which is HHL using qubits). We design the circuit for the algorithm and develop a program for its implementation. We test HHL with qutrits for simple matrices and verify the results against the expected outcomes. We apply the algorithm to quantum chemistry, and in particular, to the potential energy curve calculations of the model problem of the hydrogen molecule in the split valence basis. We compare the number of qudits and the number of gates required between qubit and qutrit HHL implementations. In general, we find that for a fixed precision, the qutrit HHL circuit requires fewer number of qudits and comparable number of two-qudit gates than its qubit counterpart.

Title: Accelerated optimization of measured relative entropies
Authors: Zixin Huang, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: The measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy are quantifiers of the distinguishability of two quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$. They are defined as the maximum classical relative entropy or Rényi relative entropy realizable by performing a measurement on $\rho$ and $\sigma$, and they have interpretations in terms of asymptotic quantum hypothesis testing. Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators. In this paper, we establish foundational properties of these objective functions by analyzing their matrix gradients and Hessian superoperators; namely, we prove that these objective functions are $\beta$-smooth and $\gamma$-strongly convex / concave, where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ depend on the max-relative entropies of $\rho$ and $\sigma$. A practical consequence of these properties is that we can conduct Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent / ascent, a well known classical optimization technique, to calculate the measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy to arbitrary precision. These algorithms are generally more memory efficient than our previous algorithms based on semi-definite optimization [Huang and Wilde, arXiv:2406.19060], and for well conditioned states $\rho$ and $\sigma$, these algorithms are notably faster.

Title: Elucidating Many-Body Effects in Molecular Core Spectra through Real-Time Approaches: Efficient Classical Approximations and a Quantum Perspective
Authors: Vibin Abraham, Priyabrata Senapati, Himadri Pathak, Bo Peng
Abstract: Accurately resolving many-body satellite features in molecular core-level spectra requires theoretical approaches that capture electron correlation both efficiently and systematically. The recently developed time-dependent double coupled-cluster (TD-dCC) ansatz achieves this by combining correlation effects from the N- and (N-1)-electron sectors, but its exact formulation remains computationally demanding. Here we introduce a hierarchy of cost-effective approximate TD-dCC ansatzes derived from truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansions, which preserve a single-similarity-transformation structure while retaining the essential correlation diagrams responsible for satellite formation. We further develop a detailed component analysis that isolates hole-mediated excitation pathways, which are correlated processes arising from the coupling between ground-state and ionized-state amplitudes. We use it to interpret quasiparticle and satellite features across the hierarchy. Applications to the single-impurity Anderson model and molecular systems (H2O and CH4) demonstrate that the approximate TD-dCC methods closely and efficiently reproduce exact many-body spectral features and quasiparticle weights. In parallel, we construct a fault-tolerant quantum signal processing algorithm for the core-hole Green's function, providing a scalable quantum route for simulating correlated core-level dynamics. Together, these developments establish complementary classical and quantum methodologies for quantitative, many-body-accurate core spectroscopy.

Title: Attractor Subspace and Decoherence-Free Algebra of Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Daniele Amato, Paolo Facchi, Arturo Konderak
Abstract: In this review we discuss some results on the asymptotic dynamics of finite-dimensional open quantum systems in the Heisenberg picture. Both the spectral and algebraic approaches to this topic are addressed, with particular emphasis on their relationship. The analysis is conducted in both the discrete-time and the continuous-time Markovian settings. In the final part of the work, some issues emerging in the infinite-dimensional case are also discussed. In particular, we provide an example of a Markovian evolution whose decoherence-free algebra is a type III von Neumann algebra.

Title: Fewest switches surface hopping with decoherence in the Marcus inverted regime: correct rates but wrong thermal populations
Authors: Manas Nagda, Priyam Kumar De, Amber Jain
Abstract: Fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) is a well benchmarked dynamical method for simulating nonadiabatic systems. In particular, the literature shows that for the spin-Boson model Hamiltonian, FSSH with appropriate corrections usually captures the detailed balance well and obtains rate constants within a factor of 2 compared to numerically exact results. In this study, we show that in the deep inverted Marcus regime, the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH, one version that includes decoherence) yields reasonably accurate rate constants but incorrect thermal populations over a broad range of parameters. We present an analytical derivation to understand the AFSSH behavior, and therefore, show that AFSSH obtains correct rate constants owing to the resonance of the time derivative coupling with the exothermicity, but obtains an incorrect thermal population owing to the self-consistency issue. The presented derivation provides an analytical expression for the quantum correction factor for AFSSH simulations in the Marcus inverted regime.

Title: Noise-Adaptive Quantum Circuit Mapping for Multi-Chip NISQ Systems via Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Atiye Zeynali, Zahra Bakhshi
Abstract: The transition from monolithic to distributed multi-chip quantum architectures has fundamentally altered the circuit compilation landscape, introducing challenges in managing temporal noise variations and minimizing expensive inter-chip operations. We present DeepQMap, a deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Dynamic Noise Adaptation (DNA) network with multi-head attention mechanisms and Rainbow DQN architecture. Unlike conventional static optimization approaches such as QUBO formulations, our method continuously adapts to hardware dynamics through learned temporal representations of quantum system behavior. Comprehensive evaluation across 270 benchmark circuits spanning Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover's algorithm, and Variational Quantum Eigensolver demonstrates that DeepQMap achieves mean circuit fidelity of $0.920 \pm 0.023$, representing a statistically significant 49.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art QUBO methods ($0.618 \pm 0.031$, $t_{98} = 4.87$, $p = 0.0023$, Cohen's $d = 2.34$). Inter-chip communication overhead reduces by 79.8\%, decreasing from 2.34 operations per circuit to 0.47. The DNA network maintains noise prediction accuracy with coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.912$ and mean absolute error of 0.87\%, enabling proactive compensation for hardware fluctuations. Scalability analysis confirms sustained performance across 20-100 qubit systems, with fidelity remaining above 0.87 even at maximum scale where competing methods degrade below 0.60. Training convergence occurs 8.2$\times$ faster than baseline approaches, completing in 45 minutes versus 370 minutes for QUBO optimization. Very large effect sizes validate practical significance for near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing applications.

Title: Coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states via nonlinear absorption of quanta
Authors: Kingshuk Adhikary, Darren W. Moore, Radim Filip
Abstract: The linear and phase insensitive absorption of a single quanta via coherent interactions with a saturable system, even a single ground state qubit, is sufficient to deterministically generate quantum non-Gaussian states in an oscillator, even stimulated merely by increasing thermal oscillator energy. However, the resultant states only approach Fock states and therefore do not exhibit quantum coherence. Here we overcome this limitation using a minimal step: a nonlinear phase-insensitive absorption process added to the linear one. The coherent addition of such individually passive processes allows coherence to emerge and increase in phase space without an external drive and with minimal interaction requirements. The coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states emerges because the linear and nonlinear absorption processes are not mutually passive. In the simplest case rotationally symmetric Wigner functions of the oscillator Fock states convert their many negative regions to an extremely complex asymmetric structure in sharp contrast to the rotational symmetry of those obtained by the individual interactions. We extend this case to include an unsaturable absorber (oscillator) and analyse switching between linear and nonlinear absorptions, suitable for broad classes of experiments.

Title: Exact solutions of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrödinger equation through supersymmetric potentials
Authors: David J. Fernández C., O. Pavón-Torres
Abstract: By employing supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we present a general algorithm to construct supersymmetric partner potentials and hence derive exact stationary solutions of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrödinger equation (INLSE). This is possible due to the connection between the INLSE and the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), which can be established from a treatment based on Lie point symmetries and is related with Schrödinger equation, under certain conditions. As an illustrative example, we construct exact solutions for the INLSE through a Pösch-Teller potential with a single bound state.

Title: Space-Optimized and Experimental Implementations of Regev's Quantum Factoring Algorithm
Authors: Wentao Yang, Bao Yan, Muxi Zheng, Quanfeng Lu, Shijie Wei, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: The integer factorization problem (IFP) underpins the security of RSA, yet becomes efficiently solvable on a quantum computer through Shor's algorithm. Regev's recent high-dimensional variant reduces the circuit size through lattice-based post-processing, but introduces substantial space overhead and lacks practical implementations. Here, we propose a qubit reuse method by intermediate-uncomputation that significantly reduces the space complexity of Regev's algorithm, inspired by reversible computing. Our basic strategy lowers the cost from \( O(n^{3/2}) \) to \( O(n^{5/4}) \), and refined strategies achieve \( O(n \log n) \)which is a space lower bound within this model. Simulations demonstrate the resulting time-space trade-offs and resource scaling. Moreover, we construct and compile quantum circuits that factor \( N = 35 \), verifying the effectiveness of our method through noisy simulations. A more simplified experimental circuit for Regev's algorithm is executed on a superconducting quantum computer, with lattice-based post-processing successfully retrieving the factors. These results advance the practical feasibility of Regev-style quantum factoring and provide guidance for future theoretical and experimental developments.

Title: Deterministic coupling of ultracold atomic lattice to a suspended photonic waveguide
Authors: J. T. Hansen, F. Gargiulo, J. B. Mathiassen, J. H. Müller, E. S. Polzik, J.-B. Béguin
Abstract: The deterministic control of light-matter interactions at the level of single particles and on subwavelength scales is central to quantum optics and hybrid integrated quantum technologies. However, combining cold atom research with nanophotonic devices in a fully controllable platform remains a major experimental challenge. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic coupling of an ultracold atomic lattice to light propagating in suspended on-chip photonic circuits. These capabilities open avenues to address scalability challenges in neutral-atom quantum computers and simulators, enabling fast optical readout, efficient and subwavelength non-diffracting interaction zones, and genuine compatibility with integrated solid-state photon sources, detectors, and stop-band modulators. Beyond controllable quantum matter, the platform also enables in-situ imaging of evanescent fields of light and nanoscale structures, including prospects for three-dimensional scanning microscopy with non-invasive single-atom probes for quantum sensing applications.

Title: Doublon bound states in the continuum through giant atoms
Authors: Walter Rieck, Anton Frisk Kockum, Guangze Chen
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are spatially localized modes embedded in the spectrum of extended states, typically stabilized by symmetry or interference. While extensively studied in single-particle and linear systems, the many-body regime of BICs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that giant atoms, quantum emitters coupled nonlocally to structured waveguides, can host robust doublon BICs, i.e., two-photon bound states stabilized by destructive interference and interactions. We first analyze a driven two-photon emission process and show how doublon BICs arise and mediate decoherence-free interaction between distant atoms. We then demonstrate that these many-body BICs also emerge under natural, undriven dynamics via a virtual two-photon emission process in three-level giant atoms. Our results reveal an interference-based mechanism for stabilizing many-body localization in open quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum simulation, non-ergodic dynamics, and protected quantum information processing.

Title: General Machine Learning Algorithm for Quantum Teleportation
Authors: Allison Brattley, Tomas Opatrny, Kunal K. Das
Abstract: We present a general algorithm, based on machine learning, which can create optimal unitary operators to implement quantum teleportation in any system with well-defined set of measurements in a relevant entangled basis. We illustrate it with a collective spin model and demonstrate its versatility by applying it to teloportation of single and multiple qubit states, coherent and Dicke states, and for systems with prior distributions and unequal dimensions. All cases display significant regimes of quantum advantage over corresponding classical schemes with no entanglement. The algorithm offers the flexibility to choose a balance between target fidelity and computational cost.

Title: Universal learning of nonlocal entropy via local correlations in non-equilibrium quantum states
Authors: Hao Liao, Xuanqin Huang, Ping Wang
Abstract: Characterizing the nonlocal nature of quantum states is a central challenge in the practical application of large-scale quantum computation and simulation. Quantum mutual information (QMI), a fundamental nonlocal measure, plays a key role in quantifying entanglement and has become increasingly important in studying nonequilibrium quantum many-body phenomena, such as many-body localization and thermalization. However, experimental measurement of QMI remains extremely difficult, particularly for nonequilibrium states, which are more complex than ground states. In this Letter, we employ a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to establish a universal mapping between the QMI and local correlations only up to second order for nonequilibrium states generated by quenches in a one-dimensional disordered XXZ model. Our approach provides a practical method for experimentally extracting QMI, readily applicable in platforms such as superconducting qubits. Moreover, this work will establishes a general framework for reconstructing other nonlocal observables, including Fisher information and out-of-time-ordered correlators.

Title: Nonlinear stochastic and quantum motion from Coulomb forces
Authors: Luca Ornigotti, Darren W. Moore, Radim Filip
Abstract: Controllable nonlinear quantum interactions are a much sought after target for modern quantum technologies. They are typically difficult and costly to engineer for bespoke purposes. However controllable nonlinearities may have always been in reach via the natural and fundamental forces between quantum particles. The Coulomb interaction between charged particles is the simplest example. We show that after eliminating the harmonic part of the Coulomb force by an auxiliary linear force, the remaining reciprocal nonlinear part results in a directly observable non-reciprocal nonlinear effect: increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the coherent displacement of one particle, driven by the position noise, or uncertainty in quantum regime, in another particle. This essential evidence of nonlinear forces is present across large ranges of trap frequency and mass scales, as well as visible in both stochastic and quantum regimes.

Title: An Introduction to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
Authors: Alessandro Giovagnoli
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational quantum algorithm introduced to tackle classically intractable combinatorial optimization problems. This tutorial offers a comprehensive, first-principles introduction to QAOA and its properties, focusing on its application to Quadratic and Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO and PUBO) problems. The tutorial begins by outlining variational quantum circuits and QUBO problems, focusing on their key properties and the encoding of problem constraints through quadratic penalty terms. Next, it explores the QAOA in detail, covering its Hamiltonian formulation, gate decomposition, and example applications, along with their implementation and performance results. This is followed by an analysis of the algorithm's energy landscape, where proofs are provided for its symmetry and periodicity, and where a resulting parameter space reduction is proposed. Finally, the tutorial extends these concepts to PUBO problems by generalizing the results to higher-order Hamiltonians and discussing the associated symmetries and circuit construction.

Title: Cavity magnomechanical framework for a high-efficiency quantum battery
Authors: S.K. Singh, Ahmed A. Zahia, Jia-Xin Peng, M.Y. Abd-Rabboud
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a quantum battery architecture where two identical two-level atoms are charged by a cavity-magnomechanical system, which includes a microwave cavity, a magnon mode hosted in a YIG sphere, and phonon mode due to the deformation of the YIG sphere. The charging process relies on coherent energy exchange, where the atoms couple to the cavity, which in turn, it interacts with the magnon mode via a beam-splitter mechanism. By deriving the system Hamiltonian under the rotating-wave approximation and employing a Lindblad master equation to rigorously model dissipation, we analyze the complete dynamical evolution of the battery. Our study demonstrates that strong, resonant light-matter interactions are crucial for enhancing the key performance metrics: charging efficiency, stored energy, and ergotropy (extractable work). We systematically investigate the deleterious effects of detuning and decoherence, and critically, we uncover a non-trivial interplay between the system's coupling strengths. This reveals optimal operating regimes where constructive interference maximizes performance, while excessive coupling in specific channels can degrade it. Ultimately, our findings provide a quantitative framework for engineering high-efficiency quantum batteries in hybrid magnonic platforms, offering a design roadmap for future experimental realizations.

Title: Non-Hermitian topology in a single driven-dissipative Kerr-Cat qubit
Authors: Pei-Rong Han, Huiye Qiu, Hao-Long Zhang, Wen Ning, Zhen-Biao Yang, Shi-Biao Zheng
Abstract: The intriguing physical phenomena associated with exceptional points have established non-Hermitian physics as a frontier of modern research. Recent investigations have extended non-Hermitian physics into the fully quantum domain. However, existing studies predominantly concentrate on discrete-variable quantum systems, while non-Hermitian quantum effects in continuous-variable encoded systems remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the exceptional structure for a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit, realized with a Kerr nonlinear resonator. We find that the dissipation leads to a bidirectional jump between the two basis states of the cat qubit, which is in distinct contrast with the unidirectional jump associated with normal two-level systems. The competition between this jump and a single-photon drive gives arise to the emergence of third-order Liouvillian exceptional points (LEP3s), each corresponds to a crossing point of two lines of LEP2s. We further show that the LEP3 can exhibit the topological character of the Hamiltonian EP3s, which cannot be realized with a single qubit. Our work opens the possibility of realizing non-Hermitian phenomena with continuous-variable quantum systems.

Abstract: A computational model of adiabatic evolutionary quantum system (or AEQS, pronounced "eeh-ks") was introduced in [Yamakami,2022] as a sort of quantum annealing and its underlying input-driven Hamiltonians are generated quantum-algorithmically by various forms of quantum automata families (including 1qqaf's). We study an efficient way to accomplish certain machine learning tasks by training these AEQSs quantumly. When AEQSs are controlled by 1qqaf's, it suffices in essence to find an optimal 1qqaf that approximately solves a target relational problem. For this purpose, we develop a basic idea of approximately utilizing well-known quantum algorithms for quantum counting, quantum amplitude estimation, and quantum approximation. We then provide a rough estimation of the efficiency of our quantum learning algorithms for AEQSs.

Title: Tunable Bands in 1D Fractional Quantum Media
Authors: Brenden R. Guyette, Joshua M. Lewis, Lincoln D. Carr
Abstract: Fractional calculus has become an essential framework in geophysics, optics, and biological systems to capture long-range correlations and anomalous transport. In this article, we extend fractional calculus to explore a particle in a periodic potential, where the Schrödinger equation is generalized to its fractional form. This framework allows us to study how the Lévy index $q$ governs the formation and inversion of energy bands, offering a pathway to engineer new physical behaviors and device functionalities by tuning $q$ in periodic quantum systems. We solve the fractional Schrödinger equation for periodic rectangular potentials of varying height $V_0$, barrier thickness $L$, and well width $W$ using an imaginary-time evolution algorithm, and supplement the discrete energy dispersion through Gaussian process regression. Our analysis reveals a qualitative shift in the band structure at $q=2$, separating into regimes for $q>2$ and $q<2$. For $q > 2$, energy bands undergo an inverting transformation as symmetric minima emerge within the first Brillouin zone, shifting from $k=0$ toward $k=\pm \pi/a$ with increasing $q$. These degenerate minima define a Bloch-momentum qubit, suggesting an analog to valley degrees of freedom used in valleytronics. The response of the ground band scales with fractional order as $V_0^{-0.28\pm0.05}L^{-0.34\pm0.08}W^{-0.49\pm0.06}$, indicating tunable sensitivity to geometry. For $q < 2$, the effective mass near $k = 0$ decreases exponentially with $q$, yielding a universal effective mass of $0.15\pm0.01$ as $q \to 1$, demonstrating that the Lévy index serves as a tunable degree of freedom capable of driving band inversion, modulating the band gap, and reshaping carrier dynamics.

Title: Teleportation-based quantum state tomography
Authors: Gustavo Rigolin
Abstract: We explicitly show that the quantum teleportation protocol can be employed to completely reconstruct arbitrary two- and three-qubit density matrices. We also extend the present analysis to n-qubit density matrices. The only quantum resources needed to implement the teleportation-based quantum state tomography protocol are the ability to make Bell measurements and the ability to prepare a few different single qubit states to be teleported from Alice to Bob.

Title: HOPPS: Hardware-Aware Optimal Phase Polynomial Synthesis with Blockwise Optimization for Quantum Circuits
Authors: Xinpeng Li, Ji Liu, Shuai Xu, Paul Hovland, Vipin Chaudhary
Abstract: Blocks composed of {CNOT, Rz} are ubiquitous in modern quantum applications, notably in circuits such as QAOA ansatzes and quantum adders. After compilation, many of them exhibit large CNOT counts or depths, which lowers fidelity. Therefore, we introduce HOPPS: a SAT-based hardware-aware optimal phase polynomial synthesis algorithm that could generate {CNOT, Rz} blocks with CNOT count or depth optimality. Sometime {CNOT, Rz} blocks are large, such as in QAOA ansatzes, HOPPS's pursuit of optimality limits its scalability. To address this issue, we introduce an iterative blockwise optimization strategy: large circuits are partitioned into smaller blocks, each block is optimally refined, and the process is repeated for several iterations. Empirical results show that HOPPS is more efficient comparing with existing near optimal synthesis tools. Used as a peephole optimizer, HOPPS reduces the CNOT count by up to 50.0% and the CNOT depth by up to 57.1% under OLSQ. For large QAOA circuit, after mapping by Qiskit, circuit can be reduced CNOT count and depth by up to 44.4% and 42.4% by our iterative blockwise optimization.

Title: Quantum Key Distribution Based on Systematic Polar Coding
Authors: Georgi Bebrov (Technical University of Varna)
Abstract: Here we concerned with quantum key distribution - a way to establish common cryptographic key between several parties. The work proposes a combination between quantum key distribution and systematic polar coding (an error correction algorithm) frameworks - quantum key distribution based on systematic polar coding. This results in obtaining key rates greater than standard quantum key distribution (BB84) and its efficient version (eBB84) when finite-size regime and lower-error-rate quantum channel are considered.

Title: Processing Entangled Links Into Secure Cryptographic Keys
Authors: Marcel Kokorsch, Guido Dietl
Abstract: The following paper presents a holistic approach to the processing of entangled links within entanglement based quantum key distribution protocols, whose security relies on the Bell inequality. We investigate the interactions, and the collective impact, of the whole processing chain on the final secure key rate. This includes the quantum mechanical preprocessing in the form of entanglement distillation, processing of the entangled states via measurements and the necessary classical postprocessing based on the measurement results. Our investigations are based on the principle idea of the Eckert 1991 protocol and utilize the secret key capacity introduced by Devetak and Winter in 2005. Our results include a proof on what measurement bases need to be chosen to achieve this capacity for the case of Werner states. It also presents a new processing strategy and compares it with the most common one that can be found within the literature. Furthermore, it answers the question on how much entanglement distillation is optimal. By doing so we propose a unified formalism, describing the whole processing chain, that can be used to make quantitative statements on the relation between the quality and quantity of entangled but noisy quantum states used for generating secure keys.

Title: Noisy dynamics of confined quantum walks on a chip
Authors: L. Sansoni, E. Stefanutti, C. Benedetti, I. Gianani, C. Taballione, A. Toor, L. Herrera, M. Pistilli, S. Santoro, M. Barbieri, A. Chiuri
Abstract: Quantum walks represent an excellent testbed for investigating the interplay between unitary coherent and incoherent dissipative processes. Thanks to photonic quantum interferometers of considerable size, experimental studies could be performed, devoted to investigating the consequences of different sorts of realistic noise in these systems. In this work we employ a 20x20 on-chip multimode interferometer to introduce another key aspect in the problem: the presence of edges in the walker lattice, enforcing a confined evolution. We show how noise can disrupt translational symmetry and reshape interference patterns. The non trivial probability distributions obtained along the temporal evolution of the system demonstrate how speed up effects, localization and coherent oscillations are pillar concepts to be fully characterized and understood when applied in realistic quantum dynamics.

Title: Feature Ranking in Credit-Risk with Qudit-Based Networks
Authors: Georgios Maragkopoulos, Lazaros Chavatzoglou, Aikaterini Mandilara, Dimitris Syvridis
Abstract: In finance, predictive models must balance accuracy and interpretability, particularly in credit risk assessment, where model decisions carry material consequences. We present a quantum neural network (QNN) based on a single qudit, in which both data features and trainable parameters are co-encoded within a unified unitary evolution generated by the full Lie algebra. This design explores the entire Hilbert space while enabling interpretability through the magnitudes of the learned coefficients. We benchmark our model on a real-world, imbalanced credit-risk dataset from Taiwan. The proposed QNN consistently outperforms LR and reaches the results of random forest models in macro-F1 score while preserving a transparent correspondence between learned parameters and input feature importance. To quantify the interpretability of the proposed model, we introduce two complementary metrics: (i) the edit distance between the model's feature ranking and that of LR, and (ii) a feature-poisoning test where selected features are replaced with noise. Results indicate that the proposed quantum model achieves competitive performance while offering a tractable path toward interpretable quantum learning.

Title: Flexible Genetic Algorithm for Quantum Support Vector Machines
Authors: Nguyen Minh Duc, Vu Tuan Hai, Le Bin Ho, Tran Nguyen Lan
Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) is one of the most promising frameworks in quantum machine learning, yet their performance depends on the design of the feature map. Conventional approaches rely on fixed quantum circuits, which often fail to generalize across datasets. To address this limitation, we propose GA-QSVM, a hybrid framework that employs Genetic Algorithms (GA) to automatically optimize feature maps. The proposed method introduces a configurable framework that flexibly defines the evolutionary parameters, enabling the construction of adaptive circuits. Experimental evaluation of datasets, including Digits, Fashion, Wine, and Breast Cancer, demonstrates that GA-QSVMs achieve a comparable accuracy compared to classical SVMs and standard QSVMs. Furthermore, transfer learning results indicate that GA-QSVM's circuits generalize effectively across datasets. These findings highlight the potential of evolutionary strategies to automate and enhance kernel design for future quantum machine learning applications.

Title: Synchronized Aharonov-Bohm Motifs via Engineered Dissipation
Authors: Christopher W. Wächtler, Gloria Platero
Abstract: The interplay between external gauge fields and lattice geometry can induce extreme localization dynamics through complete destructive interference. We show that combining this flux-induced localization with engineered dissipation leads to robust spin synchronization in rotationally symmetric spin geometries, referred to as Aharonov-Bohm motifs, with cyclic symmetries of any order. The synchronized dynamics is independent of initial conditions and features entanglement among spins within each motif. We further demonstrate that multiple motifs can fully synchronize when coupled, which is achieved by applying additional collective dissipation acting on all intra-motif spins. These results reveal a direct connection between flux-induced localization, dissipative engineering, and collective quantum synchronization.

Title: Entropic Dynamics approach to Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Ariel Caticha
Abstract: Entropic dynamics (ED) is a framework that allows one to derive quantum theory as a Hamilton-Killing flow on the cotangent bundle of a statistical manifold. These flows are such that they preserve the symplectic and the (information) metric geometries; they explain the linearity of quantum mechanics and the appearance of complex numbers. In this paper the ED framework is extended to deal with local gauge symmetries. More specifically, on the basis of maximum entropy methods and information geometry, for an appropriate choice of ontic variables and constraints, we derive the quantum electrodynamics of radiation fields interacting with charged particles. As a test that despite its unorthodox foundation the ED approach is empirically successful we derive the Maxwell equations.

Title: A demonstration that classical gravity does not produce entanglement
Authors: Mike D. Schneider, Nick Huggett, Niels Linnemann
Abstract: Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect.

Title: Longitudinal Pulsed Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Transfer via Periodic Optimal Control
Authors: José P. Carvalho, Anders Bodholt Nielsen, David L. Goodwin, Nino Wili, Niels Chr. Nielsen
Abstract: Taking inspiration from NMR spectroscopy, periodic irradiation schemes have recently shown remarkable performance when implemented into pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) sequences. This has prompted considerable interest in development of broadband pulsed DNP sequences utilizing such schemes. On this background, most efforts have focused on solid-state NMR like transverse spin-locked pulse sequences whose performance in DNP applications may be compromised by the broadband capabilities of the initial excitation pulse. Leveraging the flexibility and robustness of optimal control theory combined with underlying insights from effective Hamiltonian theory, we present a new family of broadband DNP pulse sequences, termed LOOP (Longitudinally Optimized with Overarching Periodicity), that alleviates the excitation-pulse challenge by accomplishing longitudinal polarization transfer. These sequences define robust single-spin effective $z$ rotations, with impressive compensation towards microwave field inhomogeneity, and are capable of delivering DNP transfer with bandwidths exceeding 100 MHz, while employing a peak microwave field amplitude of only 32 MHz, at an external magnetic field of 0.35 T.

Title: Neural Architecture Search for Quantum Autoencoders
Authors: Hibah Agha, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Shinjae Yoo
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters. This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.

Title: Decoupling local classicality from classical explainability: A noncontextual model for bilocal classical theory and a locally-classical but contextual theory
Authors: Sina Soltani, Marco Erba, David Schmid, John H.Selby
Abstract: We construct an ontological model for the theory known as bilocal classical theory this http URL. To our knowledge, this is only the second time that an ontological model has been constructed for an entire theory, rather than just for some particular scenarios within a theory. This result refutes a conjecture from this http URL which suggested that there might be no local-realist ontological model for bilocal classical theory. Moreover, it is the first time that an ontological model has been constructed for a theory that fails to be locally tomographic, showing that the assumption of local tomography underpinning the structure theorem in this http URL is a genuine limitation of the theorem. This demonstrates that in general there is no tension between failures of local tomography and classical explainability (i.e., generalised noncontextuality). In fact, bilocal classical theory is in many ways more simply understood via the underlying ontological model than it is within its original formulation (much as how odd-dimensional stabiliser subtheories can be more simply understood via Spekkens' toy theory). Furthermore, this result naturally leads to the question, does every locally-classical theory admit of an ontological model? By constructing a concrete counterexample, we show that this is not the case. Our findings demonstrate that there is no straightforward relationship between theories being locally-classical, and them being classically-explainable. This shows that the fundamental status of compositional properties (such as local tomography) is not a technical side-issue, but a central and unavoidable question for a coherent understanding even of classicality itself.

Title: Performance Guarantees for Quantum Neural Estimation of Entropies
Authors: Sreejith Sreekumar, Ziv Goldfeld, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Estimating quantum entropies and divergences is an important problem in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning. Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|\Theta(\mathcal{U})|d/\epsilon^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $\Theta(\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $\epsilon$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|\Theta(\mathcal{U})|\mathrm{polylog}(d)/\epsilon^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice.

Authors: Ilnar Zinnatullin, Alexander Vasiliev
Abstract: Quantum hashing is a widely used technique in quantum computation that allows us to design space-efficient algorithms and protocols. Recently, Vasiliev has shown that the phase form of shallow quantum hashing can be implemented by a circuit of depth 2. In this paper, we establish a connection between shallow quantum hashing and single-qubit quantum hashing for the amplitude form. For a shallow circuit, we propose a circuit of depth 1 that achieves the same collision resistance.

Title: Quantitative and Optimal Device-Independent Lower Bounds on Detection Efficiency
Authors: Arkaprabha Ghosal, Soumyadip Patra, Peter Bierhorst
Abstract: This paper examines a quantitative and optimal lower bound on the detector efficiency in a (2,2,2) Bell experiment within a fully device-independent framework, whereby the detectors used in the experiment are uncharacterized. We provide a tight lower bound on the minimum efficiency required to observe a desired Bell-CHSH violation using the Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy, confirming tightness up to four decimal places with numerical optimization over explicit quantum realizations. We then introduce the effect of dark counts and demonstrate how to quantify the minimum required efficiency to observe a desired CHSH violation with an increasing dark count error. Finally, to obtain an analytical closed-form expression of the minimum efficiency, we consider the set of no-signaling behaviors that satisfy the Tsirelson bound, which are easier to characterize than the quantum set. Using such behaviors, we find a simple closed-form expression for a lower bound on the minimum efficiency which is monotonically increasing with the CHSH violation, though the analytically obtained lower bounds are meaningfully below the numerically tight lower bound.

Title: Simulating dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model: a comparative study of large-scale classical numerics
Authors: Joseph Vovrosh, Sergi Julià-Farré, Wladislaw Krinitsin, Michael Kaicher, Fergus Hayes, Emmanuel Gottlob, Augustine Kshetrimayum, Kemal Bidzhiev, Simon B. Jäger, Markus Schmitt, Joseph Tindall, Constantin Dalyac, Tiago Mendes-Santos, Alexandre Dauphin
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of many-qubit systems is an outstanding problem that has recently driven significant advances in both numerical methods and programmable quantum processing units. In this work, we employ a comprehensive toolbox of state-of-the-art numerical approaches to classically simulate the dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our methods include three different tensor network techniques -- matrix product states, tree-tensor networks, and two-dimensional tensor-networks under the belief propagation approximation -- as well as time-dependent variational Monte Carlo with Neural Quantum States. We focus on two paradigmatic dynamical protocols: (i) quantum annealing through a critical point and (ii) post-quench dynamics. Our extensive results show the quantitative predictions of various state-of-the-art numerical methods providing a benchmark for future numerical investigations and experimental studies with the aim to push the limitations on classical and QPUs. In particular, our work connects classical simulability to different regimes associated with quantum dynamics in Rydberg arrays - namely, quasi-adiabatic dynamics, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and quantum quenches.

Title: Entanglement-limited linear response in fermionic systems
Authors: Hadi Cheraghi, Ali G. Moghaddam, Teemu Ojanen
Abstract: We propose a general connection between entanglement-entropy scaling laws and the linear response functions of particle-conserving fermionic systems in their ground state. Specifically, we show that the response to perturbations coupled to the particle number within a finite region exhibits the same size scaling as the entanglement entropy of that region. We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume. Our work thus establishes a direct link between linear-response properties and many-body entanglement.

Title: Lightweight Error-Correction Code Encoders in Superconducting Electronic Systems
Authors: Yerzhan Mustafa, Berker Peköz, Selçuk Köse
Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3) codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.

Title: Lane-Frame Quantum Multimodal Driving Forecasts for the Trajectory of Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Navneet Singh, Shiva Raj Pokhrel
Abstract: Trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving must deliver accurate, calibrated multi-modal futures under tight compute and latency constraints. We propose a compact hybrid quantum architecture that aligns quantum inductive bias with road-scene structure by operating in an ego-centric, lane-aligned frame and predicting residual corrections to a kinematic baseline instead of absolute poses. The model combines a transformer-inspired quantum attention encoder (9 qubits), a parameter-lean quantum feedforward stack (64 layers, ${\sim}1200$ trainable angles), and a Fourier-based decoder that uses shallow entanglement and phase superposition to generate 16 trajectory hypotheses in a single pass, with mode confidences derived from the latent spectrum. All circuit parameters are trained with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), avoiding backpropagation through non-analytic components. In the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the model achieves minADE (minimum Average Displacement Error) of \SI{1.94}{m} and minFDE (minimum Final Displacement Error) of \SI{3.56}{m} in the $16$ models predicted over the horizon of \SI{2.0}{s}, consistently outperforming a kinematic baseline with reduced miss rates and strong recall. Ablations confirm that residual learning in the lane frame, truncated Fourier decoding, shallow entanglement, and spectrum-based ranking focus capacity where it matters, yielding stable optimization and reliable multi-modal forecasts from small, shallow quantum circuits on a modern autonomous-driving benchmark.

Title: A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Fine Tuned BERT for Text Classification
Authors: Abu Kaisar Mohammad Masum, Naveed Mahmud, M. Hassan Najafi, Sercan Aygun
Abstract: Fine-tuning BERT for text classification can be computationally challenging and requires careful hyper-parameter tuning. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of quantum algorithms to outperform conventional methods in machine learning and text classification tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates an n-qubit quantum circuit with a classical BERT model for text classification. We evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned classical-quantum BERT and demonstrate its feasibility as well as its potential in advancing this research area. Our experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model achieves performance that is competitive with, and in some cases better than, the classical baselines on standard benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates the adaptability of classical-quantum models for fine-tuning pre-trained models across diverse datasets. Overall, the hybrid model highlights the promise of quantum computing in achieving improved performance for text classification tasks.

Title: QDNA-ID Quantum Device Native Authentication
Authors: Osamah N. Neamah (Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Karabuk University, Karabuk, Turkey)
Abstract: QDNA-ID is a trust-chain framework that links physical quantum behavior to digitally verified records. The system first executes standard quantum circuits with random shot patterns across different devices to generate entropy profiles and measurement data that reveal device-specific behavior. A Bell or CHSH test is then used to confirm that correlations originate from genuine non classical processes rather than classical simulation. The verified outcomes are converted into statistical fingerprints using entropy, divergence, and bias features to characterize each device. These features and metadata for device, session, and random seed parameters are digitally signed and time stamped to ensure integrity and traceability. Authenticated artifacts are stored in a hierarchical index for reproducible retrieval and long term auditing. A visualization and analytics interface monitors drift, policy enforcement, and device behavior logs. A machine learning engine tracks entropy drift, detects anomalies, and classifies devices based on evolving patterns. An external verification API supports independent recomputation of hashes, signatures, and CHSH evidence. QDNA-ID operates as a continuous feedback loop that maintains a persistent chain of trust for quantum computing environments.

Title: Krylov Complexity in Canonical Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Meysam Motaharfar, Maxwell R. Siebersma, Parampreet Singh
Abstract: We explore Krylov complexity for two exactly solvable models, one in the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) quantum cosmology and another in loop quantum cosmology (LQC), for a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe sourced with a massless scalar field, which serves the role of clock. While the WDW quantization of this model cannot avoid the big bang/big crunch singularity, it is replaced by a big bounce in LQC. We construct the Krylov basis analytically by applying the Lanczos algorithm and evaluate both the Krylov state and operator complexity. In regimes where the wave function of the universe is sharply peaked, our results indicate that the Krylov complexity grows quadratically with the scalar field clock for the state and operator complexities in both the WDW quantum cosmology and LQC. We further show that operator complexity is exactly twice the state complexity in these regimes. We discuss the interpretation of the global behavior of these systems by calculating the Krylov entropy for both quantum cosmological frameworks. We observe that in LQC, the Krylov complexity and entropy remain finite at the bounce, whereas in the WDW quantum cosmology, they diverge at the big bang/crunch singularity. Our work paves the way for computing Krylov complexity in more intricate quantum cosmological models, including those exhibiting phenomena such as quantum chaos.

Title: Tensor network simulations of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model
Authors: Sebastian Grieninger, Jake Montgomery, Felix Ringer, Ismail Zahed
Abstract: Generalized Parton Distribution functions (GPDs) are off-diagonal light-cone matrix elements that encode the internal structure of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom. In this work, we present the first nonperturbative study of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED2), within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory. Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.

Title: Hyperbolic Dispersion and Low-Frequency Plasmons in Electrides
Authors: Qi-Dong Hao, Hao Wang, Hong-Xing Song, Xiang-Rong Chen, Hua Y. Geng
Abstract: Natural hyperbolic materials have attracted significant interest in the field of photonics due to their unique optical properties. Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials.

Title: Utilizing Circulant Structure to Optimize the Implementations of Linear Layers
Authors: Buji Xu, Xiaoming Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for optimizing the linear layer used in symmetric cryptography. It is observed that these matrices often have circulant structure. The basic idea of this work is to utilize the property to construct a sequence of transformation matrices, which allows subsequent heuristic algorithms to find more efficient implementations. Our results outperform previous works for various linear layers of block ciphers. For Whirlwind M0 , we obtain two implementations with 159 XOR counts (8% better than Yuan et al. at FSE 2025) and depth 17 (39% better than Shi et al. at AsiaCrypt 2024) respectively. For AES MixColumn, our automated method produces a quantum circuit with depth 10, which nearly matches the manually optimized state-of-the-art result by Zhang et al. at IEEE TC 2024, only with 2 extra CNOTs.

Title: Discrete Action, Graph Evolution, and the Hierarchy of Symmetries: A Rigorous Construction of Temporal Layers $C1 \to C2 \to C3 \to C4$
Authors: Medeu Abishev, Daulet Berkimbayev
Abstract: Postulating a minimal discrete quantum of action $S=\hbar$ and a simple rule for the growth of an oriented graph, we construct a strict hierarchy of temporal layers $C N$ with discrete periods $\tau_N=N\hbar/E$. Each layer is specified by its configuration space, symplectic structure, update rule, and emergent symmetry. At $C1$ the state is represented by a single oriented edge with $U(1)$ phase $e^{i E t/\hbar}$. The transition $C1 \to C2$ splits the edge into two independent flows, which yields canonical pairs $(x_a,p_a)$, local $U(1)$ invariance, and an effective $(2{+}1)$ metric with signature $(+--)$. The closure $C2 \to C3$ produces $SU(3)$ connections and an Einstein-Yang-Mills type action. We show that these structures follow from discrete-action principles, and that stochastic graph growth naturally provides mechanisms for decoherence and spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Authors: Matan Even Tzur, Chen Mor, Noa Yaffe, Michael Birk, Andrei Rasputnyi, Omer Kneller, Ido Nisim, Ido Kaminer, Maria Chekhova, Michael Krueger, Misha Ivanov, Nirit Dudovich, Oren Cohen
Abstract: Until recently, attosecond optical spectroscopy and quantum optics evolved along non-overlapping directions. In attosecond science, attosecond pulses have been regarded as classical waves, applied to probe electron dynamics on their natural time scale. Here, we transfer fundamental concepts of quantum optics into attosecond physics, enabling control of both the properties of the XUV attosecond pulses and the quantum fluctuations of matter on attosecond time scales. By combining bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) with a strong laser field to drive high-harmonic generation, we transfer the quantum properties of the BSV onto the resulting XUV attosecond pulses. Applying advanced attosecond interferometry, we reconstruct the quantum state of the XUV high harmonics and their associated attosecond pulses with attosecond precision. Finally, we resolve the squeezing of the electron's wavepacket during one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena - field induced tunneling. The ability to measure and control quantum correlations in both electrons and XUV attosecond pulses establishes a foundation for attosecond quantum electrodynamics, manipulating the quantum state of electrons and photons with sub-cycle precision.

Title: Neural network approximation of regularized density functionals
Authors: Mihály A. Csirik, Andre Laestadius, Mathias Oster
Abstract: Density functional theory is one of the most efficient and widely used computational methods of quantum mechanics, especially in fields such as solid state physics and quantum chemistry. From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.

Title: Quantum machine learning for efficient reduced order modelling of turbulent flows
Authors: Han Li, Yutong Lou, Dunhui Xiao
Abstract: Accurately predicting turbulent flows remains a central challenge in fluid dynamics due to their high dimensionality and intrinsic nonlinearity. Recent developments in quantum algorithms and machine learning offer new opportunities for overcoming the computational barriers inherent in turbulence modeling. Here we present a new hybrid quantum-classical framework that enables faster-than-real-time turbulence prediction by integrating machine learning, quantum computation, and fluid dynamics modeling, in particular, the reduced-order modeling. The novel framework combines quantum proper orthogonal decomposition (QPOD) with a quantum-enhanced deep kernel learning (QDKL) approach. QPOD employs quantum circuits to perform efficient eigenvalue decomposition for low-rank flow reconstruction, while QDKL exploits quantum entanglement and nonlinear mappings to enhance kernel expressivity and dynamic prediction accuracy. The new method is demonstrated on three benchmark turbulent flows, our architecture achieves significantly improved predictive accuracy at reduced model ranks, with training speeds up to 10 times faster and parameter counts reduced by a factor of 1/N compared to classical counterparts, where N is the input dimensionality. Although constrained by current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, our results demonstrate the potential of quantum machine learning to transform turbulence simulation and lay a solid foundation for scalable, real-time quantum fluid modeling in future quantum computers.

Title: Atomic magnetometry based on the ground-state Hanle effect in an elliptically polarized light wave
Authors: D.V. Brazhnikov, A.O. Makarov, K.S. Kozlova, A.N. Goncharov
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state Hanle effect in alkali-metal vapor irradiating by a resonant elliptically polarized light wave. The magneto-optical resonances are observed as a change in the ellipticity parameter of the light wave polarization when scanning the transverse magnetic field near zero. We use a miniature ($\approx\,$$0.125$ cm$^3$) glass cesium vapor cell heated to a relatively low temperature of $\approx\,$$85^\circ$C. Under the current experimental conditions, the sensitivity of magnetic field measurements is limited by a technical noise, reaching $180$ fT/$\surd$Hz in a $200$ Hz bandwidth. The ultimate photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of the method is estimated to be $\approx\,$$5$ fT/$\surd$Hz. The proposed scheme is promising for the development of a zero-field atomic magnetometer with reduced heat dissipation of the sensor head and relaxed requirements for magnetic shielding compared to counterparts operating in the spin-exchange relaxation-free regime. These features are of particular value for biomedical applications.

Title: Toward end-to-end quantum simulation of rapidly distorted turbulence
Authors: Zhaoyuan Meng, Leyu Chen, Jin-Peng Liu, Guowei He
Abstract: We propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm to simulate rapidly distorted turbulence via linear combination of Hamiltonian (LCHS). The algorithm comprises three primary stages: the efficient preparation of an initial turbulent state with a prescribed energy spectrum, its subsequent time evolution via LCHS, and the direct measurement of key turbulence statistics. Our analysis indicates that the algorithm can offer a practical quantum speedup over the classical simulation methods for a sufficiently large computational grid. We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for simulating a minimal instance of non-trivial turbulence with classical validation. The numerical results show excellent agreement with ground-truth solutions, capturing both the qualitative evolution of turbulent fields and the quantitative behavior of statistics, including the Reynolds stresses and the fluctuating velocity spectrum. Despite its linearity, rapidly distorted turbulence captures essential turbulence mechanisms and may inform the development of quantum algorithms for the Navier-Stokes equations. Our work establishes a foundation for addressing more complex turbulent phenomena on future fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Title: Web of Non-invertible Dualities for (2+1) Dimensional Models with Subsystem Symmetries
Authors: Avijit Maity, Vikram Tripathi, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy
Abstract: We extend non-invertible duality concepts from one-dimensional systems to two spatial dimensions by constructing a web of non-invertible dualities for lattice models with subsystem symmetries. For the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact.

Title: Micrometer thick single crystal iron-garnet films on a diamagnetic buffer layer for cryogenic applications

Abstract: This work advances the frontier of low-damping magnetic materials, directly addressing the demand for ultra-low-loss components in quantum computing and cryogenic electronics. Here we demonstrate a new approach to get single crystal micrometer-thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films with low damping through isolating and mitigating interfacial paramagnetic contributions of a paramagnetic substrate by a buffer-layer. The YIG films with the diamagnetic yttrium scandium gallium garnet buffer layer grown by liquid phase epitaxy on a gadolinium gallium substrate demonstrate homogeneity unprecedented for the thin planar YIG structures, yielding ferromagnetic resonance linewidths of 4.9 MHz at 4 K and 5.9 MHz at 16 mK, the lowest values reported to date. These results underscore the critical role of interfacial engineering in overcoming intrinsic material limitations, opening avenues for further optimization in spin-based technologies.

Title: YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ nano-constriction Josephson junctions and SQUIDs fabricated by focused helium-ion-beam irradiation
Authors: Christoph Schmid, Christopher Buckreus, David Haas, Max Pröpper, Robin Hutt, César Magén, Dominik Hanisch, Max Karrer, Meinhard Schilling, Dieter Koelle, Reinhold Kleiner, Edward Goldobin
Abstract: By focused $30\,\mathrm{keV}$ He ion beam irradiation, epitaxially grown YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) thin films can be driven from the superconducting to the insulating state with increasing irradiation dose. A properly chosen dose suppresses superconductivity down to $4\,\mathrm{K}$, while crystallinity is still preserved. With this approach we create areas of normal-conducting YBCO that can be used to define resistively shunted constriction-type Josephson junctions (cJJs) on the nanometer scale. We also demonstrate that the fabricated cJJs can be incorporated in direct current superconducting quantum interference devices and can be used as detector junctions in THz antennas.

Title: Neural surrogates for designing gravitational wave detectors
Authors: Carlos Ruiz-Gonzalez, Sören Arlt, Sebastian Lehner, Arturs Berzins, Yehonathan Drori, Rana X Adhikari, Johannes Brandstetter, Mario Krenn
Abstract: Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.

Title: Wigner and Gabor phase-space analysis of propagators for evolution equations
Authors: Elena Cordero, Gianluca Giacchi, Luigi Rodino
Abstract: We study the Wigner kernel and the Gabor matrix associated with the propagators of a broad class of linear evolution equations, including the complex heat, wave, and Hermite equations. Within the framework of time-frequency analysis, we derive explicit expressions for the Wigner kernels of Fourier multipliers and establish quantitative decay estimates for the corresponding Gabor matrices. These results are obtained under symbol regularity conditions formulated in the Gelfand-Shilov scale and ensure exponential off-diagonal decay or quasi-diagonality of the matrix representation. We believe this approach can be extended to more general symbols in the pseudodifferential setting, improving the existing results in terms of their Gabor matrix decay. For the complex heat equation, we obtain closed-form formulas exhibiting both dissipative and oscillatory behavior governed respectively by the real and imaginary parts of the diffusion parameter. The modulus of the Gabor matrix is shown to display Gaussian decay and temporal spreading consistent with diffusion phenomena. In contrast, the complex Hermite equation is analyzed via Hörmander's metaplectic semigroup, where the propagator decomposes as the product of a real Hermite semigroup and a fractional Fourier transform. In this setting, the Gabor matrix retains its Gaussian shape while undergoing a pure rotation on the time-frequency plane, reflecting the symplectic structure of the underlying flow. The analysis provides a unified operator-theoretic and phase-space perspective on parabolic and hyperbolic evolution equations, linking the geometry of their symbols with the sparsity and localization properties of their Gabor representations. Explicit formulas are given in a form suitable for numerical computation and visualization of phase-space dynamics.

Title: Robotic chip-scale nanofabrication for superior consistency
Authors: Felix M. Mayor, Wenyan Guan, Erik Szakiel, Amir H. Safavi-Naeini, Samuel Gyger
Abstract: Unlike the rigid, high-volume automation found in industry, academic research requires process flexibility that has historically relied on variable manual operations. This hinders the fabrication of advanced, complex devices. We propose to address this gap by automating these low-volume, high-stakes tasks using a robotic arm to improve process control and consistency. As a proof of concept, we deploy this system for the resist development of Josephson junction devices. A statistical comparison of the process repeatability shows the robotic process achieves a resistance spread across chips close to 2%, a significant improvement over the ~7% spread observed from human operators, validating robotics as a solution to eliminate operator-dependent variability and a path towards industrial-level consistency in a research setting.

Title: Globally Optimal Quantum Control
Authors: Denys I. Bondar, Llorenc Balada Gaggioli, Georgios Korpas, Jakub Marecek, Jiri Vala, Kurt Jacobs
Abstract: Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are nonconvex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present quantum control via polynomial optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but also provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.

Title: Gravitational cat states as a resource for quantum information processing
Authors: Atta ur Rahman, Ao-Xiang Liu, Saeed Haddadi, Cong-Feng Qiao
Abstract: We investigate how resourceful gravitational cat states are to preserve quantum correlations. In this regard, we explore the dynamics of gravitational cat states under different situations such as thermal, classical stochastic, general decaying, and power-law noisy fields. In particular, the one-way steerability, Bell non-locality, entanglement, and purity in two qubits are our main focus. We also address the weak measurement protocol on the dynamics of quantum correlations and purity of the state. Our results show that the gravitational cat states have a reliable and better capacity to preserve quantum correlations and remain one of the good resources for the deployment of quantum information processing protocols. Additionally, two independent channels are also employed and it is observed that only the weaker coupling regimes are effective in preserving quantum correlations. Notably, in terms of non-Markovian dynamics implication, quantum correlations are found to be longer preserved because of the information feedback phenomenon between the system and environment. Finally, we present a brief analysis to extend our gravitational model to include the electrostatic notion, providing insight into the key differences between the considered configurations.

Title: Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with key rates far above the PLOB bound
Authors: Arpan Akash Ray, Boris Skoric
Abstract: Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) at large distances has such high noise levels that the error-correcting code must have very low rate. In this regime it becomes feasible to implement random-codebook error correction, which is known to perform close to capacity. We propose a reverse reconciliation scheme for CVQKD in which the first step is advantage distillation based on random-codebook error correction operated above the Shannon limit. Our scheme has a novel way of achieving statistical decoupling between the public reconciliation data and the secret key. We provide an analysis of the secret key rate for the case of Gaussian collective attacks, and we present numerical results. The best performance is obtained when the message size exceeds the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ between Alice's quadratures $X$ and Bob's measurements $Y$, i.e. the Shannon limit. This somewhat counter-intuitive result is understood from a tradeoff between code rate and frame rejection rate, combined with the fact that error correction for QKD needs to reconcile only random data. We obtain secret key rates that lie far above the Devetak-Winter value $I(X;Y) - I(E;Y)$, which is the upper bound in the case of one-way error correction. Furthermore, our key rates lie above the PLOB bound for Continuous-Variable detection, but below the PLOB bound for Discrete-Variable detection.

Title: All You Need is pi: Quantum Computing with Hermitian Gates
Authors: Ben Zindorf, Sougato Bose
Abstract: Universal gate sets for quantum computation, when single and two qubit operations are accessible, include both Hermitian and non-Hermitian gates. Here we utilize the fact that any single-qubit operator may be implemented as two Hermitian gates, and thus a purely Hermitian universal set is possible. This implementation can be used to prepare high fidelity single-qubit states in the presence of amplitude errors, and helps to achieve a high fidelity single-qubit gate decomposition using four Hermitian gates. An implementational convenience can be that non-identity single-qubit Hermitian gates are equivalent to $\pi$ rotations up to a global phase. We show that a gate set comprised of $\pi$ rotations about two fixed axes, along with the CNOT gate, is universal for quantum computation. Moreover, we show that two $\pi$ rotations can transform the axis of any multi-controlled unitary, a special case being a single CNOT sufficing for any controlled $\pi$ rotation. These gates simplify the process of circuit compilation in view of their Hermitian nature. We exemplify by designing efficient circuits for a variety of controlled gates, and achieving a CNOT count reduction for the four-controlled Toffoli gate in LNN-restricted qubit connectivity.

Title: Optomechanical Backaction in the Bistable Regime
Authors: L. F. Deeg, D. Zoepfl, N. Diaz-Naufal, M. L. Juan, A. Metelmann, G. Kirchmair
Abstract: With a variety of realisations, optomechanics utilizes its light matter interaction to test fundamental physics. By coupling the phonons of a mechanical resonator to the photons in a high quality cavity, control of increasingly macroscopic objects has become feasible. In such systems, state manipulation of the mechanical mode is achieved by driving the cavity. To be able to achieve high drive powers the system is typically designed such that it remains in a linear response regime when driven. A nonlinear response and especially bistability in a driven cavity is often considered detrimentally to cooling and state preparation in optomechanical systems and is avoided in experiments. Here we show, that with an intrinsic nonlinear cavity backaction cooling of a mechanical resonator is feasible operating deeply within the nonlinear regime of the cavity. With our theory taking the nonlinearity into account, precise predictions on backaction cooling can be achieved even with a cavity beyond the bifurcation point, where the cavity photon number spectrum starts to deviate from a typical Lorentzian shape.

Title: Explaining Bell Locally
Authors: Charles Alexandre Bédard
Abstract: In the Heisenberg picture of unitary quantum theory, Bell inequalities are violated with local elements of reality interacting locally. Here is how: Upon measuring her particle of the entangled pair, Alice -- like other coupled systems -- smoothly and locally evolves into two non-interacting versions of herself, each of which records a different outcome: she foliates. Everything that suitably interacts with the Alices foliates in turn, generating worlds which, for all practical purposes, remain distinct and autonomous. At spacelike separation, an analogous yet independent process occurs to Bob when he measures his particle, locally differentiating him and his surroundings into two non-interacting instances. To confirm the violation of Bell inequalities, Alice and Bob must further interact to produce a record of the joint outcomes. The record arises from the two local worlds of Alice, and those of Bob, and foliates into four instances: '00', '01', '10' and '11'. The outcomes that win the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt (CHSH) game sum to a measure of $\cos^2(\pi/8)$.

Title: Ontological States in Non-Interacting Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Marcel van Kessel
Abstract: This is a paper in the field of ontological deterministic theories behind Quantum Field Theories, like for example the cellular automaton theories proposed by 't Hooft. In these theories one has ontological states in which the state of reality is exactly known and no uncertainties are present. Also these states evolve in time deterministically. A first step in finding the ontological deterministic theory behind the Standard Model is to find in Quantum Field Theory the states that behave as ontological states. We present the ontological states for all non-interacting (3+1-dimensional) Quantum Field Theories occurring in the Standard Model. We summarize the ontological states for free scalar bosons and for free masless Dirac fermions, which are known from the literature. We construct the ontological states for vector bosons, in analogy to the scalar boson case. With this we have a set of ontological states for all particles that are known to occur in reality and in the Standard Model.

Title: Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Hidden Shift Circuits via Confluent Rewriting of Symbolic Sums
Authors: Matthew Amy, Lucas Shigeru Stinchcombe
Abstract: Implementations of Roetteler's shifted bent function algorithm have in recent years been used to test and benchmark both classical simulation algorithms and quantum hardware. These circuits have many favorable properties, including a tunable amount of non-Clifford resources and a deterministic output, and moreover do not belong to any class of quantum circuits that is known to be efficiently simulable. We show that this family of circuits can in fact be simulated in polynomial time via symbolic path integrals. We do so by endowing symbolic sums with a confluent rewriting system and show that this rewriting system suffices to reduce the circuit's path integral to the hidden shift in polynomial time. We hence resolve an open conjecture about the efficient simulability of this class of circuits.

Title: Preparing Spin Squeezed States via Adaptive Genetic Algorithm
Authors: Yiming Zhao, Libo Chen, Yong Wang, Hongyang Ma, Xiaolong Zhao
Abstract: We introduce a novel strategy employing an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) for iterative optimization of control sequences to generate quantum nonclassical states. Its efficacy is demonstrated by preparing spin-squeezed states in an open collective spin model governed by a linear control field. Inspired by Darwinian evolution, the algorithm iteratively refines control sequences using crossover, mutation, and elimination strategies, starting from a coherent spin state within a dissipative and dephasing environment. We rigorously benchmark our method against constant control protocols and reinforcement learning, demonstrating competitive and robust performance. Furthermore, we showcase the GA's versatility by directly optimizing for metrologically relevant squeezing, achieving scalable performance, even in the presence of dissipation and thermal noise. The proposed strategy demonstrates a high state-preparation fidelity, exceeding 0.99, and provides a long time window for maintaining the spin squeezed state, even under dissipative conditions. We discuss feasible experimental implementations and potential extensions to alternative quantum systems, and the adaptability of the GA module. This research establishes the foundation for utilizing GA-like strategies in controlling quantum systems and achieving desired nonclassical states.

Title: Diamagnetic microchip traps for levitated nanoparticle entanglement experiments
Authors: Shafaq Gulzar Elahi, Martine Schut, Andrew Dana, Alexey Grinin, Sougato Bose, Anupam Mazumdar, Andrew Geraci
Abstract: The Quantum Gravity Mediated Entanglement (QGEM) protocol offers a novel method to probe the quantumness of gravitational interactions at non-relativistic scales. This protocol leverages the Stern-Gerlach effect to create $\mathcal{O}(\sim \mu m)$ spatial superpositions of two nanodiamonds (mass $\sim 10^{-15}$ kg) with NV spins, which are then allowed to interact and become entangled solely through the gravitational interaction. Since electromagnetic interactions such as Casimir-Polder and dipole-dipole interactions dominate at this scale, screening them to ensure the masses interact exclusively via gravity is crucial. In this paper, we propose using magnetic traps based on micro-fabricated wires, which provide strong gradients with relatively modest magnetic fields to trap nanoparticles for interferometric entanglement experiments. The design consists of a small trap to cool the center-of-mass motion of the nanodiamonds and a long trap with a weak direction suitable for creating macroscopic superpositions. In contrast to permanent-magnet-based long traps, the micro-fabricated wire-based approach allows fast switching of the magnetic trapping and state manipulation potentials and permits integrated superconducting shielding, which can screen both electrostatic and magnetic interactions between nanodiamonds in a gravitational entanglement experiment. The setup also provides a possible platform for other tests of quantum coherence in macroscopic systems and searches for novel short-range forces.

Title: Belief propagation for general graphical models with loops
Authors: Pedro Hack, Jonas Hitter, Christian B. Mendl, Alexandru Paler
Abstract: There is an increasing interest in scaling tensor network methods through belief propagation (BP), as well as increasing the accuracy of BP through tensor network methods. We develop a unification framework that takes an arbitrary graphical model with loops and provides message passing update rules and inference equations. We show that recent state-of-the-art methods regarding tensors and BP, like block belief propagation and tensor network message passing, are special instances of our framework. From a practical perspective, we discuss how our framework can be useful to understand the benefits of scheduling in BP, and show how it can be used for decoding purposes in quantum error correction. We simulate the computation of marginals, internal energy, Shannon entropy and the partition function on synthetic topologies (Kagome lattice and lattices resembling quantum error-correcting codes) and a real world topology of a power grid. The results show orders of magnitude accuracy increases for modest computational overheads. For the marginals, for example, we show that our framework can achieve an accuracy improvement of more than six orders of magnitude over tensor network BP.

Title: Resource-efficient quantum correlation measurements via multicopy neural network methods
Authors: Patrycja Tulewicz, Karol Bartkiewicz, Adam Miranowicz, Franco Nori
Abstract: Measuring complex properties in quantum systems, such as measures of quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality, is inherently challenging. Traditional methods, like quantum state tomography (QST), necessitate a full reconstruction of the density matrix for a given system and demand resources that scale exponentially with system size. We propose an alternative strategy that reduces the required information by combining multicopy measurements with artificial neural networks (ANNs), resulting in a 67\% reduction in measurement requirements compared to QST. We have successfully measured two-qubit quantum correlations of Bell states subjected to a depolarizing channel (resulting in Werner states) and an amplitude damping channel (leading to Horodecki states) using the multicopy approach on real quantum hardware. Our experiments, conducted with transmon qubits on IBMQ processors, quantified the violation of Bell's inequality and the negativity of two-qubit entangled states. We compared these results with those obtained from the standard QST approach and applied a maximum likelihood method to mitigate noise. We trained ANNs to estimate entanglement and nonlocality measures using optimized sets of projections identified through Shapley's (SHAP) analysis for the Werner and Horodecki states. The ANN output, based on this reduced set of projections, aligns well with expected values and enhances noise robustness. This approach simplifies and improves the error-robustness of multicopy measurements, eliminating the need for complex nonlinear equation analysis. It represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted quantum measurements, making practical implementation on current quantum hardware more feasible.

Title: Bounds on concatenated entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes
Authors: Nihar Ranjan Dash, Sanjoy Dutta, R. Srikanth, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: Code concatenation combines two or more component codes to design larger codes with greater noise resilience. Introducing entanglement assistance to concatenated codes provides a further advantage in terms of improved error rates and beating certain bounds on codes that would otherwise be unbeatable. First, we derive the general expression for the shared entanglement of a concatenated code and show that the number of ebits can depend on the order of concatenating the component entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs). We further construct families of pairs of EAQECCs such that the number of ebits of the resultant of concatenating the two codes in a given pair is order independent. Second, we derive conditions on code distance under which non-maximal-entanglement EAQECCs obtained from a classical quaternary Griesmer or Plotkin code saturate the entanglement-assisted (EA) Griesmer or linear EA Plotkin bound, respectively, extending the known result for maximal-entanglement EAQECCs. Furthermore, we present several families of such nonmaximal-entanglement EAQECCs. Third, we derive an EA version of the quantum Griesmer-Rains bound on the number of correctable errors for EAQECCs. Finally, we present families of pairs of EAQECCs such that the violation of the EA Hamming bound by the resultant of concatenating the two codes in a given pair is order dependent.

Title: Entanglement in cyclic sign invariant quantum states
Authors: Aabhas Gulati, Ion Nechita, Satvik Singh
Abstract: We introduce and study bipartite quantum states that are invariant under the local action of the cyclic sign group. Due to symmetry, these states are sparse and can be parameterized by a triple of vectors. Their important semi-definite properties, such as positivity and positivity under partial transpose (PPT), can be simply characterized in terms of these vectors and their discrete Fourier transforms. We study in detail the entanglement properties of this family of symmetric states, showing that it contains PPT entangled states. For states that are diagonal in the Dicke basis, deciding separability is equivalent to a circulant version of the complete positivity problem. In local dimension d <= 5, we completely characterize these sets and construct entanglement witnesses; some partial results are also obtained for d = 6, 7. We construct a new family of states for which the properties of PPT and separability can be characterized for all dimensions, generalizing results from the literature. Our results show that this class of symmetric states has a rich entanglement structure, even in the bosonic subspace.

Title: Advancing quantum imaging through learning theory
Authors: Yunkai Wang, Changhun Oh, Junyu Liu, Liang Jiang, Sisi Zhou
Abstract: We study quantum imaging by applying the resolvable expressive capacity (REC) formalism developed for physical neural networks (PNNs). In this paradigm of quantum learning, the imaging system functions as a physical learning device that maps input parameters to measurable features, while complex practical tasks are handled by training only the output weights, enabled by the systematic identification of well-estimated features (eigentasks) and their corresponding sample thresholds. Using this framework, we analyze both direct imaging and superresolution strategies for compact sources, defined as sources with sizes bounded below the Rayleigh limit. In particular, we introduce the orthogonalized SPADE method-a nontrivial generalization of existing superresolution techniques-that achieves superior performance when multiple compact sources are closely spaced. This method relaxes the earlier superresolution studies' strong assumption that the entire source must lie within the Rayleigh limit, marking an important step toward developing more general and practically applicable approaches. Using the example of face recognition, which involve complex structured sources, we demonstrate the superior performance of our orthogonalized SPADE method and highlight key advantages of the quantum learning approach-its ability to tackle complex imaging tasks and enhance performance by selectively extracting well-estimated features.

Title: Digital quantum simulation of bosonic systems and quantum complementarity
Authors: Victor P. Brasil, Diego S. Starke, Jonas Maziero
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation (DQS) has emerged as a powerful approach to investigate complex quantum systems using digital quantum computers. Such systems, like many-particle bosonic systems and intricate optical experimental setups, pose significant challenges for classical simulation methods. In this paper, we utilize a general formalism for the DQS of bosonic systems, which consists of mapping bosonic operators to Pauli operators using the Gray code, in order to simulate interferometric variants of Afshar's experiment -- an intricate optical experiment -- on IBM's quantum computers. We investigated experiments analogous to Afshar's double-slit experiment performed by Unruh and Pessoa Júnior, exploring discussions on the apparent violation of Bohr's complementarity principle when considering the entire experimental setup. Based on the aforementioned experiments, we construct a variation of a delayed-choice setup. We also explore another experiment starting with a two-photon initial state. Finally, we analyze these experiments within the framework of an updated quantum complementarity principle, which applies to specific quantum state preparations and remains consistent with the foundational principles of Quantum Mechanics.

Title: Information-theoretic principle of emergent 1-form symmetries
Authors: Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system. They can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose that the emergence of 1-form symmetries is information-theoretic in nature, precisely characterized by the preservation of information about how quantum states transform under the symmetry. As a consequence, the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition which we argue to be revealed from the long-range entanglement in the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to efficiently detect 1-form symmetries with a global quantum error correction (QEC) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As a practical application of our framework, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately determined by a disorder parameter. We further argue that our proposed theory for emergent 1-form symmetries offers new perspectives on particle condensation and suggests sharp information-theoretic phase boundaries between Higgs and confining regimes in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.

Title: Capturing an Electron in the Virtual State
Authors: Alok Nath Singh, Bibek Bhandari, Rafael Sánchez, Andrew N. Jordan
Abstract: We address a foundational question in quantum mechanics: Can a particle be directly found in a classically forbidden virtual state? We instantiate this conceptual question by investigating the traversal of electrons through a tunnel barrier, which we define in a triple quantum dot (TQD) system where the occupation of the central dot is energetically avoided. The motivation behind this setup is to answer whether the central dot is occupied or not during a virtual transition when it is being explicitly monitored. We investigate this problem in two different limits of continuous measurements: the stochastic quantum diffusion and the quantum jump. We find that, even though individual trajectories differ considerably across these limits, measuring leads to a higher occupation in the central dot on average. Our results demonstrate that the act of observation fundamentally reshapes tunneling dynamics, resolving the seeming paradox of detecting a particle in a classically forbidden region: weak measurements partially localize the particle, while strong measurements enforce a discontinuous either/or detection or no detection outcome.

Title: Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes
Authors: Nasrin Estaji, Ismaeil Abdolhosseini Sarsari, Gergő Thiering, Adam Gali
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.

Title: Superradiance in dense atomic samples
Authors: I. M. de Araújo, H. Sanchez, L. F. Alves da Silva, M. H. Y. Moussa
Abstract: Here we present an approach to the problem of superradiance in dense atomic samples, when dipolar interactions arise between atoms. Our treatment consists of the sequential use of the Holstein-Primakoff and mean-field approximations, from which we derive master equations for the strong and weak couplings of the sample with the reservoir. We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.

Title: Limits of absolute vector magnetometry with NV centers in diamond
Authors: Dennis Lönard, Isabel Cardoso Barbosa, Stefan Johansson, Jonas Gutsche, Artur Widera
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has become a widely used platform for quantum sensing. The four NV axes in mono-crystalline diamond specifically allow for vector magnetometry, with magnetic-field sensitivities reaching down to $\mathrm{fT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The current literature primarily focuses on improving the precision of NV-based magnetometers. Here, we study the experimental accuracy of determining the magnetic field from measured spin-resonance frequencies via solving the NV Hamiltonian. We derive exact, analytical, and fast-to-compute formulas for calculating resonance frequencies from a known magnetic-field vector, and vice versa, formulas for calculating the magnetic-field vector from measured resonance frequencies. Additionally, the accuracy of often-used approximations is assessed. Finally, we promote using the Voigt profile as a fit model to determine the linewidth of measured resonances accurately. An open-source Python package accompanies our analysis.

Title: Quantum Search on Computation Trees
Authors: Jevgēnijs Vihrovs
Abstract: We show a simple generalization of the quantum walk algorithm for search in backtracking trees by Montanaro (ToC 2018) to the case where vertices can have different times of computation. If a vertex $v$ in the tree of depth $D$ is computed in $t_v$ steps from its parent, then we show that detection of a marked vertex requires $\text{O}(\sqrt{TD})$ queries to the steps of the computing procedures, where $T = \sum_v t_v^2$. This framework provides an easy and convenient way to re-obtain a number of other quantum frameworks like variable time search, quantum divide & conquer and bomb query algorithms. The underlying algorithm is simple, explicitly constructed, and has low poly-logarithmic factors in the complexity. As a corollary, this gives a quantum algorithm for variable time search with unknown times with optimal query complexity $\text{O}(\sqrt{T \log \min(n,t_{\max})})$, where $T = \sum_i t_i^2$ and $t_{\max} = \max_i t_i$ if $t_i$ is the number of steps required to compute the $i$-th variable. This resolves the open question of the query complexity of variable time search, as the matching lower bound was recently shown by Ambainis, Kokainis and Vihrovs (TQC'23). As another result, we obtain an $\widetilde{\text{O}}(n)$ time algorithm for the geometric task of determining if any three lines among $n$ given intersect at the same point, improving the $\text{O}(n^{1+\text{o}(1)})$ algorithm of Ambainis and Larka (TQC'20).

Title: Rank-based entanglement detection for PPT entangled states
Authors: Aabhas Gulati
Abstract: We develop a new method for entanglement detection in bipartite quantum states by using the violation of the rank-1-generated property of matrices. The positive-semidefinite matrices form a convex cone that has extremal elements of rank 1. But, convex conic subsets resulting from the presence of linear constraints allow extremal elements of rank >= 2. The problem of deciding when a matrix is rank-1 generated, i.e, a sum of rank-1 positive-semidefinite (PSD) matrices, has been studied extensively in optimization theory. This rank-1 generated property acts as an entanglement criterion, and we use this property to find novel classes of PPT (Positive under partial transposition) entangled states. We do this by mapping some faces of PPT density matrices to convex cones that are not rank-1 generated. We show that all separable states map to a rank-1 generated matrix. In general, the same is not true for the corresponding mapping of PPT entangled states. We also extend this approach to construct PPT entangled edge states. Finally, we provide witnesses that detect violations of the rank-1 generated property.

Title: The Dirac--Bergmann approach to optimal control theory
Authors: Davit Aghamalyan, Aleek Maity, Varun Narasimhachar, V V Sreedhar
Abstract: We present a novel framework for optimal control in both classical and quantum systems. Our approach leverages the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm: a systematic method for formulating and solving constrained dynamical systems. In contrast to the standard Pontryagin Principle, which is used in control theory, our approach bypasses the need to perform a variation to obtain the optimal solution. Instead, the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm generates the optimal solution automatically, through the closure of the Poission Bracket algebra of the full set of constraints and the Hamiltonian. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through two quintessential examples: (1) the classical brachistochrone problem and (2) the time-optimal control of a generic quantum system, relevant for quantum technological applications. In the latter example, both closed and open quantum systems are discussed.

Title: SAQR-QC: A Logic for Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning about Quantum Circuits
Authors: Nengkun Yu, Jens Palsberg, Thomas Reps
Abstract: Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.

Title: Private Quantum Database
Authors: Giancarlo Gatti, Floris Geerts, Rihan Hai
Abstract: Quantum databases open an exciting new frontier in data management by offering privacy guarantees that classical systems cannot match. Traditional engines tackle user privacy, which hides the records being queried, or data privacy, which prevents a user from learning more than she has queried. We propose a quantum database that protects both by leveraging quantum mechanics: when the user measures her chosen basis, the superposition collapses and the unqueried rows become physically inaccessible. We encode relational tables as a sequence of Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) over mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), transmit a bounded number of quantum states, and let a single, destructive measurement reconstruct only the selected tuple. This allows us to preserve data privacy and user privacy at once without trusted hardware or heavyweight cryptography. Moreover, we envision a novel hybrid quantum-classical architecture ready for early deployment, which ensures compatibility with the limitations of today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.

Title: Quantum Physical Unclonable Function based on Chaotic Hamiltonians
Authors: Soham Ghosh, Holger Boche, Marc Geitz
Abstract: Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs) are hardware-based cryptographic primitives with strong theoretical security. This security stems from their modeling as Haar-random unitaries. However, implementing such unitaries on Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices is challenging due to exponential simulation complexity. Previous work tackled this using pseudo-random unitary designs but only under limited adversarial models with only black-box query access. In this paper, we propose a new QPUF construction based on chaotic quantum dynamics. We modeled the QPUF as a unitary time evolution under a chaotic Hamiltonian and proved that this approach offers security comparable to Haar-random unitaries. Intuitively, we show that while chaotic dynamics generate less randomness than ideal Haar unitaries, the randomness is still sufficient to make the QPUF unclonable in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that the evolution time required to achieve security scales linearly with number of qudits used in the scheme and can be kept public. We identified the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model as a candidate for the QPUF Hamiltonian. Recent experiments using nuclear spins and cold atoms have shown progress toward achieving this goal. Inspired by recent experimental advances, we present a schematic architecture for realizing our proposed QPUF device based on optical Kagome Lattice with disorder. For adversaries with only query access, we also introduce an efficiently simulable pseudo-chaotic QPUF. Our results lay the preliminary groundwork for bridging the gap between theoretical security and the practical implementation of QPUFs for the first time.

Title: Absence of local conserved charges of the Fredkin spin chain and its truncated versions
Authors: Wen-Ming Fan, Kun Hao, Yang-Yang Chen, Kun Zhang, Xiao-Hui Wang, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: Conservation laws serve as the hallmark of integrability. The absence of conserved charges typically implies that the model is nonintegrable. The recently proposed Fredkin spin chain exhibits rich structures, and its ground state is analytically known. However, whether the Fredkin spin chain is integrable remains an open question. In this work, through rigorous analytical calculations, we demonstrate that the Fredkin spin chain, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, lacks local conserved charges, thereby confirming its nonintegrable nature. Furthermore, we find that when one or a portion of the Hamiltonian terms are removed (referred to as the truncated Fredkin spin chain), local conserved charges are still absent. Our findings suggest that in models involving three-site interactions, integrable models are generally rare.

Title: Computational complexity of Berry phase estimation in topological phases of matter
Authors: Ryu Hayakawa, Kazuki Sakamoto, Chusei Kiumi
Abstract: The Berry phase is a fundamental quantity in the classification of topological phases of matter. In this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm and several complexity-theoretical results for the Berry phase estimation (BPE) problems. Our new quantum algorithm achieves BPE in a more general setting than previously known quantum algorithms, with a theoretical guarantee. For the complexity-theoretic results, we consider three cases. First, we prove $\mathsf{BQP}$-completeness when we are given a guiding state that has a large overlap with the ground state. This result establishes an exponential quantum speedup for estimating the Berry phase. Second, we prove $\mathsf{dUQMA}$-completeness when we have $\textit{a priori}$ bound for ground state energy. Here, $\mathsf{dUQMA}$ is a variant of the unique witness version of $\mathsf{QMA}$ (i.e., $\mathsf{UQMA}$), which we introduce in this paper, and this class precisely captures the complexity of BPE without the known guiding state. Remarkably, this problem turned out to be the first natural problem contained in both $\mathsf{UQMA}$ and $\mathsf{co}$-$\mathsf{UQMA}$. Third, we show $\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{dUQMA[log]}}$-hardness and containment in $\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{PGQMA[log]}}$ when we have no additional assumption. These results advance the role of quantum computing in the study of topological phases of matter and provide a pathway for clarifying the connection between topological phases of matter and computational complexity.

Title: Lower Bounds for Hamiltonian Parameter Learning from Time Evolution
Authors: Ziyun Chen, Jerry Li
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning Hamiltonians from time evolution: for a Hamiltonian $P = \sum_{P} \alpha_P P$, where the sum is taken over all Pauli matrices, given the ability to apply $e^{-iHt}$, the goal is to approximately recover the coefficients $\alpha_P$ of the Hamiltonian. This is a well-studied problem in quantum learning theory, with applications to quantum metrology, sensing, device benchmarking, and many-body physics. For this problem, we demonstrate the first lower bounds which scale with the number of parameters of the unknown Hamiltonian. When the unknown Hamiltonian is arbitrary, we show that learning the coefficients to entry-wise error $\epsilon$ requires $2^{(1/2 - o(1))n} / \epsilon$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian. If the Hamiltonian is additionally assumed to be $k$-local, we show that learning the coefficients to entry-wise constant error requires $n^{\Omega (k)}$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian, resolving an open question of Bakshi, Liu, Moitra, and Tang. These bounds immediately imply that any learning algorithm with inverse polynomial time resolution requires super-polynomial total evolution time. Our lower bounds hold even for very simple planted spike detection problems, where the goal is to decide whether or not there is a single coefficient which is super-polynomially larger than the other coefficients of the Hamiltonian. Our lower bound also holds in natural average-case settings, suggesting that this hardness is likely unavoidable in many natural settings, without additional structure.

Title: Application Scale Quantum Circuit Compilation with Controlled Error
Authors: Justin Kalloor, Lucas Kovalsky, Mathias Weiden, John Kubiatowicz, Ed Younis, Costin Iancu, Mohan Sarovar
Abstract: Compilation and optimization of quantum circuits are critical components in the execution of algorithms on quantum computers. These components must successfully balance two competing priorities: minimizing the number of expensive resources, such as two-qubit gates or arbitrary angle single-qubit rotations, and minimizing the approximation error of the compiled circuit to the ideal target unitary describing the quantum algorithm. We develop a practical workflow for managing and optimizing this tradeoff, which enables quantum circuit compilation and optimization at scales of hundreds of qubits. Our workflow is able to tackle circuits at such large scales while providing rigorous guarantees on circuit output error by leveraging circuit partitioning and the notion of averaging over circuit ensembles. We demonstrate our workflow on several benchmark algorithmic circuits acting on up to 380 qubits, and show that it can simultaneously achieve substantial reductions in resource-intensive gates and control output errors, offering a practical and scalable strategy for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: Parametric phase modulation in superconducting circuits
Authors: Zhuang Ma, Xianke Li, Hongyi Shi, Ruonan Guo, Jianwen Xu, Xinsheng Tan, Yang Yu
Abstract: Parametric modulation, valued for its versatility, is widely employed in superconducting circuits for quantum simulations and high-fidelity two-qubit gates. Conventionally, the qubit coupling strength is determined by the amplitude of the parametric flux pulse, which affects the qubit parameters dramatically. In this paper, we propose and implement a phase-modulation scheme to tune the interaction strength via adjustment of the relative phase between the parametric flux pulses applied to two coupled qubits. We characterize this modulation for sideband couplings, at both sweet and off-sweet spots, achieving a broad range of coupling strengths, as confirmed by both population dynamics and spectroscopy methods. This approach enables phase-controlled modulation of coupling strength, providing a promising candidate for parametrically driven quantum simulations and gate operations.

Title: Reducing measurements in quantum erasure correction by quantum local recovery
Authors: Ryutaroh Matsumoto
Abstract: As measurements are costly and prone to errors on certain quantum computing devices, we should reduce the number of measurements and the number of measured qudits as small as possible in quantum erasure correction. It is intuitively obvious that a decoder can omit measurements of stabilizers that are irrelevant to erased qudits, but this intuition has not been rigorously formalized as far as the author is aware. In this paper, we formalize relevant stabilizers sufficient to correct erased qudits with a quantum stabilizer code, by using a recent idea from quantum local recovery. The minimum required number of measured stabilizer observables is also clarified. As an application, we also show that correction of $\delta$ erasures on a generalized surface code proposed by Delfosse, Iyer and Poulin requires at most $\delta$ measurements of vertexes and at most $\delta$ measurements of faces, independently of its code parameters.

Title: Non-Markovian dynamics in nonstationary Gaussian baths
Authors: Vladislav Sukharnikov, Stasis Chuchurka, Frank Schlawin
Abstract: Building on the standard hierarchy of pure states (HOPS) approach, we construct a generalized formulation suitable for open quantum systems interacting with nonstationary Gaussian baths, potentially extending its applicability to nonequilibrium baths. This is achieved by extending the conventional exponential decomposition of bath correlation functions (BCF) to allow explicitly time-dependent forms. We demonstrate the method's performance on two examples of nonstationary squeezed reservoirs generated via uniform squeezing and degenerate parametric amplification. Benchmarking against the associated hierarchy of master equations shows that HOPS achieves superior efficiency under hierarchy truncation. In cases where each contribution in the BCF expansion can be associated with an independent physical bath, the formalism can be simplified in a pseudomode representation which is more efficient in a strongly non-Markovian regime. Our results highlight HOPS as a versatile and powerful tool for simulating open quantum systems in nonstationary baths, with potential applications ranging from squeezed light-matter interactions to driven quantum materials and dissipative phase transitions.

Title: Entanglement Structure of Nonlocal Field Theories
Authors: Reza Pirmoradian, M. Hossein Bek-Khoshnevis, Sadaf Ebadi, M. Reza Tanhayi
Abstract: Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.

Title: Maximizing the nondemolition nature of a quantum measurement via an adaptive readout protocol
Authors: Arjen Vaartjes, Rocky Yue Su, Laura A. O'Neill, Paul Steinacker, Gauri Goenka, Mark R. van Blankenstein, Xi Yu, Benjamin Wilhelm, Alexander M. Jakob, Fay E. Hudson, Kohei M. Itoh, Chih Hwan Yang, Andrew S. Dzurak, David N. Jamieson, Martin Nurizzo, Danielle Holmes, Arne Laucht, Andrea Morello
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\pm0.07)\%$ to $(99.61\pm0.04)\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.

Title: Lorentz Transformation in Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Marcello Baldo
Abstract: The compatibility of special relativity and Quantum Mechanics has been questioned by several authors. The origin of this tension can be traced back mainly to the introduction of the measurement processes and the corresponding wave function reduction, which play a crucial role in Quantum Mechanics. We approach this problem within a recent proposal for a model of Quantum Mechanics, where the measurement is explicitly described as a specific stochastic process. This implements ordinary Quantum Mechanics, where measurement and reduction are treated as phenomenological events of unknown origin without any physical justification. To state clearly the question, we first discuss and establish the effect of a Lorentz transformation on a generic wave function in space-time. This allows to formulate the relativistic version of the model. We then consider few thought experiments in order to analyze to what extent Quantum Mechanics follows relativistic invariance and find the specific critical points where non invariance possibly occurs. The relevance of this analysis on the experimental observations is also discussed.

Title: Fractional Contribution of Dynamical and Geometric Phases in Quantum Evolution
Authors: Arun Kumar Pati, Vlatko Vedral, Erik Sjoqvist
Abstract: The fundamental division of the total quantum evolution phase into geometric and dynamical components is a central problem in quantum physics. Here, we prove a remarkably simple and universal law demonstrating that this partitioning is governed, at every instant, solely by a single geometric quantity: the Bargmann angle (Bures angle). This result provides a universally applicable and rigorous way to define the exact fraction of the total phase that is geometric versus dynamical in origin, thereby establishing a new quantitative link between the dynamics of quantum evolution and the geometry of the state space. This finding has immediate practical consequences, furnishing a real-time measure of the geometricity of an evolution for designing high-fidelity geometric quantum gates with optimized robustness, and opening new avenues for quantum speed limit and coherent control.

Title: Qudit-native simulation of the Potts model
Authors: Maksim A. Gavreev, Evgeniy O. Kiktenko, Aleksey K. Fedorov, Anastasiia S. Nikolaeva
Abstract: Simulating entangled, many-body quantum systems is notoriously hard, especially in the case of high-dimensional nature of physical underlying objects. In this work, we propose an approach for simulating the Potts model based on the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition that we construct for qudit systems. Specifically, we introduce two qudit-native decomposition schemes: (i) the first utilizes Molmer-Sorensen gate and additional local levels to encode the Potts interactions, while (ii) the second employs an light-shift gate that naturally fits qudit architectures. These decompositions enable a direct and efficient mapping of the Potts model dynamics into hardware-efficient qudit gate sequences for trapped-ion platform. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a Suzuki-Trotter approximation with our evolution-into-gates framework, for detecting the dynamical quantum phase transition. Our results establish a pathway toward qudit-based digital quantum simulation of many-body models and provide a new perspective on probing nonanalytic behavior in high-dimensional quantum many-body models.

Title: Tensor-network approach to quantum optical state evolution beyond the Fock basis
Authors: Nikolay Kapridov, Egor Tiunov, Dmitry Chermoshentsev
Abstract: Understanding the quantum evolution of light in nonlinear media is central to the development of next-generation quantum technologies. Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($\alpha = 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.

Title: Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry
Authors: Jonah Glick, Tim Kovachy
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.

Title: Quantum phase diagrams of Dicke-Ising models by a wormhole algorithm
Authors: Anja Langheld, Max Hörmann, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: We gain quantitative insights on effects of light-matter interactions on correlated quantum matter by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.

Title: Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator
Authors: T.-W. Zhou, T. Beller, G. Masini, J. Parravicini, G. Cappellini, C. Repellin, T. Giamarchi, J. Catani, M. Filippone, L. Fallani
Abstract: In the Hall effect, a voltage drop develops perpendicularly to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Recent developments with quantum simulators have unveiled strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in a non-electronic system of strongly interacting fermions was not achieved to date. Here, we demonstrate a technique for measuring the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a cold-atom analogue of a solid-state Hall bar and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analogue quantum simulations and measurements performed in solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.

Title: Coarse-grained Bootstrap of Quantum Many-body Systems
Authors: Minjae Cho, Colin Oscar Nancarrow, Petar Tadić, Yuan Xin, Zechuan Zheng
Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding tighter bounds compared to those obtained without coarse-graining.

Title: Prethermalization of light and matter in cavity-coupled Rydberg arrays
Authors: Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Hossein Hosseinabadi, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.

Title: Ultimate Quantum Precision Limit at Colliders: Conditions and Case Studies
Authors: Tengyu Ai, Qi Bi, Yuxin He, Jia Liu, Xiao-Ping Wang
Abstract: We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\tau \to \pi \nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.

Title: Probing electron spin dynamics in single telecom InAs(P)/InP quantum dots using the Hanle effect
Authors: Maja Wasiluk, Helena Janowska, Anna Musiał, Johann P. Reithmaier, Mohamed Benyoucef, Wojciech Rudno-Rudziński
Abstract: Spins of carriers confined in quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for qubits due to their relatively long spin relaxation times. However, the electron spin dephasing, primarily driven by hyperfine interactions with nuclear spins, can limit their coherence. Here, we report the first Hanle effect demonstration in single InAs(P)/InP QDs emitting in the telecom C-band leading to experimental determination of electron spin dephasing time. Using polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we identified excitonic complexes and confirmed the presence of a negatively charged trion, exhibiting a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) of $-36\%$ under quasi--resonant excitation. From the analysis of Hanle linewidth and employing a previously reported value of the electron $g$-factor, we extracted an electron spin dephasing time of $T_2^{\ast} = 1.59 \pm 0.49~\mathrm{ns}$. Despite the large indium nuclear spin, the obtained $T_2^{\ast}$ is comparable to values reported for GaAs-based QDs, which we attribute to the larger volume of the InAs(P)/InP QDs. These findings confirm the potential of InP-based telecom QDs for use in spin-photon interfaces.

Authors: Daigo Oue, Mário G. Silveirinha
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.

Title: False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems
Authors: Adith Sai Aramthottil, Ali Emami Kopaei, Piotr Sierant, Lev Vidmar, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.

Title: Synthetic Data Generation and Differential Privacy using Tensor Networks' Matrix Product States (MPS)
Authors: Alejandro Moreno R., Desale Fentaw, Samuel Palmer, Raúl Salles de Padua, Ninad Dixit, Samuel Mugel, Roman Orús, Manuel Radons, Josef Menter, Ali Abedi
Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via Rényi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.

Title: Nonlinear Ringdowns as Sources and Detectors of Quantum Gravitational Waves
Authors: Thiago Guerreiro
Abstract: Is gravity quantum mechanical? If so, we argue that nonlinear effects in black hole ringdowns - notably second harmonic generation - generates gravitational waves in non-classical states. While quantum features of these states such as sub-Poissonian statistics or entanglement could in principle be measured at interferometric detectors, the tiny coupling of gravity to matter makes this extremely challenging. Drawing on ideas from quantum optics, we instead propose that the nonlinearities in ringdowns could be used as strongly coupled detectors of quantum gravitational radiation, potentially offering a new route to probing the quantum nature of gravity.

Title: From Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling to soliton proliferation in Josephson junction arrays
Authors: Mikheil Tsitsishvili, Reinhold Egger, Karsten Flensberg, Sebastian Diehl
Abstract: We propose Josephson junction arrays as realistic platforms for observing nonequilibrium scaling laws characterizing the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, and space-time soliton proliferation. Focusing on a two-chain ladder geometry, we perform numerical simulations for the roughness function. Together with analytical arguments, our results predict KPZ scaling at intermediate time scales, extending over sufficiently long time scales to be observable, followed by a crossover to the asymptotic long-time regime governed by soliton proliferation.

Title: Haag Duality for 2D Quantum Spin Systems
Authors: Yoshiko Ogata, David Pérez-García, Alberto Ruiz-de-Alarcón
Abstract: Haag duality is a fundamental locality property introduced in the pioneering formulation of algebraic quantum field theory by Haag and Kastler in the 1960s. Since then, it has played a central role, most notably in the classification of superselection sectors by Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts in the 1970s. Over the past two decades, this concept has migrated from its relativistic origins to quantum spin systems, becoming a cornerstone of the operator-algebraic approach to the long-standing problem of classifying two-dimensional topological quantum phases of matter. In physics, it is widely conjectured that such phases are classified by their emergent anyons, a view supported by exactly solvable models exemplifying all known non-chiral phases: Kitaev's quantum double models, Levin-Wen string-net models, and their slight generalizations. In these models, elementary excitations behave as quasi-particles, namely anyons, whose fusion and braiding properties form a tensor category expected to characterize the phase of matter. A major open problem was to derive the emergence of anyons and the stability of their fusion and braiding beyond these solvable models. Recently, it has been shown that a weaker, phase-stable form of Haag duality resolves these questions. However, rigorous proofs of Haag duality in two dimensions were previously restricted to systems exhibiting abelian anyons. In this work, we establish Haag duality for a broad class of tensor network models based on $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras, encompassing all Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and expected to include all non-chiral topological quantum phases of matter.

Title: Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity
Authors: Thomas Schürmann
Abstract: We derive intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds for the canonical momentum uncertainty of scalar quantum states that are strictly localized in geodesic balls $B_{\Sigma}(p,r)$, serving as the position uncertainty, on spacelike hypersurfaces $(\Sigma,h)$ of arbitrary Lorentzian spacetimes. The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p r \ge \hbar/2$. Under the same assumption, a vector-field Barta-type argument improves this universal floor to the scale-invariant bound $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, which provides a universal, foliation-independent floor. Any further sharpening of the constant requires eigenvalue-comparison results or other curvature-sensitive methods.

Title: Casimir Stabilization of Fluctuating Electronic Nematic Order
Authors: Ola Carlsson, Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Jonathan B. Curtis, Frieder Lindel, Lorenzo Graziotto, Jérôme Faist, Eugene Demler
Abstract: Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.

Title: Metaplectic time-frequency representations
Authors: Gianluca Giacchi
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.

Title: Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation
Authors: Noam Mouelle, Jeremiah Mitchell, Valerie Gibson, Ulrich Schneider
Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.

Title: Perfect Particle Transmission through Duality Defects
Authors: Atsushi Ueda, Vic Vander Linden, Laurens Lootens, Jutho Haegeman, Paul Fendley, Frank Verstraete
Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.

Title: Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background
Authors: Kazuki Ikeda, Yaron Oz
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.

Title: Competing Localizations on Disordered Non-Hermitian Random Graph Lattice
Authors: S Rahul, A Harshitha
Abstract: Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight-binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on-site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that together define the underlying random graph structure. By varying $p$, $\Delta$, and the disorder strength, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show a strong competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations across parameter regimes. Notably, even in the presence of strong disorder, skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson-driven localization. We further discuss the relevance of these results to machine-learning architectures and information propagation in complex networks and other real-world problems.
