Title: Interaction-Conditional Semantics and the Dissolution of Quantum Paradoxes
Authors: Jonathon Sendall
Abstract: This paper argues that several canonical puzzles in quantum mechanics, including spin measurement, the double slit, entanglement correlations, and Wigner's friend, share a common origin in a semantic error and the illicit promotion of interaction conditional outcomes to intrinsic properties. I introduce four principles that license only configuration relative predication, grounding outcomes in physical measurement geometry while preserving objectivity. Applying these principles uniformly dissolves each puzzle without new physics or ad hoc interpretive machinery. Bell's theorem and the Kochen-Specker theorem are reframed not as dynamical mysteries but as constraints on permissible explanatory structure, evidence that intrinsic-outcome semantics is incompatible with empirical reality. The result is a relational objectivity that avoids both naive property realism and observer subjectivism.

Title: A framework to evaluate the performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms
Authors: Ernesto Mamedaliev, Vladyslav Libov, Albert Nieto-Morales, Oskar Słowik, Arit Kumar Bishwas
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising methods for solving combinatorial optimization problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, benchmarking VQAs is difficult due to their stochastic behavior and the lack of standardized performance criteria. This work introduces a general framework for evaluating VQAs applied to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. The framework uses three complementary metrics: feasibility, quality, and reproducibility. It also introduces a quality diagram that visualizes trade-offs between success probability and computational resources. Reproducibility is formalized using Shannon entropy, and a decision rule is defined for selecting algorithms under resource constraints. As a demonstration, the framework is applied to several VQAs using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) cost functions and different shot counts on a 16-qubit QUBO instance. The results show how the framework supports systematic benchmarking and provides a foundation for adaptive algorithm selection in hybrid quantum-classical workflows.

Title: Lightweight Quantum-Enhanced ResNet for Coronary Angiography Classification: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Feature Enhancement Framework
Authors: Jingsong Xia
Abstract: Background: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the cornerstone imaging modality for evaluating coronary artery stenosis and guiding interventional decision-making. However, interpretation based on single-frame angiographic images remains highly operator-dependent, and conventional deep learning models still face challenges in modeling complex vascular morphology and fine-grained texture this http URL: We propose a Lightweight Quantum-Enhanced ResNet (LQER) for binary classification of coronary angiography images. A pretrained ResNet18 is employed as a classical feature extractor, while a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is introduced at the high-level semantic feature space for quantum feature enhancement. The quantum module utilizes data re-uploading and entanglement structures, followed by residual fusion with classical features, enabling end-to-end hybrid optimization with a strictly controlled number of this http URL: On an independent test set, the proposed LQER outperformed the classical ResNet18 baseline in accuracy, AUC, and F1-score, achieving a test accuracy exceeding 90%. The results demonstrate that lightweight quantum feature enhancement improves discrimination of positive lesions, particularly under class-imbalanced this http URL: This study validates a practical hybrid quantum--classical learning paradigm for coronary angiography analysis, providing a feasible pathway for deploying quantum machine learning in medical imaging applications.

Title: Phase Diagrams of Information Backflow: Unifying Entanglement Revivals and Entropy Overshoots in Minimal Non-Markovian Models
Authors: Koichi Nakagawa
Abstract: Memory effects in non-Markovian dynamics are often diagnosed either via quantum-correlation revivals or via non-monotonic classical information measures, yet a unified minimal framework comparing their ``backflow phases'' is still lacking. Here we propose an information-backflow phase-diagram approach that places \emph{quantum entanglement revivals} and \emph{classical entropy overshoots} on the same footing through a common backflow functional $N_I=\int_{\dot I>0}\dot I\,dt$. On the quantum side, we employ a fractional (Caputo) extension of a two-state dissipative model embedded by thermo-field dynamics (TFD), yielding a closed-form intrinsic entanglement component $b^{(\alpha)}_{qe}(t)=\frac14[E_\alpha(-\lambda^\alpha t^\alpha)]^2\sin^2(\omega t)$ and an integrated revival measure $N_{qe}$ that delineates a sharp boundary near $\alpha\simeq 1/2$ in the $(\alpha,\omega/\lambda)$ plane. On the classical side, we consider a three-state model whose Markov generator is promoted either to an exponential-kernel generalized master equation (with exact Markov embedding) or to a semi-Markov process with Erlang-2 waiting times. We quantify non-monotonicity by the entropy overshoot $\Delta H$ and KL-based diagnostics on the probability simplex. To strengthen the quantum--classical symmetry, we further introduce a \emph{fractional Mittag--Leffler memory kernel} in the classical dynamics and show that an analogous backflow transition emerges around $\alpha\simeq 1/2$, indicating that the boundary originates from the kernel's mathematical structure rather than from quantumness per se. Overall, our results provide a compact, model-agnostic route to classify non-Markovianity by phase diagrams of information backflow and to interpret them via a shared embedding narrative: memory stored in hidden degrees of freedom returns to the observed sector as non-monotonic information flow.

Title: Feshbach-Villars Hamiltonian Approach to the Klein-Gordon Oscillator and Supercritical Step Scattering in Standard and Generalized Doubly Special Relativity
Authors: A. Boumali, N. Jafari, Y. Chargui
Abstract: We develop a first-order Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian framework for spin-0 relativistic quantum dynamics in the presence of Planck-scale kinematic deformations described within generalized doubly special relativity (G-DSR). Starting from a generic nonlinear momentum-space map, we derive the corresponding modified dispersion relation (MDR) at leading order in the Planck length \(l_p\) and construct a consistent FV linearization of the deformed Klein-Gordon operator. The resulting two-component Hamiltonian remains \(\sigma_3\)-pseudo-Hermitian at \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\), which guarantees conservation of the FV charge and current and provides a current-based definition of reflection and transmission in stationary scattering. As applications, we study two benchmark settings in which the FV metric structure is essential: (i) the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator and (ii) scattering from electrostatic step and barrier potentials. For the oscillator, we obtain controlled \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\) branch-resolved spectral shifts and show how kinetic versus mass-shell deformations reshape the level spacing and the high-energy spectral compression. For step and barrier scattering, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients directly from the pseudo-Hermitian FV current and quantify the deformation-induced shift of the supercritical (pair-production) threshold. A comparative analysis of the Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin realizations indicates that MS-type deformations generally delay the onset of the supercritical regime and reduce the magnitude of the negative transmitted flux within the validity domain \(l_p E \ll 1\).

Title: Quantum Simulation of the Polaron-Molecule Transition on a NISQ Device
Authors: Hugo Catala, Ezequiel Valero, German Rodrigo
Abstract: The simulation of strongly correlated fermionic systems remains one of the most significant challenges in computational physics due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the fermionic sign problem. In this work, we present a digital quantum simulation framework to explore the Fermi polaron and the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover. We develop a unified Hamiltonian formalism that bridges pairing superfluidity and impurity physics, mapping the system onto a gate-based quantum processor via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Using a first-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, we implement a Ramsey interferometry protocol to extract the real-time dynamics and spectral response of the system. Our results demonstrate a smooth transition from a dressed quasiparticle (polaron) regime to a stable molecular bound state, characterized by a linear energy renormalization in the strong-coupling limit. We validate our simulation against exact classical benchmarks and report successful execution on the Barcelona Supercomputing Center quantum hardware. Despite the inherent noise of the quantum hardware, the hybrid variational approach shows remarkable resilience, accurately capturing the bifurcation of the spectral density

Title: Operationally induced preferred basis in unitary quantum mechanics
Authors: Vitaly Pronskikh
Abstract: The preferred-basis problem and the definite-outcome aspect of the measurement problem persist even if the detector is modeled unitarily, because experimental data are necessarily represented in a Boolean event algebra of mutually exclusive records whereas the theoretical description is naturally formulated in a noncommutative operator algebra with continuous unitary symmetry. This change of mathematical type constitutes the core of the 'cut': a structurally necessary interface from group-based kinematics to set-based counting. In the presented view the basis relevant for recorded outcomes is not determined by the system Hamiltonian alone; it is induced by the measurement mapping, i.e., by the detector channel together with the coarse-grained readout that defines an instrument. The probabilistic mapping is anchored in symmetry and measure theory: by Gleason-type uniqueness (Gleason for projections in $d>2$ and Busch's extension for Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) including $d=2$), the trace rule is the unique probability measure consistent with additivity over exclusive events and basis-independence of the unitary sector. A compact qubit--pointer model yields an induced unsharp POVM $E_\pm=\tfrac12(\id\pm \eta\,\sigma_z)$ with $\eta$ fixed by pointer resolution, displaying explicitly how the detector induces the relevant basis. Finally, nested-observer paradoxes are tightened into a non-composability lemma: joint assignment of outcome propositions is obstructed unless a joint instrument exists. This relocates the origin of randomness to the stochasticity of the transition rules.

Title: Post-selection games
Authors: Víctor Calleja Rodríguez, Ivan A. Bocanegra-Garay, Mateus Araújo
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce post-selection games, a generalization of nonlocal games where each round can be not only won or lost by the players, but also discarded by the referee. Such games naturally formalize possibilistic proofs of nonlocality, such as Hardy's paradox. We develop algorithms for computing the local and Tsirelson bounds of post-selection games. Furthermore, we show that they have an unbounded advantage in statistical power over traditional nonlocal games, making them ideally suited for analysing Bell tests with low detection efficiency.

Title: Eigenstate condensation in quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces
Authors: Christopher David White, Michael Winer, Noam Bernstein
Abstract: Random quantum states drawn from the Haar ensemble with a constraint on the energy expectation value $E_{\mathrm{av}} = \langle \psi | H | \psi\rangle$ display \textit{eigenstate condensation}: for $E_{\mathrm{av}}$ below a critical value $E_c$, they develop macroscopic overlap with the ground state. We study eigenstate condensation in systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These systems display three phases: a ground-state phase, in which energy-constrained random states have macroscopic overlap with the ground state; a high-temperature phase, in which they have exponentially small overlap with each energy eigenstate; and an anti-ground-state phase, in which they have macroscopic overlap with the most highly excited state. In local spin systems the ground-state and anti-ground-state phases approach the middle of the spectrum as $1/[\text{system size}]$, but -- because the condensation phase transitions have exponential, rather than polynomial, finite-size scaling -- the crossover becomes exponentially sharp in system size and the high-temperature phase is best understood as an extended phase.

Title: Experimental Demonstration of Commutation Relations Using Intensity Correlations
Authors: Hans Dang, Sebastian Luff, Martin Fischer, Markus Sondermann, Mojdeh. S. Najafabadi, Luis L. Sanchez-Soto, Gerd Leuchs
Abstract: The canonical commutation relation is a cornerstone of quantum theory and underlies the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Although uncertainty relations have been extensively tested, direct verifications of the underlying commutation relation itself have remained elusive. We report an experimental demonstration of the bosonic commutation relation for optical field operators based on measurements of two distinct intensity correlation functions. From these measurements, we extract the expectation value of the field-operator commutator for both a single-photon state and coherent state. In both cases, the measured values are consistent with unity, in quantitative agreement with quantum theory.

Title: Against probability: A quantum state is more than a list of probability distributions
Authors: Ladina Hausmann, Renato Renner
Abstract: The state $\rho$ of a quantum system can be represented by a vector $\mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{M}}(\rho)$ of outcome probabilities for a set of measurements $\mathcal{M}$. Such representations appear throughout physics, for example, in quantum field theory via correlation functions and in quantum foundations within generalized probabilistic frameworks. In this work, we identify an unavoidable tension: to enable operationally meaningful statements, the map ${\rho \mapsto \mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{M}}(\rho)}$ must be topologically robust $\unicode{x2013}$ preserving the notion of closeness between states. Yet, a probability representation that is topologically robust cannot simultaneously retain other essential structure, such as the subsystem structure.

Title: Multivariate Multicycle Codes for Complete Single-Shot Decoding
Authors: Feroz Ahmed Mian, Owen Gwilliam, Stefan Krastanov
Abstract: We introduce multivariate multicycle (MM) codes, a new family of quantum error correcting codes that unifies and generalizes bivariate bicycle codes, multivariate bicycle codes, abelian two-block group algebra codes, generalized bicycle codes, trivariate tricycle codes, and n-dimensional toric codes. MM codes are Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes defined from length-t chain complexes with $t \ge 4$. The chief advantage of these codes is that they possess metachecks and high confinement that permit complete single-shot decoding, while also having additional algebraic structure that might enable logical non-Clifford gates. We offer a framework that facilitates the construction of long-length chain complexes through the use of Koszul complex. In particular, obtaining explicit boundary maps (parity check and metacheck matrices) is particularly straightforward in our approach. This simple but very general parameterization of codes permitted us to efficiently perform a numerical search, where we identify several MM code candidates that demonstrate these capabilities at high rates and high code distances. Examples of new codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ include $[[96, 12, 8]]$, $[[96, 44, 4]]$ $[[144, 40, 4]]$, $[[216, 12, 12]]$, $[[360, 30, 6]]$, $[[384, 80, 4]]$, $[[486, 24, 12]]$, $[[486, 66, 9]]$ and $[[648, 60, 9]]$. Notably, our codes achieve confinement profiles that surpass all known single-shot decodable quantum CSS codes of practical blocksize.

Title: Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian for ab initio hybrid quantum-classical molecular design with applications to photodynamic therapy
Authors: Emil Zak
Abstract: Relativistic spin effects drive subtle molecular phenomena ranging from intersystem crossing in photodynamic therapy to spin-mediated catalysis and high-resolution spectroscopy. These effects are described by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian, which extends the nonrelativistic electronic Hamiltonian by including one- and two-electron spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions. First-principles simulations of the full Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian rapidly become intractable on classical computers due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the complexity of two-body spin-dependent terms. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing molecular energy levels and properties governed by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian. Our approach block-encodes the relativistic Hamiltonian in a second-quantized, doubly factorized representation. By reformulating the Hamiltonian in a symmetry-adapted Majorana basis, we construct efficient linear-combination-of-unitaries circuits that encode spin-orbit interactions without effective or mean-field approximations. We introduce spin-controlled Pauli-SWAP networks that decouple spin and orbital control logic, enabling a unified treatment of relativistic spin mixing with only modest overhead relative to spin-free simulations. We analyze quantum resources in terms of logical qubits and T-gate complexity, showing that explicit spin degrees of freedom do not worsen the asymptotic scaling. The prefactor is reduced by a factor of two compared to direct linear-combination-of-unitaries approaches. Finally, we outline a hybrid quantum-classical workflow for designing photodynamic therapy photosensitizers, artificial photosynthesis catalysts, and other systems where accurate relativistic spin effects are essential.

Title: Complete transparency with three active-passive-coupled optical resonators
Authors: Xiao-Bo Yan, Liu Yang, Bing He
Abstract: The phenomena of induced transparency, with the typical examples of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic media and coupled optical resonators, have attracted tremendous interest since their discoveries. Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range. A free control on the transparency window size and output field intensity can be realized by tuning two inter-cavity couplings without modifying the built-in system parameters.

Title: Krylov's State Complexity and Information Geometry in Qubit Dynamics
Authors: Carlo Cafaro, Emma Clements, Vishnu Vardhan Anuboyina
Abstract: We compare Krylov's state complexity with an information-geometric (IG) measure of complexity for the quantum evolution of two-level systems. Focusing on qubit dynamics on the Bloch sphere, we analyze evolutions generated by stationary and nonstationary Hamiltonians, corresponding to geodesic and nongeodesic trajectories. We formulate Krylov complexity in geometric terms, both instantaneously and in a time-averaged sense, and contrast it with an IG complexity of quantum evolutions characterized in terms of efficiency and curvature. We show that the two measures reflect fundamentally different aspects of quantum dynamics: Krylov's state complexity quantifies the directional spread of the evolving state relative to the initial state, whereas the IG complexity captures the effective volume explored along the trajectory on the Bloch sphere. This geometric distinction explains their inequivalent behavior and highlights the complementary nature of state-based and information-geometric notions of complexity in quantum systems.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Technology
Authors: Marin Bukov, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges -- such as scalability, interpretability, and integration with experimental platforms -- and outlines promising directions for future research. Throughout, we highlight experimental implementations that exemplify the increasing role of reinforcement learning in shaping the development of quantum technologies.

Title: Quantum capacity analysis of finite-dimensional lossy channels
Authors: Sofia Cocciaretto, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: Traditionally, Quantum Information, and Quantum Communication specifically, have been focused on qubit-based architectures. Recent results, however, highlighted that higher dimensional architectures (qudit-based) may present advantages both in terms of communication and computation; a family of channels called Multi-level Amplitude Damping (MAD) channels, which are a possible qudit generalization of the well known Amplitude Damping Channels, is able to model energy decay processes that may happen during signal transmission. In this work, the Quantum Capacity of 4-dimensional MAD's is studied, relying on a technique for computing it even outside of degradable and antidegradable conditions. We also characterized the complete region of antidegradability and degradability in the parameter space for a generic d-dimensional MAD using both analytical and semi-numerical methods.

Title: Private Proofs of When and Where
Authors: Uma Girish, Greg Gluch, Shafi Goldwasser, Tal Malkin, Leo Orshansky, Henry Yuen
Abstract: Position verification schemes are interactive protocols where entities prove their physical location to others; this enables interactive proofs for statements of the form "I am at a location $L$." Although secure position verification cannot be achieved with classical protocols (even with computational assumptions), they are feasible with quantum protocols. In this paper we introduce the notion of zero-knowledge position verification, which generalizes position verification in two ways: 1. enabling entities to prove more sophisticated statements about their locations at different times (for example, "I was NOT near location $L$ at noon yesterday"). 2. maintaining privacy for any other detail about their true location besides the statement they are proving. We construct zero-knowledge position verification from standard position verification and post-quantum one-way functions. The central tool in our construction is a primitive we call position commitments, which allow entities to privately commit to their physical position in a particular moment, which is then revealed at some later time.

Title: Qubit-qudit entanglement transfer in defect centers with high-spin nuclei
Authors: W.-R. Hannes, Guido Burkard
Abstract: We propose a scheme for accumulating entanglement between long-lived qudits provided by central nuclear spins of defect centers. Assuming a generic setting, the electron spin of each node acts as the communication qubit and may be entangled with other nodes, e.g., through a spin-photon interface. The generally available Ising component of the hyperfine interaction is shown to facilitate repeated entanglement transfer onto memory qudits of arbitrary dimension $d\le 2I+1$ with $I$ the nuclear spin quantum number. When $d$ is set to an integer power of two, maximal entanglement can be generated deterministically and without intermittent driving of nuclear spins. The scheme is applicable to several candidate systems, including the $^{73}$Ge germanium vacancy in diamond.

Title: Time-series based quantum state discrimination
Authors: Samuel Jung, Neel Vora, Akel Hashim, Yilun Xu, Gang Huang
Abstract: Accurate quantum state readout is crucial for error correction and algorithms, but measurement errors are detrimental. Readout fidelity is typically limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and energy relaxation ($T_1$ decay), a significant problem for superconducting qubits. While most approaches classify results using clustering algorithms on integrated readout signals, these methods cannot distinguish a qubit that was initially in the ground state from one that decayed to it during measurement. We instead propose using machine learning (ML) on the raw, non-integrated analog signal. We apply time-series classification models, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to the full data trajectory. We find that our LSTM model, combined with filtering and feature engineering, consistently outperforms clustering. The largest improvements come from reclassifying points in the boundary regions between clusters. These points correspond to atypical measurement records, likely due to transient or noisy features lost during data integration. By retaining temporal information, sequence-aware models like LSTMs can better discriminate these trajectories, whereas clustering methods based on integrated values are more prone to misclassification.

Title: The cost of quantum algorithms for biochemistry: A case study in metaphosphate hydrolysis
Authors: Ryan LaRose, Alan Bidart, Ben DalFavero, Sophia E. Economou, J. Wayne Mullinax, Mafalda Ramôa, Jeremiah Rowland, Brenda Rubenstein, Nicolas PD Sawaya, Prateek Vaish, Grant M. Rotskoff, Norm M. Tubman
Abstract: We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for ATP/metaphosphate hydrolysis, one of the most important reactions in all of biology with implications for metabolism, cellular signaling, and cancer therapeutics. In particular, we consider three algorithms for solving the ground state energy estimation problem: the variational quantum eigensolver, quantum Krylov, and quantum phase estimation. By utilizing exact classical simulation, numerical estimation, and analytical bounds, we provide a current and future outlook for using quantum computers to solve impactful biochemical and biological problems. Our results show that variational methods, while being the most heuristic, still require substantially fewer overall resources on quantum hardware, and could feasibly address such problems on current or near-future devices. We include our complete dataset of biomolecular Hamiltonians and code as benchmarks to improve upon with future techniques.

Title: Inverse-Squeezing Kennedy Receiver for Near-Helstrom Discrimination of Displaced-Squeezed BPSK
Authors: Enhao Bai, Jian Peng, Tianyi Wu, Chen Dong, Kai Wen, Fengkai Sun, Zhenrong Zhang, Chun Zhou, Yaping Li
Abstract: To address the discrimination problem of binary phase-shift keyed displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK), this paper proposes an Inverse-squeezing Kennedy (IS-Kennedy) receiver. This architecture incorporates an inverse-squeezing operator following the displacement operation of a conventional Kennedy receiver, mapping the S-BPSK signals onto equivalent large-amplitude coherent states. Furthermore, it employs a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector to perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision-making. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under ideal conditions, the IS-Kennedy receiver effectively translates the transmitter's squeezing resources into a displacement gain at the receiver. Consequently, its error probability approaches the Helstrom bound across the entire energy spectrum, remaining within a constant factor of 3 dB. In the low-photon-number regime ($N \approx 0.6$), the proposed scheme surpasses the coherent-state limit, achieving an error rate below 1\%. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of system performance under non-ideal conditions, revealing the robustness of PNR detection against background dark counts and a characteristic ``parity photon-number step'' saturation effect arising from squeezing parameter mismatch.

Title: Introduction to Quantum Entanglement Geometry
Authors: Kazuki Ikeda
Abstract: This article is an expository account aimed at viewing entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a phenomenon of global geometry. While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme. The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme. Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.

Title: Evolution of quantum geometric tensor of 1D periodic systems after a quench
Authors: Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Yu-Huan Huang, Hao Guo. Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: We investigate the post-quench dynamics of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of 1D periodic systems with a suddenly changed Hamiltonian. The diagonal component with respect to the crystal momentum gives a metric corresponding to the variance of the time-evolved position, and its coefficient of the quadratic term in time is the group-velocity variance, signaling ballistic wavepacket dispersion. The other diagonal QGT component with respect to time reveals the energy variance. The off-diagonal QGT component features a real part as a covariance and an imaginary part representing a quench-induced curvature. Using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, our numerical results of different quenches confirm that the post-quench QGT is governed by physical quantities and local geometric objects from the initial state and post-quench bands, such as the Berry connection, group velocities, and energy variance. Furthermore, the connections between the QGT and physical observables suggest the QGT as a comprehensive probe for nonequilibrium phenomena.

Authors: Qian Chen, Benoît Collins
Abstract: We extend \cite{chen2025srkbp} by analyzing the complexity of the $k$-block-positivity testing algorithm. In this paper, we investigate a symmetry reduction scheme based on rectangular shaped Young diagrams. Connecting the complexity to the dimensions of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{U}(d)$, we derive an explicit formula for the complexity, which also clarifies why the semidefinite program hierarchy collapses in the $k=d$ case.

Title: High-Performance Exact Synthesis of Two-Qubit Quantum Circuits
Authors: Andrew N.Glaudell, Michael Jarret, Swan Klein, Samuel S. Mendelson, T. C. Mooney, Mingzhen Tian
Abstract: Exact synthesis provides unconditional optimality and canonical structure, but is often limited to small, carefully scoped regimes. We present an exact synthesis framework for two-qubit circuits over the Clifford+$T$ gate set that optimizes $T$-count exactly. Our approach exhausts a bounded search space, exploits algebraic canonicalization to avoid redundancy, and constructs a lookup table of optimal implementations that turns synthesis into a query. Algorithmically, we combine meet-in-the-middle ideas with provable pruning rules and problem-specific arithmetic designed for modern hardware. The result is an exact, reusable synthesis engine with substantially improved practical performance.

Title: The strong converse exponent of composable randomness extraction against quantum side information
Authors: Roberto Rubboli, Marco Tomamichel
Abstract: We find a tight characterization of the strong converse exponent for randomness extraction against quantum side information. In contrast to previous tight bounds, we employ a composable error criterion given by the fidelity (or purified distance) to a uniform distribution in product with the marginal state. The characterization is in terms of a club-sandwiched conditional entropy recently introduced by Rubboli, Goodarzi and Tomamichel and used by Li, Li and Yu to establish the strong converse exponent for the case of classical side information. This provides the first precise operational interpretation of this family of conditional entropies in the quantum setting.

Title: Quantum simulation of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation via measurement-induced potential reconstruction
Authors: Kaiwen Weng, Zhaoyuan Meng, Zixuan Yang, Guohui Hu
Abstract: The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model that describes diverse complex phenomena in nature. However, simulating the NLSE on a quantum computer is inherently challenging due to the presence of the nonlinear term. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for simulating the NLSE based on the split-step Fourier method. During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder. The simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement with the corresponding classical solutions. This work provide a concrete basis for analyzing accuracy-cost trade-offs in quantum-classical simulations of nonlinear dispersive wave dynamics.

Title: Analytical construction of $(n, n-1)$ quantum random access codes saturating the conjectured bound
Authors: Takayuki Suzuki
Abstract: Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) embody the fundamental trade-off between the compressibility of information into limited quantum resources and the accessibility of that information, serving as a cornerstone of quantum communication and computation. In particular, the $(n, n-1)$-QRACs, which encode $n$ bits of classical information into $n-1$ qubits, provides an ideal theoretical model for verifying quantum advantage in high-dimensional spaces; however, the analytical derivation of optimal codes for general $n$ has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish an analytical construction method for $(n, n-1)$-QRACs by using an explicit operator formalism. We prove that this construction strictly achieves the numerically conjectured upper bound of the average success probability, $\mathcal{P} = 1/2 + \sqrt{(n-1)/n}/2$, for all $n$. Furthermore, we present a systematic algorithm to decompose the derived optimal POVM into standard quantum gates. Since the resulting decoding circuit consists solely of interactions between adjacent qubits, it can be implemented with a circuit depth of $O(n)$ even under linear connectivity constraints. Additionally, we analyze the high-dimensional limit and demonstrate that while the non-commutativity of measurements is suppressed, an information-theoretic gap of $O(\log n)$ from the Holevo bound inevitably arises for symmetric encoding. This study not only provides a scalable implementation method for high-dimensional quantum information processing but also offers new insights into the mathematical structure at the quantum-classical boundary.

Title: Universal Operational Privacy in Distributed Quantum Sensing
Authors: Min Namkung, Dong-Hyun Kim, Seongjin Hong, Yong-Su Kim, Su-Yong Lee, Hyang-Tag Lim
Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental requirement in distributed quantum sensing networks, where multiple clients estimate spatially distributed parameters using shared quantum resources while interacting with potentially untrusted servers. Despite its importance, existing privacy conditions rely on idealized quantum bounds and do not fully capture the operational constraints imposed by realistic measurements. Here, we introduce a universal operational privacy framework for distributed quantum sensing, formulated in terms of the experimentally accessible classical Fisher information matrix and applicable to arbitrary protocols characterized by singular information structures. The proposed condition provides a protocol-independent criterion ensuring that no information about individual parameters is accessible to untrusted parties. We further experimentally demonstrate that a distributed quantum sensing protocol employing fewer photons than the number of estimated parameters simultaneously satisfies the universal privacy condition and achieves Heisenberg-limited precision. Our results establish universal operational constraints governing privacy in distributed quantum sensing networks and provide a foundation for practical, privacy-preserving quantum sensing beyond full-rank regimes.

Title: Pareto-Front Engineering of Dynamical Sweet Spots in Superconducting Qubits
Authors: Zhen Yang, Shan Jin, Yajie Hao, Guangwei Deng, Xiu-Hao Deng, Re-Bing Wu, Xiaoting Wang
Abstract: Operating superconducting qubits at dynamical sweet spots (DSSs) suppresses decoherence from low-frequency flux noise. A key open question is how long coherence can be extended under this strategy and what fundamental limits constrain it. Here we introduce a fully parameterized, multi-objective periodic-flux modulation framework that simultaneously optimizes energy relaxation $T_1$ and pure dephasing $T_\phi$, thereby quantifying the tradeoff between them. For fluxonium qubits with realistic noise spectra, our method enhances $T_\phi$ by a factor of 3-5 compared with existing DSS strategies while maintaining $T_1$ in the hundred-microsecond range. We further prove that, although DSSs eliminate first-order sensitivity to low-frequency noise, relaxation rate cannot be reduced arbitrarily close to zero, establishing an upper bound on achievable $T_1$. At the optimized working points, we identify double-DSS regions that are insensitive to both DC and AC flux, providing robust operating bands for experiments. As applications, we design single- and two-qubit control protocols at these operating points and numerically demonstrate high-fidelity gate operations. These results establish a general and useful framework for Pareto-front engineering of DSSs that substantially improves coherence and gate performance in superconducting qubits.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Advanced QEC Architecture Decoding
Authors: Yidong Zhou, Lingyi Kong, Yifeng Peng, Zhiding Liang
Abstract: The advent of promising quantum error correction (QEC) codes with efficient resource utilization and high-performance fault-tolerant quantum memories signifies a critical step towards realizing practical quantum computation. While surface codes have been a dominant approach, their limitations have spurred the development of more advanced QEC architectures. These advanced codes often present increased complexity, demanding innovative decoding methodologies. This work investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, including hybrid and multi-agent approaches, to enhance the decoding of various advanced QEC architectures. By leveraging the ability of RL to learn optimal strategies from noisy syndrome measurements, we explore the potential for achieving improved logical error rates and scalability compared to traditional decoding methods. Our approach examines the adaptation of reinforcement learning to exploit the structural properties of these modern QEC models. We also explore the benefits of combining different RL algorithms to address the multifaceted nature of the decoding problem, considering factors such as code degeneracy and real-world noise characteristics. With our proposed method, we are able to demonstrate that an autonomously trained agent can derive decoding schemes for the complex decoding requirement of advanced QEC architectures.

Title: Graphene Josephson Junctions for Engineering Motional Quanta
Authors: Zhen-Yang Peng, Mehdi Abdi
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum device based on the graphene Josephson junctions, where the vibrational degrees of freedom of a graphene membrane couple to the superconducting circuits. The flexural mode-controlled tunneling of the Cooper pairs introduces a strong and tunable coupling even at the zero-point fluctuations level. By employing this interaction, we show that a parametric process can be efficiently implemented. We then investigate foundational and technological applications of our hybrid device empowered by nonlinear interactions, with fast generation of non-classical mechanical states, and critically enhanced quantum sensing under suitable quantum control. Our work provides the possibility of employing the graphene motional degree of freedom for quantum information processing in circuit quantum nanomechanical structures.

Title: Beyond Photon Shot Noise: Chemical Limits in Spectrophotometric Precision
Authors: Georg Engelhardt, Dahai He, JunYan Luo
Abstract: In this work, we investigate precision limitations in spectrophotometry (i.e., spectroscopic concentration measurements) imposed by chemical processes of molecules. Using the recently developed Photon-resolved Floquet theory, which generalizes Maxwell-Bloch theory for higher-order measurement statistics, we analyze a molecular model system subject to chemical reactions whose electronic and optical properties depend on the chemical state. Analysis of sensitivity bounds reveals: (i) Phase measurements are more sensitive than intensity measurements; (ii) Sensitivity exhibits three regimes: photon-shot-noise limited, chemically limited, and intermediate; (iii) Sensitivity shows a turnover as a function of reaction rate due to the interplay between coherent electronic dynamics and incoherent chemical dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that chemical properties must be considered to estimate ultimate precision limits in optical spectrophotometry.

Title: Continuous-mode analysis of improved two-way CV-QKD
Authors: Yanhao Sun, Jiayu Ma, Xiangyu Wang, Song Yu, Ziyang Chen, Hong Guo
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enables information-theoretically secure key generation between legitimate parties. To further enhance system performance, an improved two-way CV-QKD protocol has been proposed, which is accessible in practice and exhibits increased robustness against excess noise. However, in practical implementations, device nonidealities inevitably drive the optical field from the single-mode regime into the continuous-mode regime. In this work, we introduce temporal modes to characterize the evolution of optical fields in the improved two-way protocol and establish a security analysis framework for the continuous-mode scenario based on adaptive normalization with calibrated shot-noise unit. In addition, finite-size effects are taken into account in the analysis. Our results demonstrate that the improved two-way protocol retains a performance advantage over one-way counterpart. The analysis provides useful guidance for the practical implementation and performance optimization of improved two-way CV-QKD systems.

Title: Experimental High-Accuracy and Broadband Quantum Frequency Sensing via Geodesic Control
Authors: Si-Qi Chen, Qi-Tao Duan, Teng Li, He Lu
Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation of oscillating signals over a broad bandwidth is a central task in quantum sensing, yet it is often compromised by spurious responses to higher-order harmonics in realistic multi-frequency environments. Here we experimentally demonstrate a high-accuracy and broadband quantum frequency sensing protocol based on geodesic control, implemented using the electron spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By engineering an intrinsically single-frequency response, geodesic control enables bias-free frequency estimation with strong suppression of harmonic-induced systematic errors across a wide spectral range spanning from the megahertz to the gigahertz regime. Furthermore, by incorporating synchronized readout, we achieve millihertz-level frequency resolution under noisy signal conditions. Our results provide systematic experimental benchmarking of geodesic control for quantum frequency sensing and establish it as a practical approach for high-accuracy metrology in realistic environments.

Title: Remote magnon-phonon entanglement in the waveguide-magnomechanics
Authors: Shi-fan Qi, Fan Li
Abstract: Generating long-distance quantum entanglement is crucial for advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a protocol for generating remote magnon-phonon entanglement in a hybrid waveguide-magnomechanical system, where multiple spatially separated magnon modes couple to a common waveguide while interacting with their respective phonon modes. By applying tailored pulsed drives and engineering the magnon-phonon interactions, our scheme enables the creation of diverse long-distance and dynamically stable entanglement. Beyond basic magnon-phonon two-mode entanglement, it supports genuine multimode entanglement between a single phonon and multiple magnons, bipartite entanglement between a single magnon and multiple phonons, as well as genuine four-mode entanglement involving two magnons and two phonons. Moreover, we show that dissipative magnon-magnon interactions mediated by traveling photons can generate substantially stronger long-distance entanglement than coherent couplings. Our work provides an experimentally feasible scheme for the remote generation of magnon-phonon entanglement.

Title: Nanomechanical sensor resolving impulsive forces below its zero-point fluctuations
Authors: Martynas Skrabulis, Martin Colombano Sosa, Nicola Carlon Zambon, Andrei Militaru, Massimiliano Rossi, Martin Frimmer, Lukas Novotny
Abstract: The sensitivity of a mechanical transducer is ultimately limited by its inherent quantum fluctuations. Here, we use an optically levitated nanoparticle to measure impulsive forces smaller than the particle's zero-point momentum uncertainty. Our approach relies on reversibly squeezing the levitated particle's center-of-mass motion to coherently amplify the perturbation. We demonstrate resolving single impulsive-force kicks as small as 6.9 keV/c, a value 0.6 dB below the sensor's zero-point value.

Title: Mikado strategy for the detection of atoms in images of microtrap arrays
Authors: Marc Cheneau, François Goudail
Abstract: Building on top of our recent work [arXiv:2502.08511], we introduce a new strategy to solve the problem of detecting atoms in high-resolution images of microtrap arrays. By alternating estimation and detection steps, we get rid of the need for an explicit model to compute the posterior occupancy probability of each site given its a priori optimal estimate. As direct benefits, we show an improved detection accuracy compared to our previous work when the sites are not optically well resolved, and we expect a greater robustness against real experimental conditions.

Title: Quantum Zeno-like Paradox for Position Measurements: A Particle Precisely Found in Space is Nowhere to be Found in Hilbert Space
Authors: Xabier Oianguren-Asua, Roderich Tumulka
Abstract: On a quantum particle in the unit interval $[0,1]$, perform a position measurement with inaccuracy $1/n$ and then a quantum measurement of the projection $|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|$ with some arbitrary but fixed normalized $\phi$. Call the outcomes $X \in[0,1]$ and $Y \in\{0,1\}$. We show that in the limit $n\to\infty$ corresponding to perfect precision for $X$, the probability of $Y=1$ tends to 0 for every $\phi$. Since there is no density matrix, pure or mixed, which upon measurement of any $|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|$ yields outcome 1 with probability 0, our result suggests that a novel type of quantum state beyond Hilbert space is necessary to describe a quantum particle after a perfect position measurement.

Title: Flux-tunable transmon incorporating a van der Waals superconductor via an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction
Authors: Eliya Blumenthal, Ilay Mangel, Amit Kanigel, Shay Hacohen-Gourgy
Abstract: Incorporating van der Waals (vdW) superconductors into Josephson elements extends circuit-QED beyond conventional Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel junctions and enables microwave probes of unconventional condensates and subgap excitations. In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~\mu$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.

Title: Broadcasting quantum nonlinearity in hybrid systems
Authors: Alisa D. Manukhova, Andrey A. Rakhubovsky, Radim Filip
Abstract: Linear oscillators contribute to most branches of contemporary quantum science. They have already successfully served as quantum sensors and memories, found applications in quantum communication, and hold promise for cluster-state-based quantum computing. To master universal quantum processing with linear oscillators, an unconditional nonlinear operation is required. We propose such an operation using light-mediated interaction with another system that possesses a nonlinearity equivalent to more than a quadratic potential. Such a potential grants access to a nonlinear operation that can be broadcast to the target linear system. The nonlinear character of the operation can be verified by observing adequate negative values of the target system's Wigner function and the squeezing of the variance of a certain nonlinear combination of the quadratures below the thresholds attainable by Gaussian states. We explicitly evaluate an optically levitated mechanical oscillator as a flexible source of nonlinearity for a proof-of-principle demonstration of the nonlinearity broadcasting to linear systems, for example, mechanical oscillators or macroscopic atomic spin ensembles.

Title: DynQ: A Dynamic Topology-Agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine via Quality-Weighted Community Detection
Authors: Shusen Liu, Pascal Jahan Elahi, Ugo Varetto
Abstract: Quantum cloud platforms remain fundamentally non-virtualised: despite rapid hardware scaling, each user program still monopolises an entire quantum processor, preventing resource sharing, economic scalability, and quality-of-service differentiation. Existing Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) designs attempt spatial multiplexing through topology-specific or template-based partitioning, but these approaches are brittle under hardware heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects, which dominate real quantum devices. We present DynQ, the first dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that virtualises quantum hardware using quality-weighted community detection. Instead of imposing fixed geometric regions, DynQ models a quantum processor as a weighted graph derived from live calibration data and automatically discovers execution regions that maximise internal gate quality while minimising inter-region coupling. This operationalises the classical virtualisation principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing execution regions that are connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient to crosstalk and defects. We evaluate DynQ across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, comparing against state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines. On hardware with pronounced spatial quality variation, DynQ achieves up to 19.1 percent higher fidelity and 45.1 percent lower output error. When transient hardware defects cause baseline executions to fail completely, DynQ adapts dynamically and achieves over 86 percent fidelity. By transforming calibrated device graphs into adaptive virtual hardware abstractions, DynQ decouples quantum programs from fragile physical layouts and enables reliable, high-utilisation quantum cloud services.

Title: Efficient Application of Tensor Network Operators to Tensor Network States
Authors: Richard M. Milbradt, Shuo Sun, Christian B. Mendl, Johnnie Gray, Garnet K.-L. Chan
Abstract: The performance of tensor network methods has seen constant improvements over the last few years. We add to this effort by introducing a new algorithm that efficiently applies tree tensor network operators to tree tensor network states inspired by the density matrix method and the Cholesky decomposition. This application procedure is a common subroutine in tensor network methods. We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures. Additionally, our CBC still performs among the most successful methods, showing less dependence on the different bond dimensions of the operator.

Title: Transversal gates of the ((3,3,2)) qutrit code and local symmetries of the absolutely maximally entangled state of four qutrits
Authors: Ian Tan
Abstract: We provide a proof that there exists a bijection between local unitary (LU) orbits of absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states in $(\mathbb{C}^D)^{\otimes n}$ where $n$ is even, also known as perfect tensors, and LU orbits of $((n-1,D,n/2))_D$ quantum error correcting codes. Thus, by a result of Rather et al. (2023), the AME state of 4 qutrits and the pure $((3,3,2))_3$ qutrit code $\mathcal{C}$ are both unique up to the action of the LU group. We further explore the connection between the 4-qutrit AME state and the code $\mathcal{C}$ by showing that the group of transversal gates of $\mathcal{C}$ and the group of local symmetries of the AME state are closely related. Taking advantage of results from Vinberg's theory of graded Lie algebras, we find generators of both of these groups.

Title: Approximate Decoherence, Recoherence and Records in Isolated Quantum Systems
Authors: Philipp Strasberg, Joseph Schindler, Jiaozi Wang, Andreas Winter
Abstract: Using the framework of decoherent histories, we study which past events leave detectable records in isolated quantum systems under the realistic assumption that decoherence is approximate and not perfect. In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a "branch selection problem", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem.

Title: Robust topological quantum state transfer with long-range interactions in Rydberg arrays
Authors: Siri Raupach, Beatriz Olmos, Mathias B. M. Svendsen
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for fast, robust and high-fidelity topological quantum state transfer in one-dimensional systems with long-range couplings, motivated by chains of Rydberg atoms with dipole-dipole interactions. Such long-range interactions naturally give rise to extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models supporting topologically protected edge states. We show that these edge states enable high-fidelity edge-to-edge excitation transfer using both time-independent protocols, based on coherent edge state dynamics, and time-dependent protocols, based on adiabatic modulation of system parameters. Long-range couplings play a central role by enhancing the relevant energy gaps, leading to a substantial improvement in transfer efficiency compared to nearest neighbour models. The resulting transfer is robust against positional disorder, reflecting its topological origin and highlighting the potential of long-range interacting platforms for reliable quantum state transfer.

Title: Optimally Driven Dressed Qubits
Authors: Alon Salhov, Sagi Nechushtan, Alex Retzker
Abstract: The applicability and performance of qubits dressed by classical fields are limited because their control protocols give rise to an undesired counter-rotating term (CRT). This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures.

Title: Quantum Light Detection with Enhanced Photonic Neural Network
Authors: Stanisław Świerczewski, Dogyun Ko, Amir Rahmani, Juan Camilo López Carreño, Wouter Verstraelen, Piotr Deuar, Barbara Piętka, Timothy C. H. Liew, Michał Matuszewski, Andrzej Opala
Abstract: Advances in quantum technologies are accelerating the demand for optical quantum state sensors that combine high precision, versatility, and scalability within a unified hardware platform. Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently. Photonic neural networks are particularly well suited for such implementations, owing to their intrinsic sensitivity to photon-encoded quantum information. However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/\gamma \approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes. By reducing reliance on material nonlinearity and reservoir size, the proposed approach facilitates the practical deployment of high-fidelity photonic quantum sensors on existing integrated platforms, paving the way toward chip-scale quantum processors and photonic sensing technologies.

Title: A two-mode model for black hole evaporation and information flow
Authors: Erfan Bayenat, Babak Vakili
Abstract: We develop and analyze a two-oscillator model for black hole evaporation in which an effective geometric degree of freedom and a representative Hawking radiation mode are described by coupled harmonic oscillators with opposite signs in their free Hamiltonians. The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\langle n_x\rangle - \langle n_y\rangle$. The reduced entropy $S_x(t)$ exhibits periodic growth, indicating entanglement generation. These results demonstrate that even a minimal two-mode framework can capture key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation.

Title: Quantum Circuit Pre-Synthesis: Learning Local Edits to Reduce $T$-count
Authors: Daniele Lizzio Bosco, Lukasz Cincio, Giuseppe Serra, M. Cerezo
Abstract: Compiling quantum circuits into Clifford+$T$ gates is a central task for fault-tolerant quantum computing using stabilizer codes. In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis. Experimental results of our proposed strategy, applied on top of well-known synthesis algorithms, show up to a $20\%$ reduction in $T$-count on circuits with up to 25 qubits, without introducing any additional approximation error prior to synthesis.

Title: Inter-branch message transfer on superconducting quantum processors: a multi-architecture benchmark
Authors: Cameron V. Cogburn
Abstract: We treat inter-branch message transfer in a Wigner's-friend circuit as a practical benchmark for near-term superconducting quantum processors. Implementing Violaris' unitary message-transfer primitive, we compare performance across IBM Eagle, Nighthawk, and Heron (r2/r3) processors for message sizes up to $n=32$, without error mitigation. We study three message families -- sparse (one-hot), half-weight, and dense -- and measure conditional string success $p_{\mathrm{all}}=\Pr(P=\mu\mid R=0)$, memory erasure after uncomputation, and correlation diagnostics (branch contrast and bitwise mutual information). The sparse family compiles to essentially constant two-qubit depth, yielding a depth-controlled probe of device noise: at $n=32$ we observe $p_{\mathrm{all}}$ spanning $\approx0.07$ to $\approx0.68$ across backends. In contrast, half and dense messages incur rapidly growing routing overhead, and transpiler-seed variability becomes a practical limitation near the coherence frontier. We further report an amplitude sweep (no-amplification test) and a divergence ``cousins'' sweep that quantifies degradation with branch-conditioned complexity. All data and figure-generation scripts are released.

Title: Spectral Codes: A Geometric Formalism for Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Satoshi Kanno, Yoshi-aki Shimada
Abstract: We present a new geometric perspective on quantum error correction based on spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction. Overall, our results suggest that quantum error correction can be viewed as a universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry.

Title: Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Ievgen I. Arkhipov
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

Authors: Anthony M. Polloreno, Graeme Smith
Abstract: Broadband detection of a weak oscillatory field with unknown carrier frequency underlies magnetometry, axion searches and gravitational-wave sensing. We show that the Grover-like integration-time lower bound for this task is a geometric corollary an upper bound on the integrated quantum Fisher information, a metrological constraint. We further give an all-analog multi-resonant protocol based on a randomized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger control Hamiltonian and an m-register GHZ probe and verify near-optimal scaling through simulation.

Title: Enhanced quantum state discrimination under general measurements with entanglement and nonorthogonality restrictions
Authors: Swati Choudhary, Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: The minimum error probability for distinguishing between two quantum states is bounded by the Helstrom limit, derived under the assumption that measurement strategies are restricted to positive operator-valued measurements. We explore scenarios in which the error probability for discriminating two quantum states can be reduced below the Helstrom bound under some constrained access of resources, indicating the use of measurement operations that go beyond the standard positive operator-valued measurements framework. We refer to such measurements as non-positive operator-valued measurements. While existing literature often associates these measurements with initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary, followed by joint projective measurement and discarding the auxiliary, we demonstrate that initial entanglement between system and auxiliary is not necessary for the emergence of such measurements in the context of state discrimination. Interestingly, even initial product states can give rise to effective non-positive measurements on the subsystem, and achieve sub-Helstrom discrimination error when discriminating quantum states of the subsystem.

Title: A Folded Surface Code Architecture for 2D Quantum Hardware
Authors: Zhu Sun, Zhenyu Cai
Abstract: Qubit shuttling has become an indispensable ingredient for scaling leading quantum computing platforms, including semiconductor spin, neutral-atom, and trapped-ion qubits, enabling both crosstalk reduction and tighter integration of control hardware. Cai et al. (2023) proposed a scalable architecture that employs short-range shuttling to realize effective three-dimensional connectivity on a strictly two-dimensional device. Building on recent advances in quantum error correction, we show that this architecture enables the native implementation of folded surface codes on 2D hardware, reducing the runtime of all single-qubit logical Clifford gates and logical CNOTs within subsets of qubits from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ in conventional surface code lattice surgery to constant time. We present explicit protocols for these operations and demonstrate that access to a transversal $S$ gate reduces the spacetime volume of 8T-to-CCZ magic-state distillation by more than an order of magnitude compared with standard 2D lattice surgery approaches. Finally, we introduce a new "virtual-stack" layout that more efficiently exploits the quasi-three-dimensional structure of the architecture, enabling efficient multilayer routing on these two-dimensional devices.

Title: Theory of low-weight quantum codes
Authors: Fuchuan Wei, Zhengyi Han, Austin Yubo He, Zimu Li, Zi-Wen Liu
Abstract: Low check weight is practically crucial code property for fault-tolerant quantum computing, which underlies the strong interest in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. Here, we explore the theory of weight-constrained stabilizer codes from various foundational perspectives including the complexity of computing code weight and the explicit boundary of feasible low-weight codes in both theoretical and practical settings. We first prove that calculating the optimal code weight is an $\mathsf{NP}$-hard problem, demonstrating the necessity of establishing bounds for weight that are analytical or efficiently computable. Then we systematically investigate the feasible code parameters with weight constraints. We provide various explicit analytical lower bounds and in particular completely characterize stabilizer codes with weight at most 3, showing that they have distance 2 and code rate at most 1/4. We also develop a powerful linear programming (LP) scheme for setting code parameter bounds with weight constraints, which yields exact optimal weight values for all code parameters with $n\leq 9$. We further refined this constraint from multiple perspectives by considering the generator weight distribution and overlap. In particular, we consider practical architectures and demonstrate how to apply our methods to e.g.~the IBM 127-qubit chip. Our study brings the weight as a crucial parameter into coding theory and provide guidance for code design and utility in practical scenarios.

Title: Symmetric and Antisymmetric Quantum States from Graph Structure and Orientation
Authors: Matheus R. de Jesus, Eduardo O. C. Hoefel, Renato M. Angelo
Abstract: Graph states provide a powerful framework for describing multipartite entanglement in quantum information science. In their standard formulation, graph states are generated by controlled-$Z$ interactions and naturally encode symmetric exchange properties. Here we establish a precise correspondence between graph topology and exchange symmetry by proving that a graph state is fully symmetric under particle permutations if and only if the underlying graph is complete. We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering. We show that complete directed graphs endowed with appropriate orientations, for an odd number of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states. Together, these results provide a unified graph-theoretic description of bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry based on graph completeness and edge orientation.

Title: Distinguishing synthetic unravelings on quantum computers
Authors: Eloy Piñol, Piotr Sierant, Dustin Keys, Romain Veyron, Miguel Angel García-March, Tanner Reese, Morgan W. Mitchell, Jan Wehr, Maciej Lewenstein
Abstract: Distinct monitoring or intervention schemes can produce different conditioned stochastic quantum trajectories while sharing the same unconditional (ensemble-averaged) dynamics. This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by the unconditional density matrix, whereas applying a nonlinear function before averaging can yield unraveling-dependent results beyond the average evolution. A paradigmatic example is resonance fluorescence, where direct photodetection (jump/Poisson) and homodyne or heterodyne detection (diffusive/Wiener) define inequivalent unravelings of the same GKSL dynamics. In earlier work, we showed that nonlinear trajectory averages can distinguish such unravelings, but observing the effect in that optical setting requires demanding experimental precision. Here we translate the same idea to a digital setting by introducing synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits acting on one and two qubits. We design two unravelings - a projective measurement unraveling and a random-unitary "kick" unraveling - that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution while yielding different nonlinear conditional-state statistics. We implement the protocols on superconducting-qubit hardware provided by IBM Quantum to access trajectory-level information. We show that the variance across trajectories and the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy distinguish the unravelings in both theory and experiment, while the unconditional state and the ensemble-averaged expectation values that are linear in the state remain identical. Our results provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is fixed by the unconditional dynamics.

Title: Variational Quantum Circuit-Based Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization
Authors: Vincent Gurgul, Ying Chen, Stefan Lessmann
Abstract: This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

Title: Human Cardiac Measurements with Diamond Magnetometers

Edmonds, Matthew Markham, Peter A. Koss, Oliver Schnell, Ulrich G. Hofmann, Tonio Ball, Juergen Beck, Dmitry Budker, Joerg Wrachtrup, Arne Wickenbrock
Abstract: We demonstrate direct, non-invasive and non-contact detection of human cardiac magnetic signals using quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Three configurations were employed recording magnetocardiography (MCG) signals in various shielded and unshielded environments. The signals were averaged over a few hundreds up to several thousands of heart beats to detect the MCG traces. The compact room-temperature NV sensors exhibit sensitivities of 6-26 pT/Hz^(1/2) with active sensing volumes below 0.5 mm^3, defining the performance level of the demonstrated MCG measurements. While the present signals are obtained by averaging, this performance already indicates a clear path toward single-shot MCG sensing. To move beyond shielded environments toward practical clinical use, strong noise suppression is required. To this end, we implement NV-based gradiometry and achieve efficient common-mode noise rejection, enabled by the intrinsically small sensing volume of NV sensors. Together, these multi-platform results obtained across diverse magnetic environments provide a solid foundation for translating quantum sensors into human medical diagnostics such as MCG and magnetoencephalography (MEG).

Title: Tame Complexity of Effective Field Theories in the Quantum Gravity Landscape
Authors: Thomas W. Grimm, David Prieto, Mick van Vliet
Abstract: Effective field theories consistent with quantum gravity obey surprising finiteness constraints, appearing in several distinct but interconnected forms. In this work we develop a framework that unifies these observations by proposing that the defining data of such theories, as well as the landscape of effective field theories that are valid at least up to a fixed cutoff, admit descriptions with a uniform bound on complexity. To make this precise, we use tame geometry and work in sharply o-minimal structures, in which tame sets and functions come with two integer parameters that quantify their information content; we call this pair their tame complexity. Our Finite Complexity Conjectures are supported by controlled examples in which an infinite Wilsonian expansion nevertheless admits an equivalent finite-complexity description, typically through hidden rigidity conditions such as differential or recursion relations. We further assemble evidence from string compactifications, highlighting the constraining role of moduli space geometry and the importance of dualities. This perspective also yields mathematically well-defined notions of counting and volume measures on the space of effective theories, formulated in terms of effective field theory domains and coverings, whose finiteness is naturally enforced by the conjectures.

Title: Jordan-Wigner mapping between quantum-spin and fermionic Casimir effects
Authors: Katsumasa Nakayama, Kei Suzuki
Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.

Title: Dissipative diffusion in quantum state preparation: from passive cooling to system-bath engineering
Authors: Tim Pokart, Lukas König, Sebastian Diehl, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: We investigate and compare two particle number conserving protocols for the preparation of a topologically nontrivial state. The first is derived from thermally coupling the system to a cold bath, while the second is based on engineered dissipation. We numerically study the time required to reach the target state as well as its robustness against physically important perturbations. Crucially, in both protocols the cooling capability is limited by dissipatively induced diffusion processes. The resulting quadratic scaling of the cooling time with system size is corroborated also analytically using mean-field approximations and a purely classical random walk model. Furthermore, we find that the engineered protocol admits a unique and stable dark state, which contributes to an ongoing discussion regarding the applicability of dissipative state preparation to many-body systems.

Title: Stacked quantum Ising systems and quantum Ashkin-Teller model
Authors: Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We analyze the quantum states of an isolated composite system consisting of two stacked quantum Ising (SQI) subsystems, coupled by a local Hamiltonian term that preserves the $Z_2$ symmetry of each subsystem. The coupling strength is controlled by an intercoupling parameter $w$, with $w=0$ corresponding to decoupled quantum Ising systems. We focus on the quantum correlations of one of the two SQI subsystems, $S$, in the ground state of the global system, and study their dependence on both the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part $E$ and the intercoupling strength. We concentrate on regimes in which $S$ develops critical long-range correlations. The most interesting physical scenario arises when both SQI subsystems are critical. In particular, for identical SQI subsystems, the global system is equivalent to the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, characterized by an additional $Z_2$ interchange symmetry between the two subsystem operators. In this limit, one-dimensional SQI systems exhibit a peculiar critical line along which the length-scale critical exponent $\nu$ varies continuously with $w$, while two-dimensional systems develop quantum multicritical behaviors characterized by an effective enlargement of the symmetry of the critical modes, from the actual $Z_2\oplus Z_2$ symmetry to a continuous O(2) symmetry.

Title: Sedentary quantum walks on bipartite graphs
Authors: Karen Meagher, Hermie Monterde
Abstract: If a quantum walk starting on a vertex tends to stay at home, then that vertex is said to be sedentary. We prove that almost all planar graphs and almost all trees contain at least two sedentary vertices for any assignment of edge weights -- a result that suggests vertex sedentariness is a common phenomenon in trees and planar graphs. For weighted bipartite graphs, we show that a vertex is not sedentary whenever 0 does not belong to its eigenvalue support. Consequently, each vertex in a nonsingular weighted bipartite graph is not sedentary, a stark contrast to weighted trees and weighted planar graphs. A corollary of this result is that every vertex in a bipartite graph with a unique perfect matching is not sedentary for any assignment of edge weights. We also construct new families of weighted bipartite graphs with sedentary vertices using the bipartite double and subdivision operations. Finally, we show that unweighted paths and unweighted even cycles contain no sedentary vertices.

Title: When Does Adaptation Win? Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control
Authors: Nima Leclerc, Chris Miller, Nicholas Brawand
Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

Title: Frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function of IDTBT single-molecule fluorescence
Authors: Quanwei Li, Yuping Shi, Lam Lam, K. Birgitta Whaley, Graham Fleming
Abstract: The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.

Title: C2NP: A Benchmark for Learning Scale-Dependent Geometric Invariances in 3D Materials Generation
Authors: Can Polat, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban, Hasan Kurban
Abstract: Generative models for materials have achieved strong performance on periodic bulk crystals, yet their ability to generalize across scale transitions to finite nanostructures remains largely untested. We introduce Crystal-to-Nanoparticle (C2NP), a systematic benchmark for evaluating generative models when moving between infinite crystalline unit cells and finite nanoparticles, where surface effects and size-dependent distortions dominate. C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry. Overall, our results suggest that current methods rely on template memorization rather than scalable physical generalization. C2NP offers a controlled, reproducible framework for diagnosing these failures, with immediate applications to nanoparticle catalyst design, nanostructured hydrides for hydrogen storage, and materials discovery.

Title: How Entanglement Reshapes the Geometry of Quantum Differential Privacy
Authors: Xi Wang, Parastoo Sadeghi, Guodong Shi
Abstract: Quantum differential privacy provides a rigorous framework for quantifying privacy guarantees in quantum information processing. While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols.

Title: Broadband Heterodyne Microwave Detection using Rydberg Atoms with High Sensitivity
Authors: Hsuan-Jui Su, Shao-Cheng Fang, Ting-An Li, Chen-Hao Chang, Yu-Chi Chen, Yi-Hsin Chen
Abstract: We present a Rydberg atom-based microwave electric field sensor that achieves extended dynamic range and enhanced sensitivity across a broad bandwidth. By characterizing the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting induced by a single-tone microwave field, we demonstrate a spectroscopic method that simultaneously extracts both the microwave frequency and electric field strength directly from the splitting pattern. We implement dual-tone heterodyne detection, achieving a minimum detectable field strength on the order of uV/cm and a sensitivity in the sub-uV/cm/Hz^1/2 regime, while extending the operational bandwidth up to 3 GHz. Through systematic characterization of frequency and power dependencies, we identify optimal operating conditions to minimize power broadening in the resonant AT regime and maximize sensitivity in the far-off-resonance AC Stark regime. The resulting platform combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, and a dynamic range of approximately 90 dB, establishing Rydberg atoms as practical sensors for precision electric field metrology.

Title: Analytical solution of the Schrödinger equation with $1/r^3$ and attractive $1/r^2$ potentials: Universal three-body parameter of mixed-dimensional Efimov states
Authors: Yuki Ohishi, Kazuki Oi, Shimpei Endo
Abstract: We study the Schrödinger equation with $1/r^3$ and attractive $1/r^2$ potentials. Using the quantum defect theory, we obtain analytical solutions for both repulsive and attractive $1/r^3$ interactions. The obtained discrete-scale-invariant energies and wave functions, validated by excellent agreement with numerical results, provide a natural framework for describing the universality of Efimov states in mixed dimension. Specifically, we consider a three-body system consisting of two heavy particles with large dipole moments confined to a quasi-one-dimensional geometry and resonantly interacting with an unconfined light particle. With the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, this system is effectively reduced to the Schrödinger equation with $1/r^3$ and $1/r^2$ potentials, and manifests the Efimov effect. Our analytical solution suggests that, for repulsive dipole interactions, the three-body parameter of the mixed-dimensional Efimov states is universally set by the dipolar length scale, whereas for attractive interactions it explicitly depends on the short-range phase. We also investigate the effects of finite transverse confinement and find that our analytical results are useful for describing the Efimov states composed of two polar molecules and a light atom.

Title: Orthogonally Constrained CASSCF Framework: Newton-Raphson Orbital Optimization and Nuclear Gradients
Authors: Loris Delafosse, Vincent Robert, Saad Yalouz
Abstract: In a recent work, we introduced the foundations of an orthogonally constrained complete active space self-consistent field (OC-CASSCF) framework that produces state-specific molecular orbitals for mutually orthogonal multiconfigurational electronic states. In the present study, we extend this approach by incorporating a Newton-Raphson orbital-optimization scheme, for which we derive analytical expressions of the orbital gradient and Hessian. Furthermore, we outline a practical route toward the evaluation of analytical nuclear gradients, enabling geometry optimizations within the OC-CASSCF formalism. Benchmark calculations on the three lowest singlet states of LiH and H$_2$O molecules demonstrate a systematic improvement as compared to conventional state-averaged CASSCF, even when using modestly sized active spaces.

Title: Real-Time Iteration Scheme for Dynamical Mean-Field Theory: A Framework for Near-Term Quantum Simulation
Authors: Chakradhar Rangi, Aadi Singh, Ka-Ming Tam
Abstract: We present a time-domain iteration scheme for solving the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) self-consistent equations using retarded Green's functions in real time. Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics.

Title: Entanglement Entropy in CFT and Modular Nuclearity
Authors: Lorenzo Panebianco, Benedikt Wegener
Abstract: In the framework of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory, several operator algebraic notions of entanglement entropy can be associated with any pair of causally disjoint spacetime regions $\mathcal{S}_A$ and $\mathcal{S}_B$ with positive relative distance. Among them, the canonical entanglement entropy is defined as the von Neumann entropy of a canonical intermediate type I factor. In this work, we show that the canonical entanglement entropy of the vacuum state is finite for a broad class of conformal nets including the $U(1)$-current model and the $SU(n)$-loop group models. Since previous studies suggest that this finiteness property is related to nuclearity properties of the system, we show that the mutual information is finite in any local QFT satisfying a modular $p$-nuclearity condition for some $0 < p < 1$. A similar finiteness result is established for another notion of entanglement entropy introduced in this paper. We conclude with remarks for future work in this direction.

Title: Optical purification of materials based on atom walking in traveling-wave lights
Authors: Wenxi Lai
Abstract: An optical method for precise purification of chemical elements is introduced in this paper. The materials are supposed to be in the states of gaseous beams, which are coherently coupled to an external traveling light during purification. Before decoherence occurs, atoms periodically move in the light with different speeds that depends on masses and optical transition wave lengths of these atoms. The speed gradient leads to deflections of different atoms in different directions. The model is described by Schrödinger equations with analytical results. This method could be used for some hardly separable atoms and isotopes depending on the condition of atom coherent time. The present work opens a platform for applications of cold atom technology in the purification of atoms and molecules.

Title: Beyond Classical Attention: Quantum Attention for Scalable Computation
Authors: Xuyang Guo, Zhao Song, Xin Yang, Ruizhe Zhang
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance across various tasks, attention-driven models have profoundly transformed the field of machine learning. Since attention computations account for the primary computational overhead in both model inference and training, efficiently computing attention matrices has become one of the core challenges in accelerating large language models. It is well-known that quantum machines possess computational advantages over classical machines, and the role of quantum computing in LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on leveraging the Grover search algorithm to efficiently compute a sparse attention matrix. Through comparisons with classical algorithms, we demonstrate that our method achieves quantum acceleration in polynomial time. Additionally, we observe that the generated quantum attention matrices naturally exhibit low-rank structures, providing further theoretical support for efficient modeling. Moreover, within the specific context of attention matrix computation, we conduct a systematic and detailed analysis of the error and time complexity of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Parameter estimation for quantum jump unraveling
Authors: Marco Radaelli, Joseph A. Smiga, Gabriel T. Landi, Felix C. Binder
Abstract: We consider the estimation of parameters encoded in the measurement record of a continuously monitored quantum system in the jump unraveling, corresponding to a single-shot scenario, where information is continuously gathered. Here, it is generally difficult to assess the precision of the estimation procedure via the Fisher Information due to intricate temporal correlations and memory effects. In this paper we provide a full set of solutions to this problem. First, for multi-channel renewal processes we relate the Fisher Information to an underlying Markov chain and derive a easily computable expression for it. For non-renewal processes, we introduce a new algorithm that combines two methods: the monitoring operator method for metrology and the Gillespie algorithm which allows for efficient sampling of a stochastic form of the Fisher Information along individual quantum trajectories. We show that this stochastic Fisher Information satisfies useful properties related to estimation on a single run. Finally, we consider the case where some information is lost in data compression/post-selection and provide tools for computing the Fisher Information in this case. All scenarios are illustrated with instructive examples from quantum optics and condensed matter.

Title: Non-Gaussian state teleportation with a nonlinear feedforward
Authors: Vojtěch Kala, Mattia Walschaers, Radim Filip, Petr Marek
Abstract: Measurement-induced quantum computation with continuous-variable cluster states utilizes teleportation to transmit and alter quantum states via measurement-and-feedforward control. One of the key challenges of this approach is the deterioration of quantum states caused by the noise added due to imperfect entanglement of the cluster. We analyze the propagation of a quantum non-Gaussian state with nonlinear squeezing through a small cluster state. We show that a nonlinear feedforward in the deterministic teleportation protocol reduces the added noise and improves the nonlinear squeezing transferred. In a probabilistic regime, the improvement can be manifested even with current experimental resources. Better processing of non-Gaussian states can bring us closer to the necessary interplay between cluster states and non-Gaussianity required by quantum computing.

Title: Iteratively decoded magic state distillation
Authors: Kwok Ho Wan
Abstract: We present numerical simulation results for the 7-to-1 and 15-to-1 state distillation circuits, constructed using transversal CNOTs acting on multiple surface code patches. The distillation circuits are decoded iteratively using the method outlined in [arXiv:2407.20976]. We show that, with a re-configurable qubit architecture, we can perform fast magic state distillation in $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ code cycles. We confirm that both circuits suppress an injected input error rate $p$ to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ in the presence of additional circuit-level noise. We also outline how ZX-calculus and Pauli webs can be used to benchmark stabiliser proxies for these distillation circuits.

Title: Graph-Theoretic Analysis of $n$-Replica Time Evolution in the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble
Authors: Tingfei Li, Jianghui Yu
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $n$-replica time evolution operator $\mathcal{U}_n(t)\equiv e^{\mathcal{L}_nt} $ for the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (BGUE) using a graph-theoretic approach. We examine the moments of the generating operator $\mathcal{L}_n$, which governs the Euclidean time evolution within an auxiliary $D^{2n}$-dimensional Hilbert space, where $D$ represents the dimension of the Hilbert space for the original system. Explicit representations for the cases of $n = 2$ and $n = 3$ are derived, emphasizing the role of graph categorization in simplifying calculations. Furthermore, we present a general approach to streamline the calculation of time evolution for arbitrary $n$, supported by a detailed example of $n = 4$. Our results demonstrate that the $n$-replica framework not only facilitates the evaluation of various observables but also provides valuable insights into the relationship between Brownian disordered systems and quantum information theory.

Title: Non-stabilizerness of Neural Quantum States
Authors: Alessandro Sinibaldi, Antonio Francesco Mello, Mario Collura, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: We introduce a methodology to estimate non-stabilizerness or "magic", a key resource for quantum complexity, with Neural Quantum States (NQS). Our framework relies on two schemes based on Monte Carlo sampling to quantify non-stabilizerness via Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE) in arbitrary variational wave functions. When combined with NQS, this approach is effective for systems with strong correlations and in dimensions larger than one, unlike Tensor Network methods. Firstly, we study the magic content in an ensemble of random NQS, demonstrating that neural network parametrizations of the wave function capture finite non-stabilizerness besides large entanglement. Secondly, we investigate the non-stabilizerness in the ground state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. In 1D, we find that the SRE vanishes at the Majumdar-Ghosh point $J_2 = J_1/2$, consistent with a stabilizer ground state. In 2D, a dip in the SRE is observed near maximum frustration around $J_2/J_1 \approx 0.6$, suggesting a Valence Bond Solid between the two antiferromagnetic phases.

Title: Reassessing the boundary between classical and nonclassical for individual quantum processes
Authors: Yujie Zhang, David Schmid, Yìlè Yīng, Robert W. Spekkens
Abstract: There is a received wisdom about where to draw the boundary between classical and nonclassical for various types of quantum processes. For multipartite states, it is the divide between separable and entangled; for channels, the divide between entanglement-breaking and not; for sets of measurements, the divide between compatible and incompatible; for assemblages, the divide between steerable and unsteerable. However, these choices have not been motivated by any unified notion of what it means to be classically explainable. One well-motivated notion of classical explainability is the one based on generalized noncontextuality: a set of circuits is classically explainable if a generalized-noncontextual ontological model can realize the statistics they generate. In this work, we show that this notion can be leveraged to define a classical-nonclassical divide for individual quantum processes of arbitrary type. We begin the task of characterizing where the classical-nonclassical divide lies according to this proposal for a variety of different types of processes. In particular, we show that all of the following are judged to be nonclassical: every entangled state, every set of incompatible measurements, every non-entanglement-breaking channel, and every steerable assemblage. Our proposal differs from the received wisdom, however, insofar as it also judges certain subsets of the complementary classes to be nonclassical, including certain separable states, compatible sets of measurements, entanglement-breaking channels, and unsteerable assemblages. Finally, we prove structure theorems characterizing the classical-nonclassical divide based on whether a process admits of a specific type of frame representation.

Title: Powering Quantum Computation with Quantum Batteries
Authors: Yaniv Kurman, Kieran Hymas, Arkady Fedorov, William J. Munro, James Quach
Abstract: Executing quantum logic in cryogenic quantum computers requires a continuous energy supply from room-temperature control electronics. This dependence on external energy sources creates scalability limitations due to control channel density and heat dissipation. Here, we propose quantum batteries (QBs) as intrinsic quantum energy sources for quantum computation, enabling the thermodynamic limit of zero dissipation for unitary gates. Unlike classical power sources, QBs maintain quantum coherence with their load - a property that, while theoretically studied, remains unexploited in practical quantum technologies. We demonstrate that initializing a bosonic QB in a Fock state can supply the energy required for arbitrary unitary gates regardless of the circuit's depth, via the recycling of pre-charged energy. Crucially, allowing QB-qubit entanglement during computation lowers the QB initial energy requirements below established energy-fidelity bounds. This scheme facilitates a universal gate set controlled by a single parameter per qubit, its resonant frequency. The relative detuning of each qubit from the QB resonant frequency gives rise to qualitatively two gate types, off-resonance and around-resonance. The former facilitates dispersive gates which allow multi-qubit parity probing while the latter enables energy exchange between the QB and the qubits, driving both population transfer and entanglement generation. This mechanism utilizes the all-to-all connectivity of the shared resonator architecture to go beyond the standard single- and two-qubit native gates of current platforms with multi-qubit gate timescales of few pi/g, where g is the qubit-resonator coupling. The resultant speed-up includes also superextensive gates between symmetric Dicke states, characteristic of QB systems.

Title: Enhanced sensitivity in microscale high-field NMR via nuclear-spin locking with NV centers
Authors: Oliver T. Whaites, Jaime García Oliván, Jorge Casanova
Abstract: Solid state defects such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been utilized for NMR sensing at ambient temperatures for samples at the nano-scale and up to the micro-scale. Similar to standard NMR, NV-sensitivities can be increased using tesla-valued magnetic fields to boost nuclear thermal polarization, while structural parameters, such as chemical shifts, are also enhanced. However, with standard microwave (MW) based sensing techniques, NV centers struggle to track fast megahertz Larmor frequencies encountered in high-field scenarios. Previous protocols have addressed this by mapping target NMR parameters to the signal amplitude rather than the frequency, using a mediating RF field. Although successful, protocol sensitivities are limited by the coherence time ($T_2^*$) of the NMR signal owing to the presence of stages where the sample magnetization freely evolves. In this work, we propose extending this coherence time, and consequently improving sensitivity, via amplitude encoding with weak nuclear spin locking instead of free evolution, thereby taking advantage of the longer sample coherence times ($T_{1\rho}$). We demonstrate this can enhance protocol sensitivities by $\gtrsim 4$ times.

Title: Chernoff Information Bottleneck for Covert Quantum Target Sensing
Authors: Giuseppe Ortolano, Ivano Ruo-Berchera, Leonardo Banchi
Abstract: The paradigm of quantum metrology and sensing aims to identify a quantum advantage in precision at a fixed energy of the probe state. However, in practice, employing high-energy classical probes is often simpler than leveraging the quantum regime. This is not the case of covert sensing scenarios, where detection must be performed while avoiding to be discovered by an adversary, because increasing energy unduly facilitates the adversary. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to assess the quantum advantage in covert situations based on extending the information bottleneck principle to decision problems via the Chernoff information. We demonstrate how entangled photonic probes paired with photon counting significantly outperform classical coherent transmitters in covert detection and ranging, often representing the only option for secrecy. Thus, our work highlights the great potential of integrating quantum sensing into LiDAR and Radar systems to enhance covert performance.

Title: Exact treatment of the memory kernel under time-dependent system-environment coupling via a train of delta distributions
Authors: Yuta Uenaga, Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura, Takano Taira
Abstract: Memory effects in a quantum system coupled to an environment are one of the central features in the theory of open quantum systems. The dynamics of such quantum systems are typically governed by an equation of motion with a time-convolution integral of the memory kernel. However, solving such integro-differential equations is challenging, especially when the memory kernel is nonstationary (not time-translation invariant). In this paper, we analytically and nonperturbatively solve such integro-differential equations with a nonstationary memory kernel by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. We then apply this method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the damped harmonic oscillator model to demonstrate that (i) our solution asymptotes to the well-known exact solution in the continuum limit, and that (ii) our method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.

In this work, we present a quantum-assisted framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a link-based formulation of VRP. Our approach encodes flow conservation and subtour elimination directly into the cost Hamiltonian, preserving graph structure while minimizing resource requirements for practical hardware implementation. We design and implement the full pipeline on a gate-based quantum computer, including problem formulation, encoding, circuit synthesis, and execution on IBM Quantum System One. Experimental results on small VRP instances highlight the effects of penalty scaling, coefficient normalization, and circuit depth on solution feasibility under hardware noise. While scalability remains constrained by circuit complexity and decoherence, the study demonstrates a practical pathway for implementing VRP on quantum hardware and identifies methodological directions for advancing near-term quantum optimization.

Title: PT symmetry and the square well potential: Antilinear symmetry rather than Hermiticity in scattering processes
Authors: Philip D. Mannheim
Abstract: While a Hamiltonian with a real potential acts as a Hermitian operator when it acts on bound states, it produces resonances with complex energies in a scattering experiment. Scattering states are not square integrable, being instead delta function normalized. This lack of square integrability breaks the connection between Hermiticity and real eigenvalues, to thus allow for real bound state sector eigenvalues and complex scattering sector eigenvalues. When written as contour integrals delta functions take support in the complex plane, with the scattering amplitude being able to take support in the complex plane too. However, the scattering amplitude is CPT symmetric (or PT symmetric if C is conserved), regardless of whether or not states are square integrable. For resonance scattering this antilinear symmetry requires the presence of a complex conjugate pair of energies, one to describe the excitation of the resonance and the other to describe its decay, with it being their interplay that enforces probability conservation. Each complex pair of energy eigenvalues corresponds to only one observable resonance not two, to thus modify the standard pure decaying complex energy pole discussion of resonances. We show that the non-relativistic real potential square-well problem possesses PT symmetry in both the bound and scattering sectors, with there being complex conjugate pairs of energy eigenvalues in its scattering amplitude. For those values of the potential for which bound states lie right at the top of the well the scattering amplitude threshold branch point is an exceptional point, a characteristic of systems with antilinear symmetry at which there are more independent solutions to the Schrödinger equation than eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. The square well thus provides an explicit realization of how antilinearity is more general than Hermiticity.

Title: Designing open quantum systems for enabling quantum enhanced sensing through classical measurements
Authors: Robert Mattes, Albert Cabot, Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: Quantum systems in nonequilibrium conditions, where coherent many-body interactions compete with dissipative effects, can feature rich phase diagrams and emergent critical behavior. Associated collective effects, together with the continuous observation of quanta dissipated into the environment -- typically photons -- allow to achieve quantum enhanced parameter estimation. However, protocols for tapping this enhancement typically involve intricate measurements on the combined system-environment state. Here we show that many-body quantum enhancement can in fact be obtained through classical measurements, such as photon counting and homodyne detection. We illustrate this in detail for a class of open spin-boson models which can be realized in trapped-ion or cavity QED setups. Our findings highlight a route towards the design of systems that enable a practical implementation of quantum enhanced metrology through continuous classical measurements.

Title: From top quarks to enhanced quantum key distribution: A Framework for Optimal Predictability of Quantum Observables
Authors: Dennis I. Martínez-Moreno, Miguel Castillo-Celeita, Diego G. Bussandri
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of quantum measurements is a cornerstone of quantum information theory and a key resource for quantum technologies. Here, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying the predictability of measurements on a bipartite quantum system using error measures inherited from statistical learning theory: the Bayes risk and inference variance. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal measurement that minimizes the prediction error for any arbitrary observable and any two-qubit state. We establish a direct, quantitative link between the ability to surpass the fundamental limit of local unpredictability and the presence of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Additionally, by optimizing measurement choices according to the minimal Bayes risk, we propose a modified entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol achieving higher secure key rates than the standard BB84 protocol, demonstrating enhanced resilience to noise. We apply our framework in two scenarios: perfect Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy colliders. Our work offers a novel perspective on quantum correlations, connecting statistical inference, fundamental quantum phenomena, and cryptographic applications.

Title: Minimising the number of edges in LC-equivalent graph states
Authors: Hemant Sharma, Kenneth Goodenough, Johannes Borregaard, Filip Rozpędek, Jonas Helsen
Abstract: Graph states are a powerful class of entangled states with numerous applications in quantum communication and quantum computation. Local Clifford (LC) operations that map one graph state to another can alter the structure of the corresponding graphs, including changing the number of edges. Here, we tackle the associated edge-minimisation problem: finding graphs with the minimum number of edges in the LC-equivalence class of a given graph. Such graphs are called minimum edge representatives (MER) and are crucial for minimising the resources required to create a graph state. We leverage Bouchet's algebraic formulation of LC-equivalence to encode the edge-minimisation problem as an integer linear program (EDM-ILP). We further propose a simulated annealing (EDM-SA) approach guided by the local clustering coefficient for edge minimisation. We identify new MERs for graph states with up to 16 qubits by combining EDM-SA and EDM-ILP. We extend the ILP to weighted-edge minimisation, where each edge has an associated weight, and prove that this problem is NP-complete. Finally, we employ our tools to minimise the resources required to create all-photonic generalised repeater graph states using fusion operations.

Title: Effective criteria for entanglement witnesses in small dimensions
Authors: Łukasz Grzelka, Łukasz Skowronek, Karol Życzkowski
Abstract: We present an effective set of necessary and sufficient criteria for block-positivity of matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{C}$. The approach is based on Sturm sequences and quartic polynomial positivity conditions presented in recent literature. The procedure allows us to test whether a given $4\times 4$ complex matrix corresponds to an entanglement witness, and it is exact when the matrix coefficients belong to the rationals, extended by $\mathrm{i}$. The method can be generalized to $\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\mathcal{H}_d$ systems for $d>2$ to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity. We also outline an alternative approach to the problem relying on Gröbner bases.

Title: Achieving the Quantum Fisher Information Bound in Pseudo-Hermitian Sensors
Authors: Ievgen I. Arkhipov, Franco Nori, Şahin K. Özdemir
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have attracted considerable interest over the last few decades due to their unique spectral and dynamical properties not encountered in Hermitian counterparts. An intensely debated question is whether non-Hermitian systems, described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra, can offer enhanced sensitivity for parameter estimation when they are operated at or close to exceptional points. However, much of the current analysis and conclusions are based on mathematical formalism developed for Hermitian quantum systems, which is questionable when applied to pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose Hilbert space metric is intrinsically parameter dependent. Here, we develop a covariant formulation of quantum Fisher information (QFI) defined on the deformed Hilbert space of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This covariant framework ensures the preservation of the state norm and enables a consistent treatment of parameter sensitivity. We further show that the covariant QFI of pseudo-Hermitian systems is dual to the ordinary QFI of corresponding Hermitian systems. Importantly, this correspondence naturally imposes an upper bound on the covariant QFI and allows one to identify optimal projections which saturate the corresponding classical Fisher information to this ultimate limit. The developed framework also enables to set the criteria under which pseudo-Hermitian sensors can exhibit an advantage over their Hermitian counterparts of the same dimensionality.

Title: General many-body entanglement swapping protocol: opportunities for distributed quantum computing
Authors: Santeri Huhtanen, Yousef Mafi, Ali G. Moghaddam, Teemu Ojanen
Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. Moreover, we demonstrate how the three-party protocol can be generalized to many-body swapping networks, enabling a general many-body state sharing with unit fidelity via arbitrary number of intermediate nodes. This is achieved by replacing all but one of the unitary operations with those corresponding to the same Schmidt states but with a flattened spectrum, which also completely eliminates the need for postselection. We provide a proof of concept of the three-party protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as fault-tolerant entanglement swapping and new strategies for distributed quantum computing.

Title: Non-Gaussian Phase Transition and Cascade of Instabilities in the Dissipative Quantum Rabi Model
Authors: Mingyu Kang, Yikang Zhang, Kenneth R. Brown, Thomas Barthel
Abstract: The open quantum Rabi model describes a two-level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator. A Gaussian phase transition for the nonequilibrium steady states has been predicted when the bosonic mode is soft and subject to damping. We show that oscillator dephasing is a relevant perturbation, which leads to a non-Gaussian phase transition and an intriguing cascade of instabilities for $k$-th order bosonic operators, as well as a jump in the steady-state qubit polarization. For the soft-mode limit, the equations of motion form a closed hierarchy and spectral properties can be efficiently studied. To this purpose, we establish a fruitful connection to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The results for the phase diagram, stability boundaries, and relevant observables are based on mean-field analysis, exact diagonalization, perturbation theory, and Keldysh field theory.

Title: Long-ranged gates in quantum computation architectures with limited connectivity
Authors: Wolfgang Dür
Abstract: We propose a quantum computation architecture based on geometries with nearest-neighbor interactions, including e.g. planar structures. We show how to efficiently split the role of qubits into data and entanglement-generation qubits. Multipartite entangled states, e.g. 2D cluster states, are generated among the latter, and flexibly transformed via mid-circuit measurements to multiple, long-ranged Bell states, which are used to perform several two-qubit gates in parallel on data qubits. We introduce planar architectures with $n$ data and $n$ auxiliary qubits that allow one to perform $O(\sqrt n)$ long-ranged two-qubit gates simultaneously, with only one round of nearest neighbor gates and one round of mid-circuit measurements. We also show that our approach is applicable in existing superconducting quantum computation architectures, with only a constant overhead.

Title: Cornell Interaction in the Two-body Pauli-Schrödinger-type Equation Framework: The Symplectic Quantum Mechanics Formalism
Authors: R.R. Luz, R.A.S. Paiva, G.X.A. Petronilo, A.E. Santana, T.M. Rocha Filho, R.G.G. Amorim
Abstract: We investigate the quantum behavior of a quark-antiquark bound system under the influence of a magnetic field within the symplectic formulation of quantum mechanics. Employing a perturbative approach, we obtain the ground and first excited states of the system described by the Cornell potential, which incorporates both confining and non-confining interactions. After performing a Bohlin mapping in phase space, we solve the time-independent symplectic Pauli-Schrödinger-type equation and determine the corresponding Wigner function. Special attention is given to the observation of the confinement of the quark-antiquark, that is revealed in the phase space structure. Due to the presence of spin in the Hamiltonian, the results reveal that the magnetic field enhances the non-classicality of the Wigner function, signaling stronger quantum interference and a departure from classical behavior. The experimental mass spectra is used to estimate the intensity of the external field, leading to a value that is in order of the transient magnetic field measured in non-central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.

Title: Robust qubit interactions mediated by photonic topological edge states
Authors: Boris Gurevich, Weihua Xie, Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Michael H. Kolodrubetz
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.

Title: Construction and Rigorous Analysis of Quantum-Like States
Authors: Ethan Dickey, Abhijeet Vyas, Sabre Kais
Abstract: Extending upon the observations of the emergence of quantum-like states from classical complex synchronized networks, this work adds mathematical rigor to the analysis of single Quantum-Like (QL) bits constructed by eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of such networks. First, we rigorously show that symmetric construction of such networks (regular undirected/symmetric bipartite graph $G_C$ connecting two regular undirected subgraphs $G_A,\,G_B$) leads to an equal superposition of the $|+\rangle, |-\rangle$ Hadamard states (with basis $|0\rangle,\,|1\rangle$ set from eigenvectors of the subgraphs), and provide an analysis of sufficient conditions on the network for construction of such states. Second, we prove two methods to construct any arbitrary single qubit state $|\psi\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle,\, |a|^2+|b|^2=1$ and provide a switching lemma for the boundaries of both methods. The first method of construction is by detuning the regularities of the two subgraphs and the second is by asymmetrically constructing the bipartite connection matrix $C$ by allowing it to be directed, and then detuning those regularities. While the intuition is derived from the motivation of using complex synchronized networks for quantum information storage and computations, the proofs for constructing eigenvectors that interact in a quantum-like fashion only require the structure of the graph embedded in the adjacency matrix. Practically, this means that synchronization is not important to creating quantum-like bits, only that the edge weights are generally unit or close to unit and that the subgraphs are regular. As such, the results on combinations of random k-regular graphs (precisely Erdős-Rényi graphs) may be independently interesting.

Title: Quantum chemistry with provable convergence via randomized sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization

Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on classical processing of individual samples have recently emerged as the most effective and robust methods to approximate ground-state wave functions of many-body quantum systems on pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. In these algorithms, the quantum computer acts as a sampling engine that generates the subspace in which the Hamiltonian is classically diagonalized. The recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states as circuits from which samples are collected. Convergence guarantees can be derived for SKQD under similar assumptions to those of quantum phase estimation, provided that the ground-state wave function is well approximated by a polynomial subset of the full Hilbert space. However, implementations of SKQD for complex many-body Hamiltonians, such as quantum chemistry ones, are limited by the depths of time-evolution circuits needed to generate Krylov vectors. In this work, we introduce a method that combines SKQD with a qDRIFT randomized compilation of the Hamiltonian propagator. The resulting algorithm, termed SqDRIFT, enables quantum chemistry experiments on quantum processors, while preserving the convergence guarantees similar to the phase estimation algorithm. We demonstrate its viability by applying SqDRIFT to calculate the electronic ground-state energy of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to system sizes beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.

Title: Conditional squeezing induced by a two-level system: a first-principles approach to QND readout
Authors: Phoenix M. M. Paing
Abstract: We present a systematic Magnus expansion treatment of light-matter interaction beyond the Rotating Wave Approximation. We show that at the second order of Magnus series, the time-evolution operator acquires both energy-shifts and squeezing contributions. In addition to the energy shifts caused by vacuum and photon numbers, the second-order evolution operator contains a term that induces conditional squeezing of the field mode depending on the state of the atom. Such a term suggests a natural mechanism for phase-sensitive, quantum non-demolishing type measurements of squeezed light via homodyne detection. We also show that the second-order Magnus operator in a close SU(1,1) algebra, ensuring the exponentiation of the Magnus series yields a well-defined unitary evolution. By deriving squeezing directly from the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, our results clarify how energy shifts and $\hat{\sigma}$-dependent squeezing arise from an SU(1,1) structure, with direct implications for phase-sensitive and quantum nondemolition measurements.

Title: Time-resolved certification of frequency-bin entanglement over multi-mode channels
Authors: Stéphane Vinet, Marco Clementi, Marcello Bacchi, Yujie Zhang, Massimo Giacomin, Luke Neal, Paolo Villoresi, Matteo Galli, Daniele Bajoni, Thomas Jennewein
Abstract: Frequency-bin entangled photons can be efficiently produced on-chip which offers a scalable, robust and low-footprint platform for quantum communication, particularly well-suited for resource-constrained settings such as mobile or satellite-based systems. However, analyzing such entangled states typically requires active and lossy components, limiting scalability and multi-mode compatibility. We demonstrate a novel technique for processing frequency-encoded photons using linear interferometry and time-resolved detection. Our approach is fully passive and compatible with spatially multi-mode light, making it suitable for free-space and satellite to ground applications. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize frequency-bin entangled photons generated from a high-brightness multi-resonator source integrated on-chip to show the ability to perform arbitrary projective measurements over both single- and multi-mode channels. We report the first measurement of the joint temporal intensity between frequency-bin entangled photons, which allows us to certify entanglement by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, with a measured value of $|S|=2.32\pm0.05$ over multi-mode fiber. By combining time-resolved detection with energy-correlation measurements, we perform full quantum state tomography, yielding a state fidelity of up to $91\%$. We further assess our ability to produce non-classical states via a violation of time-energy entropic uncertainty relations and investigate the feasibility of a quantum key distribution protocol. Our work establishes a resource-efficient and scalable approach toward the deployment of robust frequency-bin entanglement over free-space and satellite-based links.

Title: High-contrast double Bragg interferometry via detuning control
Authors: Rui Li, Víctor José Martínez-Lahuerta, Naceur Gaaloul, Klemens Hammerer
Abstract: We propose high-contrast Mach-Zehnder atom interferometers based on double Bragg diffraction (DBD) operating under external acceleration. To mitigate differential Doppler shifts and experimental imperfections, we introduce a tri-frequency laser scheme with dynamic detuning control. We evaluate four detuning-control strategies-conventional DBD, constant detuning, linear detuning sweep (DS-DBD), and a hybrid protocol combining detuning sweep with optimal control theory (OCT)-using exact numerical simulations and a five-level S-matrix model. The OCT strategy provides the highest robustness, maintaining contrast above 95\% under realistic conditions, while the DS-DBD strategy sustains contrast above 90\% for well-collimated Bose-Einstein condensates. These results offer practical pathways to high-contrast, large-momentum-transfer DBD-based interferometers for precision quantum sensing and fundamental physics tests.

Title: Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries
Authors: Gerardo Ortiz, Chinmay Giridhar, Philipp Vojta, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.

Title: Symmetric $C_Z$ gate for ultracold neutral atoms based on counterdiabatic driving at Rydberg excitation
Authors: I. I. Beterov, K. V. Kozenko, P. Xu, I. I. Ryabtsev
Abstract: We designed a scheme for a neutral atom Rydberg blockade $C_Z$ gate based on the double sequence of adiabatic pulses applied symmetrically to both atoms and using counterdiabatic driving for Rydberg excitation. This provides a substantial reduction in the quantum gate operation time compared to previously proposed double adiabatic schemes, and makes our scheme competitive with modern time-optimal protocols for high-fidelity entangling gates with neutral atoms. Our approach creates a bridge between fully adiabatic and time-optimal gate schemes. The use of adiabatic passage reduces the sensitivity of gate fidelity to variations in laser intensity, while counterdiabatic driving provides short gate times. The intensity and phase profiles of the laser pulse acting on the atoms are described analytically depending only on the gate duration. We demonstrated the applicability of this scheme for single-photon and two-photon schemes of Rydberg excitation in rubidium and cesium atoms, and, for the first time, discussed the implementation of a $C_Z$ gate using three-photon excitation of rubidium atoms. In contrast to many modern $C_Z$ gate protocols, our scheme does not generate intrinsic single-qubit phase shifts, although they still appear in two-photon configuration. We also designed a numerically optimized amplitude-robust gate with an analytically defined phase profile of the laser pulse and compared its performance with the counteradiabatic gate scheme.

Title: Quantum Enhanced Dark-Matter Search with Entangled Fock States in High-Quality Cavities
Authors: Benjamin Freiman, Xinyuan You, Andy C. Y. Li, Raphael Cervantes, Taeyoon Kim, Anna Grasselino, Roni Harnik, Yao Lu
Abstract: We present a quantum-enhanced protocol for detecting wave-like dark matter using an array of $N$ entangled superconducting cavities initialized in an $m$-photon Fock state. By distributing and recollecting the quantum state with an entanglement-distribution operation, the scan rate scales as $N^2(m+1)$ while thermal excitation is the dominant background, significantly outperforming classical single-cavity methods under matched conditions. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme against additional noise sources, including decoherence and beamsplitter infidelity, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. In practice, the key requirements, namely high-Q superconducting radio-frequency cavities that support long integration times, high-fidelity microwave beamsplitters, and universal cavity control, are already available on current experimental platforms, making the protocol experimentally feasible.

Title: Manipulating Excitation Dynamics in Structured Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana, Ya-Tang Yu, Wei-Hsuan Chung, H. H. Jen
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) has become a central platform for studying collective light-matter interactions in low-dimensional photonic environments. While conventional wQED systems rely on uniform chirality or reciprocal emitter-waveguide coupling, we propose a structured wQED framework, where the coupling directionality of each emitter can be engineered locally to control excitation transport in an atom-nanophotonic interface. For different combinations of patterned coupling directionalities of the emitters, we identify four representative configurations that exhibit distinct dynamical behaviors: centering, wave-like, leap-frog, and dispersion excitations. Spectral analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian reveals that these dynamics originate from interferences among subradiant eigenmodes. Variance analysis further quantifies the spreading of excitation as functions of interatomic spacing and global chirality, showing tunable localization-delocalization transitions. Including nonguided losses, we find that the transport characteristics remain robust for realistic coupling efficiencies (beta >= 0.99). These results establish structured wQED as a practical route to manipulate excitation localization, coherence, and transport through programmable directionality patterns, paving the way for controllable subradiant transport and chiral quantum information routing.

Title: Twirlator: A Pipeline for Analyzing Subgroup Symmetry Effects in Quantum Machine Learning Ansatzes
Authors: Valter Uotila, Väinö Mehtola, Ilmo Salmenperä, Bo Zhao
Abstract: Symmetry is a strong inductive bias in geometric deep learning and its quantum counterpart, and has attracted increasing attention for improving the trainability of QML models. Yet incorporating symmetries into quantum machine learning (QML) ansatzes is not free: symmetrization often adds gates and constrains the circuits. To understand these effects, we present Twirlator, which is an automated pipeline that symmetrizes parameterized QML ansatzes and quantifies the trade-offs as the amount of symmetry increases. Twirlator models partial symmetries by the size of a subgroup of the symmetric group, enabling analysis between the ``no symmetry'' and ``full symmetry'' extremes. Across 19 common ansatz patterns, Twirlator symmetrizes circuits with respect to any subgroup of $S_n$ and measures (1) generator drift, (2) circuit overhead (depth and size), and (3) expressibility and entangling capability. The experimental evaluation focuses on subgroups of $S_4$ and $S_5$. Twirlator reveals that larger subgroups typically increase circuit overhead, reduce expressibility, and often increase entangling capability. The pipeline and results provide practical guidance for selecting ansatz patterns and symmetry levels that balance hardware cost and model performance in symmetry-aware QML applications.

Title: GCAMPS: A Scalable Classical Simulator for Qudit Systems
Authors: Ben Harper, Azar C. Nakhl, Thomas Quella, Martin Sevior, Muhammad Usman
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum systems are notoriously difficult computational problems, with conventional state vector and tensor network methods restricted to quantum systems that feature only a small number of qudits. The recently introduced Clifford Augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) method offer scalability and efficiency by combining both tensor network and stabilizer simulation techniques and leveraging their complementary advantages. This hybrid simulation method has indeed demonstrated significant improvements in simulation performance for qubit circuits. Our work generalises the CAMPS method to higher quantum degrees of freedom -- qudit simulation, resulting in a generalised CAMPS (GCAMPS). Benchmarking this extended simulator on quantum systems with three degrees of freedom, i.e. qutrits, we show that similar to the case of qubits, qutrit systems also benefit from a comparable speedup using these techniques. Indeed, we see a greater improvement with qutrit simulation compared to qubit simulation on the same $T$-doped random Clifford benchmarking circuit as a result of the increased difficulty of conventional qutrit simulation using tensor networks. This extension allows for the classical simulation of problems that were previously intractable without access to a quantum device and will open new avenues to study complex many-body physics and to develop efficient methods for quantum information processing.

Title: Lévy-Khintchine Structure Enables Fast-Forwardable Lindbladian Simulation
Authors: Minbo Gao, Zhengfeng Ji, Chenghua Liu
Abstract: Simulation of open quantum systems is an area of active research in quantum algorithms. In this work, we revisit the connection between Markovian open-system dynamics and averages of Hamiltonian real-time evolutions, which we refer to as Hamiltonian twirling channels. By applying the Lévy-Khintchine representation theorem, we clarify when and how a dissipative dynamics can be realized using Hamiltonian twirling channels. Guided by the general theory, we explore Hamiltonian twirling with Gaussian, compound Poisson and symmetric stable distributions and their algorithmic implications. These give wide classes of Lindbladians that can be simulated in $\Theta(t^{1/\alpha})$ Hamiltonian simulation time without any extra ancilla or other quantum gates for $1\le \alpha \le 2$. Moreover, we prove that these time complexities are asymptotically optimal using an information theoretic approach, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first result of lower bounds on fast-forwarding simulation algorithms.

Title: A contextual advantage for conclusive exclusion: repurposing the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph construction
Authors: Yìlè Yīng, David Schmid, Robert W. Spekkens
Abstract: The task of conclusive exclusion for a set of quantum states is to find a measurement such that for each state in the set, there is an outcome that allows one to conclude with certainty that the state in question was not prepared. Defining classicality of statistics as realizability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model, we show that there is a quantum-over-classical advantage for how well one can achieve conclusive exclusion. This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these. Finally, we show that this bound also constitutes a classical causal compatibility inequality within the bilocality scenario, and that its violation in quantum theory yields a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in that scenario.

Title: Quantum graphs of homomorphisms
Authors: Andre Kornell, Bert Lindenhovius
Abstract: We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case. The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We prove that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also include a short proof that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel.

Title: Reduction of thermodynamic uncertainty by a virtual qubit
Authors: Yang Li, Fu-Lin Zhang
Abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) imposes a fundamental constraint between current fluctuations and entropy production, providing a refined formulation of the second law for micro- and nanoscale systems. Quantum violations of the classical TUR reveal genuinely quantum thermodynamic effects, which are essential for improving performance and enabling optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we analyze the TUR in a class of paradigmatic quantum thermal-machine models whose operation is enabled by coherent coupling between two energy levels forming a virtual qubit. Steady-state coherences are confined to this virtual-qubit subspace, while in the absence of coherent coupling the system satisfies detailed balance with the thermal reservoirs and supports no steady-state heat currents. We show that the steady-state currents and entropy production can be fully reproduced by an effective classical Markov process, whereas current fluctuations acquire an additional purely quantum correction originating from coherence. As a result, the thermodynamic uncertainty naturally decomposes into a classical (diagonal) contribution and a coherent contribution. The latter becomes negative under resonant conditions and reaches its minimum at the coupling strength that maximizes steady-state coherence. We further identify the conditions for minimizing the thermodynamic uncertainty, and the criteria for surpassing the classical TUR bound in the vicinity of the reversible limit.

Title: Stabilizer Code-Generic Universal Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation
Authors: Nicholas J.C. Papadopoulos, Ramin Ayanzadeh
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error-correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.

Title: Reducing TLS loss in tantalum CPW resonators using titanium sacrificial layers
Authors: Zachary Degnan, Chun-Ching Chiu, Yi-Hsun Chen, David Sommers, Leonid Abdurakhimov, Lihuang Zhu, Arkady Fedorov, Peter Jacobson
Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.

Title: On Tunneling in the Quantum Multiverse
Authors: S.E. Ennadifi
Abstract: Prompted by the longstanding interpretational controversy in quantum mechanics, quantum tunneling is heuristically addressed within the Everettian quantum multiverse. In this framework, the universal wavefunction splits into decohered reflected and transmitted branches under the environmetal effect after encountring a potential barrier. The observed tunneling is then experienced by the observer located in a tunneled world. The tunneling probability and the tunneling time are investigated in terms of the tunneled world relative weights and the branching duration, respectively. The macroscopic quantum tunneling, recently honored, is also discussed and the corresponding macroscopic tunneling time is approached based on the obtained results and known data.

Title: Quantum Recurrent Unit: A Parameter-Efficient Quantum Neural Network Architecture for NISQ Devices
Authors: Tzong-Daw Wu, Hsi-Sheng Goan
Abstract: The rapid growth of modern machine learning (ML) models presents fundamental challenges in parameter efficiency and computational resource requirements. This study introduces the Quantum Recurrent Unit (QRU), a novel quantum neural network (NN) architecture specifically designed to address these challenges while remaining compatible with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QRU leverages quantum controlled-SWAP (C-SWAP; Fredkin) gates to implement an information selection mechanism inspired by classical Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), enabling selective processing of temporal information via quantum operations. Through its innovative recurrent architecture featuring measurement results feedforward state propagation and shared parameters across time steps, QRU achieves constant circuit depth and constant parameter count regardless of input sequence length, effectively circumventing stringent NISQ hardware constraints. We systematically validate QRU through three progressive experiments: (1) oscillatory behavior prediction, where 72-parameter QRU matches 197-parameter classical GRU performance; (2) Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer classification, where 35 parameters achieve 96.13% accuracy comparable to 167-parameter artificial NNs; and (3) MNIST handwritten digit recognition, where 132 parameters reach 98.05% accuracy, outperforming a 27,265-parameter convolutional NN. These results demonstrate that QRU consistently achieves comparable or superior performance with significantly fewer parameters than classical NNs while maintaining constant quantum circuit depth. The architecture's quantum-native design, combining C-SWAP-based information selection with novel recurrent processing, suggests QRU's potential as a fundamental building block for next-generation ML systems, offering a promising pathway toward more efficient and scalable quantum ML architectures.

Title: An Adaptive Purification Controller for Quantum Networks: Dynamic Protocol Selection and Multipartite Distillation
Authors: Pranav Kulkarni, Leo Sünkel, Michael Kölle
Abstract: Efficient entanglement distribution is the cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the "goodput," the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, demonstrating robustness for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, confirming real-time feasibility with decision latencies in the millisecond range per link.

Title: Atomtronic superconducting quantum interference device in synthetic dimensions
Authors: Wenxi Lai, Yu-Quan Ma, Yi-Wen Wei
Abstract: Coherence and scalability are essential properties of quantum systems required in quantum computers. This study presents a high coherent and scalable qubit system with atomtronics in synthetic dimensions. It is atomtronic counterpart of superconducting quantum interference device. Comparing with traditional superconducting quantum interference device which requires at least $2$-dimensional circuits, the synthetic dimensional superconducting quantum interference device can be realized only in $1$-dimensional circuits. The synthetic dimensional system is composed of Bose-Einstein condensate in two neighboring optical wells which is coupled to an external coherent light. Control parameter for the qubit is naturally provided by artificial magnetic flux originated from the coherent atom-light coupling. It should be a great advantage for the scalability and integration feature of quantum logic gates.

Title: Dynamical symmetries of the anisotropic oscillator
Authors: Akash Sinha, Aritra Ghosh, Bijan Bagchi
Abstract: It is well known that the Hamiltonian of an $n$-dimensional isotropic oscillator admits an $SU(n)$ symmetry, making the system maximally superintegrable. However, the dynamical symmetries of the anisotropic oscillator are much more subtle. We introduce a novel set of canonical transformations that map an $n$-dimensional anisotropic oscillator to the corresponding isotropic problem. Consequently, the anisotropic oscillator is found to possess the same number of conserved quantities as the isotropic oscillator, making it maximally superintegrable too (commensurate case). The first integrals are explicitly calculated in the case of a two-dimensional anisotropic oscillator and remarkably, they admit closed-form expressions.

Title: Involutive Markov categories and the quantum de Finetti theorem
Authors: Tobias Fritz, Antonio Lorenzin
Abstract: Markov categories have recently emerged as a powerful high-level framework for probability theory and theoretical statistics. Here we study a quantum version of this concept, called involutive Markov categories. These are equivalent to Parzygnat's quantum Markov categories, but we argue that they offer a simpler and more practical approach. Our main examples of involutive Markov categories have pre-C*-algebras, including infinite-dimensional ones, as objects, together with completely positive unital maps as morphisms in the picture of interest. In this context, we prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for both the minimal and the maximal C*-tensor norms, and we develop a categorical description of such quantum de Finetti theorems which amounts to a universal property of state spaces.

Title: Kramers Dichroism in PT Symmetric Magnets
Authors: Oles Matsyshyn, Ying Xiong, Justin C. W. Song
Abstract: Superpositions between states in doubly degenerate Kramers pairs can act as an internal degree of freedom. Here we uncover a Kramers dichroism in PT symmetric magnets: interband transitions induced by circularly polarized light irradiation produce a coherent superposition between Kramers partnered states. This allows to optically control the Kramers degree of freedom. In contrast, Kramers pairs optically excited by linearly polarized light remain in a completely mixed state. Strikingly, we find a class of second-order nonlinear responses that directly track the coherence between Kramers partnered states. Such Kramers nonlinearities can be pronounced producing large second-order nonlinear layer polarization responses activated by Kramers degeneracy in layered antiferromagnets. Together with Kramers dichroism, these render optical responses a novel means for accessing the Kramers degree of freedom and diagnosing their quantum coherent state.

Title: Integer Factorization via Tensor Network Schnorr's Sieving
Authors: Marco Tesoro, Ilaria Siloi, Daniel Jaschke, Giuseppe Magnifico, Simone Montangero
Abstract: Classical public-key cryptography standards rely on the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption protocol. The security of this protocol is based on the exponential computational complexity of the most efficient classical algorithms for factoring large semiprime numbers into their two prime components. Here, we address RSA factorization building on Schnorr's mathematical framework where factorization translates into a combinatorial optimization problem. We solve the optimization task via tensor network methods, a quantum-inspired classical numerical technique. This tensor network Schnorr's sieving algorithm displays numerical evidence of polynomial scaling of resources with the bit-length of the semiprime. We factorize RSA numbers up to 100 bits and assess how computational resources scale through numerical simulations up to 130 bits, encoding the optimization problem in quantum systems with up to 256 qubits. Only the high-order polynomial scaling of the required resources limits the factorization of larger numbers. Although these results do not currently undermine the security of the present communication infrastructure, they strongly highlight the urgency of implementing post-quantum cryptography or quantum key distribution.

Title: Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from a conserved current, application to the massive scalar boson
Authors: Domenico P.L. Castrigiano, Carmine De Rosa, Valter Moretti
Abstract: Only recently the concept of achronal localization has been developed as the adequate frame for the description of the localizability of a relativistic quantum mechanical system. Here covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method is applied to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. As (covariant) achronal localizations correspond one-to-one to (covariant) representations of the causal logic, thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly a covariant family of representations of the causal logic is derived from the stress-energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. The construction of an achronal localization from a conserved current relies on a version of the divergence theorem for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary. This result is stated and proved in this work.

Title: Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires
Authors: Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. analyzing and summing charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.

Title: Absorbing state transitions with discrete symmetries
Authors: Hyunsoo Ha, David A. Huse, Rhine Samajdar
Abstract: Robust phases of matter, which remain stable under small perturbations, are of fundamental importance in statistical physics and quantum information. Recent advances in interactive quantum dynamics have led to renewed interest in out-of-equilibrium dynamical phases and associated phase transitions in both classical and quantum many-body systems. Motivated by these developments, we investigate whether a stable absorbing phase can exist in one-dimensional classical stochastic systems, with local update rules, in the presence of fluctuations. We study models with multiple absorbing states related by discrete symmetries, such as Z2 for two-state systems, and Z3 or S3 for three-state systems. In these models, domain walls perform random walks and coarsen under local rules, which, if perfect, eventually bring the system to an absorbing state in polynomial time. However, imperfect feedback can cause domain walls to branch, potentially leading to an opposing active phase. While two-state models exhibit a well-known transition between absorbing and active phases as the branching rate increases, in three-state models with only local dynamics, branching is a relevant perturbation, ruling out a robust absorbing phase under purely local rules. However, we discover that by incorporating nonlocal information into the feedback, the absorbing phase can be stabilized, with the transition between the active and absorbing phases belonging to a new universality class. Finally, we outline how these classical rules can be implemented using deterministic quantum circuits and discuss their connections to passive error correction.

Title: Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect
Authors: Philipp Westhoff, Sebastian Paeckel, Mattia Moroder
Abstract: We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of the dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.

Title: Categories of abstract and noncommutative measurable spaces
Authors: Tobias Fritz, Antonio Lorenzin
Abstract: Gelfand duality is a fundamental result that justifies thinking of general unital $C^*$-algebras as noncommutative versions of compact Hausdorff spaces. Inspired by this perspective, we investigate what noncommutative measurable spaces should be. This leads us to consider categories of monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras as well as categories of Boolean $\sigma$-algebras, which can be thought of as abstract measurable spaces. Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces. This duality restricts to two equivalences: one involving standard Borel spaces, which are widely used in probability theory, and another involving the more general Baire measurable spaces. Moreover, this result admits a probabilistic version, where the morphisms are $\sigma$-normal cpu maps and Markov kernels, respectively. We hope that these developments can also contribute to the ongoing search for a well-behaved Markov category for measure-theoretic probability beyond the standard Borel setting - an open problem in the current state of the art.

Title: Spectral form factor of quadratic $R$-para-particle SYK model with Random Matrix Coupling
Authors: Tingfei Li
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral form factor (SFF) of the quadratic $R$-para-particle Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($R$-PSYK$_2$) model with various random matrix ensemble couplings. We generalize previous work on Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) couplings to all three Gaussian ensembles (GUE, GOE, GSE) and three circular ensembles (CUE, COE, CSE). Through analytical and numerical methods, we establish precise correspondences between GUE and CUE results, demonstrating their SFFs satisfy $\mathcal{K}_{\text{GUE}}(2t) \approx \mathcal{K}_{\text{CUE}}(t)$ in the time regime $1 \ll t \ll N$. For the symplectic ensembles, we observe similar behavior with appropriate time rescaling, while we only provide the calculation method for the orthogonal ensembles.

Title: Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons
Authors: Julius Bohm, Hugo Gerlitz, Christina Jörg, Michael Fleischhauer
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological systems is the robust quantization of particle transport. It is the origin of the integer-valued quantum Hall conductivity and a potential tool for quantum information technology. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by using arrays of photonic waveguides and described by the (lattice-translational invariant) Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model, have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. In these systems, a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound multi-photon states. Upon increasing the interaction strength a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a quantum description of topological pumps of self-bound many-particle states in terms of an effective Hamiltonian of their center-of-mass (COM) motion, which allows to introduce an effective band structure $E_\mu(K)$ with $K$ being the COM momentum, and to classify topological phases in terms of generalized symmetries. We provide an explicit analytic expression of the effective Hamiltonian for few particles in the strong interaction limit and present numerical results in the more general case. We identify a topological invariant, an effective single-particle Chern number, which fully governs the soliton transport. Increasing the interaction strength in the AAH model leads to a successive merging of COM bands, which is the origin of the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential breakdown of topological quantization for some interaction strength.

Title: Towards Quantum Simulation of Rotating Nuclei using Quantum Variational Algorithms
Authors: Dhritimalya Roy, Somnath Nag
Abstract: Quantum variational algorithms (QVAs) are increasingly potent tools for simulating quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work examines the application of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to four progressively complex models based on the cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky (CNS) framework. By incorporating single-particle spacings, pairing correlations, and rotational cranking terms, we evaluate VQE performance against exact diagonalization (ED) benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that while simpler models achieve high precision (errors $<0.005$), the transition to 8-spin-orbital Hamiltonians reveals significant scaling and optimization challenges. Notably, we show that Model IV, which employs a more expressive RealAmplitudes ansatz, successfully captures the qualitative physics of rotational alignment and reduces energy deviations compared to intermediate benchmarks. These results establish a systematic methodological baseline, identifying the breaking points of hardware-efficient ansatz while validating the potential of QVAs to model the complex competition between pairing and rotation in deformed nuclei.

Title: Spin caloritronics in collinear ferromagnetic helical structures under irradiation
Authors: Sudin Ganguly, Moumita Dey, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.

Title: Investigating Roles of Triple Excitations for High-precision Determination of Clock Properties of Alkaline Earth Metal Singly Charged Ions
Authors: A. Chakraborty, Vaibhav Katyal, B. K. Sahoo
Abstract: High-accuracy calculations of electric dipole polarizabilities and quadrupole moments ($\Theta$) of the clock states of the singly charged calcium (Ca$^+$), strontium (Sr$^+$) and barium (Ba$^+$) alkaline-earth ions are estimated by employing relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. It demonstrates importance of the triple excitations in the RCC method for precise determination of the above quantities. We also observe a different trend of correlations in the $\Theta$ values than an earlier study with respect to orbitals from higher angular momenta. Reliability of the results is verified by comparing the calculated energies, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants, and lifetimes of the atomic states with the experimental values of the $^{43}$Ca$^+$, $^{87}$Sr$^+$ and $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions. Nuclear quadrupole moments of these isotopes are also estimated by combining calculations with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants, showing large deviations from the literature values.

Title: A Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) Source Simulation
Authors: Jerry Horgan, Alexander Nico-Katz, Shelbi L. Jenkins, Ashley N. Tittelbaugh, Vivek Visan, Rohan Bali, Marco Ruffini, Boulat A. Bash, Daniel C. Kilper
Abstract: Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) offers broadband, per channel heralded EPR pairs, with a rich parameter space that allows its performance to be tailored for specific applications. We present a modular ZALM simulator that demonstrates how design choices affect output rate and fidelity. Built in NetSquid with QSI controllers, it exposes 20+ tunable parameters, supports IDEAL and REALISTIC modes, and provides reusable components for Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) sources, interference, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, fiber delay, active polarization gates, detectors, and lossy fiber. Physics based models capture Hong Ou Mandel (HOM) visibility, insertion loss, detector efficiency, gate errors, and attenuation. Using this tool, we map trade offs among fidelity, link distance, and entangled pairs per use, and show how SPDC bandwidth and DWDM grid spacing steer performance. Using the default configuration settings, average fidelity remains constant at 0.83 but the ebit rate decreases from 0.0175 at the source to 0.0 at 50 km; narrowing the SPDC degeneracy bandwidth increases the ebit rate significantly without affecting fidelity. The simulator enables codesign of source, filtering, and feedforward settings for specific quantum memories and integrates as a building block for end to end quantum network studies.

Title: Quantum Electron Clouds near Black Holes: Black Atoms and Molecules
Authors: Hinako Iseki, Shin Sasaki, Kenta Shiozawa
Abstract: We study quantum mechanical wavefunctions near highly curved spaces, i.e., black holes. By utilizing the formalism developed by DeWitt, we derive the Schrödinger equations in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild and the Reissner-Nordström black hole geometries. The quantum electron cloud for the "black hydrogen atom" - an electron trapped by black holes - is particularly studied. We solve the equations and find that black holes generally attract the wavefunctions, localizing them near the horizon where the electrons are most likely to be trapped. These results imply that not only classical objects but also the quantum material and even the chemical properties of the atoms are affected by strong gravity. We also discuss black hydrogen molecules composed of multi-centered Majumdar-Papapetrou black holes.

Title: Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor junctions as thermoelectric bolometers
Authors: Leonardo Lucchesi, Federico Paolucci
Abstract: We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $\tau_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $\tau_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,\mu{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.

Title: Correlation functions of harmonic lattices in d-dimensional space
Authors: Masafumi Shimojo, Satoshi Ishihara, Hironobu Kataoka, Atsuko Matsukawa, Kazuo Koyama
Abstract: We study the correlation functions between the dynamical variables and between their conjugate momenta at sites of a harmonic lattice in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that at the thermodynamic limit, they can be expressed in terms of Lauricella's C-type hypergeometric series. Furthermore, using these expressions, we explicitly demonstrate that the correlators near the center of the lattice satisfying Diriclet boundary conditions coincide with those for the lattice with the periodic boundary conditions. By utilizing these expressions, we expect to make it easier to create programs that compute fast and highly precise for the quantum information quantities of subsystems within lattices.

Title: Talking with a ghost: semi-virtual coupled levitated oscillators
Authors: Ronghao Yin, Yugang Ren, Deok Young Seo, Anoushka Sinha, Jonathan D. Pritchett, Qiongyuan Wu, James Millen
Abstract: Mesoscopic particles levitated by optical, electrical or magnetic fields act as mechanical oscillators with a range of surprising properties, such as tuneable oscillation frequencies, access to rotational motion, and remarkable quality factors. Coupled levitated particles display rich dynamics and non-reciprocal interactions, with applications in sensing and the exploration of non-equilibrium and quantum physics. In this work, we present a single levitated particle displaying coupled-oscillator dynamics by generating an interaction with a virtual or ``ghost'' particle. This ghost levitated particle is simulated on an analogue computer, and its properties can thus be dynamically varied. Our work represents a new angle on measurement-based bath engineering and physical simulation and, in the future, could lead to the generation of novel cooling mechanisms and complex physical simulation.

Title: Orbital Magnetization Reveals Multiband Topology
Authors: Chun Wang Chau, Robert-Jan Slager, Wojciech J. Jankowski
Abstract: We demonstrate that nontrivial multiband topological invariants of electronic wavefunctions can be revealed through orbital magnetization responses to external magnetic fields. We find that decomposing orbital magnetization into energetic and quantum-geometric contributions allows one to deduce nontrivial multiband topology, provided knowledge of the energy spectrum. We showcase our findings in general effective models with multiband Euler topology. We moreover identify such multiband topological invariants in effective models of strontium ruthenate ($\text{Sr}_2 \text{Ru} \text{O}_4$), which may in principle be verified in the state-of-the-art doping-dependent magnetization measurements. Our reconstruction scheme for multiband invariants sheds a topological perspective on the multiorbital effects in materials realizing unconventional phenomenologies of orbital currents or multiband superconductivity.

Title: Quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs at a lepton collider with polarised beams
Authors: Mohammad Mahdi Altakach, Priyanka Lamba, Fabio Maltoni, Kazuki Sakurai
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information-theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.
