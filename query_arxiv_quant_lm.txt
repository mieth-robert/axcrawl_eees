Title: Quantum Information Geometry Meets DMRG: Uhlmann Gauge Improvements in Computational Methods
Authors: Andrei Tudor Patrascu
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a novel approach combining the Uhlmann gauge bundle with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Matrix Product State (MPS) techniques to enhance the representation and preservation of quantum coherence in strongly correlated many-body systems. Conventional DMRG and MPS methods frequently encounter limitations when dealing with subtle quantum correlations and entanglement structures near critical points, avoided crossings, and topologically ordered phases. By integrating the dynamical Uhlmann gauge potential and its categorical extensions into the numerical optimization and truncation procedures, our approach substantially improves coherence stability and accuracy. Through illustrative applications in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum dynamics, we demonstrate significant enhancements in precision and reliability, underscoring the broad potential of Uhlmann gauge-enhanced computational methods.

Title: Quantum Coherence and Chaotic Dynamics: Guiding Molecular Machines Toward Low-Entropy States
Authors: Andrei Tudor Patrascu
Abstract: Quantum coherence profoundly alters classical thermodynamic expectations by modifying the structure and accessibility of probability distributions. Classically, transitions to lower-entropy states (local second-law violations) are exponentially suppressed, as lower-entropy configurations have fewer available microstates and are statistically improbable. However, introducing quantum coherence and structured quantum interference among semiclassical trajectories significantly changes this scenario. Quantum coherence reduces local entropy by establishing correlations among states that are classically independent, effectively restructuring probability amplitudes to channel transitions toward otherwise improbable low-entropy states. We analyze this phenomenon explicitly within the framework of semiclassical approximations, employing the Van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator to quantify how interference terms arising from coherent superpositions modify classical fluctuation theorems. We demonstrate that quantum coherence, especially when combined with chaos-assisted dynamical tunneling, greatly enhances the probability of transitions to low-entropy configurations, creating pronounced counter-ergodic effects. Furthermore, by considering purification of mixed quantum states, we propose methodologies for deliberately engineering quantum phases among interfering pathways. This phase engineering can explicitly enhance coherence-driven transitions into lower-entropy states, providing a novel thermodynamic resource. Finally, we explore the feasibility of molecular-scale quantum machines exploiting these principles, highlighting their potential applications in quantum thermodynamics and quantum biology for performing useful work through coherence-mediated entropy reduction.

Title: Comparing GHZ-Based Strategies for Multipartite Entanglement Distribution in 2D Repeater Networks
Authors: Mohadeseh Azari, Amy Babay, Prashant Krishnamurthy, Kaushik Seshadreesan
Abstract: We conduct a comparative study to determine the initial quality necessary to extend the distance range of an $N$-qubit GHZ state (the parent state) using two-dimensional repeaters. We analyzed two strategies for distributing initial GHZ states using a centralized quantum switch to determine if any of the strategies show benefits: i) A strategy that employs quantum memories at the switch to retain quantum states entangled with each client node, where memory usage at the switch scales linearly with the number of clients, and ii) A strategy predicated on GHZ measurements at the switch node without reliance on memory assistance. In the former scenario, the switches generate GHZ states and teleport them to the clients by utilizing remote Bell pairs that are asynchronously generated and stored in memory. Conversely, in the latter scenario, the switches perform GHZ projective measurements on freshly generated remote Bell pairs without requiring local storage at the switch. To enhance the distance range of GHZ-type entanglement distribution, we analyze the two approaches as foundational elements for a self-repeating, two-dimensional quantum repeater architecture. Here, the clients of the switch nodes become the 2D repeater nodes that store elementary GHZ states in quantum memories, that can then be fused together to generate long-distance GHZ-type entanglement between end users of the network. By examining the two strategies' entanglement distribution rates and fidelities, we identify the conditions under which the 2D repeater architecture enhances overall performance, and we determine whether either method is a superior building block for such a repeater structure. Our findings illuminate the identification of effective modalities for the long-distance multipartite entanglement distribution within quantum networks.

Title: Photonic Networking of Quantum Memories in High-Dimensions
Authors: Mikhail Shalaev, Sagnik Saha, George Toh, Isabella Goetting, Ashish Kalakuntla, Harriet Bufan Shi, Jameson O'Reilly, Yichao Yu, Christopher Monroe
Abstract: Quantum networking enables the exchange of quantum information between physically separated quantum systems, which has applications ranging from quantum computing to unconditionally secure communication. Such quantum information is generally represented by two-level quantum systems or qubits. Here, we demonstrate a quantum network of high-dimensional (HD) quantum memories or ``qudits" stored in individual atoms. The interference and detection of HD time-bin encoded single photons emitted from atomic qudit memories heralds maximally-entangled Bell states across pairs of atomic qudit levels. This approach expands the quantum information capacity of a quantum network while improving the entanglement success fraction beyond the standard 50\% limit of qubit-based measurement protocols.

Title: Peak state transfer in continuous quantum walks
Authors: Gabriel Coutinho, Krystal Guo, Vincent Schmeits
Abstract: We introduce and study peak state transfer, a notion of high state transfer in qubit networks modeled by continuous-time quantum walks. Unlike perfect or pretty good state transfer, peak state transfer does not require fidelity arbitrarily close to 1, but crucially allows for an explicit determination of the time at which transfer occurs. We provide a spectral characterization of peak state transfer, which allows us to find many examples of peak state transfer, and we also establish tight lower bounds on fidelity and success probability. As a central example, we construct a family of weighted path graphs that admit peak state transfer over arbitrarily long distances with transfer probability approaching $\pi/4 \approx 0.78$. These graphs offer exponentially improved sensitivity over known perfect state transfer examples such as the weighted paths related to hypercubes, making them practical candidates for efficient quantum wires.

Title: Variational quantum simulation of a nonadditive relaxation dynamics in a qubit coupled to a finite-temperature bath
Authors: Lucas Q. Galv√£o, Clebson Cruz, Antonio Cesar do Prado Rosa Junior, Marcelo A. Moret
Abstract: In this paper, we present an application of the variational quantum simulation (VQS) framework to capture finite-temperature open-system dynamics on near-term quantum hardware. By embedding the generalized amplitude-damping channel into the VQS algorithm, we modeled the energy exchange with a thermal bath through its Lindblad representation and thereby simulated realistic dissipative effects. To explore a wide range of activation behaviors, we introduce a nonadditive relaxation-time model using a generalized form of the Arrhenius law, based on the phenomenological parameter q. We compare our method on a driven qubit subject to both static and composite time-dependent fields, comparing population evolution and trace distance errors against exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that (i) VQS accurately maps the effective nonunitary generator under generalized amplitude damping, (ii) smoother drive envelopes induced by nonaddtive parameters suppress high frequency components and yield lower simulation errors, and (iii) the variational manifold exhibits dynamical selectivity, maintaining mapping fidelity even as the exact solution's sensitivity to q increases.

Title: Tailoring the van der Waals interaction with rotation
Authors: H. S. G. Amaral, P. P. Abrantes, F. Impens, P. A. Maia Neto, R. de Melo e Souza
Abstract: We report a systematic procedure to engineer the van der Waals force between levitated nanoparticles in high vacuum by setting them into a fast rotation. By tuning the rotation frequency close to a polaritonic resonance, we can significantly enhance the van der Waals attraction. In addition, for frequencies slightly beyond resonance, rotation can change the nature of the interaction from attraction to repulsion. Rotational Doppler shifts effectively modify the frequency-dependent polarizability of the nanoparticles, thereby reshaping their mutual interaction. As a concrete and realistic example, we consider spinning barium strontium titanate nanoparticles at state-of-the-art rotation frequencies and demonstrate a modification of the force within the sensitivity of current experimental techniques.

Title: Nonlinear optical realization of non-integrable phases accompanying quantum phase transitions
Authors: Chon-Fai Kam
Abstract: In this work, we propose an experimentally feasible nonlinear optical realization of a type of non-integrable phase found in interacting quantum systems at quantum phase transitions. We show that an exotic term in the dynamical equation governs the nonlinear polarization of the optical field along an anisotropic low-birefringence fiber with tetragonal symmetry. Intriguingly, by adiabatically tuning nonlinear susceptibilities along the fibers, the Stokes vector on the Poincar√© sphere accumulates a non-integrable phase called the Hannay angle, which shares the same geometric gauge structure as that associated with quantum phase transitions. Experimental realization via adiabatically depositing nano-crystals along the fibers is discussed.

Title: Benchmarking quantum computers via protocols
Authors: Dekel Meirom, Tal Mor, Yossi Weinstein
Abstract: Benchmarking quantum computers often deals with the parameters of single qubits or gates and sometimes deals with algorithms run on an entire chip or a noisy simulator of a chip. Here we propose the idea of using protocols to benchmark quantum computers. The advantage of using protocols, especially the seven suggested here, over other benchmarking methods is that there is a clear cutoff (i.e., a threshold) distinguishing quantumness from classicality for each of our protocols. The protocols we suggest enable a comparison among various circuit-based quantum computers, and also between real chips and their noisy simulators. This latter method may then be used to better understand the various types of noise of the real chips. We use some of these protocols to answer an important question: ``How many effective qubits are there in this N-qubit quantum computer/simulator?'', and we then conclude which effective sub-chips can be named ``truly-quantum''.

Title: Adaptive Optimization of Latency and Throughput with Fidelity Constraints in Quantum Networks Using Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Gongyu Ni, Lester Ho, Holger Claussen
Abstract: Quantum networks rely heavily on the establishment of high-fidelity entanglement links, yet achieving target fidelity typically introduces trade-offs between latency and throughput. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised adaptive purification approach employing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to optimize the balance between latency, throughput, entanglement resource utilization and fidelity thresholds in quantum repeater networks. By intelligently predicting the necessary rounds of purification per link, our method dynamically adapts to varying fidelity requirements across different quantum communication use-cases. Through simulations integrating quantum purification, entanglement establishment, and network-level request scheduling, we compare our approach to fixed-round purification and FIFO schemes. We show that the proposed scheme achieves greater flexibility in adjusting final entanglement fidelity levels while minimizing latency and enhances the efficient utilization of entangled Bell pairs. Our results underline the potential of deep learning techniques for achieving adaptive, optimized performance in future quantum networking applications.

Title: Entanglement Request Scheduling in Quantum Networks Using Deep Q-Network
Authors: Gongyu Ni, Lester Ho, Holger Claussen
Abstract: In this paper, a novel Deep Q-Network (DQN) based scheduling method to optimize delay time and fairness among entanglement requests in quantum repeater networks is proposed. The scheduling of requests determines which pairs of end nodes should be entangled during the current time slot, while other pairs are placed in a queue for future slots. However, existing research on quantum networking often relies on simple statistical models to capture the behavior of quantum hardware, such as the failure rate of establishing entanglement. Moreover, current quantum simulators do not support network behaviors, including handling, pending, and dropping requests. To bridge the gap between quantum deployments and network behaviors, in this paper a dynamic network model is presented, encompassing quantum simulations, random topologies, and user modeling. The DQN based scheduling scheme allows us to balance the conflicting objectives of minimizing delay time and maximizing fairness among these entanglement requests. The proposed technique was evaluated using simulations, with results showing that the proposed DQN achieves higher performance compared to Greedy, Proportional fair and FIFO scheduling schemes.

Title: Inverse nonlinear fast Fourier transform on SU(2) with applications to quantum signal processing
Authors: Hongkang Ni, Rahul Sarkar, Lexing Ying, Lin Lin
Abstract: The nonlinear Fourier transform (NLFT) extends the classical Fourier transform by replacing addition with matrix multiplication. While the NLFT on $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ has been widely studied, its $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ variant has only recently attracted attention due to emerging applications in quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). In this paper, we investigate the inverse NLFT on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and establish the numerical stability of the layer stripping algorithm for the first time under suitable conditions. Furthermore, we develop a fast and numerically stable algorithm, called inverse nonlinear fast Fourier transform, for performing inverse NLFT with near-linear complexity. This algorithm is applicable to computing phase factors for both QSP and the generalized QSP (GQSP).

Title: From Quantum Indistinguishability to Classical Distinguishability: Statistics and Measurement of Two-Particle Distributions
Authors: Won-Young Hwang, Kicheon Kang
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.

Title: Phase Transitions in Open Dicke Model: a degenerate perturbation theory approach
Authors: Wenqi Tong, H. Alaeian, F. Robicheaux
Abstract: We study the steady-state behavior of the open Dicke model, which describes the collective interaction of $N$ spin-$1/2$ particles with a lossy, quantized cavity mode and exhibits a superradiant phase transition above a critical light-matter coupling. While the standard model conserves total spin, Kirton and Keeling \cite{PhysRevLett.118.123602} demonstrated that even infinitesimal homogeneous local dephasing destroys this phase transition, and that local atomic decay can restore it. We analyze this interplay using degenerate perturbation theory across subspaces of fixed total spin, $S$. For coupling strengths above the threshold, we identify a critical spin value $S_c$ such that the superradiant phase transition occurs only for $S>S_c$. Our perturbative approach captures how weak dephasing and decay induce mixing between different $S$-subspaces, yielding a steady-state spin distribution whose width scales as $1/\sqrt{N}$. This framework requires only the first and second moments and can be implemented via the 2nd-cumulant approach, circumventing the need for full density matrix calculations. Our results bridge the quantum Rabi model and Dicke physics, elucidate the roles of dephasing and decay in collective quantum effects, and apply broadly to open quantum systems with degenerate steady states.

Title: Josephson Junctions in the Age of Quantum Discovery
Authors: Hyunseong Kim, Gyunghyun Jang, Seungwon Jin, Dongbin Shin, Hyeon-Jin Shin, Jie Luo, Irfan Siddiqi, Yosep Kim, Hoon Hahn Yoon, Long B. Nguyen
Abstract: The unique combination of energy conservation and nonlinear behavior exhibited by Josephson junctions has driven transformative advances in modern quantum technologies based on superconducting circuits. These superconducting devices underpin essential developments across quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communication and open pathways to innovative applications in nonreciprocal electronics. These developments are enabled by recent breakthroughs in nanofabrication and characterization methodologies, substantially enhancing device performance and scalability. The resulting innovations reshape our understanding of quantum systems and enable practical applications. This perspective explores the foundational role of Josephson junctions research in propelling quantum technologies forward. We underscore the critical importance of synergistic progress in material science, device characterization, and nanofabrication to catalyze the next wave of breakthroughs and accelerate the transition from fundamental discoveries to industrial-scale quantum utilities. Drawing parallels with the transformative impact of transistor-based integrated circuits during the Information Age, we envision Josephson junction-based circuits as central to driving a similar revolution in the emerging Quantum Age.

Authors: Maximilian Balthasar Mansky, Tobias Rohe, Gerhard Stenzel, Alejandro Bravo de la Serna, Santiago Londo√±o Castillo, Gautham Sathish, Dimitra Nikolaidou, Dmytro Bondarenko, Linus Menzel, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien
Abstract: Many computational problems are unchanged under some symmetry operation. In classical machine learning, this can be reflected with the layer structure of the neural network. In quantum machine learning, the ansatz can be tuned to correspond to the specific symmetry of the problem. We investigate this adaption of the quantum circuit to the problem symmetry on graph classification problems. On random graphs, the quantum machine learning ansatz classifies whether a given random graph is connected, bipartite, contains a Hamiltonian path or cycle, respectively. We find that if the quantum circuit reflects the inherent symmetry of the problem, it vastly outperforms the standard, unsymmetrized ansatzes. Even when the symmetry is only approximative, there is still a significant performance gain over non-symmetrized ansatzes. We show how the symmetry can be included in the quantum circuit in a straightforward constructive method.

Title: Pursuit and Review of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based Quantum Computing -- Qubit Generation, Spin Purification, Tailored RF Pulses and MRI Sequences for Quantum Computing
Authors: Z. H. Cho, J. H. Han, D. H. Suk, H. J. Jeung, S. Z. Lee, Y. B. Kim, S. H. Paek, H. G. Lee
Abstract: We propose a novel MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) technique based quantum bit (qubit) generation with water proton NMR (1H-NMR), distinct from previously proposed NMR chemical shift or spectroscopic techniques based qubit generation. We briefly review prior NMR-based techniques in the context of quantum computing, focusing on MRI-related methods. The proposed technique utilizes MRI-based gradient methods combined with set of local reverse gradients to generate multiple qubits. This configuration enables the creation of multiple localized constant magnetic fields, each producing a qubit with highly homogeneous field, therefore, a unique single frequency. The RF electronics and signal processing techniques are analogous to those used in conventional MRI scanners, allowing operation at room temperature, with the exception of the main magnet, which remains identical to that of standard MRI systems. Additional advantages of this method include the ability to leverage the extensive pulse techniques and hardware developed for MRI scanners over the past 50 years. Furthermore, the wide array of MRI pulse sequences enables highly sophisticated signal processing for quantum computing applications, such as the spin purification.

Title: Entangling two levitated particles in free space via trap modulation and Bayesian feedback
Authors: Jinke Cao, Qi Guo, Huatang Tan
Abstract: We propose an optimal control scheme for generating quantum entanglement between two optically-levitated nanoparticles in free space. Specifically, we consider that the mechanical motion frequencies of the two levitated particles are modulated by adjusting the amplitude of the trapping beam. The two particles are coupled through Coulomb interaction, and the particles' positions are continuously monitored via homodyne detection on the back-scattered light from both particles. By employing an optimal Bayesian feedback scheme, we achieve unconditional entanglement between the two particles in steady states. More precisely, a Kalman filter is used to estimate the states of the two particles and subsequently a linear quadratic regulator is applied to derive the optimal feedback forces exerted on the particles. Physically, periodic modulation enables significant quantum squeezing in both the common mode and the differential mode of the two particles. The Coulomb coupling between the particles introduces a difference in the squeezing of the two normal modes, thereby facilitating the entanglement of the two levitated particles. Our scheme allows for the realization of both conditional and unconditional entanglement at relatively low measurement efficiencies and with low requirements for Coulomb coupling strength, significantly enhancing the feasibility of implementation.

Title: Quantum Algorithms for Causal Estimands
Authors: Rishi Goel, Casey R. Myers, Sally Shrapnel
Abstract: Modern machine learning methods typically fail to adequately capture causal information. Consequently, such models do not handle data distributional shifts, are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and often learn spurious correlations. Causal machine learning, or causal inference, aims to solve these issues by estimating the expected outcome of counterfactual events, using observational and/or interventional data, where causal relationships are typically depicted as directed acyclic graphs. It is an open question as to whether these causal algorithms provide opportunities for quantum enhancement. In this paper we consider a recently developed family of non-parametric, continuous causal estimators and derive quantum algorithms for these tasks. Kernel evaluation and large matrix inversion are critical sub-routines of these classical algorithms, which makes them particularly amenable to a quantum treatment. Unlike other quantum machine learning algorithms, closed form solutions for the estimators exist, negating the need for gradient evaluation and variational learning. We describe several new hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and show that uniform consistency of the estimators is retained. Furthermore, if one is satisfied with a quantum state output that is proportional to the true causal estimand, then these algorithms inherit the exponential complexity advantages given by quantum linear system solvers.

Title: Doubling Qubits in a Trapped-Ion System via Vibrational Dual-Rail Encoding
Authors: Minhyeok Kang, Wentao Chen, Hyukjoon Kwon, Kihwan Kim, Joonsuk Huh
Abstract: Vibrational modes of trapped ions have traditionally served as quantum buses to mediate internal qubits. However, with recent advances in quantum control, it has become possible to use these vibrational modes directly as quantum computational resources, such as bosonic qubits. Here, we propose a dual-rail encoding scheme in which a dual-rail qubit is encoded by two vibrational modes that share a single phonon. We present the preparation, measurement, and implementation of single- and two-qubit gates, enabling universal quantum computation. The dual-rail qubit system offers scalability and all-to-all connectivity. Moreover, we extend the dual-rail qubit system to a logical internal qubit--dual-rail qubit hybrid system by incorporating internal qubits into the dual-rail qubit system as another type of logical qubit. The hybrid system nearly doubles the number of available logical qubits compared to conventional trapped-ion quantum computers while maintaining all-to-all connectivity. Additionally, we propose a method for implementing multi-qubit controlled gates and discuss potential applications that can leverage the advantages of the hybrid system. Our scheme provides a practical framework for an internal qubit-boson qubit hybrid system.

Title: On neutron holography, neutron interferometry and neutron orbital angular momentum
Authors: Wolfgang Treimer, Frank Hau√üer, Ingeborg Beckers, Martin Suda, Terrence Jach
Abstract: A neutron Laue crystal interferometer has been reported by Saranac et al . to demonstrate neutron holography of a spiral phase plate. Using its two coherent beams as the object and reference beams, the resulting interference pattern was interpreted as a hologram. This interference pattern was then reported to reconstruct neutron beams with various intrinsic orbital angular momenta. There are serious doubts about the method for generating neutron orbital angular momentum with a crystal interferometer. Due to the extremely different lateral coherence lengths in the interferometer, one should expect the pattern described as a hologram to be asymmetric. In addition, a neutron crystal interferometer always produces a Moire image where the beams are combined in the final crystal, that appears as a one-dimensional enlargement of the interference pattern. We present computer simulations showing that the images presented as holograms can be computed as conventional interference patterns assuming the phase shifts of ordinary neutrons passing through objects located in one or the other beam path of the interferometer. Additionally, we discuss the complications of using a crystal interferometer for holography, while raising the question of whether the intrinsic orbital angular momentum states of neutrons are necessary or sufficient to explain the recorded images.

Title: Countermeasure against Detector Blinding Attack with Secret Key Leakage Estimation
Authors: Dmitry M. Melkonian, Daniil S. Bulavkin, Kirill E. Bugai, Kirill A. Balygin, Dmitriy A. Dvoretskiy
Abstract: We present a countermeasure against the detector blinding attack (DBA) utilizing statistical analysis of error and double-click events accumulated during a quantum key distribution session under randomized modulation of single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detection efficiencies via gate voltage manipulation. Building upon prior work demonstrating the ineffectiveness of this countermeasure against continuous-wave (CW) DBA, we extend the analysis to evaluate its performance against pulsed DBA. Our findings reveal an approximately 25 dB increase in the trigger pulse energies difference between high and low gate voltage applied under pulsed DBA conditions compared to CW DBA. This heightened difference enables a re-evaluation of the feasibility of utilizing SPAD detection probability variations as a countermeasure and makes it possible to estimate the fraction of bits compromised by an adversary during pulsed DBA.

Title: From Theory to Practice: Analyzing VQPM for Quantum Optimization of QUBO Problems
Authors: Ammar Daskin
Abstract: The variational quantum power method (VQPM), which adapts the classical power iteration algorithm for quantum settings, has shown promise for eigenvector estimation and optimization on quantum hardware. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis of VQPM by investigating its convergence, robustness, and qubit locking mechanisms. We present detailed strategies for applying VQPM to QUBO problems by leveraging these locking mechanisms. Based on the simulations for each strategy we have carried out, we give systematic guidelines for their practical applications. We also offer a simple numerical comparison with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) by running both algorithms on a set of trial problems. Our results indicate that VQPM can be employed as an effective quantum optimization algorithm on quantum computers for QUBO problems, and this work can serve as an initial guideline for such applications.

Title: Physics-Aware Compilation for Parallel Quantum Circuit Execution on Neutral Atom Arrays
Authors: Geng Chen, Guowu Yang, Wenjie Sun, Lianhui Yu, Guangwei Deng, Desheng Zheng, Xiaoyu Li
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers are one of the most promising quantum architectures, offering advantages in scalability, dynamic reconfigurability, and potential for large-scale implementations. These characteristics create unique compilation challenges, especially regarding compilation efficiency while adapting to hardware flexibility. However, existing methods encounter significant performance bottlenecks at scale, hindering practical applications. We propose Physics-Aware Compilation (PAC), a method that improves compilation efficiency while preserving the inherent flexibility of neutral atom systems. PAC introduces physics-aware hardware plane partitioning that strategically allocates hardware resources based on physical device characteristics like AOD and SLM trap properties and qubit mobility constraints. Additionally, it implements parallel quantum circuit division with an improved Kernighan-Lin algorithm that enables simultaneous execution across independent regions while maintaining circuit fidelity. Our experimental evaluation compares PAC with state-of-the-art methods across increasingly larger array sizes ranging from 16x16 to 64x64 qubits. Results demonstrate that PAC achieves up to 78.5x speedup on 16x16 arrays while maintaining comparable circuit quality. PAC's compilation efficiency advantage increases with system scale, demonstrating scalability for practical quantum applications on larger arrays. PAC explores a viable path for practical applications of neutral atom quantum computers by effectively addressing the tension between compilation efficiency and hardware flexibility.

Title: Verifying Quantum Memory in the Dynamics of Spin Boson Models
Authors: Charlotte B√§cker, Valentin Link, Walter T. Strunz
Abstract: We investigate the nature of memory effects in the non-Markovian dynamics of spin boson models. Local quantum memory criteria can be used to indicate that the reduced dynamics of an open system necessarily requires a quantum memory in its environment. We apply two such criteria, derived from different definitions put forward in the literature, to spin boson and two-spin boson models. For the computation of dynamical maps and process tensors, we employ a numerically exact method for non-Markovian open system dynamics based on matrix product operator influence functionals, that can be applied across broad parameter regimes. We find that, with access to single-intervention process tensors, one can generally predict quantum memory in the dynamics at low temperatures. Given instead only the dynamical map, we are still able to detect quantum memory in the case of resonant environments at short evolution times. Moreover, we confirm quantum memory in the stationary dynamical regime using process tensors with the correlated steady state of system and environment as initial condition.

Authors: Honglin Ren, Lin Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convex roof measure of quantum coherence, with a focus on their superadditive properties. We propose sufficient conditions and establish a framework for coherence superadditivity in tripartite and multipartite systems. Through theoretical derivation, the relevant theorems are given. These results not only expand our understanding of the superadditivity of pure and mixed states but also characterize the conditions under which the superadditivity relations reach equality. Finally, the proposed methods and conclusions are verified through representative examples, providing new theoretical insights into the distribution of quantum coherence in multi-part systems.

Title: Exponential enhancement of sensitivity in Ramsey interferometry with optically thick ensemble of atoms
Authors: S.A. Moiseev, K.I. Gerasimov, M.M. Minnegaliev, I.V. Brekotkin, E.S. Moiseev
Abstract: Ramsey interferometry is a cornerstone technique for precise measurement of time and frequency in modern clocks. The Ramsey experiments are typically done in optically dilute samples of atoms to improve homogeneity and avoid back-action of atoms on excitation pulses. In contrast to later belief, we predict and experimentally show that in optically thick samples with inhomogeneous broadening of resonant transition, the back-action can lead to the highly enhanced narrowing of Ramsey resonance. The linewidth narrowing and corresponding precision of the frequency measurement scale exponentially with an increase in optical depth of a sample and can reach the limits set by homogeneous broadening. We show that this effect is caused by a nonlinear interference of multiple echoes formed inside the atomic medium, which is experimentally confirmed with $^{167}\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions in $\text{Y}_2\text{SiO}_5$ crystal. Our findings open new opportunities for nonlinear high-resolution spectroscopy of resonant media and sensitivity enhancement in a new generation of solid state clocks.

Title: Conditions for Quantum Violation of Macrorealism in Large-spin Limit
Authors: Qi-Hong Cai, Xue-Hao Yu, Ma-Cheng Yang, Ao-Xiang Liu, Cong-Feng Qiao
Abstract: This study investigates how macroscopic classical behavior emerges from a quantum underpinning with counterintuitive characteristics. The deviation from classical standpoint of a quantum system's temporal correlations is measured via the entropic Leggett-Garg inequality. We introduce a geometric framework to derive entropic Leggett-Garg inequalities involving higher-order correlations, and analyze their asymptotic behavior in large-spin systems by employing the WKB approximation. Results show that, for maximally mixed states, quantum violations converge to a constant in the macroscopic limit, rather than growing logarithmically with the system's entropy, indicating that macroscopic realism increasingly dominates as the number of energy levels expands. However, exceptions arise with certain parameter settings, where the semiclassical approximation breaks down entirely, enabling inequalities to exhibit maximal quantum violation, thus revealing that quantum and classical descriptions remain incompatible even on a macroscopic scale. It is noteworthy this violation originates exclusively from the temporal correlations of a single system, distinguishing it from macroscopic quantum phenomena observed in many-body systems such as superconductivity.

Title: Parametric Stability Analysis for Circuit Quantum Electrodynamical Hardwares
Authors: Maria Gabriela Boada, Andrea Delgado, Jose Morales Escalante
Abstract: The transmon qubit, essential to quantum computation, exhibits disordered dynamics under strong parametric drives critical to its control. We present a combined theoretical and numerical study of stability regions in circuit QED using Floquet theory, focusing on the appearance of Arnold tongues that distinguish stable from unstable regimes. Starting from simple Josephson circuits and progressing to full multimode qubit-cavity systems, we show how time-dependent modulation maps the dynamics to Mathieu-type equations, revealing thresholds for parametric resonances. Perturbative corrections capture effects like higher harmonics and weak nonlinearities. Simulations validate these predictions and expose sensitivity to fabrication parameters. These findings inform thresholds for readout fidelity, amplifier gain, and multi-qubit gate stability.

Title: Repeated quantum backflow and overflow
Authors: Christopher J. Fewster, Harkan J. Kirk-Karakaya
Abstract: Quantum backflow is a surprising phenomenon in which a quantum particle, moving in one dimension and with a state of rightwards momentum, can exhibit a net probability transfer to the left-hand half-line over a finite time interval. We generalise the setting of quantum backflow to allow for $M$ disjoint time intervals, considering the sum of probability differences for each interval. In classical statistical particle mechanics, the total backflow lies in the interval $[-1,0]$ for all $M$, indicating rightwards probability transfer. By contrast, we show that, in quantum mechanics, the maximum $M$-fold backflow is positive and unbounded from above as $M$ increases, demonstrating that there are states that exhibit repeated periods of backflow. Moreover, for $M\ge 2$, we discover a new phenomenon; namely, that there are states whose total backflow is below $-1$, giving a probability transfer to the right-hand half-line beyond that possible in classical statistical particle mechanics. We call this effect "quantum overflow". The maximum extent of the backflow and overflow effects is described by a hierarchy of backflow and overflow functions and constants, where the $M$'th backflow (overflow) constant is the supremum (infimum) of the $M$'th backflow (overflow) function. The $M=1$ backflow constant was first identified by Bracken and Melloy. Our results are obtained by formulating the $M$-fold backflow problem in terms of the spectra of suitable bounded operators. Using this formulation, we also study limiting cases of the backflow and overflow functions, including cases in which two disjoint intervals merge. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical investigations. Among other things, by applying numerical acceleration methods, we obtain a new estimate of the Bracken-Melloy constant of $0.0384506$ which is slightly lower than the previously accepted value of $0.038452$.

Authors: Lingxiao Li, Yihao Wang, Jiacheng Fan, Jing Li, Sujuan Qin, Qiaoyan Wen, Fei Gao
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are integral to advancing natural language processing, used extensively from machine translation to content creation. However, as these models scale to billions of parameters, their resource demands increase dramatically. Meanwhile, quantum computing is recognized for efficiently solving complex problems with quantum characteristics like superposition and entanglement, providing a novel approach to these challenges. This paper attempts to combine quantum computing with LLMs and proposes a Quantum knowledge Distillation algorithm for LLMs (QD-LLM), aimed at reducing the computational and memory overhead required for model loading and inference. Specifically, during the distillation stage, data is fed simultaneously into both the LLMs and the designed quantum student model to initially quantify the difference between their outputs; subsequently, with the help of the true label, the optimization of the quantum student model is executed to minimize the difference with the LLM's output. Throughout this process, only the parameters of the quantum student network are updated to make its output closer to that of the LLMs, thereby achieving the purpose of distillation. Finally, the optimized student model obtained by QD-LLM can efficiently solve domain-specific tasks during inference without the usage of the original LLMs. Experimental results show that, compared to mainstream compression methods, QD-LLM significantly reduces the number of training parameters, memory consumption, training time, and inference time while maintaining performance. Moreover, the optimized student model obtained by QD-LLM surpasses specific models designed for these tasks. We believe that QD-LLM can lay the groundwork for exploring the utilization of quantum computing in model compression and its potential extension to other natural language processing challenges.

Title: Discrete Time Crystals in the spin-s Central Spin Model
Authors: Hillol Biswas, Sayan Choudhury
Abstract: We propose periodic driving protocols to realize discrete time crystals (DTCs) in a spin-s central spin model. Interestingly, we identify parameter regimes, where eternal period-doubling and higher-order(HO)-DTCs can be realized, even for finite-sized systems. We have determined the dependence of the DTC order on the number of satellite spins and the central spin value, s. Intriguingly, we find that certain classes of HO-DTCs produce a series of maximally entangled Bell cat and super-cat states during their dynamical evolution. Finally, we demonstrate that the HO-DTCs can be employed for quantum-enhanced multiparameter sensing at the Heisenberg limit.

Title: Efficient Generation of Parameterised Quantum Circuits from Large Texts
Authors: Colin Krawchuk, Nikhil Khatri, Neil John Ortega, Dimitri Kartsaklis
Abstract: Quantum approaches to natural language processing (NLP) are redefining how linguistic information is represented and processed. While traditional hybrid quantum-classical models rely heavily on classical neural networks, recent advancements propose a novel framework, DisCoCirc, capable of directly encoding entire documents as parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs), besides enjoying some additional interpretability and compositionality benefits. Following these ideas, this paper introduces an efficient methodology for converting large-scale texts into quantum circuits using tree-like representations of pregroup diagrams. Exploiting the compositional parallels between language and quantum mechanics, grounded in symmetric monoidal categories, our approach enables faithful and efficient encoding of syntactic and discourse relationships in long and complex texts (up to 6410 words in our experiments) to quantum circuits. The developed system is provided to the community as part of the augmented open-source quantum NLP package lambeq Gen II.

Title: Quantum Hamiltonian Certification
Authors: Minbo Gao, Zhengfeng Ji, Qisheng Wang, Wenjun Yu, Qi Zhao
Abstract: We formalize and study the Hamiltonian certification problem. Given access to $e^{-\mathrm{i} Ht}$ for an unknown Hamiltonian $H$, the goal of the problem is to determine whether $H$ is $\varepsilon_1$-close to or $\varepsilon_2$-far from a target Hamiltonian $H_0$. While Hamiltonian learning methods have been extensively studied, they often require restrictive assumptions and suffer from inefficiencies when adapted for certification tasks. This work introduces a direct and efficient framework for Hamiltonian certification. Our approach achieves \textit{optimal} total evolution time $\Theta((\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1)^{-1})$ for certification under the normalized Frobenius norm, without prior structural assumptions. This approach also extends to certify Hamiltonians with respect to all Pauli norms and normalized Schatten $p$-norms for $1\leq p\leq2$ in the one-sided error setting ($\varepsilon_1=0$). Notably, the result in Pauli $1$-norm suggests a quadratic advantage of our approach over all possible Hamiltonian learning approaches. We also establish matching lower bounds to show the optimality of our approach across all the above norms. We complement our result by showing that the certification problem with respect to normalized Schatten $\infty$-norm is $\mathsf{coQMA}$-hard, and therefore unlikely to have efficient solutions. This hardness result provides strong evidence that our focus on the above metrics is not merely a technical choice but a requirement for efficient certification. To enhance practical applicability, we develop an ancilla-free certification method that maintains the inverse precision scaling while eliminating the need for auxiliary qubits, making our approach immediately accessible for near-term quantum devices with limited resources.

Title: Partite-wise Entanglement
Authors: Yu Guo, Ning Yang
Abstract: It is known that $\rho^{AB}$ as a bipartite reduced state of the 3-qubit GHZ state is separable, but part $A$ and part $B$ are indeed entangled with each other without tracing out part $C$. Namely, whether a state containing entanglement is always dependent on the global system it lives in. We explore here such entanglement in any $n$-partite system with arbitrary dimensions, $n\geqslant3$, and call it partite-wise entanglement (PWE) which contains pairwise entanglement (PE) proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 032420(2024)] as a special case. In particular, we investigate the partite-wise entanglement extensibility, and from which we find that the reduced state of a genuine entangled state could be any mixed state without pure reduced states. We then propose three classes of the partite-wise entanglement measures which are based on the genuine entanglement measure, minimal bipartition measure, and the minimal distance from the partite-wise separable states, respectively. The former two methods are far-ranging since all of them are defined by the reduced functions. Consequently, we establish the framework of the resource theory of the partite-wise entanglement and the genuine partite-wise entanglement for which the free states are the pure states and the states with pure reduced states, respectively.

Title: A Game-Theoretic Quantum Algorithm for Solving Magic Squares
Authors: Sarah Chehade, Andrea Delgado, Elaine Wong
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising near-term approach to finding optimal quantum strategies for playing non-local games. These games test quantum correlations beyond classical limits and enable entanglement verification. In this work, we present a variational framework for the Magic Square Game (MSG), a two-player non-local game with perfect quantum advantage. We construct a value Hamiltonian that encodes the game's parity and consistency constraints, then optimize parameterized quantum circuits to minimize this cost. Our approach builds on the stabilizer formalism, leverages commutation structure for circuit design, and is hardware-efficient. Compared to existing work, our contribution emphasizes algebraic structure and interpretability. We validate our method through numerical experiments and outline generalizations to larger games.

Title: Unraveling superradiance: entanglement and mutual information in collective decay
Authors: Xin H. H. Zhang, Daniel Malz, Peter Rabl
Abstract: We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters into a squeezed photonic reservoir. By using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an accelerated initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of spin squeezing in the steady state, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we show that our numerical approach is also applicable for the investigation of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at very long times.

Title: Optical signatures of coherence in molecular dimers
Authors: Priyankar Banerjee, Adam Burgess, Julian Wiercinski, Moritz Cygorek, Erik M. Gauger
Abstract: We calculate experimentally measurable signatures of quantum correlations in a coupled molecular dimer that strongly interacts with its vibrational environment. We investigate intensity and mode-resolved photon coincidences for different relative orientations of such dimers, and observe spatio-temporal correlations for various configurations. We find that projective measurements can produce cooperative signatures even when emitters are arranged orthogonal to each other. To model effects of vibrational environments that are present in realistic experimental situations, we use the polaron framework. Further, we also account for the effects of finite instrument response, varying temperature, and presence of static disorder. We analyse the effect of disorder in both dimer orientation and measurement direction and find that photon coincidences remain well-resolvable using state-of-the-art detectors. This work enhances our understanding of cooperative emission from two coupled emitters and offers direction for future experiments on probing their coherent dynamics.

Title: Towards local and compositional measurements in quantum field theory
Authors: Robert Oeckl (CCM-UNAM), Adamantia Zampeli (ICTQT)
Abstract: A universal framework for the joint measurement of multiple localized observables in quantum field theory satisfying spacetime locality and compositionality is still lacking. We present an approach to the problem that is based on the one hand on the positive formalism, an axiomatic framework, where it is clear from the outset that we satisfy locality and compositionality, while also having a consistent probabilistic interpretation. On the other hand, the approach is based on standard tools from quantum field theory, in particular the path integral and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. After an overview of the conceptual foundations we introduce the modulus-square construction as a formalization of the measurement process for an important class of observables including quadratic observables. We show that this construction has many of the desired properties, including positivity, locality, single measurement recovery and compositionality. We introduce a renormalization scheme for the measurement of quadratic observables that also satisfies compositionality, in contrast to previous renormalization schemes. We discuss relativistic causality, confirming that measurements in our scheme are indeed localized in the spacetime regions where the underlying observables have support.

Title: Towards an Atomic Agency for Quantum-AI
Authors: Mauritz Kop
Abstract: This essay analyzes emerging AI & quantum technology (incl. quantum-AI hybrids) regulation, export controls, and standards in the US, EU, & China, comparing legislative efforts anno 2025 to balance benefits/risks via their distinct innovation systems. While finding convergence on needing responsible governance despite differing philosophies, it posits risks from a US 'Washington effect' (premature regulation under uncertainty) and a Chinese 'Beijing effect' (exporting autocratic norms via standards/Digital Silk Road), exacerbated by export controls and decoupling. Faced with planetary challenges, it explores pathways toward a harmonized Quantum Acquis Planetaire, anchored in universal values ('what connects us') via foundational standards and agile legal guardrails. Smart regulation must incentivize responsible behavior (e.g., RQT by design) and ensure equitable benefit/risk distribution, requiring cooperative stewardship and strategic Sino-American recoupling. This could be coupled with collaborative research platforms for quantum and AI (which are increasingly interdependent) akin to CERN or ITER - emulating successful international resource pooling to foster coordinated responsible innovation. Realizing goals like fault tolerant quantum-centric supercomputing, algorithmic development and use case discovery requires such collective global expertise, challenging protectionist measures that stifle collaboration and supply chains. The Quantum Acquis Planetaire, envisioned as a global body of Quantum Law, could be codified via a UN Quantum Treaty inspired by precedents like the 2024 UN AI Resolution and 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), designed to align quantum advancements with global imperatives such as the UN SDGs. To enforce it, manage arms race risks, and ensure non-proliferation, an 'Atomic Agency for Quantum-AI' (modeled on IAEA safeguards) warrants serious examination.

Title: The Journey from Planck Distribution to Bose Statistics From Classical to Quantum Mechanics and Beyond
Authors: Shreetam Dash, Prasanta K. Panigrahi
Abstract: In 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose's pioneering work laid the foundation for Bose-Einstein statistics, which describes particles with integral spins. His derivation of Planck's law for blackbody radiation bypassed classical assumptions, relying instead on the statistical mechanics of light quanta. Bose's methodology addressed limitations in existing theories, such as Einstein's dependence on classical concepts like Wien's displacement law and Bohr's correspondence principle. Further, his work underscored the incompatibility between classical electrodynamics and quantum theory, proposing innovative statistical approaches to thermodynamic equilibrium. The insights from Bose's work extend beyond theoretical physics. As was immediately noticed by Einstein, for temperatures below a critical threshold, Bose-Einstein statistics predicts the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where particles condense en-masse into the ground state. This quantum phenomenon on a macroscopic scale opened avenues to explore new technologies in recent times, apart from throwing light on new phases of matter. This article revisits Bose's groundbreaking contributions, highlighting their enduring impact on quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and field theory.

Title: Self-consciousness and personal identity in quantum panprotopsychism
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini, Jorge Pullin
Abstract: In previous papers, we demonstrated that an ontology of quantum mechanics, described in terms of states and events with internal phenomenal aspects (a form of panprotopsychism), is well suited to explain consciousness. We showed that the combination problems of qualities, structures and subjects in panpsychism and panprotopsychism stem from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics regarding supervenience, which are not applicable at the quantum level. Within this view, consciousness arises in entangled quantum systems coupled to the neural network of the brain. In entangled systems, the properties of individual parts disappear, giving rise to an exponential number of emergent properties and states. Here, we analyze self-consciousness as the capacity to view oneself as a subject of experience. The causal openness of quantum systems provides self-conscious beings the ability to make independent choices and decisions, reflecting a sense of self-governance and autonomy. In this context, the issue of personal identity takes a new form free from the problems of the simple view or the reductive approaches.

Title: Enhancing Network Anomaly Detection with Quantum GANs and Successive Data Injection for Multivariate Time Series
Authors: Wajdi Hammami, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Shengrui Wang
Abstract: Quantum computing may offer new approaches for advancing machine learning, including in complex tasks such as anomaly detection in network traffic. In this paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) architecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting technique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method encodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both data re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum states efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the restricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an anomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the discriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. The QGAN was trained using the parameter shift rule and benchmarked against a classical GAN. Experimental results indicate that the quantum model achieves a accuracy high along with high recall and F1-scores in anomaly detection, and attains a lower MSE compared to the classical model. Notably, the QGAN accomplishes this performance with only 80 parameters, demonstrating competitive results with a compact architecture. Tests using a noisy simulator suggest that the approach remains effective under realistic noise-prone conditions.

Title: Redefining Neural Operators in $d+1$ Dimensions
Authors: Haoze Song, Zhihao Li, Xiaobo Zhang, Zecheng Gan, Zhilu Lai, Wei Wang
Abstract: Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely validated on universally approximating various operators. Although recent advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$ dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3...$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the embedding spaces blocks our view to design neural operators that can fully capture the target system evolution. Drawing on recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution process in neural operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement our proposed Schr√∂dingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. In experiments, our $d+1$ dimensional evolving linear block performs far better than others. Also, we test SKNO's SOTA performance on various benchmark tests and also the zero-shot super-resolution task. In addition, we analyse the impact of different lifting and recovering operators on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.

Title: Q-Policy: Quantum-Enhanced Policy Evaluation for Scalable Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Kalyan Cherukuri, Aarav Lala, Yash Yardi
Abstract: We propose Q-Policy, a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework that mathematically accelerates policy evaluation and optimization by exploiting quantum computing primitives. Q-Policy encodes value functions in quantum superposition, enabling simultaneous evaluation of multiple state-action pairs via amplitude encoding and quantum parallelism. We introduce a quantum-enhanced policy iteration algorithm with provable polynomial reductions in sample complexity for the evaluation step, under standard assumptions. To demonstrate the technical feasibility and theoretical soundness of our approach, we validate Q-Policy on classical emulations of small discrete control tasks. Due to current hardware and simulation limitations, our experiments focus on showcasing proof-of-concept behavior rather than large-scale empirical evaluation. Our results support the potential of Q-Policy as a theoretical foundation for scalable RL on future quantum devices, addressing RL scalability challenges beyond classical approaches.

Title: Unlocking Photon Magnon Interplay via Saturation Magnetization
Authors: Sachin Verma, Jiten Mahalik, Abhishek Maurya, Rajeev Singh, Biswanath Bhoi
Abstract: Photon magnon hybrid systems present a promising platform for the development of next generation devices in quantum information processing and quantum sensing technologies. In this study, we investigate the control of photon magnon coupling (PMC) strength through systematic variation of the saturation magnetization in a planar hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) integrated with a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film configuration. Using full wave numerical simulations in CST Microwave Studio, we demonstrate that tuning the Ms of the YIG film from 1750 Oe to 900 Oe enables systematic control over the coupling strength across the 127 to 51 MHz range at room temperature. To explain the observed PMC dynamics, we develop a semiclassical analytical model based on electromagnetic theory that accurately reproduces the observed coupling behavior, revealing the key role of spin density in mediating the light matter interaction. The model is further extended to include the effects of variable magnon damping across different Ms values, enabling broader frequency control. These findings establish Ms as a key tuning parameter for tailoring PMC, with direct implications for the design of tunable hybrid systems for reconfigurable quantum devices.

Title: Quantum Entanglement is Quantum: ZZ Production at the LHC
Authors: Dorival Gon√ßalves, Ajay Kaladharan, Frank Krauss, Alberto Navarro
Abstract: Polarization and spin correlations in diboson systems serve as powerful tools for precision tests and searches for new physics. Recently, interpreting these observables through the lens of quantum information, for instance by examining whether the diboson systems exhibit entanglement, has introduced a compelling new dimension to these studies. We analyze the angular coefficients in the processes $pp\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ and $h\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$, incorporating higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections. Guided by the fundamental properties of the spin density matrix, we assess the stability of the two-qutrit interpretation under radiative effects. For the $pp \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ process, NLO QCD corrections preserve the two-qutrit structure but weaken entanglement indicators, an effect that can be partially mitigated by jet binning. In contrast, electroweak corrections introduce non-factorizable contributions that modify the quantum properties of the system. While these effects can be largely depleted by selecting events with a double-resonant $ZZ$ structure, such a kinematic handle is not available for Higgs decays. In the $h \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ channel, singly-resonant NLO electroweak corrections substantially distort the angular coefficients, challenging the description of these events as a two-qutrit system.

Title: Speeding up quantum Markov processes through lifting
Authors: Bowen Li, Jianfeng Lu
Abstract: We generalize the concept of non-reversible lifts for reversible diffusion processes initiated by Eberle and Lorler (2024) to quantum Markov dynamics. The lifting operation, which naturally results in hypocoercive processes, can be formally interpreted as, though not restricted to, the reverse of the overdamped limit. We prove that the $L^2$ convergence rate of the lifted process is bounded above by the square root of the spectral gap of its overdamped dynamics, indicating that the lifting approach can at most achieve a transition from diffusive to ballistic mixing speeds. Further, using the variational hypocoercivity framework based on space-time Poincare inequalities, we derive a lower bound for the convergence rate of the lifted dynamics. These findings not only offer quantitative convergence guarantees for hypocoercive quantum Markov processes but also characterize the potential and limitations of accelerating the convergence through lifting. In addition, we develop an abstract lifting framework in the Hilbert space setting applicable to any symmetric contraction $C_0$-semigroup, thereby unifying the treatment of classical and quantum dynamics. As applications, we construct optimal lifts for various detailed balanced classical and quantum processes, including the symmetric random walk on a chain, the depolarizing semigroup, Schur multipliers, and quantum Markov semigroups on group von Neumann algebras.

Title: Finite-time stabilization of ladder multi-level quantum systems
Authors: Zeping Su, Sen Kuang, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: In this paper, a novel continuous non-smooth control strategy is proposed to achieve finite-time stabilization of ladder quantum systems. We first design a universal fractional-order control law for a ladder n-level quantum system using a distance-based Lyapunov function, and then apply the Filippov solution in the sense of differential inclusions and the LaSalle's invariance principle to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the ladder system under the continuous non-smooth control law. Both asymptotic stability and finite-time stability for the ladder system is rigorously established by applying Lyapunov stability theory and finite-time stability criteria. We also derive an upper bound of the time required for convergence to an eigenstate of the intrinsic Hamiltonian. Numerical simulations on a rubidium ladder three-level atomic system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Spin manipulation and nuclear polarization enhancement in particle beams with static magnetic fields
Authors: Chrysovalantis S. Kannis, Ralf Engels, Tarek El-Kordy, Nicolas Faatz, Simon J. P√ºtz, Vincent Verhoeven, T. Peter Rakitzis, Markus B√ºscher
Abstract: A theoretical study of spin dynamics in non-relativistic particle beams with interacting angular momenta traversing static, spatially varying magnetic fields is presented. The computational framework evaluates sinusoidal magnetic field configurations, calculating key observables such as average spin projections and state populations during the interaction. It is demonstrated that such fields can effectively enhance nuclear polarization in partially, incoherently polarized hydrogen and deuterium atomic beams, as well as coherently rotationally state-selected hydrogen deuteride molecular beams. This enhancement is attributed to transitions induced within the hyperfine regime of these systems. The study spans frequency ranges from GHz scales for atoms to hundreds of kHz for molecules, corresponding to magnetic field variations on spatial scales from submillimeters to meters.

Title: Probing new physics in the top sector using quantum information
Authors: Rafael Aoude, Hannah Banks, Chris D. White, Martin J. White
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that quantitative concepts from quantum information theory can play a role in analysing collider physics, including elucidating new physics. In this paper, we study various QI measures including magic, trace distance and fidelity distance, in generic new physics scenarios modelled by the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. We argue that such measures can indeed show up differences with respect to the pure Standard Model, and we compare our results with similar findings for the concurrence discussed previously in the literature. We examine the relative sensitivity of different measures to new physics in two-dimensional bins of the top pair invariant mass and scattering angle, finding that the concurrence, magic and trace distance each emerge as the best measure in at least some regions of the phase space. This highlights the importance of exploring multiple quantum information measures in the hunt for beyond the Standard Model physics.

Title: Driven Critical Dynamics in Tricitical Point
Authors: Ting-Long Wang, Yi-Fan Jiang, Shuai Yin
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism, describing driven dynamics across critical points based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario (AIS), have attracted broad attentions. However, the driven dynamics in tricritical point with two independent relevant directions has not been adequately studied. Here, we employ time dependent variational principle to study the driven critical dynamics at a one-dimensional supersymmetric Ising tricritical point. For the relevant direction along the Ising critical line, the AIS apparently breaks down. Nevertheless, we find that the critical dynamics can still be described by the KZ scaling in which the driving rate has the dimension of $r=z+1/\nu_\mu$ with $z$ and $\nu_\mu$ being the dynamic exponent and correlation length exponent in this direction, respectively. For driven dynamics along other direction, the driving rate has the dimension $r=z+1/\nu_p$ with $\nu_p$ being the other correlation length exponent. Our work brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics near the tricritical point, which could be realized in programmable quantum processors in Rydberg atomic systems.

Title: Temporal SU(1,1) Interferometer with Broadband Squeezed Light Injection
Authors: Zepeng Liu, Tianyu Liu, Hongmei Ma, Chun-Hua Yuan
Abstract: Temporal optics has attracted much attention due to its ability for lossless stretching of ultrafast temporal pulses. At the same time, spatial SU(1,1) interferometers have been widely used because of their high sensitivity to phase changes. On this basis, we studied a temporal SU(1,1) interferometer based on a temporal Fourier transform system and injected broadband squeezing light into the interferometer for research. The results show that the output spectral characteristics of the interferometer depend on the ratio of the focal group velocity dispersion (GDD) of the two temporal lenses (this ratio is defined as the magnification factor) and the phase derivative of the applied phase. The magnification factor significantly affects the bandwidth and squeeze degree at the center frequency of the output spectrum. The phase derivative induces a nonlinear frequency shift effect, resulting in a controllable shift in the center frequency of the output squeezed state spectrum, and the shift is linearly related to the phase derivative. This novel temporal SU(1,1) interferometer architecture opens up new avenues for the control of nonclassical fields in the time-frequency domain and quantum information processing applications.

Title: Tricritical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Ladders
Authors: Hanteng Wang, Xingyu Li, Chengshu Li
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism is being actively explored on quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we study the KZ scaling around tricritical phase transition points, with Rydberg atom ladders as a concrete incarnation. The criticality is of Ising and Potts type for two- and three-leg ladders, respectively. When slowly ramping across or near the tricritical point from the disordered phase to the ordered phase, we obtain universal power-law scaling in agreement with conventional KZ predictions. We study a "tangential" KZ ramping that both begins and ends in the disordered phase, a novel protocol enabled by the two-dimensional phase diagram. The tangential KZ directly reveals subleading critical exponents of the critical point. Finally, we explore the regime of intermediate-speed ramping and find a dynamical analog of the celebrated Zamolodchikov's c-theorem. Practically, our work provides an immediately relevant protocol for current experiments to pinpoint the elusive tricritical points. More broadly, tangential and intermediate-speed rampings go beyond the conventional KZ paradigm and introduce new insights into critical quantum dynamics.

Title: Stark Energy Shifts due to Quantum Gravity in RGUP Algebra
Authors: Gaurav Bhandari, S. D. Pathak
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Stark effect in the hydrogen atom under an external electric field, incorporating relativistic generalized uncertainty principle (RGUP) corrections within Minkowskian spacetime and calculate the upper bound on $\beta$ the RGUP parameter. Employing RGUP algebra and the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation, we derive modifications to the energy spectrum for degenerate and non-degenerate states. The perturbed Hamiltonian, modified by RGUP, enfold quantum gravitational effects. Our results reveal quantum gravitational corrections to the Stark energy spectrum in the relativistic regime, with energy shifts for non-degenerate ($n=1$) and degenerate ($n \neq 1$) cases showing additional terms proportional to $\beta$. These findings reduce to standard Stark effect results and non-relativistic GUP frameworks in the limits $\beta\rightarrow 0$ and $c \rightarrow \infty $, establishing our model as a generalized framework for analyzing minimal length effects in relativistic quantum systems.

Title: Characterizing asymmetric and bimodal long-term financial return distributions through quantum walks
Authors: Stijn De Backer, Luis E. C. Rocha, Jan Ryckebusch, Koen Schoors
Abstract: The analysis of logarithmic return distributions defined over large time scales is crucial for understanding the long-term dynamics of asset price movements. For large time scales of the order of two trading years, the anticipated Gaussian behavior of the returns often does not emerge, and their distributions often exhibit a high level of asymmetry and bimodality. These features are inadequately captured by the majority of classical models to address financial time series and return distributions. In the presented analysis, we use a model based on the discrete-time quantum walk to characterize the observed asymmetry and bimodality. The quantum walk distinguishes itself from a classical diffusion process by the occurrence of interference effects, which allows for the generation of bimodal and asymmetric probability distributions. By capturing the broader trends and patterns that emerge over extended periods, this analysis complements traditional short-term models and offers opportunities to more accurately describe the probabilistic structure underlying long-term financial decisions.

Title: A Physics-Inspired Optimizer: Velocity Regularized Adam
Authors: Pranav Vaidhyanathan, Lucas Schorling, Natalia Ares, Michael A. Osborne
Abstract: We introduce Velocity-Regularized Adam (VRAdam), a physics-inspired optimizer for training deep neural networks that draws on ideas from quartic terms for kinetic energy with its stabilizing effects on various system dynamics. Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.

Title: Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling
Authors: Gianmichele Blasi, Ricard Ravell Rodr√≠guez, Mykhailo Moskalets, Rosa L√≥pez, G√©raldine Haack
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the meaning of the concept of activity itself. Here, we introduce a generalized dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling and derive a steady-state quantum KUR (QKUR) expressed in terms of this generalized activity. Explicit expressions are obtained within Green's function and Landauer-B√ºttiker formalisms. This QKUR ensures that uncertainty relations are valid across all coupling strengths, offering a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.

Title: Quantum confinement and carbon nanodots: A conceptual view for the origin of diffuse interstellar bands
Authors: A.P. Jones
Abstract: The nature of the Diffuse Interstellar Band (DIB) carriers is perhaps the most studied, longest standing, unresolved problem in astronomy. While four bands have been associated with the fullerene cation (C^+_60) the vast majority (> 550) remain unidentified. This works is an attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the typical energy transitions that are central to explaining the origin of DIBs, however, it does not make an association between these transitions and any particular DIBs. The effect of quantum confinement on excitons is used, including charge transfer excitons, to construct a generic basis for the electronic transitions that could, in principle, be coherent with the energies associated with DIBs. In this model the carriers are carbon nanodots (CNDs) modelled as nanodiamonds and a-C(:H) nanoparticles. These preliminary results seem to show that particle size dependent effects in nanodiamond and a-C(:H) CNDs could be consistent with the positions of, and intervals between, some of the DIBs. One particular strength of the model is that predicts single bands from the majority of single-size particles and, at most, two bands from some of these same carriers. In the latter case the two bands come from different transitions and may or may not inter-correlate, depending upon the local environment. This generic framework indicates that the size dependent fundamental transitions in CNDs could provide a viable scenario for the origin of some DIB-type bands. While this work does not identify a single DIB, it furnishes a conceptual view for the DIB origin, and suggests that a more refined exploration of quantum confinement size effects, and exciton physics within the astronomical domain might prove fruitful. This work also hints at the requirement for stable configurations for particular size domains in order to explain DIB wavelength stability.

Title: Level Generation with Quantum Reservoir Computing
Authors: Jo√£o S. Ferreira, Pierre Fromholz, Hari Shaji, James R. Wootton
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning particularly suited for time series analysis, including forecasting predictions. We take an implementation of \emph{quantum} reservoir computing that was initially designed to generate variants of musical scores and adapt it to create levels of Super Mario Bros. Motivated by our analysis of these levels, we develop a new Roblox \textit{obby} where the courses can be generated in real time on superconducting qubit hardware, and investigate some of the constraints placed by such real-time generation.

Title: Calibration-free single-frame super-resolution fluorescence microscopy
Authors: Ane≈æka Dost√°lov√°, Dominik Va≈°inka, Robert St√°rek, Miroslav Je≈æek
Abstract: Molecular fluorescence microscopy is a leading approach to super-resolution and nanoscale imaging in life and material sciences. However, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is often bottlenecked by system-specific calibrations and long acquisitions of sparsely blinking molecules. We present a deep-learning approach that reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single diffraction-limited camera frame. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic data encompassing a wide range of optical and sample parameters, enabling robust generalization across microscopes and experimental conditions. Applied to dense terrylene samples with 150 ms acquisition time, our method significantly reduces reconstruction error compared to Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and ThunderSTORM multi-emitter fitting. The results confirm the ability to resolve emitters separated by 35 nm at 580 nm wavelength, corresponding to sevenfold resolution improvement beyond the Rayleigh criterion. By delivering unprecedented details from a single short camera exposure without prior information and calibration, our approach enables plug-and-play super-resolution imaging of fast, dense, or light-sensitive samples on standard wide-field setups.

Title: Reflection phase shifts of bouncing Bogoliubov waves
Authors: Carsten Henkel
Abstract: The Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are solved for an inhomogeneous condensate in the vicinity of a turning point, addressing the full continuous spectrum. A basis change in the space of the two Bogoliubov "particle" and "hole" amplitudes is introduced that decouples them approximately. We find a spatially extended mode that governs mainly excitations in the condensate phase, while another mode is localised to regions with density gradients. An analytical and numerical discussion of the phase shift is provided that incident matter waves suffer upon reflection at the turning point, forming standing waves. As an application, we compute eigenfrequencies in a gravitational trap, without recourse to the local density approximation. The non-condensate density at finite temperature and its quantum depletion are discussed in a companion paper.

Title: Multireference Embedding and Fragmentation Methods for Classical and Quantum Computers: from Model Systems to Realistic Applications
Authors: Shreya Verma, Abhishek Mitra, Qiaohong Wang, Ruhee D'Cunha, Bhavnesh Jangid, Matthew R. Hennefarth, Valay Agarawal, Leon Otis, Soumi Haldar, Matthew R. Hermes, Laura Gagliardi
Abstract: One of the primary challenges in quantum chemistry is the accurate modeling of strong electron correlation. While multireference methods effectively capture such correlation, their steep scaling with system size prohibits their application to large molecules and extended materials. Quantum embedding offers a promising solution by partitioning complex systems into manageable subsystems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in multireference density matrix embedding and localized active space self-consistent field approaches for complex molecules and extended materials. We discuss both classical implementations and the emerging potential of these methods on quantum computers. By extending classical embedding concepts to the quantum landscape, these algorithms have the potential to expand the reach of multireference methods in quantum chemistry and materials.

Title: Time-dependent conformal transformations and the propagator for quadratic systems
Authors: Q.-L. Zhao, P.-M. Zhang, P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: The method proposed by Inomata and his collaborators allows us to transform a damped Caldiroli-Kanai oscillator with time-dependent frequency to one with constant frequency and no friction by redefining the time variable, obtained by solving a Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation. Their mapping ``Eisenhart-Duval'' lifts as a conformal transformation between two appropriate Bargmann spaces. The quantum propagator is calculated also by bringing the quadratic system to free form by another time-dependent Bargmann-conformal transformation which generalizes the one introduced before by Niederer and is related to the mapping proposed by Arnold. Our approach allows us to extend the Maslov phase correction to arbitrary time-dependent frequency. The method is illustrated by the Mathieu profile.

Title: Accelerating Simulation of Quantum Circuits under Noise via Computational Reuse
Authors: Meng Wang, Swamit Tannu, Prashant J. Nair
Abstract: To realize the full potential of quantum computers, we must mitigate qubit errors by developing noise-aware algorithms, compilers, and architectures. Thus, simulating quantum programs on high-performance computing (HPC) systems with different noise models is a de facto tool researchers use. Unfortunately, noisy simulators iteratively execute a similar circuit for thousands of trials, thereby incurring significant performance overheads. To address this, we propose a noisy simulation technique called Tree-Based Quantum Circuit Simulation (TQSim). TQSim exploits the reusability of intermediate results during the noisy simulation, reducing computation. TQSim dynamically partitions a circuit into several subcircuits. It then reuses the intermediate results from these subcircuits during computation. Compared to a noisy Qulacs-based baseline simulator, TQSim achieves a speedup of up to 3.89x for noisy simulations. TQSim is designed to be efficient with multi-node setups while also maintaining tight fidelity bounds.

Title: An additive refinement of quantum channel capacities
Authors: D.-S. Wang
Abstract: Capacities of quantum channels are fundamental quantities in the theory of quantum information. A desirable property is the additivity for a capacity. However, this cannot be achieved for a few quantities that have been established as capacity measures. Asymptotic regularization is generically necessary making the study of capacities notoriously hard. In this work, by a proper refinement of the physical settings of quantum communication, we prove additive quantities for quantum channel capacities that can be employed for quantum Shannon theorems. This refinement, only a tiny step away from the standard settings, is consistent with the principle of quantum theory, and it further demonstrates von Neumann entropy as the cornerstone of quantum information.

Title: Superoscillating Quantum Control Induced By Sequential Selections
Authors: Yongcheng Ding, Yiming Pan, Xi Chen
Abstract: Superoscillation is a counterintuitive phenomenon for its mathematical feature of ``faster-than-Fourier", which has allowed novel optical imaging beyond the diffraction limit. In this article, we introduce a superoscillating quantum control protocol realized by sequential selections within the framework of weak measurement, which steers the apparatus (target) by repeatedly applying optimal pre- and post-selections to the system (controller). Our protocol accelerates theadiabatic transport of trapped ions and adiabatic quantum search algorithm at a finite energy cost. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the protocol in the presence of decoherence and fluctuating noise, and elucidate the trade-off between fidelity and rounds of selections. Our findings open new avenues for quantum state manipulation and wave-packet control using superoscillation across a range of quantum platforms.

Title: Ehrenfest's theorem beyond the Ehrenfest time
Authors: Felipe Hern√°ndez, Daniel Ranard, C. Jess Riedel
Abstract: In closed quantum systems, wavepackets can spread exponentially in time due to chaos, forming long-range superpositions in just seconds for ordinary macroscopic systems. A weakly coupled environment is conjectured to decohere the system and restore the quantum-classical correspondence while necessarily introducing diffusive noise -- but at what coupling strength, and under which conditions? For Markovian open systems with Hamiltonians of the form $H = p^2/2m+V(x)$ and Hermitian linear Lindblad operators, we prove the quantum and classical evolutions are close whenever the strength of the environment-induced diffusion satisfies $D \gg (\hbar/s_H)^{4/3} D_H$, where $s_H$ and $D_H$ are characteristic action and diffusion scales that we define precisely using the classical Hamiltonian $H$. The bound applies for all observables and for times exponentially longer than the Ehrenfest timescale, which is when the correspondence can break down in closed systems. The strength of the diffusive noise can vanish in the classical limit to give the appearance of reversible dynamics. The $4/3$ exponent may be optimal, suggested by heuristic arguments and prior numerical evidence. Based on our bound, we give an efficient classical algorithm for simulating quantum Lindblad dynamics, which becomes provably accurate when the strength of environmental coupling exceeds the above threshold.

Title: Spectral Properties of Two Superconducting Artificial Atoms Coupled to a Resonator in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime
Authors: Akiyoshi Tomonaga, Roberto Stassi, Hiroto Mukai, Franco Nori, Fumiki Yoshihara, Jaw-Shen Tsai
Abstract: We experimentally investigate a superconducting circuit composed of two flux qubits ultrastrongly coupled to a common LC resonator. Owing to the large anharmonicity of the flux qubits, the system can be described well by a generalized Dicke Hamiltonian containing spin spin interaction terms. In the experimentally measured spectrum, we observed two key phenomena. First, an avoided level crossing provides evidence of the exotic interaction that allows the simultaneous excitation of two artificial atoms by absorbing one photon from the resonator. Second, we identified a pronounced spectral asymmetry that is a clear signature of light matter decoupling. This multi atom ultrastrongly coupled system opens the door to studying novel processes for quantum optics and quantum-information tasks on a chip.

Title: Generalized $Œ±$-Observational Entropy
Authors: Shivam Sinha, Nripendra Majumbdar, S. Aravinda
Abstract: Traditional measures of entropy, like the Von Neumann entropy, while fundamental in quantum information theory, are insufficient when interpreted as thermodynamic entropy due to their invariance under unitary transformations, which contradicts observed entropy increases in isolated systems. Recognizing this limitations of existing measures for thermodynamic entropy, recent research has focused on observational entropy (OE) as a promising alternative, offering practical applicability and theoretical insights. In this work, we extend the scope of observational entropy by generalizing it to a parameterized version called $\alpha$-Observational entropy ($\alpha$-OE). $\alpha$-OE is expressed in terms of the Petz-R√©nyi relative entropy between the states on which a quantum-to-classical channel is applied. The $\alpha$-OE reduces to OE under $\alpha\rightarrow 1$. We prove various properties of the $\alpha$-OE, which are the generalization of the properties of OE, including the monotonically increasing of $\alpha$-OE as a function of refinement of coarse-graining. We further explore the role of $\alpha$-OE in thermodynamic contexts, particularly for the entropy production in open and closed quantum systems and its relation with the Helmholtz free energy.

Title: Universal adjointation of isometry operations using conversion of quantum supermaps
Authors: Satoshi Yoshida, Akihito Soeda, Mio Murao
Abstract: Identification of possible transformations of quantum objects including quantum states and quantum operations is indispensable in developing quantum algorithms. Universal transformations, defined as input-independent transformations, appear in various quantum applications. Such is the case for universal transformations of unitary operations. However, extending these transformations to non-unitary operations is nontrivial and largely unresolved. Addressing this, we introduce isometry adjointation protocols that transform an input isometry operation into its adjoint operation, which include both unitary operation and quantum state transformations. The paper details the construction of parallel and sequential isometry adjointation protocols, derived from unitary inversion protocols using quantum combs and the (dual) Clebsch-Gordan transforms, and achieving optimal approximation error. This error is shown to be independent of the output dimension of the isometry operation. In particular, we explicitly obtain an asymptotically optimal parallel protocol achieving an approximation error $\epsilon = \Theta(d^2/n)$, where $d$ is the input dimension of the isometry operation and $n$ is the number of calls of the isometry operation. The research also extends to isometry inversion and universal error detection, employing semidefinite programming to assess optimal performances. The findings suggest that the optimal performance of general protocols in isometry adjointation and universal error detection is not dependent on the output dimension, and that indefinite causal order protocols offer advantages over sequential ones in isometry inversion and universal error detection.

Title: Test of the physical significance of Bell nonlocality
Authors: Carlos Vieira, Ravishankar Ramanathan, Ad√°n Cabello
Abstract: Loophole-free violations of Bell inequalities imply that at least one of the assumptions behind local hidden-variable theories must fail. Here, we show that, if only one fails, then it has to fail completely, therefore excluding models that partially constrain freedom of choice or allow for partial retrocausal influences, or allow partial instantaneous actions at a distance. Specifically, we show that (i) any hidden-variable theory with outcome independence (OI) and arbitrary joint relaxation of measurement independence (MI) and parameter independence (PI) can be experimentally excluded in a Bell-like experiment with many settings on high-dimensional entangled states, and (ii) any hidden-variable theory with MI, PI and arbitrary relaxation of OI can be excluded in a Bell-like experiment with many settings on qubit-qubit entangled states.

Title: Quantum neural network with ensemble learning to mitigate barren plateaus and cost function concentration
Authors: Lucas Friedrich, Jonas Maziero
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum computers promises transformative impacts across diverse fields of science and technology. Quantum neural networks (QNNs), as a forefront application, hold substantial potential. Despite the multitude of proposed models in the literature, persistent challenges, notably the vanishing gradient (VG) and cost function concentration (CFC) problems, impede their widespread success. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to quantum neural network construction, specifically addressing the issues of VG and CFC. Our methodology employs ensemble learning, advocating for the simultaneous deployment of multiple quantum circuits with a depth equal to \(1\), a departure from the conventional use of a single quantum circuit with depth \(L\). We assess the efficacy of our proposed model through a comparative analysis with a conventionally constructed QNN. The evaluation unfolds in the context of a classification problem, yielding valuable insights into the potential advantages of our innovative approach.

Title: Modeling error correction with Lindblad dynamics and approximate channels
Authors: Zohar Schwartzman-Nowik, Liran Shirizly, Haggai Landa
Abstract: We analyze the performance of a quantum error correction code subject to physically motivated noise modeled by a Lindblad master equation. We consider dissipative and coherent single-qubit terms and two-qubit crosstalk, studying how different approximations of the noise capture the success rate of a code. Focusing on the five-qubit code and adapting it to partially correct two-qubit errors in relevant parameter regimes according to the noise model, we find that a composite-channel approximation where every noise term is considered separately captures the behavior in many physical cases up to long timescales, eventually failing due to the effect of noncommuting terms. In contrast, we find that single-qubit approximations do not properly capture the error correction dynamics with two-qubit noise, even for short times. A Pauli approximation going beyond a single-qubit channel is sensitive to the details of the noise, state, and decoder, and succeeds at short timescales relative to the noise strength, beyond which it fails. Furthermore, we point out a mechanism for a Pauli model failure where it underestimates the failure rate of a code even with frequent syndrome projection and correction cycles. These results shed light on the performance of error correction in the presence of realistic noise and can advance the ongoing efforts towards useful quantum error correction.

Title: Transfer and routing of Gaussian states through quantum complex networks with and without community structure
Authors: Markku Hahto, Johannes Nokkala, Guillermo Garc√≠a-P√©rez, Sabrina Maniscalco, Jyrki Piilo
Abstract: The goal in quantum state transfer is to avoid the need to physically transport carriers of quantum information. This is achieved by using a suitably engineered Hamiltonian that induces the transfer of the state of one subsystem to another. A less known generalization of state transfer considers multiple systems such that any pair can exchange quantum information and transfers can take place at any time, starting and stopping independently. This is sometimes called routing of quantum states. State transfer in particular has received a great deal of attention, however the vast majority of results in both state transfer and routing concern qubits transferred in a network of restricted structure. Here we consider routing of single-mode Gaussian states and entanglement through complex networks of quantum harmonic oscillators. We compare a protocol where the transfer is completed in a single step but the effective Hamiltonian only approximately transfers the state with one where the transfer can in principle be perfect but the transfer is done in two steps, and also illustrate the state-dependency of the transfer fidelity. We find that even in a random and homogeneous network, the transfer fidelity still depends on the degree of the nodes for any link density, and that in both random and complex networks it is the community structure that controls the appearance of higher frequency normal modes useful for transfer. Finally, we find that networks of sufficient complexity may have superior routing performance over superficially similar random networks. Our results pave the way for further exploration of the role of community structure in state transfer and related tasks.

Title: Projective squeezing for translation symmetric bosonic codes
Authors: Suguru Endo, Keitaro Anai, Yuichiro Matsuzaki, Yuuki Tokunaga, Yasunari Suzuki
Abstract: The design of translation symmetric bosonic codes, e.g., Gottesmann-Kitaev-Preskill and squeezed cat codes, is robust against photon loss, but the computation accuracy is limited by the available squeezing level. Here, we introduce the \textit{projective squeezing} (PS) method for computing outcomes for a higher squeezing level by revealing that a linear combination of displacement operators with periodic displacement values constitutes the smeared projector onto the better code space; we also show the analytical relationship between the increased squeezing level and the projection probability. We introduce concrete implementation methods for PS based on linear-combination-of-unitaries and virtual quantum error detection. We also numerically verify our analytical arguments and show that our protocol can mitigate the effect of photon loss.

Title: An entanglement-enhanced atomic gravimeter
Authors: Christophe Cassens, Bernd Meyer-Hoppe, Ernst Rasel, Carsten Klempt
Abstract: Interferometers based on ultra-cold atoms enable an absolute measurement of inertial forces with unprecedented precision. However, their resolution is fundamentally restricted by quantum fluctuations. Improved resolutions with entangled or squeezed atoms were demonstrated in internal-state measurements for thermal and quantum-degenerate atoms and, recently, for momentum-state interferometers with laser-cooled atoms. Here, we present a gravimeter based on Bose-Einstein condensates with a sensitivity of $-1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$dB beyond the standard quantum limit. Interferometry with Bose-Einstein condensates combined with delta-kick collimation minimizes atom loss in and improves scalability of the interferometer to very-long baseline atom interferometers.

Title: Quantum Algorithms for Inverse Participation Ratio Estimation in multi-qubit and multi-qudit systems
Authors: Yingjian Liu, Piotr Sierant, Paolo Stornati, Maciej Lewenstein, Marcin P≈Çodzie≈Ñ
Abstract: Inverse Participation Ratios (IPRs) and the related Participation Entropies quantify the spread of a quantum state over a selected basis of the Hilbert space, offering insights into the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of the system. In this work, we propose three quantum algorithms to estimate IPRs on multi-qubit and multi-qudit quantum devices. The first algorithm allows for the estimation of IPRs in the computational basis by single-qubit measurements, while the second one enables measurement of IPR in the eigenbasis of a selected Hamiltonian, without the knowledge about the eigenstates of the system. Next, we provide an algorithm for IPR in the computational basis for a multi-qudit system. We discuss resources required by the algorithms and benchmark them by investigating the one-axis twisting protocol, the thermalization in a deformed PXP model, and the ground state of a spin-$1$ AKLT chain in a transverse field.

Title: Quantum Resource Theories beyond Convexity
Authors: Roberto Salazar, Jakub Czartowski, Ricard Ravell Rodr√≠guez, Grzegorz Rajchel-Mieldzioƒá, Pawe≈Ç Horodecki, Karol ≈ªyczkowski
Abstract: A class of quantum resource theories, based on non-convex star-shape sets, presented in this work captures the key quantum properties that cannot be studied by standard convex theories. We provide operational interpretations for a resource of this class and demonstrate its advantage to improve performance of correlated quantum discrimination tasks and testing of quantum combs. Proposed techniques provide useful tools to describe quantum discord, total correlations in composite quantum systems and to estimate the degree of non-Markovianity of an analyzed quantum dynamics. Other applications include the problem of unistochasticity of a given bistochastic matrix, with relevance for quantization of classical dynamics and studies of violation of CP-symmetry in high energy physics. In all these cases, the non-linear witnesses introduced here outperform the standard linear witnesses. Importance of our findings for quantum information theory is also emphasized.

Title: Quantum (Inspired) $D^2$-sampling with Applications
Authors: Poojan Shah, Ragesh Jaiswal
Abstract: $D^2$-sampling is a fundamental component of sampling-based clustering algorithms such as $k$-means++. Given a dataset $V \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $N$ points and a center set $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $D^2$-sampling refers to picking a point from $V$ where the sampling probability of a point is proportional to its squared distance from the nearest center in $C$. Starting with empty $C$ and iteratively $D^2$-sampling and updating $C$ in $k$ rounds is precisely $k$-means++ seeding that runs in $O(Nkd)$ time and gives $O(\log{k})$-approximation in expectation for the $k$-means problem. We give a quantum algorithm for (approximate) $D^2$-sampling in the QRAM model that results in a quantum implementation of $k$-means++ that runs in time $\tilde{O}(\zeta^2 k^2)$. Here $\zeta$ is the aspect ratio (i.e., largest to smallest interpoint distance), and $\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $N, d, k$. It can be shown through a robust approximation analysis of $k$-means++ that the quantum version preserves its $O(\log{k})$ approximation guarantee. Further, we show that our quantum algorithm for $D^2$-sampling can be 'dequantized' using the sample-query access model of Tang (PhD Thesis, Ewin Tang, University of Washington, 2023). This results in a fast quantum-inspired classical implementation of $k$-means++, which we call QI-$k$-means++, with a running time $O(Nd) + \tilde{O}(\zeta^2k^2d)$, where the $O(Nd)$ term is for setting up the sample-query access data structure. Experimental investigations show promising results for QI-$k$-means++ on large datasets with bounded aspect ratio. Finally, we use our quantum $D^2$-sampling with the known $ D^2$-sampling-based classical approximation scheme (i.e., $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for any given $\varepsilon>0$) to obtain the first quantum approximation scheme for the $k$-means problem with polylogarithmic running time dependence on $N$.

Title: Dictionary-based sparse block encoding with low subnormalization and circuit depth
Authors: Chunlin Yang, Zexian Li, Hongmei Yao, Zhaobing Fan, Guofeng Zhang, Jianshe Liu
Abstract: We propose a novel protocol for the sparse block encoding. When our sparse block encoding protocol is compiled into the $\{\rm U(2), CNOT\}$ gate set, we show that it queries a $2^n\times2^n$-dimensional sparse matrix with $s$ non-zero elements in a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(ns))$ with $\mathcal{O}(n^2s)$ ancillary qubits. This represents an exponential improvement over existing methods. Furthermore, our protocol achieves a subnormalization of $\sum_{l=0}^{s_0}\vert A_l\vert$, where the proposed dictionary structure contains $s_0$ data items ($s_0\leq s$) and $A_l$ denotes the value of the $l$-th data item. The dictionary data structure establishes a unified framework for various sparse block-encoding protocols, with implementations connected to linear combinations of unitaries (LCU) and sparse access intermediate model (SAIM). To demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, we provide several applications including the Laplacian matrices in graph problems and discrete differential operators.

Title: Parallel transport in rotating frames and projective holonomic quantum computation
Authors: Ole S√∂nnerborn
Abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation is a promising approach for implementing quantum gates that offers both efficiency and robustness against certain types of errors. A key element of this approach is a geometric constraint known as the parallel transport condition. According to the principle of covariance, this condition must be appropriately modified when changing reference frames. In this paper, we detail how to adjust the parallel transport condition when transitioning from the laboratory frame to a rotating reference frame. Furthermore, building on gauge invariance considerations, we develop a framework for nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation with projective gates. The parallel transport condition of this framework effectively addresses the problem of global dynamical phases inherent in conventional nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation. We extend the isoholonomic inequality, which provides a fundamental bound on the efficiency of protocols used to implement holonomic quantum gates, to encompass projective quantum gates. We also determine a minimum execution time for projective holonomic quantum gates and show that this time can be attained when the codimension of the computational space is sufficiently large.

Title: Imaging-based Quantum Optomechanics
Authors: Christian M. Pluchar, Wenhua He, Jack Manley, Nicolas Deshler, Saikat Guha, Dalziel J. Wilson
Abstract: In active imaging protocols, information about a landscape is encoded into the spatial mode of a scattered photon. A common assumption is that the landscape is rigid; however, in principle it can be altered by radiation pressure, a concept that has found fruitful application in the field of quantum optomechanics. Here we explore active imaging of a mechanical resonator with an eye to generalizing the concept of radiation pressure backaction to spatially multimode light. As a thought experiment, we consider imaging the flexural modes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its surface. We show that backaction in this setting arises from spatial photon shot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We also derive the imprecision-backaction product for coherent illumination in the limit of purely spatial backaction, revealing it to be equivalent to the standard quantum limit for purely dispersive, single-mode optomechanical coupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatial backaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light. In conjunction with high-$Q$ nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks enhanced by spatial mode entanglement.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of dynamical processes in molecules and reactions is among the most challenging problems in quantum chemistry. Quantum computers promise efficient chemical simulation, but the existing quantum algorithms require many logical qubits and gates, placing practical applications beyond existing technology. Here, we carry out the first quantum simulations of chemical dynamics by employing a more hardware-efficient encoding scheme that uses both qubits and bosonic degrees of freedom. Our trapped-ion device accurately simulates the dynamics of non-adiabatic chemical processes, which are among the most difficult problems in computational chemistry because they involve strong coupling between electronic and nuclear motions. We demonstrate the programmability and versatility of our approach by simulating the dynamics of three different molecules as well as open-system dynamics in the condensed phase, all with the same quantum resources. Our approach requires orders of magnitude fewer resources than equivalent qubit-only quantum simulations, demonstrating the potential of using hybrid encoding schemes to accelerate quantum simulations of complex chemical processes, which could have applications in fields ranging from energy conversion and storage to biology and drug design.

Title: On-demand single-microwave-photon source in a superconducting circuit with wideband frequency tunability
Authors: Samarth Hawaldar, Siddhi Satish Khaire, Per Delsing, Baladitya Suri
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new method of generating single microwave photons in superconducting circuits. We theoretically show that pure single microwave photons can be generated on demand and tuned over a large frequency band by making use of Landau-Zener transitions under a rapid sweep of a control parameter. We devise a protocol that enables fast control of the frequency of the emitted photon over two octaves, without requiring extensive calibration. Additionally, we make theoretical estimates of the generation efficiency, tunability, purity, and linewidth of the photons emitted using this method for both charge and flux qubit-based architectures. We also provide estimates of optimal device parameters for these architectures in order to realize the device.

Title: Visibility Stokes parameters as a foundation for quantum information science with undetected photons
Authors: Jaroslav Kysela, Markus Gr√§fe, Jorge Fuenzalida
Abstract: The framework of measurement operators plays a fundamental role in extracting information about quantum systems. Recently, techniques based on induced coherence have been developed to access the same information for undetected photons. However, there has been a lack of consistent reformulation of quantum operators for these techniques. In this work, we introduce a set of parameters that quantify the polarization of undetected photons based on measured visibilities. Given their similarity to classical counterparts, we refer to them as visibility Stokes parameters. We apply these parameters and the corresponding quantum operators to the problem of quantum state tomography, thoroughly analyzing the environment of undetected photons and its role in the reconstruction process. Because these parameters provide a more intuitive and consistent understanding of the measurement process, we believe that some established quantum information protocols could be adapted for undetected photons.

Title: Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation
Authors: Martin Ritter, David M. Long, Qianao Yue, Anushya Chandran, Alicia J. Koll√°r
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.

Title: Diffraction of correlated biphotons through transparent samples
Authors: Nazanin Dehghan, Alessio D'Errico, Yingwen Zhang, Benjamin Sussman, Ebrahim Karimi
Abstract: Two-photon states generated through degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) can exhibit sharp correlations in the transverse spatial coordinates. This property leads to unique free-space propagation features. Here, we show that a phase object placed in the image plane of the source affects the free space propagation of the SPDC in a way that is mathematically analogous to the Fresnel diffraction of a first-order coherent source. This effect can be observed via the extraction of correlation images. We demonstrate this prediction with an experiment where the diffraction of correlated bi-photons is detected using an event-based camera. The results allow us to reconstruct the phase structure of the sample via non-interferometric phase retrieval methods. We verify that the retrieved phase patterns exhibit an enhanced contrast due to the probe two-photon nature. Our findings offer applications for non-interferometric, quantum-enhanced phase imaging.

Title: Reshaping quantum device noise via repetition code circuits
Authors: Yue Ma, Michael Hanks, Evdokia Gneusheva, M. S. Kim
Abstract: Noise of a quantum processor can be an important resource for simulating open quantum dynamics. However, this requires characterizing the device noise and then transforming it into a target structure. Here we take the first step towards this goal: We analytically and numerically study reshaping the noise associated with native trapped-ion two-qubit entangling gates via quantum circuits based on repetition codes, and experimentally demonstrate our findings on the IonQ Aria-1 quantum hardware. We investigate all the building blocks, including the quantum channels describing noisy two-qubit entangling gates, the compilation of the encoding circuits into native gates, and the propagation of two-qubit errors across ideal single-qubit gates.

Title: Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis
Authors: Roberto Ruiz, Alejandro Sopena, Esperanza L√≥pez, Germ√°n Sierra, Bal√°zs Pozsgay
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.

Abstract: Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons and Lee introduced the complexity class PDQP (which was original labeled naCQP), an alteration of BQP enhanced with the ability to obtain non-collapsing measurements, samples of quantum states without collapsing them. Although PDQP contains SZK, it still requires $\Omega(N^{1/4})$ queries to solve unstructured search. We formulate an alternative equivalent definition of PDQP, which we use to prove the positive weighted adversary lower-bounding method, establishing multiple tighter bounds and a trade-off between queries and non-collapsing measurements. We utilize the technique in order to analyze the query complexity of the well-studied majority and element distinctness problems. Additionally, we prove a tight $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ bound on search. Furthermore, we use the lower-bound to explore PDQP under query restrictions, finding that when combined with non-adaptive queries, we limit the speed-up in several cases.

Title: Optimized four-qubit quantum error correcting code for amplitude damping channel
Authors: Xuanhui Mao, Qian Xu, Liang Jiang
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for reliable quantum information processing. Targeting a particular error channel, both the encoding and the recovery channel can be optimized through a biconvex optimization to give a high-performance, noise-adapted QEC scheme. We solve the biconvex optimization by the technique of alternating semi-definite programming and identify a new four-qubit code for amplitude damping channel, one major noise in superconducting circuits and a good model for spontaneous emission and energy dissipation. We also construct analytical encoding and recovery channels that are close to the numerically optimized ones. We show that the new code notably outperforms the Leung-Nielsen-Chuang-Yamamoto four-qubit code in terms of the entanglement fidelity over an amplitude damping channel.

Title: Variational Quantum Subspace Construction via Symmetry-Preserving Cost Functions
Authors: Hamzat A. Akande, Alexandre Perrin, Bruno Senjean, Matthieu Saubanere
Abstract: Determining low-energy eigenstates in electronic many-body quantum systems is a key challenge in computational chemistry and condensed-matter physics. Hybrid quantum-classical approaches, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Subspace Methods, offer practical solutions but face limitations in circuit depth and measurement overhead. In this article, we propose a variational strategy based on symmetry-preserving cost functions to iteratively construct a reduced subspace for the extraction of low-lying energy states. We show that, under certain conditions, our approach leads to a tridiagonal representation similar to that obtained with the Lanczos algorithm. The iterative process allows control over the trade-off between circuit depth, the number of variational parameters, and the number of measurements required to achieve the desired accuracy, making it suitable for current quantum hardware. As a proof of concept, we test the proposed algorithms on H4 chain and ring, targeting both the ground-state energy and the charge gap.

Title: Sample Complexity of Black Box Work Extraction
Authors: Shantanav Chakraborty, Siddhartha Das, Arnab Ghorui, Soumyabrata Hazra, Uttam Singh
Abstract: Extracting work from a physical system is one of the cornerstones of quantum thermodynamics. The extractable work, as quantified by ergotropy, necessitates a complete description of the quantum system. This is significantly more challenging when the state of the underlying system is unknown, as quantum tomography is extremely inefficient. In this article, we analyze the number of samples of the unknown state required to extract work. With only a single copy of an unknown state, we prove that extracting any work is nearly impossible (in the appropriate asymptotic limit). In contrast, when multiple copies are available, we quantify the sample complexity required to estimate extractable work, establishing a scaling relationship that balances the desired accuracy with success probability. Our work develops a sample-efficient protocol to assess the utility of unknown states as quantum batteries and opens avenues for estimating thermodynamic quantities using near-term quantum computers.

Title: Isoholonomic inequality and tight implementations of holonomic quantum gates
Authors: Ole S√∂nnerborn
Abstract: In holonomic quantum computation, quantum logic gates are realized by cyclic parallel transport of the computational space. The resulting quantum gate corresponds to the holonomy associated with the closed path traced by the computational space. The isoholonomic inequality for gates establishes a fundamental lower bound on the path length of such cyclic transports, which depends only on the spectrum of the holonomy, that is, the eigenvalues of the implemented quantum gate. The isoholonomic inequality also gives rise to an estimate of the minimum time required to execute a holonomic quantum gate, underscoring the central role of the inequality in quantum computation. In this paper, we show that when the codimension of the computational space is sufficiently large, any quantum gate can be implemented using a parallel transporting Hamiltonian in a way that saturates the isoholonomic inequality and the corresponding time estimate. We call such implementations tight. The treatment presented here is constructive and lays the foundation for the development of efficient and optimal implementation strategies in holonomic quantum computation.

Title: The Jacobi Factoring Circuit: Quantum Factoring with Near-Linear Gates and Sublinear Space and Depth
Authors: Gregory D. Kahanamoku-Meyer, Seyoon Ragavan, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Katherine Van Kirk
Abstract: We present a compact quantum circuit for factoring a large class of integers, including some whose classical hardness is expected to be equivalent to RSA (but not including RSA integers themselves). Most notably, we factor $n$-bit integers of the form $P^2 Q$ with $\log Q = \Theta(n^a)$ for $a \in (2/3, 1)$ in space and depth sublinear in n (specifically, $\tilde{O}(\log Q)$) using $\tilde{O}(n)$ quantum gates; for these integers, no known classical algorithms exploit the relatively small size of $Q$ to run asymptotically faster than general-purpose factoring algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time circuit to achieve sublinear qubit count for a classically-hard factoring problem. We thus believe that factoring such numbers has potential to be the most concretely efficient classically-verifiable proof of quantumness currently known. Our circuit builds on the quantum algorithm for squarefree decomposition discovered by Li, Peng, Du, and Suter (Nature Scientific Reports 2012), which relies on computing the Jacobi symbol in quantum superposition. The technical core of our contribution is a new space-efficient quantum algorithm to compute the Jacobi symbol of $A$ mod $B$, in the regime where $B$ is classical and much larger than $A$. Our circuit for computing the Jacobi symbol generalizes to related problems such as computing the greatest common divisor and modular inverses, and thus could be of independent interest.

Title: Exploring dynamical quantum phase transition from pure states to mixed states through extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models
Authors: Kaiyuan Cao, Tianren Zhang, Xiangping Jiang, Jian Wang
Abstract: We investigate dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the extended SSH model framework, focusing on the SSH-3 and SSH-4 variants, which differ in symmetry properties. The SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states tied to its topological nature. Our results show that for pure states, DQPTs occur after quenches crossing the topological transition, even when the energy band gap remains open. For mixed states, DQPT behavior aligns with pure states at low temperatures but undergoes significant changes at higher temperatures, including the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, features four distinct energy spectrum configurations. We find that pure-state DQPTs arise only when the quench starts from a gapless initial state and crosses the critical topological point. At finite temperature, mixed-state DQPTs persist at low temperatures only if the corresponding pure-state quench induces DQPTs, but they disappear at elevated temperatures. These findings elucidate the interplay between symmetry, topology, and temperature in governing DQPTs within generalized SSH models.

Title: Evaluating many-body stabilizer R√©nyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic
Authors: Yi-Ming Ding, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R√©nyi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling \emph{reduced Pauli strings} within a \emph{reduced configuration space}, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. We first isolate the free energy part in $2$-SRE, which is a trivial term. Notably, at quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the \emph{characteristic function} contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, analyzing the volume-law correction to SRE reveals a discontinuity tied to criticalities, suggesting that it is more informative than the full-state magic. For conformal critical points, we claim it could reflect nonlocal magic residing in correlations. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.

Title: Sample Complexity Bounds for Scalar Parameter Estimation Under Quantum Differential Privacy
Authors: Farhad Farokhi
Abstract: This paper presents tight upper and lower bounds for minimum number of samples (copies of a quantum state) required to attain a prescribed accuracy (measured by error variance) for scalar parameters estimation using unbiased estimators under quantum local differential privacy for qubits. Particularly, the best-case (optimal) scenario is considered by minimizing the sample complexity over all differentially-private channels; the worst-case channels can be arbitrarily uninformative and render the problem ill-defined. In the small privacy budget $\epsilon$ regime, i.e., $\epsilon\ll 1$, the sample complexity scales as $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2})$. This bound matches that of classical parameter estimation under local differential privacy. The lower bound however loosens in the large privacy budget regime, i.e., $\epsilon\gg 1$. The upper bound for the minimum number of samples is generalized to qudits (with dimension $d$) resulting in sample complexity of $O(d\epsilon^{-2})$.

Title: A strong-driving toolkit for topological Floquet energy pumps with superconducting circuits
Authors: Martin Ritter, David M. Long, Qianao Yue, Maya Amouzegar, Anushya Chandran, Alicia J. Koll√°r
Abstract: Topological Floquet energy pumps -- which use periodic driving to create a topologically protected quantized energy current -- have been proposed and studied theoretically, but have never been observed directly. Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.

Title: Efficient preparation of entangled states in cavity QED with Grover's algorithm
Authors: Omar Nagib, M. Saffman, K. M√∏lmer
Abstract: We propose to employ the amplification mechanism of Grover's search algorithm to efficiently prepare entangled states of an ensemble of qubits. The conditional change of sign employed in the algorithm can be implemented by the phase shift of photons scattered on an optical cavity hosting an atomic ensemble. We show that collective Dicke states, GHZ states, and Schr√∂dinger cat superpositions of $N$ atoms may be prepared deterministically by few ($\sim N^{1/4}$) photon scattering events without individual addressing of the atoms.

Title: Deterministic carving of quantum states with Grover's algorithm
Authors: Omar Nagib, M. Saffman, K. M√∏lmer
Abstract: We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.

Title: Online Learning of Pure States is as Hard as Mixed States
Authors: Maxime Meyer, Soumik Adhikary, Naixu Guo, Patrick Rebentrost
Abstract: Quantum state tomography, the task of learning an unknown quantum state, is a fundamental problem in quantum information. In standard settings, the complexity of this problem depends significantly on the type of quantum state that one is trying to learn, with pure states being substantially easier to learn than general mixed states. A natural question is whether this separation holds for any quantum state learning setting. In this work, we consider the online learning framework and prove the surprising result that learning pure states in this setting is as hard as learning mixed states. More specifically, we show that both classes share almost the same sequential fat-shattering dimension, leading to identical regret scaling. We also generalize previous results on full quantum state tomography in the online setting to (i) the $\epsilon$-realizable setting and (ii) learning the density matrix only partially, using smoothed analysis.

Title: Simulating Work Extraction in a Dinuclear Quantum Battery Using a Variational Quantum Algorithm
Authors: Lucas Galv√£o, Ana Clara das Neves, Maron Anka, Clebson Cruz
Abstract: Understanding the thermodynamic properties of quantum systems is essential for developing energy-efficient quantum technologies. In this regard, this work explores the application of quantum computational methods to study the quantum properties and work extraction processes in a dinuclear quantum battery model. Our results demonstrate that variational quantum algorithms can reproduce key trends in experimental data, making it possible to analyze the effectiveness of the presented protocol in noisy environments and providing insights into the feasibility of quantum batteries in near-term devices. We have shown that the presence of a noisy environment hinders the accuracy of the evaluation of the amount of energy stored in the system. Additionally, we analyze the work extraction precision, revealing that although the system can store energy at room temperature, the protocol is highly precise only at low temperatures, and its accuracy at ambient conditions remains limited, compromising its usability.

Title: Eigenstate thermalization in spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems with SU(2) symmetry
Authors: Rohit Patil, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We study the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the eigenstates of the extended spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain, which exhibits the non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry. We explore integrable and nonintegrable regimes, and consider observables that preserve the SU(2) symmetry of the Hamiltonian as well as observables that break it. We study in detail the low-frequency behavior of the off-diagonal matrix elements at and away from integrability. In the nonintegrable regime, we test the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, paying special attention to the effect of the spin, which is the distinctive conserved quantity introduced by the SU(2) symmetry.

Title: Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction
Authors: Zijian Liang, Ke Liu, Hao Song, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr√∂bner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \leq 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360, 12, \leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

Title: Scalable quantum simulator with an extended gate set in giant atoms
Authors: Guangze Chen, Anton Frisk Kockum
Abstract: Quantum computation and quantum simulation require a versatile gate set to optimize circuit compilation for practical applications. However, existing platforms are often limited to specific gate types or rely on parametric couplers to extend their gate set, which compromises scalability. Here, we propose a scalable quantum simulator with an extended gate set based on giant-atom three-level systems, which can be implemented with superconducting circuits. Unlike conventional small atoms, giant atoms couple to the environment at multiple points, introducing interference effects that allow exceptional tunability of their interactions. By leveraging this tunability, our setup supports both CZ and iSWAP gates through simple frequency adjustments, eliminating the need for parametric couplers. This dual-gate capability enhances circuit efficiency, reducing the overhead for quantum simulation. As a demonstration, we showcase the simulation of spin dynamics in dissipative Heisenberg XXZ spin chains, highlighting the setup's ability to tackle complex open quantum many-body dynamics. Finally, we discuss how a two-dimensional extension of our system could enable fault-tolerant quantum computation, paving the way for a universal quantum processor.

Title: Blockchain with proof of quantum work
Authors: Mohammad H. Amin, Jack Raymond, Daniel Kinn, Firas Hamze, Kelsey Hamer, Joel Pasvolsky, William Bernoudy, Andrew D. King, Samuel Kortas
Abstract: We propose a blockchain architecture in which mining requires a quantum computer. The consensus mechanism is based on proof of quantum work, a quantum-enhanced alternative to traditional proof of work that leverages quantum supremacy to make mining intractable for classical computers. We have refined the blockchain framework to incorporate the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, ensuring stability against sampling errors and hardware inaccuracies. To validate our approach, we implemented a prototype blockchain on four D-Wave(TM) quantum annealing processors geographically distributed within North America, demonstrating stable operation across hundreds of thousands of quantum hashing operations. Our experimental protocol follows the same approach used in the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy [King et al. Science 2025], ensuring that classical computers cannot efficiently perform the same computation task. By replacing classical machines with quantum systems for mining, it is possible to significantly reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact traditionally associated with blockchain mining while providing a quantum-safe layer of security. Beyond serving as a proof of concept for a meaningful application of quantum computing, this work highlights the potential for other near-term quantum computing applications using existing technology.

Title: Exponential quantum speedups in quantum chemistry with linear depth
Authors: Oskar Leimkuhler, K. Birgitta Whaley
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and generalized unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations, for which computing the off-diagonal matrix elements is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete for any polynomial depth. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.

Title: Quantum Deep Sets and Sequences
Authors: Vladimir Vargas-Calder√≥n
Abstract: This paper introduces the quantum deep sets model, expanding the quantum machine learning tool-box by enabling the possibility of learning variadic functions using quantum systems. A couple of variants are presented for this model. The first one focuses on mapping sets to quantum systems through state vector averaging: each element of the set is mapped to a quantum state, and the quantum state of the set is the average of the corresponding quantum states of its elements. This approach allows the definition of a permutation-invariant variadic model. The second variant is useful for ordered sets, i.e., sequences, and relies on optimal coherification of tristochastic tensors that implement products of mixed states: each element of the set is mapped to a density matrix, and the quantum state of the set is the product of the corresponding density matrices of its elements. Such variant can be relevant in tasks such as natural language processing. The resulting quantum state in any of the variants is then processed to realise a function that solves a machine learning task such as classification, regression or density estimation. Through synthetic problem examples, the efficacy and versatility of quantum deep sets and sequences (QDSs) is demonstrated.

Title: Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries
Authors: Zijian Liang, Jens Niklas Eberhardt, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: We construct high-performance planar quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with open boundaries, demonstrating substantially improved resource efficiency compared to the surface code. We present planar code families with logical dimensions ranging from $k=6$ to $k=13$ (e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[173, 8, 9]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$), all using local stabilizers of weight 6 or lower. These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel ``lattice grafting'' optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Title: Phonon-Coupled Hole-Spin Qubits in High-Purity Germanium: Design and Modeling of a Scalable Architecture
Authors: D.-M. Mei, S. A. Panamaldeniya, K. Dong, S. Bhattarai, N. Budhathoki, A. Warren
Abstract: We present a design and modeling of a scalable quantum processor architecture utilizing hole-spin qubits defined in gate-controlled germanium (Ge) quantum dots, where coherent spin-phonon coupling is predicted to facilitate qubit manipulation and long-range interactions. The architecture exploits the strong, electrically tunable spin-orbit interactions intrinsic to hole states in Ge, integrated with high-quality phononic crystal cavities (PnCCs) to enable fully electrical qubit control and phonon-mediated coupling. Employing a streamlined simulation framework built upon multiband \(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}\) modeling and finite-element methods, we quantify key performance metrics, including electrically tunable \( g \)-factors ranging from \(1.3\) to \(2.0\), spin-phonon coupling strengths up to \(6.3\,\mathrm{MHz}\), phononic cavity quality factors exceeding \(10^4\), and phonon-mediated spin relaxation times (\(T_1\)) reaching milliseconds. The proposed architecture concurrently achieves extended spin coherence and rapid gate operations through strategic electric field modulation and engineered phononic bandgap environments. Furthermore, isotopically enriched high-purity Ge crystals grown in-house at the University of South Dakota, significantly enhance device coherence by minimizing disorder and hyperfine interactions. This integrated approach, merging advanced materials engineering, precise spin-orbit coupling, and phononic cavity design, establishes a promising CMOS-compatible pathway toward scalable, high-fidelity quantum computing.

Title: Revealing hidden nonlocality and preparation contextuality for an arbitrary input Bell inequality
Authors: Asmita Kumari, Saikat Patra
Abstract: In recent years, the activation of hidden nonlocality for a mixed entangled state, admitting a local model, has gained considerable interest. In this paper, we study the activation of hidden nonlocality and preparation contextuality for a class of mixed entangled states, using local filtering operations. For our demonstration, we consider the two-party (Alice and Bob) one-way communication game known as parity oblivious random access code (PORAC). The quantum success probability of such $n$-bit PORAC solely depends on a Bell functional involving $2^{n-1}$ and $n$ dichotomic measurement settings for Alice and Bob, respectively. Such a Bell functional has two classical bounds, the local and the preparation non-contextual. We show that using local filtering operations on local mixed entangled state, the nonlocality can be revealed for any non-zero value of the mixedness parameter of the entangled state if $n\geq6$. Further, we show that the preparation contextuality, which is a comparatively weaker quantum correlation than nonlocality, can be revealed for any non-zero value of the mixedness parameter of the entangled state if $n\geq 4$.

Title: Robust and digital hyper-polarization protocol of nuclear spins via magic sequential sequence
Authors: Haiyang Li, Hao Liao, Ping Wang
Abstract: Hyper-polarization of nuclear spins is crucial for advancing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and quantum information technologies, as nuclear spins typically exhibit extremely low polarization at room temperature due to their small gyro-magnetic ratios. A promising approach to achieving high nuclear spin polarization is transferring the polarization of electron to nuclear spin. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a highly effective medium for this purpose, and various hyper-polarization protocols have been developed. Among these, the pulsed polarization (PulsePol) method has been extensively studied due to its robustness against static energy shifts of the electron spin. In this study, we introduce a sequential polarization protocol and identify a series of magic and digital sequences for hyper-polarizing nuclear spins. Notably, we demonstrate that some of these magic sequences exhibit significantly greater robustness compared to the PulsePol protocol in the presence of finite half $\pi$ pulse duration of the protocol. This enhanced robustness positions our protocol as a more suitable candidate for hyper-polarizing nuclear spins species with large gyromagnetic ratios and also ensures better compatibility with high-efficiency readout techniques at high magnetic fields. Additionally, the generality of our protocol allows for its direct application to other solid-state quantum systems beyond the NV center.

Title: From the Bloch equation to a thermodynamically consistent master equation
Authors: Eugenia Pyurbeeva, Ronnie Kosloff
Abstract: The Bloch equation that set the foundation for open quantum systems, was conceived by pure physical reasoning. Since then, the Lindblad (GKLS) form of a quantum master equation, its most general mathematical representation, became an established staple in the open quantum systems toolbox. It allows to describe a multitude of quantum phenomena, however its universality comes at a cost - without additional constraints, the resultant dynamics are not necessarily thermodynamically consistent, and the equation itself lacks an intuitive interpretation. We present a mathematically equivalent form of the Lindblad master equation under a single constraint of strict energy conservation. The "elemental Bloch" equation separates the system dynamics into its elemental parts, making an explicit distinction between thermal mixing, dephasing, and energy relaxation, and thus reinstating the physical intuition in the equation. We derive the equation for a many-level system by accounting for all relevant transitions between pairs of levels. Finally, the formalism is illustrated by calculating the fixed point of the dynamics and exploring the conditions for canonical invariance in quantum systems.

Title: Quantum gyroscope based on the cavity magnomechanical system
Authors: Zhe-Qi Yang, Lei Chen, Yu-Rong Lin, Wei Qin, Zhi-Rong Zhong
Abstract: High-precision rotational angle measurement in noise-prone environments holds critical impor tance in aerospace engineering, military navigation, and related domains. In this paper, we propose a quantum gyroscope scheme based on a cavity magnomechanical system, which enables high precision rotation angle detection by harnessing hybrid light-magnon interactions. Central to this framework is the employment of a two-mode squeezed coherent state, generated via parametric coupling of dual quantized optical fields with collective spin excitations (magnons), serving as the quantum metrological probe. We demonstrate that this scheme can significantly reduce quantum noise to levels far below the shot-noise limit. Furthermore, in the non-Markovian case, the per formance of the quantum gyroscope in a dissipative environment does not deteriorate over time, provided that the environmental spectral density satisfies certain conditions. These findings provide critical insights for advancing miniaturized quantum gyroscopes with sub-microradian precision, addressing long-standing challenges in inertial navigation systems under strong ambient noise.

Title: Entanglement generation and dynamical equilibrium within de Broglie Bohm theory
Authors: Mustafa Kemal D√∂ner
Abstract: In this work, we reassess our previous hybrid semiclassical gravity model and demonstrate its ability to induce entanglement even in the limit of weak entanglement. By incorporating feedback terms sourced from gravitational potential interactions between subsystems, based on a refined version of Theory of (Exclusively) Local Beables developed by Travis Norsen, we show that these interactions alone can generate entanglement. Building on this insight, we propose a novel communication scheme and introduce the concept of dynamical equilibrium, which formalizes a stable strategy for subsystems. This framework is inspired by the quantum equilibrium hypothesis of de Broglie Bohm theory and causal interpretation of David Bohm and Jean Pierre Vigier.

The unique conditions of space, characterized by low noise and low gravity environments, open up diverse possibilities for applications ranging from precise time and frequency transfer to Earth Observation and the search of new Physics. In this paper, we summarise the M-class mission proposal in response to the 2022 call in ESA's science program: Space-Time Explorer and Quantum Equivalence Principle Space Test (STE-QUEST). It consists in a satellite mission featuring a dual-species atom interferometer operating over extended durations. This mission aims to tackle three of the most fundamental questions in Physics: (i) testing the universality of free fall with an accuracy better than one part in $10^{-17}$, (ii) exploring various forms of Ultra-Light Dark Matter, and (iii) scrutinizing the foundations of Quantum Mechanics.

Title: Classical correspondence beyond the Ehrenfest time for open quantum systems with general Lindbladians
Authors: Felipe Hern√°ndez, Daniel Ranard, C. Jess Riedel
Abstract: Quantum and classical systems evolving under the same formal Hamiltonian $H$ may dramatically differ after the Ehrenfest timescale $t_E \sim \log(\hbar^{-1})$, even as $\hbar \to 0$. Coupling the system to a Markovian environment results in a Lindblad equation for the quantum evolution. Its classical counterpart is given by the Fokker-Planck equation on phase space, which describes Hamiltonian flow with friction and diffusive noise. The quantum and classical evolutions may be compared via the Wigner-Weyl representation. Due to decoherence, they are conjectured to match closely for times far beyond the Ehrenfest timescale as $\hbar \to 0$. We prove a version of this correspondence, bounding the error between the quantum and classical evolutions for any sufficiently regular Hamiltonian $H(x,p)$ and Lindblad functions $L_k(x,p)$. The error is small when the strength of the diffusion $D$ associated to the Lindblad functions satisfies $D \gg \hbar^{4/3}$, which allows vanishing noise in the classical limit. Our method uses a time-dependent semiclassical mixture of variably squeezed Gaussian states. The states evolve according to a local harmonic approximation to the Lindblad dynamics. Both the exact quantum trajectory and its classical counterpart can be expressed as perturbations of this semiclassical mixture, with the errors bounded using Duhamel's principle. We present heuristic arguments suggesting the $4/3$ exponent is optimal and defines a boundary in the sense that asymptotically weaker diffusion permits a breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence at the Ehrenfest timescale. In a shorter companion paper, we treat the special case of Hamiltonians that decompose into kinetic and potential energy with linear Lindblad operators, with explicit bounds that can be applied directly to physical systems.

Title: Bethe-ansatz diagonalization of steady state of boundary driven integrable spin chains
Authors: Vladislav Popkov, Xin Zhang, Carlo Presilla, Tomaz Prosen
Abstract: We find that the density operator of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of XXZ spin chain with strong ``sink and source" boundary dissipation, can be described in terms of quasiparticles, with renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for an associated coherent system. The dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. In particular, this leads to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression -- in the NESS spectrum -- of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.

Title: Toward Mixed Analog-Digital Quantum Signal Processing: Quantum AD/DA Conversion and the Fourier Transform
Authors: Yuan Liu, John M. Martyn, Jasmine Sinanan-Singh, Kevin C. Smith, Steven M. Girvin, Isaac L. Chuang
Abstract: Signal processing stands as a pillar of classical computation and modern information technology, applicable to both analog and digital signals. Recently, advancements in quantum information science have suggested that quantum signal processing (QSP) can enable more powerful signal processing capabilities. However, the developments in QSP have primarily leveraged \emph{digital} quantum resources, such as discrete-variable (DV) systems like qubits, rather than \emph{analog} quantum resources, such as continuous-variable (CV) systems like quantum oscillators. Consequently, there remains a gap in understanding how signal processing can be performed on hybrid CV-DV quantum computers. Here we address this gap by developing a new paradigm of mixed analog-digital QSP. We demonstrate the utility of this paradigm by showcasing how it naturally enables analog-digital conversion of quantum signals -- specifically, the transfer of states between DV and CV quantum systems. We then show that such quantum analog-digital conversion enables new implementations of quantum algorithms on CV-DV hardware. This is exemplified by realizing the quantum Fourier transform of a state encoded on qubits via the free-evolution of a quantum oscillator, albeit with a runtime exponential in the number of qubits due to information theoretic arguments. Collectively, this work marks a significant step forward in hybrid CV-DV quantum computation, providing a foundation for scalable analog-digital signal processing on quantum processors.

Title: Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on transition probabilities of small-scale quantum systems
Authors: Ludovico Tesser, Matteo Acciai, Christian Sp√•nsl√§tt, In√®s Safi, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.

Title: Exploring Quantum Aspects of Dark Matter Axions and Dark Photons Transitioning to Photons in a Resonant Cavity
Authors: Ruifeng Zheng, Puxian Wei, Qiaoli Yang
Abstract: When axion cold dark matter interacts with a static magnetic field, it can be converted to photons with energy near the axion's mass. Classical analysis shows that incorporating a resonant cavity significantly enhances this conversion rate, forming the basis for many experiments aimed at detecting dark matter axions. However, one might ask: Does the axion-photon conversion rate increase for a single axion-photon transition? Answering this question could lead to optimizing the search for axions by integrating quantum measurement techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate that at the quantum level, single axion-photon transitions are amplified by the cavity quality factor $Q$. Furthermore, the coherence of dark matter waves is unnecessary during the measurement. The underlying principle is similar to the Purcell effect. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the scenario involving dark photon dark matter.

Title: Boundary anomaly detection in two-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases
Authors: Ke Ding, Hao-Ran Zhang, Bai-Ting Liu, Shuo Yang
Abstract: We generalize the topological response theory to detect the boundary anomalies of linear subsystem symmetries. This approach allows us to distinguish different subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases and uncover new ones. We focus on the cases where the mixed anomaly exists within the adjacent subsystems. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the power of this method by identifying strong and weak $Z_2^\tau\times Z_2^\sigma$ SSPT phases in a tunable tensor network state. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic $Z_2$ SSPT phase characterized by its degenerate entanglement spectrum. Furthermore, we extend the anomaly indicator to mixed-state density matrices and show that quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetry can persist under both uniform and alternating disorders. This finding establishes a connection between boundary quantum anomalies in pure and mixed states. Our work provides a numerical method to detect quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetries, offering new insights into the study of topological quantum phases.

Title: Proof of absence of local conserved quantities in two- and higher-dimensional quantum Ising models
Authors: Yuuya Chiba
Abstract: We prove that the Ising models with transverse and longitudinal fields on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions higher than one have no local conserved quantities other than the Hamiltonian. This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.

Title: Dirac-von Neumann Axiomatic Structure for Classical Electromagnetism
Authors: Daniel W. Piasecki
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a complex Hilbert Space with Hermitian operators for calculations in \textit{classical} electromagnetism that parallels the Hilbert Space of quantum mechanics. The axioms of this classical theory are the so-called Dirac-von Neumann axioms, however, with classical potentials in place of the wavefunction and the indeterministic collapse postulate removed. This approach lets us derive a variety of fundamental expressions for electromagnetism using minimal mathematics and a calculation sequence well-known for traditional quantum mechanics. We also demonstrate the existence of the wave commutation relationship $[\hat{x},\hat{k}]=i$, which is a unique classical analogue to the canonical commutator $[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$. The difference between classical and quantum mechanics lies in the presence of $\hbar$. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of noncommutativity of observables for a classical theory, which simply reflects its wavenature. A classical analogue of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is developed for electromagnetic waves, and its implications discussed. Further comparisons between electromagnetism, Koopman-von Neumann-Sudarshan (KvNS) classical mechanics (for point particles), and quantum mechanics are made. Finally, supplementing the analysis presented, we additionally demonstrate an elegant, completely relativistic version of Feynman's proof of Maxwell's equations \citep{Dyson}. Unlike what \citet{Dyson} indicated, there is no need for Galilean relativity for the proof to work. This fits parsimoniously with our usage of classical Lie commutators for electromagnetism.

Title: Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices
Authors: Ling-Na Wu, Xikun Li, Nathan Goldman, Botao Wang
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.

Title: Exact path integrals on half-line in quantum cosmology with a fluid clock and aspects of operator ordering ambiguity
Authors: Vikramaditya Mondal, Harkirat Singh Sahota, Kinjalk Lochan
Abstract: We perform $\textit{exact}$ half-line path integral quantization of flat, homogeneous cosmological models containing a perfect fluid acting as an internal clock, in a $D+1$ dimensional minisuperspace setup. We also discuss certain classes of operator ordering ambiguity inherent in such quantization procedures and argue that a particular ordering prescription in the quantum theory can preserve two symmetries, namely arbitrary lapse rescalings and general covariance, which are already present at the classical level. As a result of this imposition, a large class of quantum Hamiltonians differing by operator ordering produces the same inner products between quantum states. This imposition of the two symmetries of the classical minisuperspace models leads to a unique prescription for writing the quantum Hamiltonian for minisuperspace dimension $D>2$. Interestingly, in the case of $D=1$, the lapse rescaling symmetry is lost in the quantum theory, leading to an essentially ambiguous description of the canonical theory. We provide general proof of this in the context of both canonical quantization and path integrals. We supply concrete examples to validate our findings further.

Title: Dimer problem on a spherical surface
Authors: A. Tononi, D. S. Petrov, M. Lewenstein
Abstract: We solve the problem of a dimer moving on a spherical surface and find that its binding energy and wave function are sensitive to the total angular momentum. The dimer gets squeezed in the direction orthogonal to the center-of-mass motion and can qualitatively change its geometry from two-dimensional to one-dimensional. These results suggest that combining the curved geometry with finite angular momentum may give rise to qualitatively new many-body phenomena in ultracold shell-shaped gases.

Title: Light-controlled strong coupling of optical cavity modes spaced by 200 THz
Authors: Lavanya Taneja, David I Schuster, Jonathan Simon
Abstract: Cavities have driven significant advances in optical physics and quantum science, with applications ranging from lasers and spectroscopy to quantum information processing, simulation and metrology. For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-P√©rot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $>$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.

Title: Approximation of diffeomorphisms for quantum state transfers
Authors: Eugenio Pozzoli, Alessandro Scagliotti
Abstract: In this paper, we seek to combine two emerging standpoints in control theory. On the one hand, recent advances in infinite-dimensional geometric control have unlocked a method for controlling (with arbitrary precision and in arbitrarily small times) state transfers for bilinear Schr√∂dinger PDEs posed on a Riemannian manifold $M$. In particular, these arguments rely on controllability results in the group of the diffeomorphisms of $M$. On the other hand, using tools of $\Gamma$-convergence, it has been proved that we can phrase the retrieval of a diffeomorphism of $M$ as an ensemble optimal control problem. More precisely, this is done by employing a control-affine system for \emph{simultaneously} steering a finite swarm of points towards the respective targets. Here we blend these two theoretical approaches and numerically find control laws driving state transitions (such as eigenstate transfers) in small time in a bilinear Schr√∂dinger PDE posed on the torus. Such systems have experimental relevance and are currently used to model rotational dynamics of molecules, and cold atoms trapped in periodic optical lattices.

Title: A silicon spin vacuum: isotopically enriched $^{28}$silicon-on-insulator and $^{28}$silicon from ultra-high fluence ion implantation
Authors: Shao Qi Lim, Brett C. Johnson, Sergey Rubanov, Nico Klingner, Bin Gong, Alexander M. Jakob, Danielle Holmes, David N. Jamieson, Jim S. Williams, Jeffrey C. McCallum
Abstract: Isotopically enriched silicon (Si) can greatly enhance qubit coherence times by minimizing naturally occurring $^{29}$Si which has a non-zero nuclear spin. Ultra-high fluence $^{28}$Si ion implantation of bulk natural Si substrates was recently demonstrated as an attractive technique to ultra-high $^{28}$Si isotopic purity. In this work, we apply this $^{28}$Si enrichment process to produce $^{28}$Si and $^{28}$Si-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Experimentally, we produced a $^{28}$Si sample on natural Si substrate with $^{29}$Si depleted to 7~ppm (limited by measurement noise floor), that is at least 100 nm thick. This is achieved with an ion energy that results in a sputter yield of less than one and an ultra-high ion fluence, as supported by our improved computational model that is based on fitting a large number of experiments. Further, our model predicts the $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si depletion in our sample to be less than 1~ppm. In the case of SOI, ion implantation conditions are found to be more stringent than those of bulk natural Si in terms of minimizing threading dislocations upon subsequent solid phase epitaxy annealing. Finally, we do not observe open volume defects in our $^{28}$SOI and $^{28}$Si samples after SPE annealing (620¬∞C, 10 minutes).
