Title: Composable Finite-Size Security of High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution Protocols
Authors: Florian Kanitschar, Marcus Huber
Abstract: Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) extending beyond urban areas commonly use satellite links. However, the transmission of quantum states through the Earth's atmosphere is highly susceptible to noise, restricting its application primarily to nighttime. High-dimensional (HD) QKD offers a promising solution to this limitation by employing high-dimensionally entangled quantum states. Although experimental platforms for HD QKD exist, previous security analyses were limited to the asymptotic regime and have either relied on impractical measurements or employed computationally demanding convex optimization tasks restricting the security analysis to low dimensions. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting a composable finite-size security proof against both collective and coherent attacks for a general HD QKD protocol that utilizes only experimentally accessible measurements. In addition to the conventional, yet impractical `one-shot' key rates, we also provide a practical variable-length security argument that yields significantly higher expected key rates. This approach is particularly crucial for rapidly changing and turbulent atmospheric conditions, as encountered for free-space and satellite-based QKD platforms.

Title: Non-Gaussian Noise Magnetometry Using Local Spin Qubits
Authors: Jonathan B. Curtis, Amir Yacoby, Eugene Demler
Abstract: Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.

Title: Real-Time Scattering on Quantum Computers via Hamiltonian Truncation
Authors: James Ingoldby, Michael Spannowsky, Timur Sypchenko, Simon Williams, Matthew Wingate
Abstract: We present a quantum computational framework using Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) for simulating real-time scattering processes in $(1+1)$-dimensional scalar $\phi^4$ theory. Unlike traditional lattice discretisation methods, HT approximates the quantum field theory Hilbert space by truncating the energy eigenbasis of a solvable reference Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of required qubits. Our approach involves preparing initial states as wavepackets through adiabatic evolution from the free-field theory to the interacting regime. We experimentally demonstrate this state preparation procedure on an IonQ trapped-ion quantum device and validate it through quantum simulations, capturing key phenomena such as wavepacket dynamics, interference effects, and particle production post-collision. Detailed resource comparisons highlight the advantages of HT over lattice approaches in terms of qubit efficiency, although we observe challenges associated with circuit depth scaling. Our findings suggest that Hamiltonian Truncation offers a promising strategy for quantum simulations of quantum field theories, particularly as quantum hardware and algorithms continue to improve.

Title: A Framework for the Efficient Evaluation of Runtime Assertions on Quantum Computers
Authors: Damian Rovara, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille
Abstract: The continuous growth of quantum computing and the increasingly complex quantum programs resulting from it lead to unprecedented obstacles in ensuring program correctness. Runtime assertions are, therefore, becoming a crucial tool in the development of quantum programs. They assist developers in the debugging process and help to test and verify the program. However, while assertions can be implemented in a straightforward manner on classical computers, physical limitations of quantum computers pose considerable challenges for the evaluation of quantum assertions. Access to the quantum state of a program is limited, execution time is expensive and noise can significantly distort measurement outcomes. To address these problems, this work proposes a framework that assists developers in the evaluation of runtime assertions on real quantum computers. It translates a variety of assertions into sets of measurements, reduces execution overhead where possible and evaluates the measurement results after the execution even in the presence of noise. This approach substantially aids developers in the debugging process, enabling efficient assertion-driven debugging even in large programs. The proposed framework is available as an open-source implementation at this https URL

Title: Qudit Noisy Stabilizer Formalism
Authors: Paul Aigner, Maria Flors Mor-Ruiz, Wolfgang DÃ¼r
Abstract: We introduce the qudit Noisy Stabilizer Formalism, a framework for efficiently describing the evolution of stabilizer states in prime-power dimensions subject to generalized Pauli-diagonal noise under Clifford operations and generalized Pauli measurements. For arbitrary dimensions, the formalism remains applicable, though restricted to a subset of stabilizer states and operations. The computational complexity scales linearly with the number of qudits in the initial state and exponentially with the number of qudits in the final state. This ensures that when noisy qudit stabilizer states evolve via generalized Pauli measurements and Clifford operations to generate multipartite entangled states of a few qudits, their description remains efficient. We demonstrate this by analyzing the generation of a generalized Bell pair from a noisy linear cluster state subject to two distinct noise sources acting on each of the qudits.

Title: Quantum tunneling and anti-tunneling across entropic barriers
Authors: Paolo Malgaretti, Francesco Petiziol, Alexander Schnell
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum particle in a constricted two-dimensional channel and analyze how the onset of quantum corrections impacts the (semi-)classical high-temperature behaviour, as temperature is lowered. We characterize both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (transport) properties of the system, considering the case of a narrow and disorder-free channel. Counterintuitively, we find that quantum corrections do not monotonically enhance the particle current as the temperature is lowered, as naively expected from the activation of coherent tunnelling, but they rather inhibit transport at intermediate temperatures, increasing the effective free-energy barrier. We illustrate this ``anti-tunnelling'' effect numerically by computing the non-equilibrium steady-state of a quantum master equation describing the system, and confirm it analytically by adopting the Quantum Smoluchowski limit.

Title: Quantum CNOT Gate with Actively Synchronized Photon Pairs
Authors: Haim Nakav, Tanim Firdoshi, Omri Davidson, Bankim Chandra Das, Ofer Firstenberg
Abstract: Controlling the synchronization of photons from probabilistic quantum sources plays a pivotal role in advancing efficient quantum information processing. We report the realization of a probabilistic entangling gate operating on actively synchronized photon pairs, using a quantum memory based on warm atomic vapor. We achieve a truth-table fidelity exceeding 85% and demonstrate Bell- inequality violation for all four Bell states. The reduction in visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference introduced by the storage process is identified as a primary factor limiting the gate fidelity. We derive an exact quantitative relation between HOM visibility and gate fidelity for pure single photons, which applies to all photonic gates relying on interference, regardless of the physical platform.

Title: Knowledge Distillation Inspired Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Virtual Annealing
Authors: Junxu Li
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Distillation Inspired Variational Quantum Eigensolver (KD-VQE). Inspired by the virtual distillation process in knowledge distillation (KD), KD-VQE introduces a virtual annealing mechanism to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. In KD-VQE, measurement resources (shots) are dynamically allocated among multiple trial wavefunctions, each weighted according to a Boltzmann distribution with a virtual temperature. As the temperature decreases gradually, the algorithm progressively reallocates resources toward lower-energy candidates, effectively filtering out suboptimal states and steering the system toward the global minimum. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of KD-VQE by applying it to the two-site Fermi-Hubbard model. Compared to standard VQE framework, KD-VQE explores a broader region of the solution space, and offers improved convergence behavior and increased reliability.

Title: Nanoscale Mirrorless Superradiant Lasing
Authors: Anna Bychek, Raphael Holzinger, Helmut Ritsch
Abstract: We predict collective 'free-space' lasing in a dense nanoscopic emitter arrangement where dipole-dipole coupled atomic emitters synchronize their emission and exhibit lasing behavior without the need for an optical resonator.~At the example of a subwavelength-spaced linear emitter chain with varying fractions of pumped and unpumped emitters, we present a comprehensive study of this mirrorless lasing phenomenon. The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge towards a single narrow spectral line at high pump power. The most substantial enhancement and line narrowing occur when a fraction of unpumped atoms is present. We show that this leads to superradiant lasing near the bare atomic frequency, making the system a promising candidate for a minimalist active optical frequency reference.

Title: Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier with Passive Reverse Isolation
Authors: C. S. Kow, M. T. Bell
Abstract: Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have attracted much attention for their broadband amplification and near-quantum-limited noise performance. TWPAs are non-reciprocal by nature providing gain for forward-propagating signals and transmission line losses for backward traveling waves. This intrinsic non-reciprocity is insufficient to protect sensitive quantum devices from back-action due to noise from warmer amplification stages in practical systems, and thus necessitates the need for bulky cryogenic isolators. We present a multi-stage Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier (mTWPA) that addresses this limitation by achieving passive in-band reverse isolation alongside near-quantum-limited noise performance. The multi-stage architecture consists of two, mode conversion stages and a reflectionless high-pass filter which provides the passive isolation. Experimental measurements of a prototype mTWPA demonstrated 20 dB of forward gain across a 1.6 GHz bandwidth and greater than 35 dB of reverse isolation. Noise measurements indicate performance at 1.7 times the quantum limit. This demonstrates that the increased complexity of a multi-stage TWPA design does not lead to significant added noise. The designed distribution of gain across the stages is engineered to minimize internal amplifier noise at the input, and we propose further optimization strategies in redistribution of the gain between the stages. This level of isolation effectively mitigates noise from warmer amplification stages, matching the performance of conventional isolators. The mTWPA approach offers a scalable path forward for more efficient and compact quantum circuit readout systems.

Title: Frequency super-resolution with quantum environment engineering in a weakly coupled nuclear-spin system
Authors: Tianzi Wang, Qian Cao, Peng Du, Wenxian Zhang
Abstract: Optical super-resolution has been widely employed to beat spatial diffraction limit, which is often stated by Abbe-Rayleigh criterion. Analogously, we propose a frequency super-resolution method, which beats conventional spectral resolution limit often approximated by full width half maximum of the spectral peak, {\Gamma}. This method utilizes recently developed quantum environment engineering technique. With numerical simulations and experiments, we demonstrate the frequency super-resolution method in a three-nuclear-spin system (Trifluoroiodoethylene), by successfully decomposing a thermal state spectrum of the spin F3 into four peaks of engineered pseudo-pure states of the quantum environment. The ultimate frequency resolution reaches {\sim} 0.005 {\Gamma}. This method is potentially useful in spectral decomposition of weakly coupled nuclear spin systems and might be improved further to acquire finer frequency super-resolution by employing more advanced quantum techniques..

Title: Unravelling the non-Markovian spin-boson model and quantum quasi-Otto cycle
Authors: Shreyas Harshal Pradhan, Hadi Mohammed Soufy, Vishal Anand, Rik Chattopadhyay, Subhadip Mitra, Samyadeb Bhattacharya
Abstract: We use the spin-boson model to describe the dynamics of a two-level atom interacting with Fabry-PÃ©rot cavity modes. We solve the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the system-bath model without the Born-Markov approximation to derive the non-Markovian reduced dynamics of the qubit. We further construct an exact Lindblad-type master equation for it. Similar to the quantum Otto cycle, we construct a non- Markovian quasi-cyclic process based on the atom-cavity interactions, which we call the quasi-Otto cycle. For judicious choices of input state and parameters, the quasi-cycle can be more efficient as a quantum engine than the Otto cycle. We also showed that if the quasi-cycle is repeated multiple times, the efficiency of the quasi-Otto engine asymptotically approaches that of the Otto engine.

Title: Quantum Classifiers with Trainable Kernel
Authors: Li Xu, Xiao-yu Zhang, Ming Li, Shu-qian Shen
Abstract: Kernel function plays a crucial role in machine learning algorithms such as classifiers. In this paper, we aim to improve the classification performance and reduce the reading out burden of quantum classifiers. We devise a universally trainable quantum feature mapping layout to broaden the scope of feature states and avoid the inefficiently straight preparation of quantum superposition states. We also propose an improved quantum support vector machine that employs partially evenly weighted trial states. In addition, we analyze its error sources and superiority. As a promotion, we propose a quantum iterative multi-classifier framework for one-versus-one and one-versus-rest approaches. Finally, we conduct corresponding numerical demonstrations in the \textit{qiskit} package. The simulation result of trainable quantum feature mapping shows considerable clustering performance, and the subsequent classification performance is superior to the existing quantum classifiers in terms of accuracy and distinguishability.

Title: Ordering Matters: Structure, Accuracy and Gate Cost in Second-Order Suzuki Product Formulas
Authors: Matthew A Lane, Dan E Browne
Abstract: Product formula methods, particularly the second-order Suzuki decomposition, are an important tool for simulating quantum dynamics on quantum computers due to their simplicity and unitarity preservation. While higher-order schemes have been extensively studied, the landscape of second-order decompositions remains poorly understood in practice. We explore how term ordering and recursive application of the Suzuki formula generate a broad family of approximants beyond standard Strang splitting, introducing a hybrid heuristic that minimizes local error bounds and a fractional approach with tunable sequence length. The hybrid method consistently selects the longest possible decomposition, achieving the lowest error but at the cost of exponential gate overhead, while fractional decompositions often match or exceed this performance with far fewer gates, enabling offline selection of near-optimal approximants for practical quantum simulation. This offers a simple, compiler-accessible heuristic for balancing accuracy and cost, and highlights an underexplored region of decomposition space where many low-cost approximants may achieve high accuracy without global optimization. Finally, we show that in the presence of depolarising noise, fractional decompositions become advantageous as systems approach fault-tolerant error rates, providing a practical path for balancing noise resistance and simulation accuracy.

Title: Unconventional photon blockade in cavity QED with parametric amplification
Authors: Madan Mohan Mahana, Sanket Das, Tarak Nath Dey
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the quantum-interference-induced photon blockade effect in a single two-level atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system with degenerate parametric am- plification. The analytical calculations reveal the optimal parametric gain and phase parameters for achieving optimum unconventional photon blockade conditions. Under the optimal parameter regime, the numerical results of the second-order correlation function demonstrate strong photon antibunching consistent with the analytical results. Furthermore, the numerical results corroborate that coherently driving the atom leads to a stronger photon blockade than a coherently driven cavity with the optimal parameters. We numerically demonstrate that the UPB effect is compromised by a non-zero cavity-atom coupling in the cavity-driven configuration. However, stronger photon an- tibunching can be attained with a non-zero cavity-atom coupling in the atom-driven configuration. This work may be suitable for experimentally realising a strongly antibunched single-photon source for applications in quantum technology.

Abstract: A quantum processor, like any computing device, requires the development of both hardware and the necessary set of software solutions, starting with quantum algorithms and ending with means of accessing quantum devices. As part of the roadmap for the development of the high-tech field of quantum computing in the period from 2020 to 2024, a set of software solutions for quantum computing devices was developed. This software package includes a set of quantum algorithms for solving prototypes of applied tasks, monitoring and benchmarking tools for quantum processors, error suppression and correction methods, tools for compiling and optimizing quantum circuits, as well as interfaces for remote cloud access. This review presents the key results achieved, among which it is necessary to mention the execution of quantum algorithms using a cloud-based quantum computing platform.

Title: Bayesian Frequency Metrology with Optimal Ramsey Interferometry in Optical Atomic Clocks
Authors: Timm Kielinski, Klemens Hammerer
Abstract: Frequency metrology is a cornerstone of modern precision measurements and optical atomic clocks have emerged as the most precise measurement devices. In this progress report, we explore various Ramsey interrogation schemes tailored to optical atomic clocks primarily limited by laser noise. To incorporate frequency fluctuations directly into the theoretical model, we consider a Bayesian framework. In this context, we review fundamental bounds arising in Bayesian estimation theory, which serve as a benchmark throughout this work. We investigate the trade-off between entanglement-enhanced sensitivity and robustness against laser noise in order to identify optimal initial states, measurement schemes and estimation strategies. Beside standard protocols based on coherent spin states, squeezed spin states and GHZ states, we consider variational Ramsey protocols implemented via low-depth quantum circuits based on one-axis twisting operations to approach optimal stability. In particular, we review known and identify new optimal interrogation schemes for a variety of scenarios, including different experimental platforms, ensemble sizes and regimes characterized by a wide range of interrogation durations and dead times. Hence, this work establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for optimizing Ramsey interrogation schemes, providing guidance for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks.

Title: Quantum Circuits for the Black-Scholes equations via SchrÃ¶dingerisation
Authors: Shi Jin, Zihao Tang, Xu Yin, Lei Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we construct quantum circuits for the Black-Scholes equations, a cornerstone of financial modeling, based on a quantum algorithm that overcome the cure of high dimensionality. Our approach leverages the SchrÃ¶dingerisation technique, which converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into a system evolved by unitary dynamics. This is achieved through a warped phase transformation that lifts the problem into a higher-dimensional space, enabling the simulation of the Black-Scholes equation on a quantum computer. We will conduct a thorough complexity analysis to highlight the quantum advantages of our approach compared to existing algorithms. The effectiveness of our quantum circuit is substantiated through extensive numerical experiments.

Title: Generic Two-Mode Gaussian States as Quantum Sensors
Authors: Pritam Chattopadhyay, Saikat Sur, Jonas F. G. Santos
Abstract: Gaussian quantum channels constitute a cornerstone of continuous-variable quantum information science, underpinning a wide array of protocols in quantum optics and quantum metrology. While the action of such channels on arbitrary states is well-characterized under full channel knowledge, we address the inverse problem, namely, the precise estimation of fundamental channel parameters, including the beam splitter transmissivity and the two-mode squeezing amplitude. Employing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a benchmark for metrological sensitivity, we demonstrate that the symmetry inherent in mode mixing critically governs the amplification of QFI, thereby enabling high-precision parameter estimation. In addition, we investigate quantum thermometry by estimating the average photon number of thermal states, revealing that the transmissivity parameter significantly modulates estimation precision. Our results underscore the metrological utility of two-mode Gaussian states and establish a robust framework for parameter inference in noisy and dynamically evolving quantum systems.

Title: 3D-Integrated Superconducting qubits: CMOS-Compatible, Wafer-Scale Processing for Flip-Chip Architectures

Abstract: In this article, we present a technology development of a superconducting qubit device 3D-integrated by flip-chip-bonding and processed following CMOS fabrication standards and contamination rules on 200 mm wafers. We present the utilized proof-of-concept chip designs for qubit- and carrier chip, as well as the respective front-end and back-end fabrication techniques. In characterization of the newly developed microbump technology based on metallized KOH-etched Si-islands, we observe a superconducting transition of the used metal stacks and radio frequency (RF) signal transfer through the bump connection with negligible attenuation. In time-domain spectroscopy of the qubits we find high yield qubit excitation with energy relaxation times of up to 15 us.

Title: Quantum refrigerator embedded in spin-star environments: Scalings of temperature and refrigeration time
Authors: Sukrut Mondkar, Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: We examine a quantum absorption refrigerator that comprises three qubits, each of which is connected with a separate spin-star environment. The refrigerator exhibits the feature of transient cooling, i.e., lowering of the temperature of the first qubit in sufficiently small timescales. Since the spin-star environment is inherently non-Markovian in nature, steady-state cooling may or may not be achieved. A key advantage of our model is that the symmetries of the Hamiltonian enable a solution of the reduced density matrices of the refrigerator qubits, even in the presence of a large number (~50) of environmental spins. We derive the condition for autonomous refrigeration and analyze how the optimal cold qubit temperature scales with the number of bath qubits. We find a power law scaling towards a constant asymptotic value. We also find the scaling of the minimum time required for cooling as a function of the number of bath spins. Further, we scrutinize the heat currents associated with each of the three qubits.

Title: Adaptive folding and noise filtering for robust quantum error mitigation
Authors: Kathrin F. Koenig, Finn Reinecke, Thomas Wellens
Abstract: Coping with noise in quantum computation poses significant challenges due to its unpredictable nature and the complexities of accurate modeling. This paper presents noise-adaptive folding, a technique that enhances zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) through the use of adaptive scaling factors based on circuit error measurements. Furthermore, we introduce two filtering methods: one relies on measuring error strength, while the other utilizes statistical filtering to improve the extrapolation process. Comparing our approach with standard ZNE reveals that adaptive scaling factors can be optimized using either a noise model or direct error strength measurements from inverted circuits. The integration of adaptive scaling with filtering techniques leads to notable improvements in expectation-value extrapolation over standard ZNE. Our findings demonstrate that these adaptive methods effectively strengthen error mitigation against noise fluctuations, thereby enhancing the precision and reliability of quantum computations.

Title: Voltage-tunable, femtometer-precision plasmo-mechanical displacement at fixed gap size
Authors: Rasim Volga Ovali, Mehmet Emre Tasgin
Abstract: We propose an elegant method for continuous electrical-tuning of plasmo-mechanical displacement and squeezing without changing plasmonic gap size. Recent experiments bend the mechanical oscillator (cantilever) in units of nm via electrostatic actuators. We do not bend the cantilever but merely electrically-tune the gap intensity, so plasmo-mechanical coupling, via Fano resonance. This allows continuous displacement tuning in units of mechanical oscillator length that is about 30 fm in the experiments. This way, coupling strength can be tuned by 2 orders-of-magnitude via only a 1 V potential difference. Response time is picoseconds. Moreover, quadrature-squeezing (entanglement) of the oscillator can also be tuned continuously.

Title: Phase sensitivity via photon-subtraction operations inside Mach-Zehnder interferometer
Authors: Qisi Zhou, Qinqian Kang, Tao Jiang, Zekun Zhao, Teng Zhao, Cunjin Liu, Liyun Hu
Abstract: Based on the conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we propose a metrological scheme to improve phase sensitivity. In this scheme, we use a coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state as input states, employ multi-photon-subtraction operations and make intensity-detection or homodyne-detection. We study phase sensitivity, quantum Fisher information and quantum CramÃ©r-Rao bound under both ideal and lossy conditions. The results indicate that choosing an appropriate detection method and photon subtraction scheme can significantly enhance the phase sensitivity and robustness against photon losses. Even under lossy conditions, the multi-photon subtraction schemes can surpass the standard quantum limit. Notably, the homodyne detection method can even break through the Heisenberg limit. Moreover, increasing the number of photon-subtracted can enhance both phase sensitivity and quantum Fisher information. This research highlights the significant value of this scheme in quantum precision measurement.

Title: Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization
Authors: Nana Liu, Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.

Title: Encoding classical data into the squeezing of noisy-states for nanowire communication
Authors: Mehmet Emre Tasgin
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are known to retain quantum optical properties --such assqueezing-- over significantly longer distances than their classical field amplitudes. While this resilience has been recognized for over two decades, the residual squeezing typically becomes so small that detecting it requires millions of measurements. In this work, we show that encoding classical data (bits or dits) into the "degree of squeezing" of a single-mode squeezed "noisy" state enablesefficient transmission through plasmonic nanowires. Remarkably, this approach allows the encoded information to be recovered even at long propagation distances using only a few measurements --far outperforming both squeezed non-noisy states and amplitude-based encoding schemes.

Title: A Multi-Scale Quantum Framework for Evaluating Metal-Organic Frameworks in Carbon Capture
Authors: Tom W. A. Montgomery, Adrian Varela-Alvarez, Philip Llewellyn, Phalgun Lolur
Abstract: Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials to help mitigate the effects of global warming by selectively absorbing $\text{CO}_{2}$ for direct capture. Accurate quantum chemistry simulations are a useful tool to help select and design optimal MOF structures, replacing costly or impractical experiments or providing chemically inspired features for data-driven approaches such as machine learning. However, applying simulations over large datasets requires efficient simulation methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) which, despite often being accurate, introduces uncontrolled approximations and a lack of systematic improvability. In this work we outline a hierarchical cluster model that includes a recently developed quantum embedding that provides a more systematic approach to efficiently tune accuracy. We apply this workflow to calculate the binding affinity for a small set of MOF structures and $\text{CO}_{2}$ using experimentally measured heat of adsorption as a reference. Since quantum embeddings have also been proposed as a framework to accelerate the utility of quantum hardware, we discuss some of the benefits and challenges of integrating quantum solvers into the workflow outlined in this work.

Title: Clock precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit at $10^{-18}$ level
Authors: Y. A. Yang, Maya Miklos, Yee Ming Tso, Stella Kraus, Joonseok Hur, Jun Ye
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks with unrivaled precision and accuracy have advanced the frontier of precision measurement science and opened new avenues for exploring fundamental physics. A fundamental limitation on clock precision is the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), which stems from the uncorrelated projection noise of each atom. State-of-the-art optical lattice clocks interrogate large ensembles to minimize the SQL, but density-dependent frequency shifts pose challenges to scaling the atom number. The SQL can be surpassed, however, by leveraging entanglement, though it remains an open problem to achieve quantum advantage from spin squeezing at state-of-the-art stability levels. Here we demonstrate clock performance beyond the SQL, achieving a fractional frequency precision of 1.1 $\times 10^{-18}$ for a single spin-squeezed clock. With cavity-based quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements, we prepare two spin-squeezed ensembles of $\sim$30,000 strontium atoms confined in a two-dimensional optical lattice. A synchronous clock comparison with an interrogation time of 61 ms achieves a metrological improvement of 2.0(2) dB beyond the SQL, after correcting for state preparation and measurement errors. These results establish the most precise entanglement-enhanced clock to date and offer a powerful platform for exploring the interplay of gravity and quantum entanglement.

Title: Symmetry-Aware Trotterization for Simulating the Heisenberg Model on IBM Quantum Devices
Authors: Bo Yang, Naoki Negishi
Abstract: Simulating the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation requires finding the unitary operator that efficiently describes the time evolution. One of the fundamental tools to efficiently simulate quantum dynamics is the Trotter decomposition of the time-evolution operator, and various quantum-classical hybrid algorithms have been proposed to implement Trotterization. Given that some quantum hardware is publicly accessible, it is important to assess the practical performance of Trotterization on them. However, a straightforward Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian often leads to quantum circuits with large depth, which hinders accurate simulation on devices with limited coherence time. In this work, we propose a hardware-efficient Trotterization scheme for the time evolution of a 3-site, $J=1$ XXX Heisenberg model. By exploiting the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that acts on a reduced subspace, significantly lowering the circuit depth after optimization for specific evolution times. This approach can be interpreted as a change of basis in the standard Trotterization scheme. We also test our method on the IBM Quantum device ibmq_jakarta. Combining with the readout error mitigation and the zero-noise extrapolation, we obtain the fidelity $0.9928 \pm 0.0013$ for the simulation of the time evolution of the Heisenberg model from the time $t=0$ to $t=\pi$.

Title: Privacy-preserving neutral atom-based quantum classifier towards real healthcare applications
Authors: Ettore Canonici, Filippo Caruso
Abstract: Technological advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for the healthcare domain are rapidly arising, with a growing discussion regarding the ethical management of their development. In general, ML healthcare applications crucially require performance, interpretability of data, and respect for data privacy. The latter is an increasingly debated topic as commercial cloud computing services become more and more widespread. Recently, dedicated methods are starting to be developed aiming to protect data privacy. However, these generally result in a trade-off forcing one to balance the level of data privacy and the algorithm performance. Here, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier model is proposed whose training is reformulated into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and adapted to a neutral atom-based Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Our final model does not require anonymization techniques to protect data privacy since the sensitive data are not needed to be transferred to the cloud-available QPU. Indeed, the latter is used only during the training phase, hence allowing a future concrete application in a real-world scenario. Finally, performance and scaling analyses on a publicly available breast cancer dataset are discussed, both using ideal and noisy simulations for the training process, and also successfully tested on a currently available real neutral-atom QPU.

This approach mixes temporal and spatial correlations in a manner distinct from traditional metrology, leading to ambiguities in how one identifies Heisenberg scalings (e.g.~standard asymptotic metrics like the sensitivity are not bounded by system size). Here, we propose a new metric for continuous sensing, the optimized finite-time environmental quantum Fisher information (QFI), that remedies the above issues by simultaneously treating time and system size as finite resources. In addition to having direct experimental relevance, this quantity is rigorously bounded by both system size and integration time, allowing for a precise formulation of Heisenberg scaling. We also introduce two many-body continuous sensors: the high-temperature superradiant sensor, and the dissipative spin squeezer. Both exhibit Heisenberg scaling of a collective magnetic field for multiple directions. The spin squeezed sensor has a striking advantage over previously studied many-body continuous sensors: the optimal measurement achieving the full QFI does not require the construction of a complex decoder system, but can be achieved using direct photodetection of the cavity output field.

Title: Adiabatic state preparation and thermalization of simulated phase noise in a Rydberg spin Hamiltonian
Authors: Tomas Kozlej, Gerard Pelegri, Jonathan D. Pritchard, Andrew J. Daley
Abstract: Laser phase noise is one of the main sources of decoherence in driven Rydberg systems with neutral atoms in tweezer arrays. While the effect of phase noise in the regimes of isolated qubits and few-qubit gate protocols has been studied extensively, there are open questions about the effects of this noise on many-body systems. In many scenarios, the effects of noise cannot simply be described by an increase in the energy or temperature of the system, leading to non-trivial changes in the state and relevant correlations. In this work, we use stochastic sampling to simulate laser phase noise based on experimentally relevant spectral densities. We explore the impact of this noise on adiabatic state preparation in a one-dimensional system, discussing the interplay between heating and interactions during dynamics. We find that for certain adiabatic processes, the noise can be seen to approximately thermalize in terms of its effects on relevant correlation functions.

Title: Post-selection free time-bin entanglement on a thin-film lithium niobate photonic chip
Authors: Marcello Bacchi, Andrea Bernardi, Marco Clementi, Sara Congia, Francesco Garrisi, Andrea Martellosio, Marco Passoni, Alexander Wrobel, Federico Andrea Sabattoli, Matteo Galli, Daniele Bajoni
Abstract: Time-bin entanglement is the most commonly used form of entanglement for quantum communication protocols over fiber networks, due to the natural resilience of this encoding scheme to thermal phase fluctuations in optical fibers. Projective measurements on some bases in the time-bin encoding need, however, post-selection of the measured events, introducing a loophole in Bell tests and requiring high temporal resolution. In this work, we demonstrate chip-integrated receivers for time-bin entanglement certification including a high-speed optical switch to remove such post-selection loophole. The receivers are realized using thin-film lithium niobate and operate at a switching frequency of 5 GHz, enabling high secure key rates. We demonstrate a Bell inequality violation by more than 24 standard deviations without the need for time resolution at the time-bin separation level.

Title: Experimental demonstration of a multi-particle collective measurement for optimal quantum state estimation
Authors: Arman Mansouri, Kyle M. Jordan, Jeff S. Lundeen
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a two-particle collective measurement proposed as the optimal solution to a quantum state estimation game. Our results suggest that, in practice, the collective measurement strategy is at least as good as the best local approach, and it achieves a higher average fidelity when accounting for systematic errors. This photonic implementation uses a recently developed universal two-photon projective measurement based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, polarization-dependent loss, and unitary operations. We compare the performance to the case where the entangling component of the measurement is suppressed. We further apply the collective measurement to quantum state tomography, observing a near-optimal scaling of the infidelity with the total number of samples.

Authors: Abel C. H. Chen
Abstract: In recent years, advancements in quantum chip technology, such as Willow, have contributed to reducing quantum computation error rates, potentially accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing. As a result, the design of quantum algorithms suitable for real-world applications has become a crucial research direction. This study focuses on the implementation of Shor algorithm, aiming to improve modular computation efficiency and demonstrate the factorization of a 4096-bit integer under specific constraints. Experimental results, when compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, indicate a significant improvement in efficiency while enabling the factorization of longer integers.

Title: Explaining Anomalies with Tensor Networks
Authors: Hans Hohenfeld, Marius Beuerle, Elie Mounzer
Abstract: Tensor networks, a class of variational quantum many-body wave functions have attracted considerable research interest across many disciplines, including classical machine learning. Recently, Aizpurua et al. demonstrated explainable anomaly detection with matrix product states on a discrete-valued cyber-security task, using quantum-inspired methods to gain insight into the learned model and detected anomalies. Here, we extend this framework to real-valued data domains. We furthermore introduce tree tensor networks for the task of explainable anomaly detection. We demonstrate these methods with three benchmark problems, show adequate predictive performance compared to several baseline models and both tensor network architectures' ability to explain anomalous samples. We thereby extend the application of tensor networks to a broader class of potential problems and open a pathway for future extensions to more complex tensor network architectures.

Title: Mean-field Mixed Quantum-Classical Approach for Many-Body Quantum Dynamics of Exciton-Polaritons
Authors: Pritha Ghosh, Arshath Manjalingal, Sachith Wickramasinghe, Saeed Rahmanian Koshkaki, Arkajit Mandal
Abstract: In this work, we use a mixed quantum-classical (mean-field) many-body approach for simulating the quantum dynamics of excitons and exciton-polaritons beyond the single-excitation subspace. We combine the multitrajectory Ehrenfest approach, which propagates slow degrees of freedom classically, with the Gross-Pitaevskii method, which propagates fast degrees of freedom in a mean-field fashion. We use this mean-field many-body Ehrenfest approach to analyze how the phonon-induced dynamic disorder and the many-body interaction affect the incoherent and coherent dynamics of excitons and exciton-polaritons. We examine how the number of excitations and the strength of repulsive exciton-exciton interaction nonlinearly influence the transport, FrÃ¶hlich scattering and decoherence.

Title: Spin systems as quantum field theories in inflationary universe: A study with Unruh-DeWitt detectors
Authors: Shunichiro Kinoshita, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii
Abstract: We propose a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory (QFT) in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. Our previous work (arXiv:2410.07587) has demonstrated that QFT of Majorana fermions in an arbitrary two-dimensional spacetime can be mapped onto a spin system. In this study, we apply this mapping to investigate the thermal properties of an inflationary universe. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector, known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. In an inflationary universe with Hubble constant $H$, the excitation probability of an Unruh-DeWitt detector follows a thermal distribution with temperature $H/(2\pi)$, indicating that a static observer in the inflationary universe perceives a thermal field. We consider a spin system corresponding to QFT in an inflationary universe and introduce a single spin interacting with this system as an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the detector response asymptotically approaches the result of QFT with an appropriate power of the number of spin sites. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal properties of an inflationary universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.

Title: Numerical modeling for trapped-ion thermometry using dark resonances
Authors: Muriel Bonetto, NicolÃ¡s AdriÃ¡n NuÃ±ez Barreto, Christian TomÃ¡s Schmiegelow, Cecilia Cormick
Abstract: The accurate simulation of vibrational energy transport and quantum thermodynamics with trapped ions requires good methods for the estimation of temperatures. One valuable tool with this purpose is based on the fit of dark resonances in the fluorescence spectrum. However, the reliability of the procedure is still unclear. Here, we discuss several techniques with simplified dynamical equations for the numerical simulation of the spectrum of a trapped ion undergoing thermal motion, identifying advantages and limitations of each method. We start with a simplified three-level model to provide a better insight into the approximations involved and then move on to tackle the experimentally relevant case of an eight-level calcium ion. We observe that mimicking the effect of thermal motion by means of additional dephasing is computationally very convenient but can lead to significant errors in the estimation of the temperature. However, this can be counteracted by a proper calibration, supporting the use of dark resonances as a practical thermometer.

Title: Nanoscale Mechanical Structures Fabricated from Silicon-on-Insulator Substrates
Authors: Andrew N. Cleland, Michael L. Roukes
Abstract: We describe a method with which to fabricate sub-micron mechanical structures from silicon-on-insulator substrates. We believe this is the first reported method for such fabrication, and our technique allows for complex, multilayer electron beam lithography to define metallized layers and structural Si layers on these substrates. The insulating underlayer may be removed by a straightforward wet processing step, leaving suspended single crystal Si mechanical structures. We have fabricated and mechanically tested structures such as beam resonators, tuning-fork resonators, and torsional oscillators, all with smallest dimensions of 0.1-0.2 microns and fundamental resonance frequencies above 10 MHz.

Title: QbC: Quantum Correctness by Construction
Authors: Anurudh Peduri, Ina Schaefer, Michael Walter
Abstract: Thanks to the rapid progress and growing complexity of quantum algorithms, correctness of quantum programs has become a major concern. Pioneering research over the past years has proposed various approaches to formally verify quantum programs using proof systems such as quantum Hoare logic. All these prior approaches are post-hoc: one first implements a program and only then verifies its correctness. Here we propose Quantum Correctness by Construction (QbC): an approach to constructing quantum programs from their specification in a way that ensures correctness. We use pre- and postconditions to specify program properties, and propose sound and complete refinement rules for constructing programs in a quantum while language from their specification. We validate QbC by constructing quantum programs for idiomatic problems and patterns. We find that the approach naturally suggests how to derive program details, highlighting key design choices along the way. As such, we believe that QbC can play a role in supporting the design and taxonomization of quantum algorithms and software.

Title: Exact and local compression of quantum bipartite states
Authors: Kohtaro Kato
Abstract: We study exact local compression of a quantum bipartite state; that is, applying local quantum operations to reduce the dimensions of the Hilbert spaces while perfectly preserving the correlation. We provide a closed-form expression for the minimal achievable dimensions, formulated as a minimization of the Schmidt rank of a particular pure state constructed from the given state. Numerically tractable upper and lower bounds on this rank are also obtained. As an application, we consider the exact compression of quantum channels. This method enables the analysis of a post-processing step that reduces the output dimensions while retaining the information contained in the original channel's output.

Title: Geometric measures of CHSH quantum nonlocality: characterization, quantification, and comparison by distances and operations
Authors: Gennaro Zanfardino, Wojciech Roga, Masahiro Takeoka, Fabrizio Illuminati
Abstract: We introduce a geometric framework for analyzing Bell nonlocality in Hilbert space, aiming to provide intrinsic measures of nonlocality based solely on the properties of quantum states for a given Bell inequality. Recognizing that nonlocality is inherently measurement-dependent, our approach focuses on fixing a specific Bell scenario, that is, a chosen number of measurements and outcomes per party, along with a specific Bell inequality and, for each quantum state, maximizing the violation over all possible measurement choices within the given scenario. We then characterize the geometry of the corresponding set of local states, defined as those states for which no violation occurs for any choice of measurements. Within this framework, we define geometric and entropic measures of non-locality based on the distance of a given quantum state from the set of local states, using quantities such as trace distance, Hilbert-Schmidt distance, and relative entropy. We first establish the general formalism, emphasizing the challenges posed by the NP-hardness of characterizing local sets for arbitrary Bell scenarios. We then specialize to the case of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality in two-qubit systems, where the local set is fully characterized and an explicit geometric analysis is possible. In this setting, we derive geometric measures of nonlocality for Bell-diagonal and Werner states, showing that the closest local state to a Werner state remains a Werner state, and similarly for Bell-diagonal states. For each quantum states, our results offer a metric-based characterization of Bell nonlocality that is independent of specific experimental implementations and naturally extend to different Bell scenarios when the corresponding set of local states is known.

Title: Computable and Faithful Lower Bound on Entanglement Cost
Authors: Xin Wang, Mingrui Jing, Chengkai Zhu
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing the generalized divergence of $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are non-PPT (NPT), establishing their faithfulness for the resource theory of NPT entanglement. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of quantum states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.

Title: Mollow-like triplets in ultra-fast resonant absorption
Authors: Axel Stenquist, Felipe Zapata, Edvin Olofsson, Yijie Liao, Elna Svegborn, Jakob Nicolai Bruhnke, Claudio Verdozzi, Jan Marcus DahlstrÃ¶m
Abstract: We show that resonant absorption of smooth laser fields can yield Mollow-like triplet patterns. General conditions for such triplets are derived and illustrated with a super-Gaussian pulse sequence. Gaussian pulses can not exhibit triplets, super-Gaussian pulses can form triplets depending on the pulse area and flat-top pulses can produce absorption triplets after one Rabi cycle. Our results are compared side-by-side with resonance fluorescence to emphasize similarities and differences between these unlike observables. In the high-intensity limit, we show that the central absorption peak is asymmetric, which we attribute to non-linear photoionization, beyond two-level atomic physics.

Title: Non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation in split-index matrix product states
Authors: David T. Stephen
Abstract: We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries including anomalous symmetries, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing quantum teleportation and constrained spin chains.

Title: Topological, multi-mode amplification induced by non-reciprocal, long-range dissipative couplings
Authors: Carlos Vega, Alberto MuÃ±oz de las Heras, Diego Porras, Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez-Tudela
Abstract: Non-reciprocal couplings or drivings are known to induce steady-state, directional, amplification in driven-dissipative bosonic lattices. This amplification phenomenon has been recently linked to the existence of a non-zero topological invariant defined with the system's dynamical matrix, and thus, it depends critically on the couplings' structure. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional, non-reciprocal, long-range dissipative couplings induced by the interaction of the bosonic chain with a chiral, multimode channel, and then study their impact on topological amplification phenomena. We show that these couplings can lead to topological invariant values greater than one which induce topological, multimode amplification and metastability behaviour. Besides, we also show how these couplings can also display topological amplifying phases that are dynamically stable in the presence of local parametric drivings. Finally, we conclude by showing how such phenomena can be naturally obtained in two-dimensional topological insulators hosting multiple edge modes.

Title: Random sampling of permutations through quantum circuits
Authors: Bibhas Adhikari
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a classical algorithm for random sampling of permutations, drawing inspiration from the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm. Our approach takes a comprehensive view of permutation sampling by expressing them as products of adjacent transpositions. Building on this, we develop a quantum analogue of the classical algorithm using a quantum circuit model for random sampling of permutations. As an application, we present a quantum algorithm for the two-sample randomization test to assess the difference of means in classical data. Finally, we propose a nested corona product graph generative model for symmetric groups, which facilitates random sampling of permutations from specific sets of permutations through a quantum circuit model.

Title: Scrambling in the Charging of Quantum Batteries
Authors: SebastiÃ¡n V. Romero, Yongcheng Ding, Xi Chen, Yue Ban
Abstract: Exponentially fast scrambling of an initial state characterizes quantum chaotic systems. Given the importance of quickly populating higher energy levels from low-energy states in quantum battery charging protocols, this work investigates the role of quantum scrambling in quantum batteries and its effect on optimal power and charging times by means of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, a maximally-chaotic black hole physics model that has been recently proposed as a quantum battery. We adopt a bare representation with normalized bandwidths to suppress system energy dependence. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth exploration of quantum scrambling in the context of quantum batteries. By analyzing the dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators, our findings indicate that quantum scrambling does not necessarily lead to faster charging, despite its potential for accelerating the process.

Title: State learning from pairs of states
Authors: Pranjal Agarwal, Nada Ali, Camilla Polvara, Martin IsbjÃ¶rn Trappe, Berthold-Georg Englert, Mark Hillery
Abstract: Suppose you receive a sequence of qubits where each qubit is guaranteed to be in one of two pure states, but you do not know what those states are. Your task is to determine the states. This can be viewed as a kind of quantum state learning -- or quantum state estimation. A problem is that, without more information, all that can be determined is the density matrix of the sequence and, in general, density matrices can be decomposed into pure states in many different ways. To solve the problem, additional information, either classical or quantum, is required. We show that if an additional copy of each qubit is supplied -- that is, one receives pairs of qubits, both in the same state, rather than single qubits -- the task can be accomplished. This is possible because the mixed two-qubit state has a unique decomposition into pure product states. For illustration, we simulate numerically the symmetric, informationally complete measurement of a sequence of qubit pairs and show that the unknown states and their respective probabilities of occurrence can be inferred from the data with high accuracy. Finally, we propose an experiment that employs a product measurement and can be realized with existing technology, and we demonstrate how the data tell us the states and their probabilities. We find that it is enough to detect a few thousand qubit pairs.

Title: Interplay between external driving, dissipation and collective effects in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes
Authors: Roie Dann
Abstract: Understanding how external driving and dissipation jointly influence the dynamics of open quantum systems is essential for advancing the study of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena and developing quantum technologies. The present study addresses the issue by exploring the behavior of open systems in driven optical setups coupled to a bosonic field. Starting from an exact non-Markovian master equation for linear systems, we extend the analysis to an ensemble of quantum emitters and validate the proposed solution. The analytical results unveil a range of intriguing phenomena, including pronounced non-Markovian corrections to the coherent driving and a collective cross-driving effect. These effects are experimentally accessible in platforms such as cavity QED, photonic crystals, and state-dependent optical lattices. In the Markovian limit, comparison with exact solutions reveal short-time non-Markovian effects that endure well beyond the environmental correlation decay time, alongside memory effects triggered by short laser pulses. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of driven open systems, laying the groundwork for precise quantum state control.

Title: Experimental single-copy distillation of quantumness from higher-dimensional entanglement
Authors: Xiao-Xu Fang, Gelo Noel M. Tabia, Kai-Siang Chen, Yeong-Cherng Liang, He Lu
Abstract: Entanglement is at the heart of quantum theory and is responsible for various quantum-enabling technologies. In practice, during its preparation, storage, and distribution to the intended recipients, this valuable quantum resource may suffer from noisy interactions that reduce its usefulness for the desired information-processing tasks. Conventional schemes of entanglement distillation aim to alleviate this problem by performing collective operations on multiple copies of these decohered states and sacrificing some of them to recover Bell pairs. However, for this scheme to work, the states to be distilled should already contain a large enough fraction of maximally entangled states before these collective operations. Not all entangled quantum states meet this premise. Here, by using the paradigmatic family of two-qutrit Werner states as an exemplifying example, we experimentally demonstrate how one may use single-copy local filtering operations to meet this requirement and to recover the quantumness hidden in these higher-dimensional states. Among others, our results provide the first proof-of-principle experimental certification of the Bell-nonlocal properties of these intriguing entangled states, the activation of their usefulness for quantum teleportation, dense coding, and an enhancement of their quantum steerability, and hence usefulness for certain discrimination tasks. Our theoretically established lower bounds on the steering robustness of these states, when they admit a symmetric quasiextension or a bosonic symmetric extension, and when they show hidden dense-codability may also be of independent interest.

Title: A Quantum Annealing Protocol to Solve the Nuclear Shell Model
Authors: Emanuele Costa, Axel Perez-Obiol, Javier Menendez, Arnau Rios, Artur Garcia-Saez, Bruno Julia-Diaz
Abstract: The nuclear shell model accurately describes the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei. However, the exponential scaling of the basis size with the number of degrees of freedom hampers a direct numerical solution for heavy nuclei. In this work, we present a quantum annealing protocol to obtain nuclear ground states. We propose a tailored driver Hamiltonian that preserves a large gap and validate our approach in a dozen nuclei with basis sizes up to $10^5$ using classical simulations of the annealing evolution. We explore the relation between the spectral gap and the total time of the annealing protocol, assessing its accuracy by comparing the fidelity and energy relative error to classical benchmarks. While the nuclear Hamiltonian is non-local and thus challenging to implement in current setups, the estimated computational cost of our annealing protocol on quantum circuits is polynomial in the single particle basis size, paving the way to study heavier nuclei.

Title: Data Efficient Prediction of excited-state properties using Quantum Neural Networks
Authors: Manuel HagelÃ¼ken, Marco F. Huber, Marco Roth
Abstract: Understanding the properties of excited states of complex molecules is crucial for many chemical and physical processes. Calculating these properties is often significantly more resource-intensive than calculating their ground state counterparts. We present a quantum machine learning model that predicts excited-state properties from the molecular ground state for different geometric configurations. The model comprises a symmetry-invariant quantum neural network and a conventional neural network and is able to provide accurate predictions with only a few training data points. The proposed procedure is fully NISQ compatible. This is achieved by using a quantum circuit that requires a number of parameters linearly proportional to the number of molecular orbitals, along with a parameterized measurement observable, thereby reducing the number of necessary measurements. We benchmark the algorithm on three different molecules with three different system sizes: $H_2$ with four orbitals, LiH with five orbitals, and $H_4$ with six orbitals. For these molecules, we predict the excited state transition energies and transition dipole moments. We show that, in many cases, the procedure is able to outperform various classical models (support vector machines, Gaussian processes, and neural networks) that rely solely on classical features, by up to two orders of magnitude in the test mean squared error.

Title: Streamlined Krylov construction and classification of ergodic Floquet systems
Authors: Nikita Kolganov, Dmitrii A. Trunin
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.

Title: Quantum Error Correction Without Encoding via the Circulant Structure of Pauli Noise and the Fast Fourier Transform
Authors: Alvin Gonzales
Abstract: This work introduces distribution error correction (DEC) theory, where we correct the output distribution of a quantum computer to the ideal distribution exactly. If the noise affecting the circuit is a Pauli channel, the ideal output distribution and noisy distribution in the standard basis are related by a stochastic matrix. We prove that this matrix has a recursive 2 by 2 block circulant structure. Thus, the noisy output distribution can be corrected to the ideal output distribution via a Fast Fourier Transform. Therefore, DEC for Pauli error channels does not require encoding of the logical qubits into more physical qubits and it avoids the encoding overhead of standard quantum error correction codes. Moreover, we introduce a DEC implementation that requires executions of only 2 logical circuits. The approach is tested with quantum hardware executions consisting of 20-qubit and 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, 5-qubit Grover, 6-qubit and 10-qubit quantum phase estimation, and 10-qubit and 20-qubit Dicke state preparation circuits. The correction process dramatically improves the accuracies of the output distributions for all demonstrations. For 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, a corrected distribution fidelity of 97.7% is achieved from an initial raw fidelity of 23.2%.

Abstract: The use of the vacuum projector $|0 \rangle \langle 0| $ and of the unitary Weyl operators enables us to construct a set of Hermitian dichotomic operators in relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory in Minkowski spacetime. Employing test functions supported in diamond regions, both Bell and Mermin inequalities are studied by means of a numerical setup. In addition to reporting expressive violations of both inequalities, the cluster property is also checked.

Title: Nonreciprocal interactions induce frequency shifts in superradiant lasers
Authors: Tobias Nadolny, Matteo Brunelli, Christoph Bruder
Abstract: Superradiant lasers, which consist of incoherently driven atoms coupled to a lossy cavity, are a promising source of coherent light due to their stable frequency and superior narrow linewidth. We show that when a fraction of the atoms is not driven, a shift in the lasing frequency and a broadening of the linewidth occur, limiting the performance of a superradiant laser. We explain this behavior by identifying nonreciprocal interactions between driven and undriven atoms, i.e., competing alignment and antialignment of their dipoles. Our results have implications for the realization of superradiant lasers, establishing the relevance of nonreciprocal phenomena for quantum technologies.

Authors: Donghoon Ha, Jeong San Kim
Abstract: We consider bipartite quantum state discrimination and present a quantum data-hiding scheme utilizing an orthogonal separable state ensemble. Using a bound on local minimum-error discrimination, we provide a sufficient condition for the separable state ensemble to be used in constructing a quantum data-hiding scheme. Our results are illustrated with various examples in bipartite quantum systems. As our scheme employs separable states of low-dimensional quantum systems, it becomes more feasible for practical implementation.

Harvey Moseleley Jr., Robert J. Schoelkopf
Abstract: For useful quantum computation, error-corrected machines are required that can dramatically reduce the inevitable errors experienced by physical qubits. While significant progress has been made in approaching and exceeding the surface-code threshold in superconducting platforms, large gains in the logical error rate with increasing system size remain out of reach. This is due both to the large number of required physical qubits and the need to operate far below threshold. Importantly, by exploiting the biases and structure of the physical errors, this threshold can be raised. Erasure qubits achieve this by detecting certain errors at the hardware level. Dual-rail qubits encoded in superconducting cavities are a promising erasure qubit wherein the dominant error, photon loss, can be detected and converted to an erasure. In these approaches, the complete set of operations, including two qubit gates, must be high performance and preserve as much of the desirable hierarchy or bias in the errors as possible. Here, we design and realize a novel two-qubit gate for dual-rail erasure qubits based on superconducting microwave cavities. The gate is high-speed ($\sim$500 ns duration), and yields a residual gate infidelity after error detection below 0.1%. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that this gate largely preserves the favorable error structure of idling dual-rail qubits, making it ideal for error correction. We measure low erasure rates of $\sim$0.5% per gate, as well as low and asymmetric dephasing errors that occur at least three times more frequently on control qubits compared to target qubits. Bit-flip errors are practically nonexistent, bounded at the few parts per million level. This error asymmetry has not been well explored but is extremely useful in quantum error correction and flag-qubit contexts, where it can create a faster path to effective error-corrected systems.

Title: Quantum Max d-Cut via qudit swap operators
Authors: Igor Klep, Tea Å trekelj, Jurij VolÄiÄ
Abstract: Quantum Max Cut (QMC) problem for systems of qubits is an example of a 2-local Hamiltonian problem, and a prominent paradigm in computational complexity theory. This paper investigates the algebraic structure of a higher-dimensional analog of the QMC problem for systems of qudits. The Quantum Max d-Cut (d-QMC) problem asks for the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian on a graph with n vertices whose edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb C^d)^{\otimes n}$. The algebra generated by the swap operators is identified as a quotient of a free algebra modulo symmetric group relations and a single additional relation of degree d. This presentation leads to a tailored hierarchy of semidefinite programs, leveraging noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) methods, that converges to the solution of the d-QMC problem. For complete bipartite graphs, exact solutions for the d-QMC problem are derived using the representation theory of symmetric groups and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. This in particular includes the d-QMC problem for clique and star graphs on n vertices, for all d and n. Lastly, the paper addresses a refined d-QMC problem focused on finding the largest eigenvalue within each isotypic component (irreducible block) of the graph Hamiltonian. It is shown that the spectrum of the star graph Hamiltonian distinguishes between isotypic components of the 3-QMC problem. For general d, low-degree relations for separating isotypic components are presented, enabling adaptation of the global NPO hierarchy to efficiently compute the largest eigenvalue in each isotypic component.

Title: Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Quantum Annealing
Authors: Alessia Ciacco, Francesca Guerriero, Eneko Osaba
Abstract: The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes, which are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that can be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the total travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum approach to address it. Specifically, we employ quantum annealing using D-Wave's hardware to explore its potential for solving this problem. To enhance computational feasibility, we develop a preprocessing method that effectively reduces the network size. Our experimental results demonstrate that this reduction technique significantly decreases the problem complexity, making the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, the standard input for quantum annealers, better suited for existing quantum hardware. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential of quantum annealing as a promising and innovative approach for solving the STSP.

Title: Compact Circuits for Constrained Quantum Evolutions of Sparse Operators
Authors: Franz G. Fuchs, Ruben P. Bassa
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing compact quantum circuits that implement the real-time evolution of Hamiltonians of the form $H = \sigma P_B$, where $\sigma$ is a Pauli string commuting with a projection operator $P_B$ onto a subspace of the computational basis. Such Hamiltonians frequently arise in quantum algorithms, including constrained mixers in QAOA, fermionic and excitation operators in VQE, and lattice gauge theory applications. Additionally, we construct transposition gates, widely used in quantum computing, that scale more efficiently than the best known constructions in literature. Our method emphasizes the minimization of non-transversal gates, particularly T-gates, critical for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We construct circuits requiring $\mathcal{O}(n|B|)$ CX gates and $\mathcal{O}(n |B| + \log(|B|) \log (1/\epsilon))$ T-gates, where $n$ is the number of qubits, $|B|$ the dimension of the projected subspace, and $\epsilon$ the desired approximation precision. For group-generated subspaces, we further reduce complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n \log |B|)$ CX gates and $\mathcal{O}(n+\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ T gates. Our constructive proofs yield explicit algorithms and include several applications, such as improved transposition circuits, efficient implementations of fermionic excitations, and oracle operators for combinatorial optimization. In the sparse case, i.e. when $|B|$ is small, the proposed algorithms scale favourably when compared to direct Pauli evolution.

Title: Wafer-Scale Characterization of Al/AlxOy/Al Josephson Junctions at Room Temperature

Pereira (1), Christoph Kutter (1 and 2) ((1) Fraunhofer Institut fuer Elektronische Mikrosysteme und Festkoerpertechnologien EMFT, Munich, Germany, (2) Center Integrated Sensor Systems (SENS), Universitaet der Bundeswehr Muenchen, Munich, Germany, (3) Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany)
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state

Title: Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics
Authors: Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk
Abstract: The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\{O_m \}_{m\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\{O_m \}_{m\ge n}$ for $n\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis'--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.

Title: Interpreting Multipartite Entanglement through Topological Summaries
Authors: Raghav Banka, Matthew Hagan, Nathan Wiebe
Abstract: The study of multipartite entanglement is much less developed than the bipartite scenario. Recently, a string of results have proposed using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to attach topological quantities to multipartite states. However, these quantities are not directly connected to concrete information processing tasks making their interpretations vague. We take the first steps in connecting these abstract topological quantities to operational interpretations of entanglement in two scenarios. The first is we provide a bound on the Integrated Euler Characteristic defined by Hamilton and Leditzky via an average distillable entanglement, which we develop as a generalization of the Meyer-Wallach entanglement measure studied by A. J. Scott in 2004. This allows us to connect the distance of an error correcting code to the Integrated Euler Characteristic. The second is we provide a characterization of a class of graph states containing the GHZ state via the birth and death times of the connected components and 1-dimensional cycles of the entanglement complex. In other words, the entanglement distance behavior of the first Betti number $\beta_1(\varepsilon)$ allows us to determine if a state is locally equivalent to a GHZ state, potentially providing new verification schemes for highly entangled states.

Title: Quantum Feature Space of a Qubit Coupled to an Arbitrary Bath
Authors: Chris Wise, Akram Youssry, Alberto Peruzzo, Jo Plested, Matt Woolley
Abstract: Qubit control protocols have traditionally leveraged a characterisation of the qubit-bath coupling via its power spectral density. Previous work proposed the inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical bath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with physics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges in scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural networks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an efficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the \textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled bath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature space provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the presence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the input space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this case), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the broad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how control pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space.

Title: Machine Learning Cryptanalysis of a Quantum Random Number Generator
Authors: Nhan Duy Truong, Jing Yan Haw, Syed Muhamad Assad, Ping Koy Lam, Omid Kavehei
Abstract: Random number generators (RNGs) that are crucial for cryptographic applications have been the subject of adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit environmental information to predict generated random numbers that are supposed to be truly random and unpredictable. Though quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are based on the intrinsic indeterministic nature of quantum properties, the presence of classical noise in the measurement process compromises the integrity of a QRNG. In this paper, we develop a predictive machine learning (ML) analysis to investigate the impact of deterministic classical noise in different stages of an optical continuous variable QRNG. Our ML model successfully detects inherent correlations when the deterministic noise sources are prominent. After appropriate filtering and randomness extraction processes are introduced, our QRNG system, in turn, demonstrates its robustness against ML. We further demonstrate the robustness of our ML approach by applying it to uniformly distributed random numbers from the QRNG and a congruential RNG. Hence, our result shows that ML has potentials in benchmarking the quality of RNG devices.

Title: The Geometry of Time in Topological Quantum Gravity of the Ricci Flow
Authors: Alexander Frenkel, Petr Horava, Stephen Randall
Abstract: We continue the study of topological nonrelativistic quantum gravity associated with a family of Ricci flow equations on Riemannian manifolds. This topological gravity is of the cohomological type, and it exhibits an ${\cal N}=2$ extended BRST symmetry. In our previous work, we constructed this theory in a two-step procedure in the appropriate nonrelativistic ${\cal N}=2$ superspace, first presenting a topological theory of the spatial metric $g_{ij}$, and then adding the superspace versions of the lapse and shift variables $n$ and $n^i$ while gauging the symmetries of foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms. In the relation to Perelman's theory of the Ricci flow, the role of Perelman's dilaton is played by our nonprojectable lapse. Here we demonstrate that this construction is equivalent to a standard one-step BRST gauge-fixing of a theory whose fields are $g_{ij}$, $n^i$ and $n$, and whose gauge symmetries consist of (i) the topological deformations of $g_{ij}$, and (ii) the ultralocal nonrelativistic limit of spacetime diffeomorphisms. The supercharge $Q$ of our superspace construction plays the role of the BRST charge. The spacetime diffeomorphism symmetries appear in an interestingly "shifted" form, which may be of broader interest for nonrelativistic quantum gravity outside of the present topological context. In contrast to the foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms, the gauge symmetries identified in this paper act nonprojectably on time, making it clear that this theory has no local propagating degrees of freedom. We point out an intriguing dual interpretation of the same theory, as a gauge fixing of a dual copy of ultralocal spacetime diffeomorphisms, with the role of ghosts and antighosts interchanged and the second supercharge $\bar Q$ of the ${\cal N}=2$ superalgebra playing the role of the BRST charge in the dual picture.

Title: Topological materials with extensive flat-band surface states
Authors: Protyush Nandi, Subinay Dasgupta
Abstract: Materials that have zero-energy flat band states on the surface are likely to show surface superconductivity. Here we report a theoretical observation that a Hamiltonian describing a thin slab of topological nodal line semimetal, has zero energy eigenstate spanning the entire surface under certain conditions, namely (i) the hopping probability of fermions in the direction of thickness is more than that in other directions (ii) the onsite interaction should be less than some limiting value determined by the hopping probability. Our claim is substantiated by analytic and numerical approach. We also report new phase transitions in a region of parameter space and indicate that the Hamiltonian can also be realised by stacked layers described by Kitaev model on honeycomb lattice.

Title: Silicon Double-Disk Optomechanical Resonators from Wafer-Scale Double-Layered Silicon-on-Insulator
Authors: Amy Navarathna, Benjamin J. Carey, James S. Bennett, Soroush Khademi, Warwick P. Bowen
Abstract: Whispering gallery mode (WGM) optomechanical resonators are a promising technology for the simultaneous control and measurement of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom at the nanoscale. They offer potential for use across a wide range of applications such as sensors and quantum transducers. Double-disk WGM resonators, which host strongly interacting mechanical and optical modes co-localized around their circumference, are particularly attractive due to their high optomechanical coupling. Large-scale integrated fabrication of silicon double-disk WGM resonators has not previously been demonstrated. In this work we present a process for the fabrication of double-layer silicon-on-insulator wafers, which we then use to fabricate functional optomechanical double silicon disk resonators with on-chip optical coupling. The integrated devices present an experimentally observed optical quality factors of the order of 10^5 and a single-photon optomechanical coupling of approximately 15 kHz.

Title: The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi "Gravity from entropy", Phys. Rev. D (2025) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling, small curvature limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.

Abstract: We report the observation of Dirac-Landau polaritons via THz magnetoreflectivity spectroscopy, demonstrating strong coupling between cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells and optical cavity modes. We demonstrate efficient nonlinear electroluminescence, characterized by a strongly out-of-equilibrium polariton distribution dominated by emission from the upper polariton branches. Model calculations, based on the nonlinear dependence of the emission intensity and spectral narrowing with bias voltage, indicate a polariton occupancy per mode close to unity, with a significant contribution from stimulated polariton emission. These findings open promising prospects for the development of Dirac-Landau polariton condensates and low-threshold, tunable terahertz polariton lasers based on cyclotron emission.

Title: Correlated vibration-solvent and Duschinsky effects on electron transfer dynamics and optical spectroscopy
Authors: Zi-Fan Zhu, Yu Su, Yao Wang, Rui-Xue Xu, YiJing Yan
Abstract: Understanding the effects of vibrations in electron transfer (ET) dynamics and optical spectroscopies is essential to precisely interpret the role of decoherence, especially for systems embedded in solvents. In this work, we study the correlated Duschinsky and solvent effects on ET and spectroscopy. Exploited is a novel extended dissipaton-equation-of motion (ext-DEOM) approach, which is an exact and non-Markovian, non-perturbative method for quadratic system-bath couplings. The unified bath description, in terms of multiple Brownian oscillators (BOs), comprises the solvent modes and also intramolecular vibrations. Both ET dynamics and spectroscopy show the complex interplay among linear displacements, frequency shifts, Duschinsky rotations and solvent-induced BO-mode correlations. The reduced ET system density operator evolution is further analyzed in the context of Bloch sphere representation that is basis-set independent due to its geometric nature.

Title: Probing the Quantum Capacitance of Rydberg Transitions of Surface Electrons on Liquid Helium via Microwave Frequency Modulation
Authors: Asher Jennings, Ivan Grytsenko, Yiran Tian, Oleksiy Rybalko, Jun Wang, Itay Josef Barabash, Erika Kawakami
Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry. Resonant microwave excitation of the Rydberg transition induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance originating from adiabatic state transitions and the finite curvature of the energy bands. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.34~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for our RF reflectometry scheme. This sensitivity is sufficient to detect the Rydberg transition of a single electron, offering a scalable pathway toward qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.

Title: Categorifying Clifford QCA
Authors: Bowen Yang
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. Notably, because the Pedersen--Weibel category depends only on the large-scale (coarse) structure of the metric space, so too does the classification of Clifford QCAs. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework.

Title: Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories
Authors: Alexey Golovnev, Kirill Russkov
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.
