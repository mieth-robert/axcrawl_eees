Title: Experimental Decoding Scrambled Quantum Information from the Future
Authors: Yi-Te Huang, Siang-Wei Huang, Jhen-Dong Lin, Adam Miranowicz, Neill Lambert, Franco Nori, Yueh-Nan Chen
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling describes the rapid spread of initially localized information across an entire quantum many-body system through entanglement generation. Once scrambled, the original local information becomes encoded globally, inaccessible from any single subsystem. In this work, we introduce a protocol that enables information scrambling into the past, allowing decoding even before the original information is generated. This protocol is achieved by simulating a closed timelike curve (a theoretical construct in which particles can traverse backward in time) using probabilistic methods. Remarkably, we find that stronger scrambling dynamics enhance the fidelity of the decoding process. We further present a quantum circuit design and experimentally implement our protocol on cloud-based Quantinuum and IBM quantum computers. Our approach illuminates a unique quantum task: retrieving information encoded in the future without altering the past.

Title: Near-Optimal Parameter Tuning of Level-1 QAOA for Ising Models
Authors: V Vijendran, Dax Enshan Koh, Eunok Bae, Hyukjoon Kwon, Ping Koy Lam, Syed M Assad
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. QAOA encodes solutions into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, approximated by a $p$-level parameterised quantum circuit composed of problem and mixer Hamiltonians, with parameters optimised classically. While deeper QAOA circuits can offer greater accuracy, practical applications are constrained by complex parameter optimisation and physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement errors, limiting implementations to shallow depths. This work focuses on QAOA$_1$ (QAOA at $p=1$) for QUBO problems, represented as Ising models. Despite QAOA$_1$ having only two parameters, $(\gamma, \beta)$, we show that their optimisation is challenging due to a highly oscillatory landscape, with oscillation rates increasing with the problem size, density, and weight. This behaviour necessitates high-resolution grid searches to avoid distortion of cost landscapes that may result in inaccurate minima. We propose an efficient optimisation strategy that reduces the two-dimensional $(\gamma, \beta)$ search to a one-dimensional search over $\gamma$, with $\beta^*$ computed analytically. We establish the maximum permissible sampling period required to accurately map the $\gamma$ landscape and provide an algorithm to estimate the optimal parameters in polynomial time. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that for regular graphs on average, the globally optimal $\gamma^* \in \mathbb{R}^+$ values are concentrated very close to zero and coincide with the first local optimum, enabling gradient descent to replace exhaustive line searches. This approach is validated using Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), where it consistently outperforms both coarsely optimised RQAOA and semidefinite programs across all tested QUBO instances.

Title: Viewing fluxonium through the lens of the cat qubit
Authors: Simon Lieu, Emma L. Rosenfeld, Kyungjoo Noh, Connor T. Hann
Abstract: We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge), and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in $E_j/(k_B T)$, while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in $\cos(2 \theta)$ qubits. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.

Title: Taming quantum systems: A tutorial for using shortcuts-to-adiabaticity, quantum optimal control, and reinforcement learning
Authors: Callum W. Duncan, Pablo M. Poggi, Marin Bukov, Nikolaj Thomas Zinner, Steve Campbell
Abstract: Precise manipulation of quantum effects at the atomic and nanoscale has become an essential task in ongoing scientific and technological endeavours. Quantum control methods are thus routinely exploited for research in areas such as quantum materials, quantum chemistry, and atomic and molecular physics, as well as in the development of quantum technologies like computing, simulation, and sensing. Here, we present a pedagogical introduction to the basics of quantum control methods in tutorial form, with the aim of providing newcomers to the field with the core concepts and practical tools to use these methods in their research. We focus on three areas: shortcuts to adiabaticity, quantum optimal control, and machine-learning-based control. We lay out the basic theoretical elements of each area in a pedagogical way and describe their application to a series of example cases. For these, we include detailed analytical derivations as well as extensive numerical results. As an outlook, we discuss quantum control methods in the broader context of quantum technologies development and complex quantum systems research, outlining potential connections and synergies between them.

Title: Optical Nuclear Electric Resonance in LiNa: Selective Addressing of Nuclear Spins Through Pulsed Lasers
Authors: Johannes K. Krondorfer, Matthias Diez, Andreas W. Hauser
Abstract: Optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER), a recently proposed protocol for nuclear spin manipulation in atomic systems via short laser pulses with MHz repetition rate, exploits the coupling between the nuclear quadrupole moment of a suitable atom and the periodic modulations of the electric field gradient generated by an optically stimulated electronic excitation. In this theory paper, we extend the scope of ONER from atomic to molecular systems and show that molecular vibrations do not interfere with our protocol. Exploring the diatomic molecule LiNa as a first benchmark system, our investigation showcases the robustness with respect to molecular vibration, and the ability to address and manipulate each of the two nuclear spins independently, simply by adjusting the repetition rate of a pulsed laser. Our findings suggest that it might be possible to shift complicated spin manipulation tasks required for quantum computing into the time domain by pulse-duration encoded laser signals.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Circuit Design: Using Matrix Representations
Authors: Zhiyuan Wang, Chunlin Feng, Christopher Poon, Lijian Huang, Xingjian Zhao, Yao Ma, Tianfan Fu, Xiao-Yang Liu
Abstract: Quantum computing promises advantages over classical computing. The manufacturing of quantum hardware is in the infancy stage, called the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. A major challenge is automated quantum circuit design that map a quantum circuit to gates in a universal gate set. In this paper, we present a generic MDP modeling and employ Q-learning and DQN algorithms for quantum circuit design. By leveraging the power of deep reinforcement learning, we aim to provide an automatic and scalable approach over traditional hand-crafted heuristic methods.

Title: Experimental demonstration of a scalable room-temperature quantum battery
Authors: Kieran Hymas, Jack B. Muir, Daniel Tibben, Joel van Embden, Tadahiko Hirai, Christopher J. Dunn, Daniel E. Gómez, James A. Hutchison, Trevor A. Smith, James Q. Quach
Abstract: Harnessing quantum phenomena in energy storage systems offers an opportunity to introduce a new generation of batteries with quantum-enhanced performance. Until now, the quantum battery has largely remained a theoretical concept, with little progress towards experimental realisation, due to the challenges in quantum coherent control. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable room-temperature quantum battery with a multi-layered organic-microcavity design. We show that it exhibits superextensive charging, metastabilisation of stored energy, and generates superextensive electrical power, the latter an unpredicted phenomenon. The combination of these properties in a single device is the first demonstration of the full cycle of a quantum battery, laying the framework for future designs.

Title: Symmetry-induced fragmentation and dissipative time crystal
Authors: Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: We propose a general protocol for engineering dissipative time crystals in quantum open systems through symmetry-induced fragmentation and ergodicity breaking. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we devise a generic Liouvillian possessing a series of non-dissipative eigenmodes with purely imaginary eigenvalues, which give rise to long-time oscillations breaking both ergodicity and time-translation symmetry. Illustrating our proposal using a dissipative lattice model, we show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. The richly structured prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model, under which excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group. The branching rules of the permutation group then dictate that the Liouvillian gaps acquired by the non-dissipative eigenmodes should be higher-order powers of the symmetry-breaking perturbation, protecting the prethermal time crystal.

Title: Analytical solutions for the quantum Brownian motion of a particle during a quantum quench
Authors: Ygor de Oliveira Souza, Caio C. Holanda Ribeiro, Vitorio A. De Lorenci
Abstract: A particle subjected to a fluctuating force originated from its interaction with an external quantum system undergoes quantum Brownian motion. This phenomenon is investigated in detail for the case of a particle confined by a harmonic potential and allowed to interact with a reservoir modeled as a continuum of oscillators, with particular emphasis on transient effects. Assuming a linear coupling between the particle and the reservoir, canonical quantization of the system is implemented, and analytical expressions for the quantum correlations are derived. These correlations are then applied to analyze energy conservation, and the particle Brownian motion is characterized from the perspective of the energy extracted from the reservoir.

Title: Criteria for optimal entanglement-assisted long baseline imaging protocols
Authors: Yujie Zhang, Thomas Jennewein
Abstract: Quantum-entanglement-assisted telescopy protocol have been proposed and studied as a means to extend the baseline of optical interferometric telescopes. However, determining the optimality of specific quantum-assisted protocols remains an open question. We introduce a new framework for systematically characterizing different entanglement-assisted telescopy protocols by integrating tools from quantum metrology with the superselection rule (SSR) established in quantum information theory. We demonstrate that the estimation of interference fringes in a quantum telescopy can be objectively quantified and compared using the quantum Fisher information under the SSR constraint. Our framework demonstrates that interference fringe estimation in quantum telescopy can be objectively evaluated and compared using the quantum Fisher information under the SSR constraint. This approach defines the fundamental limits of astronomical estimation problems with finite entanglement resources. Building on this foundation, we propose new entanglement-assisted protocols that outperform previously known methods. Moreover, we show that these protocols are compatible with linear optical technology and could inspire the development of improved quantum telescopy schemes for near-term, lossy, repeater-less quantum networks.

Title: High-fidelity QND readout and measurement back-action in a Tantalum-based high-coherence fluxonium qubit
Authors: Gaurav Bothara, Srijita Das, Kishor V Salunkhe, Madhavi Chand, Jay Deshmukh, Meghan P Patankar, R Vijay
Abstract: Implementing a precise measurement of the quantum state of a qubit is very critical for building a practical quantum processor as it plays an important role in state initialization and quantum error correction. While the transmon qubit has been the most commonly used design in small to medium-scale processors, the fluxonium qubit is emerging as a strong alternative with the potential for high-fidelity gate operation as a result of the high anharmonicity and high coherence achievable due to its unique design. Here, we explore the measurement characteristics of a tantalum-based high-coherence fluxonium qubit and demonstrate single-shot measurement fidelity (assignment fidelity) of 96.2% and 97.8% without and with the use of a Josephson Parametric Amplifier respectively. We study the back-action of the measurement photons on the qubit and measure a QND (repeatability) fidelity of 99.6%. We find that the measurement fidelity and QND nature are limited by state-mixing errors and our results suggest that a careful study of measurement-induced transitions in the fluxonium is needed to further optimize the readout performance.

Title: Photon statistics of time dependent electronic excitation of spin injected quantum dots
Authors: Chiran Wijesundara, Jeffrey Carvalho, Yuan Lu, Tim Thomay
Abstract: The time dynamics of spin-injected, electrically contacted quantum dots were investigated with a focus on the time evolution of photon statistics. Photon statistics can provide insights into whether the device functions as an effective single-photon emitter or exhibits higher-order emissions. Through these investigations, we found that the shape of the electrical excitation pulse has a direct impact on photon statistics. Specifically, the rising edge of the pulse corresponds to a significantly higher number of higher-order photon states, which decay much faster than single photons associated with the falling edge of the electrical pulse. This relationship implies that the pulse shape can be tailored to optimize the device as either a better single-photon source or a generator of higher-order photon states, with potential applications in creating deterministic higher-order photon Fock states. The ability to easily modify the pulse shape is a unique feature of electrically excited quantum dots.

Title: Tunable quantum light by modulated free electrons
Authors: Valerio Di Giulio, Rudolf Haindl, Claus Ropers
Abstract: Nonclassical states of light are fundamental in various applications, spanning quantum computation to enhanced sensing. Fast free electrons, which emit light into photonic structures through the mechanism of spontaneous emission, represent a promising platform for generating diverse types of states. Indeed, the intrinsic connection between the input electron wave function and the output light field suggests that electron-shaping schemes, based on light-induced scattering, facilitates their synthesis. In this article, we present a theoretical framework capable of predicting the final optical density matrix of a generic N-electron state that can also account for post-sample energy filtering. By using such framework, we study the modulation-dependent fluctuations of the N-electron emission and identify regions of Poissonian and super-Poissonian statistics. In the single-electron case, we show how coherent states with nearly 90% purity can be formed by pre-filtering a portion of the spectrum after modulation, and how non-Gaussian states are generated after a precise energy measurement. Furthermore, we present a strategy combining a single-stage electron modulation and post-filtering to harness tailored light states, such as squeezed vacuum, cat, and triangular cat states, with fidelity close to 100%.

Title: Designing Minimalistic Variational Quantum Ansatz Inspired by Algorithmic Cooling
Authors: Soyoung Shin, Ha Eum Kim, Hyeonjun Yeo, Kabgyun Jeong, Wonho Jhe, Jaewan Kim
Abstract: This study introduces a novel minimalistic variational quantum ansatz inspired by algorithmic cooling principles. The proposed Heat Exchange algorithmic cooling ansatz (HE ansatz) facilitates efficient population redistribution without requiring bath resets, simplifying implementation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The HE ansatz achieves superior approximation ratios with the complete network \textsc{Maxcut} optimization problem compared to the conventional Hardware efficient and QAOA ansatz. We also proposed a new variational algorithm that utilize HE ansatz to compute the ground state of impure dissipative-system variational quantum eigensolver (dVQE) which achieved a sub-$1\%$ error in ground-state energy calculations of the 1D Heisenberg chain with impurity and successfully simulates the edge effect of impure spin chain, highlighting its potential for applications in quantum many-body physics. These results underscore the compatibility of the ansatz with hardware-efficient implementations, offering a scalable approach for solving complex quantum problems in disordered and open quantum systems.

Title: Quantum dynamics at finite temperature: Time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: Ivan P. Christov
Abstract: In this work we investigate the ground state and the dissipative quantum dynamics of interacting charged particles in an external potential at finite temperature. The recently devised time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method allows a self-consistent treatment of the system of particles together with bath oscillators first for imaginary-time propagation of Schroedinger type of equations where both the system and the bath converge to their finite temperature ground state, and next for real time calculation where the dissipative dynamics is demonstrated. In that context the application of TDQMC appears as promising alternative to the path-integral related techniques where the real time propagation can be a challenge.

Title: Entanglement-based clock syntonization for quantum key distribution networks. Demonstration over a 50 km-long link
Authors: Yoann Pelet, Grégory Sauder, Sébastien Tanzilli, Olivier Alibart, Anthony Martin
Abstract: We present the implementation of a time synchronization protocol as part of an experimentally deployed entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) link. The system is deployed over 48 km of optical fibers across the Métropole Côte d'Azur and enables secret cryptographic key exchange between two remote users, with an average rate of 7 kbps. We exploit the time correlation of paired photons generated by a high-quality source of energy-time entanglement implemented in the QKD link to synchronize two rubidium clocks located at the end stations. The level of stability achieved guarantees a time offset between the clocks under 12 ps at all time. We also show that this protocol requires less hardware than a typical synchronization protocol for QKD that would distribute a reference clock signal between the users.

Title: Electron dynamics induced by quantum cat-state light
Authors: Shohei Imai, Atsushi Ono, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We present an effective theory for describing electron dynamics driven by an optical external field in a Schrödinger's cat state. We show that the electron density matrix evolves as an average over trajectories $\{\rho_\alpha\}$ weighted by the Sudarshan--Glauber $P$ distribution $P(\alpha)$ in the weak light--matter coupling regime. Each trajectory obeys an equation of motion, $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho_\alpha=\mathcal{H}_{\alpha} \rho_\alpha-\rho_\alpha\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$, where an effective Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$ becomes non-Hermitian due to quantum interference of light. The optical quantum interference is transferred to electrons through the asymmetric action between the ket and bra state vectors in $\rho_{\alpha}$. This non-Hermitian dynamics differs from the conventional one observed in open quantum systems, described by $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho=\mathcal{H}\rho-\rho \mathcal{H}^\dagger$, which has complex conjugation in the second term. We confirm that the results of the effective theory agree with those of full electron--photon system simulations for the few-electron Dicke model, demonstrating experimental accessibility to exotic non-Hermitian dynamics.

Title: Ancilla-free Quantum Adder with Sublinear Depth
Authors: Maxime Remaud, Vivien Vandaele
Abstract: We present the first exact quantum adder with sublinear depth and no ancilla qubits. Our construction is based on classical reversible logic only and employs low-depth implementations for the CNOT ladder operator and the Toffoli ladder operator, two key components to perform ripple-carry addition. Namely, we demonstrate that any ladder of $n$ CNOT gates can be replaced by a CNOT-circuit with $O(\log n)$ depth, while maintaining a linear number of gates. We then generalize this construction to Toffoli gates and demonstrate that any ladder of $n$ Toffoli gates can be substituted with a circuit with $O(\log^2 n)$ depth while utilizing a linearithmic number of gates. This builds on the recent works of Nie et al. and Khattar and Gidney on the technique of conditionally clean ancillae. By combining these two key elements, we present a novel approach to design quantum adders that can perform the addition of two $n$-bit numbers in depth $O(\log^2 n)$ without the use of any ancilla and using classical reversible logic only (Toffoli, CNOT and X gates).

Title: Transport approach to two-qubit quantum state tomography
Authors: Jeanne Bourgeois, Gianmichele Blasi, Géraldine Haack
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a central task for quantum information processing, enabling quantum cryptography, computation, and state certification. Traditional QST relies on projective measurements of single- and two-qubit Pauli operators, requiring qubits to be isolated from environmental dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring currents and associated transport quantities flowing through a two-qubit system between two terminals biased in temperature or voltage are sufficient to perform complete QST of the open quantum system. This transport approach requires minimal knowledge of the system-environment couplings and of the parameters setting the system's dynamics, accessible in state-of-the-art solid-state experiments via spectroscopic measurements for instance. Our findings are analytical, offering comprehensive insights into the underlying processes. As a direct consequence of our approach, we are able to provide a transport-based entanglement measure to certify the presence of quantum correlations, expressing the concurrence in terms of currents and correlations functions only.

Title: Quantum XYZ cyclic codes for biased noise
Authors: Zhipeng Liang, Fusheng Yang, Zhengzhong Yi, Xuan Wang
Abstract: In some quantum computing architectures, Pauli noise is highly biased. Tailoring Quantum error-correcting codes to the biased noise may benefit reducing the physical qubit overhead without reducing the logical error rate. In this paper, we propose a family of quantum XYZ cyclic codes, which are the only one family of quantum cyclic codes with code distance increasing with code length to our best knowledge and have good error-correcting performance against biased noise. Our simulation results show that the quantum XYZ cyclic codes have $50\%$ code-capacity thresholds for all three types of pure Pauli noise and around $13\%$ code-capacity threshold for depolarizing noise. In the finite-bias regime, when the noise is biased towards Pauli $Z$ errors with noise bias ratios $\eta_Z=1000$, the corresponding code-capacity threshold is around $49\%$. Besides, we show that to reach the same code distance, the physical qubit overhead of XYZ cyclic code is much less than that of the XZZX surface code.

Title: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Activation During Pure Dephasing Evolution
Authors: Masaya Takahashi, Jarosław K. Korbicz
Abstract: We investigate the system-environment entanglement activation during pure dephasing evolution, also called controlled unitary. A lower bound of generated entanglement is formulated with the initial coherence in the system and using relative entropy measure. For a qubit-environment case, this lower becomes a closed form by replacing conditional entropy with the overlap on the states in environment. Applying this result to the spin-boson model, we illustrate how the lower bound evolves as a function of time multiplied cutoff frequency, shown plots. The different behaviors of lower bounds with respect to Ohmicity, s=2 and s=3, corresponding to Markovian and non-Markovian evolution. In addition, we show that the decoherence in the system throughout the pure dephasing evolution represents another lower bound and upper bound of generated entanglement, indicating that larger entanglement generation leads more decoherence.

Title: Space-Time-Coupled Qubits for Enhanced Superconducting Quantum Computing
Authors: Sajjad Taravati
Abstract: The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.

Title: Port-based telecloning of an unknown quantum state
Authors: Reiji Okada, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi
Abstract: Telecloning is a protocol introduced by Murao et al. to distribute copies of an unknown quantum state to many receivers in a way that beats the trivial ``clone-and-teleport'' protocol. In the last decade, a new type of teleportation called port-based teleportation, in which the receiver can recover the state without having to actively perform correction operations, but simply by looking at the correct port, has been widely studied. In this paper, we consider the analog of telecloning, where conventional teleportation is replaced by the port-based variant. To achieve this, we generalize the optimal measurement used in port-based teleportation and develop a new one that achieves port-based telecloning. Numerical results show that, in certain cases, the proposed protocol is strictly better than the trivial clone-and-teleport approach.

Title: Two-photon interference between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals scattered off a semiconductor quantum dot
Authors: Guoqi Huang, Jian Wang, Ziqi Zeng, Hanqing Liu, Li Liu, Weijie Ji, Bang Wu, Haiqiao Ni, Zhichuan Niu, Rongzhen Jiao, Davide G. Marangon, Zhiliang Yuan
Abstract: Radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) ultimately determines the bandwidth it can offer for quantum information processing. However, no prior experiment has so far been performed to examine the effect of driving detuning on indistinguishability of photons scattered off a TLE, a parameter that is crucial for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference experiments between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. Our results suggest that indistinguishability among photons scattered off a quantum dot is inherently insensitive to the driving laser's detuning, as straightforwardly predicted by the resonance fluorescence model that systematically treats all scattered photons as spontaneous emission.

Title: Programming tools for Analogue Quantum Computing in the High-Performance Computing Context -- A Review
Authors: Mateusz Meller, Vendel Szeremi, Oliver Thomson Brown
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have brought us closer to realizing the potential of this transformative technology. While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way: Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities. Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration. Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.

Title: Generative quantum combinatorial optimization by means of a novel conditional generative quantum eigensolver
Authors: Shunya Minami, Kouhei Nakaji, Yohichi Suzuki, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Tadashi Kadowaki
Abstract: Quantum computing is entering a transformative phase with the emergence of logical quantum processors, which hold the potential to tackle complex problems beyond classical capabilities. While significant progress has been made, applying quantum algorithms to real-world problems remains challenging. Hybrid quantum-classical techniques have been explored to bridge this gap, but they often face limitations in expressiveness, trainability, or scalability. In this work, we introduce conditional Generative Quantum Eigensolver (conditional-GQE), a context-aware quantum circuit generator powered by an encoder-decoder Transformer. Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we train our generator for solving problems with up to 10 qubits, exhibiting nearly perfect performance on new problems. By leveraging the high expressiveness and flexibility of classical generative models, along with an efficient preference-based training scheme, conditional-GQE provides a generalizable and scalable framework for quantum circuit generation. Our approach advances hybrid quantum-classical computing and contributes to accelerate the transition toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: How Hamilton-Jacobi formalism helps to address the physical meaning of the wave function in Bohmian mechanics
Authors: Arnaud Amblard, Aurélien Drezet
Abstract: The meaning of the wave function has been a subject of intense debate in the foundations of quantum mechanics. In Bohmian Mechanics, the prevailing view is the nomological interpretation, which regards the wave function as a nomological entity. To make this abstract notion more concrete, the wave function is often compared to the classical Hamiltonian - another high-dimensional field whose gradient determines particle motion. However, unlike the wave function, the Hamiltonian is not the solution to a differential equation. Furthermore, while the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism offers a pilot-wave formulation of classical mechanics, it has been largely overlooked in contemporary discussions about the physical meaning of the wave function. Nonetheless, in the classical limit, there is a clear mathematical connection between the quantum wave function and the guiding field in this formalism, specifically the action function S. On the basis of these mathematical parallels, we initially intended to argue that the action function is a more appropriate classical analogue of the wave function, which, when combined with a clear conceptual distinction between laws of nature and nomological entities, could strengthen the nomological interpretation. We thought it could address some of the criticisms levelled at the nomological interpretation without resorting to the speculative realm of quantum gravity. However, contrary to our initial expectations, a closer comparison of the roles played by the action function and the wave function in their respective formalisms suggests a departure from the nomological interpretation in favour of the so-called sui generis interpretation of the wave function.

We use a recently proposed variational algorithm. The systems studied are the transverse Ising model with both a purely real and a purely complex transverse field.

Title: Dephasing-induced leakage in multi-level superconducting quantum circuits
Authors: Frederick W. Strauch
Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits, such as the transmon, have multiple quantum states beyond the computational subspace. These states can be populated during quantum logic operations; residual population in such states is known as leakage. While control methods can eliminate this error in ideal systems, leakage will arise from transient population in the presence of dephasing. This dephasing-induced leakage effect is analyzed, both analytically and numerically, for common single and two-qubit operations used in transmon-based approaches to quantum information processing.

Title: Simulating methylamine using symmetry adapted qubit-excitation-based variational quantum eigensolver
Authors: Konstantin M. Makushin, Aleksey K. Fedorov
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the resources that are needed to simulate certain molecules on a medium-scale quantum computer with the use of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach. As the conventional realization of the VQE approach significant amount of resources for simulation, %requires prohibitively large we propose and analyze optimization techniques based on molecular point group symmetries (symmetry adaption) and compact excitation circuits (qubit-excitation-based). These optimizations allows significant reduction of the essential computational capabilities yet ensuring the convergence to the required energies. We first apply this approach for small molecules, such as LiH and BeH$_2$, to evaluate their compatibility, accuracy, and potential applicability to larger problems. Then we demonstrate that instead of 600,000 two-qubit operations (in the STO-3G basis using a naive version of the Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz), we are able to simulate methylamine molecules with 26 qubits and about 12,000 of two-qubit gates using our method. We accomplish our analysis by estimating required resources for a formic acid molecule, whose simulation requires about 15,000 of two-qubit gates. Thus, the proposed combination of certain optimization methods can reduce the number of two-qubit operations by several orders of this http URL, we present alternative approaches that are of interest in the context of the further optimization in the number of two-qubit operation, we note that these approaches do not perform well enough in terms of the convergence to required energies. While these challenges persist, our resource analysis represents a valuable step towards the practical use of quantum computers and the development of better methods for optimizing computing resources.

Title: Two measurement bases are asymptotically informationally complete for any pure state tomography
Authors: Tianfeng Feng, Tianqi Xiao, Yu Wang, Shengshi Pang, Farhan Hanif, Xiaoqi Zhou, Qi Zhao, M. S. Kim, Jinzhao Sun
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions in quantum information theory is to find how many measurement bases are required to obtain the full information of a quantum state. While a minimum of four measurement bases is typically required to determine an arbitrary pure state, we prove that for any states generated by finite-depth Clifford + T circuits, just two measurement bases are sufficient. More generally, we prove that two measurement bases are informationally complete for determining algebraic pure states whose state-vector elements represented in the computational basis are algebraic numbers. Since any pure state can be asymptotically approximated by a sequence of algebraic states with arbitrarily high precision, our scheme is referred to as asymptotically informationally complete for pure state tomography. Furthermore, existing works mostly construct the measurements using entangled bases. So far, the best result requires $O(n)$ local measurement bases for $n$-qubit pure-state tomography. Here, we show that two measurement bases that involve polynomial elementary gates are sufficient for uniquely determining sparse algebraic states. Moreover, we prove that two local measurement bases, involving single-qubit local operations only, are informationally complete for certain algebraic states, such as GHZ-like and W-like states. Besides, our two-measurement-bases scheme remains valid for mixed states with certain types of noises. We numerically test the uniqueness of the reconstructed states under two (local) measurement bases with and without measurement and depolarising types of noise. Our scheme provides a theoretical guarantee for pure state tomography in the fault-tolerant quantum computing regime.

Title: Directly probing work extraction from a single qubit engine fueled by quantum measurements
Authors: Rémy Dassonneville, Cyril Elouard, Romain Cazali, Réouven Assouly, Audrey Bienfait, Alexia Auffèves, Benjamin Huard
Abstract: Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of resources of quantum origin in engines. One of the main remaining challenges consists in directly measuring the work extracted from such quantum engines. Here we probe the work extracted from a transmon superconducting qubit acting as a working medium. The engine is fueled by performing quantum measurements of an observable which does not commute with the bare qubit Hamiltonian. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon working without a hot thermal source. In our implementation, the qubit working medium amplifies a coherent microwave field from which work is extracted. The latter is not only inferred from tomographic measurements of the qubit state but also directly monitored via heterodyne detection of the field quadratures. We demonstrate the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, losses and drifts. To emphasize the role of feedback, we also study the breakdown of the engine in the open-loop configuration.

Title: On the sampling complexity of coherent superpositions
Authors: Beatriz Dias, Robert Koenig
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from the distribution of measurement outcomes when applying a POVM to a superposition $|\Psi\rangle = \sum_{j=0}^{\chi-1} c_j |\psi_j\rangle$ of $\chi$ pure states. We relate this problem to that of drawing samples from the outcome distribution when measuring a single state $|\psi_j\rangle$ in the superposition. Here $j$ is drawn from the distribution $p(j)=|c_j|^2/\|c\|^2_2$ of normalized amplitudes. We give an algorithm which $-$ given $O(\chi \|c\|_2^2 \log1/\delta)$ such samples and calls to oracles evaluating the involved probability density functions $-$ outputs a sample from the target distribution except with probability at most $\delta$. In many cases of interest, the POVM and individual states in the superposition have efficient classical descriptions allowing to evaluate matrix elements of POVM elements and to draw samples from outcome distributions. In such a scenario, our algorithm gives a reduction from strong classical simulation (i.e., the problem of computing outcome probabilities) to weak simulation (i.e., the problem of sampling). In contrast to prior work focusing on finite-outcome POVMs, this reduction also applies to continuous-outcome POVMs. An example is homodyne or heterodyne measurements applied to a superposition of Gaussian states. Here we obtain a sampling algorithm with time complexity $O(N^3 \chi^3 \|c\|_2^2 \log1/\delta)$ for a state of $N$ bosonic modes.

Title: Enhancing the fidelity of stimulated Raman transitions with simple phase shifts
Authors: Hua-Yang Wang, Xu-Yang Chen, Zhen-Yu Wang
Abstract: We demonstrate that in stimulated Raman transitions, introducing one or two simple phase shifts to the control fields significantly enhances the fidelity of state manipulation while simultaneously reducing leakage to the intermediate excited state. Our approach achieves high-fidelity quantum gate operations between the two target states under arbitrary detuning conditions. Notably, the average population in the intermediate excited state is approximately halved, without extending the overall evolution time. Additionally, our method exhibits greater robustness to static amplitude and detuning errors compared to conventional adiabatic elimination techniques, and maintains higher fidelity even in the presence of dissipation.

Title: MPS Stability and the Intersection Property
Authors: José Garre-Rubio, Alex Turzillo, András Molnár
Abstract: We identify a property of the local tensors of matrix product states (MPS) that guarantees that their parent Hamiltonians satisfy the intersection property. The intersection property ensures that the ground space consists of MPS, with degeneracy bounded by the square of the bond dimension. The new local property, dubbed stability, generalizes (block) injectivity and is satisfied by the MPS tensors that construct the W state, domain wall superposition states, and their generalizations.

Title: Quantum Search with the Signless Laplacian
Authors: Molly E. McLaughlin, Thomas G. Wong
Abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks are typically effected by either the discrete Laplacian or the adjacency matrix. In this paper, we explore a third option: the signless Laplacian, which has applications in algebraic graph theory and may arise in layered antiferromagnetic materials. We explore spatial search on the complete bipartite graph, which is generally irregular and breaks the equivalence of the three quantum walks for regular graphs, and where the search oracle breaks the equivalence of the Laplacian and signless Laplacian quantum walks on bipartite graphs without the oracle. We prove that a uniform superposition over all the vertices of the graph partially evolves to the marked vertices in one partite set, with the choice of set depending on the jumping rate of the quantum walk. We boost this success probability to 1 by proving that a particular non-uniform initial state completely evolves to the marked vertices in one partite set, again depending on the jumping rate. For some parameter regimes, the signless Laplacian yields the fastest search algorithm of the three, suggesting that it could be a new tool for developing faster quantum algorithms.

Title: Entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution in the Daylight and Uplink Satellite Configuration: Proof-of-Principal Demonstration and Feasibility Test
Authors: Kaushik Joarder, Jakub Szlachetka, Piotr Kolenderski
Abstract: Experimental realization of entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) in a daylight uplink (ground-to-satellite) communication channel is highly challenging due to the very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of this configuration and it has yet to be successfully implemented to date. While current research efforts focus on weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources for daylight QKD, we present a proof-of-principle demonstration of uplink-daylight QKD in a free-space-fiber hybrid configuration using polarization-entangled photon pairs generated via a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process. The simulated uplink channel attenuation reaches up to 50 dB, equivalent to low-earth-orbit (LEO) distances. Furthermore, the detected noise level (up to a few MHz) in the receiver telescope is representative of daylight conditions. The enhancement of SNR is achieved by implementing rigorous filtering on spatial, spectral, and temporal modes. Our ultra-bright source of entangled photons, characterized by a narrow spectral bandwidth of 0.54 nm FWHM, ensures minimal signal attenuation. We also propose a novel theoretical model of entanglement-based QKD link that fits our experimental data perfectly and is consistent with the prevailing models in the field. Our model considers a non-ideal entangled photon source and is applicable to both continuous wave (CW) and pulse-pumped sources. Using this model, we demonstrate that entanglement-based QKD is feasible under uplink daylight conditions in LEO satellites, but only up to a distance of 400 km, utilizing current state-of-the-art single-mode fiber (SMF) coupling technology.

Title: UDiTQC: U-Net-Style Diffusion Transformer for Quantum Circuit Synthesis
Authors: Zhiwei Chen, Hao Tang
Abstract: Quantum computing is a transformative technology with wide-ranging applications, and efficient quantum circuit generation is crucial for unlocking its full potential. Current diffusion model approaches based on U-Net architectures, while promising, encounter challenges related to computational efficiency and modeling global context. To address these issues, we propose UDiT,a novel U-Net-style Diffusion Transformer architecture, which combines U-Net's strengths in multi-scale feature extraction with the Transformer's ability to model global context. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on two tasks: entanglement generation and unitary compilation, where UDiTQC consistently outperforms existing methods. Additionally, our framework supports tasks such as masking and editing circuits to meet specific physical property requirements. This dual advancement, improving quantum circuit synthesis and refining generative model architectures, marks a significant milestone in the convergence of quantum computing and machine learning research.

Title: Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect
Authors: Yicheng Tang, Pradip Kattel, J.H. Pixley, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.

Title: The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The FL*-FL quantum phase transition, and the influence of spatial disorder, is described by an analysis inspired by the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This theory successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations. The crossovers connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions are also discussed.

Title: Carroll at Phase Separation
Authors: Sourav Biswas, Ashutosh Dubey, Saikat Mondal, Aritra Banerjee, Arijit Kundu, Arjun Bagchi
Abstract: Asymptotic behavior of generic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the vicinity of phase-separated regions is known to produce an instability where well-known relativistic Conformal Field Theory (CFT) techniques fail. In this letter, we introduce an analytic paradigm which solves this important issue. We show that there is an emergent Carrollian symmetry when phase separation is reached and techniques of Carroll CFT, as opposed to its relativistic relative, is central to the understanding of the physics. We work with the analogous spinless fermionic system in this region and capture the transition across this phase separation. Our numerical results corroborate the density-density correlations intrinsically computed using Carroll CFT.

Title: Quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with trivial band topology
Authors: Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager, Gunnar F. Lange
Abstract: We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin-topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$-index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain stricter bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental Bismuth realizing higher even nontrivial spin-Chern numbers. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry can be observed experimentally. Finally, we connect spin-bounds to quantum Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bounds which are central to quantum metrology, showing that the elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.

Title: Crosstalk analysis in single hole-spin qubits within highly anisotropic g-tensors
Authors: Yaser Hajati, Irina Heinz, Guido Burkard
Abstract: Spin qubits based on valence band hole states are highly promising for quantum information processing due to their strong spin-orbit coupling and ultrafast operation speed. As these systems scale up, achieving high-fidelity single-qubit operations becomes essential. However, mitigating crosstalk effects from neighboring qubits in larger arrays, particularly for anisotropic qubits with strong spin-orbit coupling, presents a significant challenge. We investigate the impact of crosstalk on qubit fidelities during single-qubit operations and derive an analytical equation that serves as a synchronization condition to eliminate crosstalk in anisotropic media. Our analysis proposes optimized driving field conditions that can robustly synchronize Rabi oscillations and minimize crosstalk, showing a strong dependence on qubit anisotropy and the orientation of the external magnetic field. Taking experimental data into our analysis, we identify a set of parameter values that enable nearly crosstalk-free single-qubit gates, thereby paving the way for scalable quantum computing architectures.

Title: Quantum advantage in decentralized control of POMDPs: A control-theoretic view of the Mermin-Peres square
Authors: Venkat Anantharam
Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Pravin P. Varaiya.

Title: Correlated electron dynamics with time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo: three-dimensional helium
Authors: Ivan P. Christov
Abstract: Here the recently proposed time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo method is applied to three dimensional para- and ortho-helium atoms subjected to an external electromagnetic field with amplitude sufficient to cause significant ionization. By solving concurrently sets of up to 20 000 coupled 3D time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the guide waves and corresponding sets of first order equations of motion for the Monte Carlo walkers we obtain ground state energies in close agreement with the exact values. The combined use of spherical coordinates and B-splines along the radial coordinate proves to be especially accurate and efficient for such calculations. Our results for the dipole response and the ionization of an atom with un-correlated electrons are in good agreement with the predictions of the conventional time-dependent Hartree-Fock method while the calculations with correlated electrons show enhanced ionization that is due to the electron-electron repulsion.

Title: Two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems
Authors: Alex Gómez Salvador, Ivan Morera, Marios H. Michael, Pavel E. Dolgirev, Danica Pavicevic, Albert Liu, Andrea Cavalleri, Eugene Demler
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical approach for computing and analyzing two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems. Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive the nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps with particular emphasis on the rephasing sector, which allows to disentangle different sources of broadening. Our many-body approach successfully distinguishes elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms contributing to the excitation linewidth. Additionally, using a non-perturbative conserving approach, we demonstrate that the echo peak exhibits a universal asymmetric shape in the sole presence of static disorder, a feature that remains robust against quantum fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to the standard theory based on isolated two-level systems, which fails to account for the dispersive nature of excitations and the interactions between different momentum components.

Title: Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers
Authors: Vladimir Al. Osipov
Abstract: Understanding the origin of the system response offers guidance for designing single-component material devices with required properties. A notable phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high concentrations of excitations lacks of comprehensive theoretical framework. Addressing this gap necessitates a discussion grounded in non-linear and multiparticle theories. In this study, we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. Based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steadystate solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The latter is described by the Dicke model and is thus responsible for the generation of the superfluorescent spectral peak. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.

Title: Generation of Deep Ultraviolet Optical Vortices via Amplitude and Phase Spiral Zone Plates
Authors: A.S. Dyatlov, M.A. Nozdrin, A.N. Sergeev, N.E. Sheremet, S.S. Stafeev, D.V. Karlovets
Abstract: We present the development and experimental implementation of diffractive optical elements designed to generate optical vortices in the deep ultraviolet range (from 260 to 266 nm). These elements, fabricated using advanced lithographic and etching techniques, facilitate the efficient transformation of Gaussian beams into twisted modes carrying orbital angular momentum. Experimental tests conducted using the laser driver of an RF photoinjector at JINR successfully demonstrate the generation of deep-ultraviolet optical vortices with a topological charge of l = 1. These findings underscore the potential of structured light in the deep ultraviolet range for applications in relativistic electron beam studies and beam manipulation technologies.

Title: Probing quantum many-body dynamics using subsystem Loschmidt echos
Authors: Simon Karch, Souvik Bandyopadhyay, Zheng-Hang Sun, Alexander Impertro, SeungJung Huh, Irene Prieto Rodríguez, Julian F. Wienand, Wolfgang Ketterle, Markus Heyl, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Immanuel Bloch, Monika Aidelsburger
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo - the probability of a quantum many-body system to return to its initial state following a dynamical evolution - generally contains key information about a quantum system, relevant across various scientific fields including quantum chaos, quantum many-body physics, or high-energy physics. However, it is typically exponentially small in system size, posing an outstanding challenge for experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the subsystem Loschmidt echo, a quasi-local observable that captures key features of the Loschmidt echo while being readily accessible experimentally. Utilizing quantum gas microscopy, we study its short- and long-time dynamics. In the short-time regime, we observe a dynamical quantum phase transition arising from genuine higher-order correlations. In the long-time regime, the subsystem Loschmidt echo allows us to quantitatively determine the effective dimension and structure of the accessible Hilbert space in the thermodynamic limit. Performing these measurements in the ergodic regime and in the presence of emergent kinetic constraints, we provide direct experimental evidence for ergodicity breaking due to fragmentation of the Hilbert space. Our results establish the subsystem Loschmidt echo as a novel and powerful tool that allows paradigmatic studies of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-body systems, applicable to a broad range of quantum simulation and computing platforms.

Abstract: A maximal realisation of the two-dimensional Pauli operator, subject to Aharonov--Bohm magnetic field, is investigated. Contrary to the case of the Pauli operator with regular magnetic potentials, it is shown that both components of the Pauli operator are critical. Asymptotics of the weakly coupled eigenvalues, generated by electric (not necessarily self-adjoint) perturbations, are derived.

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for identifying signals resembling Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) within simulated astrophysical datasets in the form of light curves. The task addressed here focuses on distinguishing GRB-like signals from background noise in simulated Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) data, the next-generation astrophysical observatory for very high-energy gamma-ray science. QCNNs, a quantum counterpart of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leverage quantum principles to process and analyze high-dimensional data efficiently. We implemented a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning technique using the Qiskit framework, with the QCNNs trained on a quantum simulator. Several QCNN architectures were tested, employing different encoding methods such as Data Reuploading and Amplitude encoding. Key findings include that QCNNs achieved accuracy comparable to classical CNNs, often surpassing 90\%, while using fewer parameters, potentially leading to more efficient models in terms of computational resources. A benchmark study further examined how hyperparameters like the number of qubits and encoding methods affected performance, with more qubits and advanced encoding methods generally enhancing accuracy but increasing complexity. QCNNs showed robust performance on time-series datasets, successfully detecting GRB signals with high precision. The research is a pioneering effort in applying QCNNs to astrophysics, offering insights into their potential and limitations. This work sets the stage for future investigations to fully realize the advantages of QCNNs in astrophysical data analysis.

Title: Entanglement and squeezing of gravitational waves
Authors: Thiago Guerreiro
Abstract: We show that the self-interactions present in the effective field theory formulation of general relativity can couple gravitational wave modes and generate nonclassical states. The output of gravitational nonlinear processes can also be sensitive to quantum features of the input states, indicating that nonlinearities can act both as sources and detectors of quantum features of gravitational waves. Due to gauge and quantization issues in strongly curved spacetimes, we work in the geometric optics limit of gravitational radiation, but we expect the key ideas extend to situations of astrophysical interest. This offers a new direction for probing the quantum nature of gravity, analogous to how the quantumness of electrodynamics was established through quantum optics.

Title: Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet-Bloch states in crystals
Authors: Vishal Tiwari, Ignacio Franco
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions enable triggering on-demand novel functionalities in materials. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch states have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the Floquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to finally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and use it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of full-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.

Title: Self-induced Josephson oscillations and self-trapping in a supersolid dipolar quantum gas
Authors: Beatrice Donelli, Nicolò Antolini, Giulio Biagioni, Marco Fattori, Andrea Fioretti, Carlo Gabbanini, Massimo Inguscio, Luca Tanzi, Giovanni Modugno, Augusto Smerzi, Luca Pezzè
Abstract: The Josephson effect characterizes superfluids and superconductors separated by a weak link, the so-called Josephson junction. A recent experiment has shown that Josephson oscillations can be observed also in a supersolid, where the weak link is not due to an external barrier, but is self-induced by interparticle interactions. Here we show theoretically that supersolids -- despite their self-induced character -- feature all the standard properties of bosonic Josephson junction arrays, including macroscopic quantum self-trapping. We focus on the harmonically trapped dipolar supersolids of interest for current experiments, and show that they can be described with a generalized Josephson model that takes into account spatial inhomogeneities. Our work shades new light on the dynamics of supersolids and opens the way to the study of a novel class of Josephson junctions.

Title: QOC: Quantum On-Chip Training with Parameter Shift and Gradient Pruning
Authors: Hanrui Wang, Zirui Li, Jiaqi Gu, Yongshan Ding, David Z. Pan, Song Han
Abstract: Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) are drawing increasing research interest thanks to its potential to achieve quantum advantages on near-term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. In order to achieve scalable PQC learning, the training process needs to be offloaded to real quantum machines instead of using exponential-cost classical simulators. One common approach to obtain PQC gradients is parameter shift whose cost scales linearly with the number of qubits. We present QOC, the first experimental demonstration of practical on-chip PQC training with parameter shift. Nevertheless, we find that due to the significant quantum errors (noises) on real machines, gradients obtained from naive parameter shift have low fidelity and thus degrading the training accuracy. To this end, we further propose probabilistic gradient pruning to firstly identify gradients with potentially large errors and then remove them. Specifically, small gradients have larger relative errors than large ones, thus having a higher probability to be pruned. We perform extensive experiments with the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) benchmarks on 5 classification tasks using 5 real quantum machines. The results demonstrate that our on-chip training achieves over 90% and 60% accuracy for 2-class and 4-class image classification tasks. The probabilistic gradient pruning brings up to 7% PQC accuracy improvements over no pruning. Overall, we successfully obtain similar on-chip training accuracy compared with noise-free simulation but have much better training scalability. The QOC code is available in the TorchQuantum library.

Title: Universal trade-off structure between symmetry, irreversibility, and quantum coherence in quantum processes
Authors: Hiroyasu Tajima, Ryuji Takagi, Yui Kuramochi
Abstract: Symmetry, irreversibility, and quantum coherence are foundational concepts in physics. Here, we present a universal tradeoff relation between these three concepts. This particularly reveals that (1) under a global symmetry, any attempt to change the local conserved charge causes inevitable irreversibility, and (2) such irreversibility can be mitigated by quantum coherence. Our tradeoff relation follows solely from the unitarity and global symmetry of the total dynamics, allowing for general applicability. For non-equilibrium physics, it relates the coherence cost and the entropy production -- representing thermodynamic irreversibility -- in arbitrary quantum processes. It also provides fundamental limitations on the capability of a number of quantum information processing tasks -- such as gate and measurement implementation and error correction -- that involve symmetry restrictions. Furthermore, it predicts how many bits of classical information thrown into a black hole become unreadable under energy conservation. Our tradeoff relation is based on quantum uncertainty relation, showcasing intimate connections between fundamental physical principles and ultimate operational capability of quantum processes.

Title: Time-Efficient Constant-Space-Overhead Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation
Authors: Hayata Yamasaki, Masato Koashi
Abstract: Scaling up quantum computers to attain substantial speedups over classical computing requires fault tolerance. Conventionally, protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation demand excessive space overheads by using many physical qubits for each logical qubit. A more recent protocol using quantum analogues of low-density parity-check codes needs only a constant space overhead that does not grow with the number of logical qubits. However, the overhead in the processing time required to implement this protocol grows polynomially with the number of computational steps. To address these problems, here we introduce an alternative approach to constant-space-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing using a concatenation of multiple small-size quantum codes rather than a single large-size quantum low-density parity-check code. We develop techniques for concatenating different quantum Hamming codes with growing sizes. As a result, we construct a low-overhead protocol to achieve constant space overhead and only quasi-polylogarithmic time overhead simultaneously. Our protocol is fault tolerant even if a decoder has a non-constant runtime, unlike the existing constant-space-overhead protocol. This code concatenation approach will make possible a large class of quantum speedups within feasibly bounded space overhead yet negligibly short time overhead.

Title: QuEst: Graph Transformer for Quantum Circuit Reliability Estimation
Authors: Hanrui Wang, Pengyu Liu, Jinglei Cheng, Zhiding Liang, Jiaqi Gu, Zirui Li, Yongshan Ding, Weiwen Jiang, Yiyu Shi, Xuehai Qian, David Z. Pan, Frederic T. Chong, Song Han
Abstract: Among different quantum algorithms, PQC for QML show promises on near-term devices. To facilitate the QML and PQC research, a recent python library called TorchQuantum has been released. It can construct, simulate, and train PQC for machine learning tasks with high speed and convenient debugging supports. Besides quantum for ML, we want to raise the community's attention on the reversed direction: ML for quantum. Specifically, the TorchQuantum library also supports using data-driven ML models to solve problems in quantum system research, such as predicting the impact of quantum noise on circuit fidelity and improving the quantum circuit compilation efficiency. This paper presents a case study of the ML for quantum part. Since estimating the noise impact on circuit reliability is an essential step toward understanding and mitigating noise, we propose to leverage classical ML to predict noise impact on circuit fidelity. Inspired by the natural graph representation of quantum circuits, we propose to leverage a graph transformer model to predict the noisy circuit fidelity. We firstly collect a large dataset with a variety of quantum circuits and obtain their fidelity on noisy simulators and real machines. Then we embed each circuit into a graph with gate and noise properties as node features, and adopt a graph transformer to predict the fidelity. Evaluated on 5 thousand random and algorithm circuits, the graph transformer predictor can provide accurate fidelity estimation with RMSE error 0.04 and outperform a simple neural network-based model by 0.02 on average. It can achieve 0.99 and 0.95 R$^2$ scores for random and algorithm circuits, respectively. Compared with circuit simulators, the predictor has over 200X speedup for estimating the fidelity.

Title: Quantum Risk Analysis: Beyond (Conditional) Value-at-Risk
Authors: Christian Laudagé, Ivica Turkalj
Abstract: Risk measures are important key figures to measure the adequacy of the reserves of a company. The most common risk measures in practice are Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). Recently, quantum-based algorithms are introduced to calculate them. These procedures are based on the so-called quantum amplitude estimation algorithm which lead to a quadratic speed up compared to classical Monte-Carlo based methods. Based on these ideas, we construct quantum-based algorithms to calculate alternatives for VaR and CVaR, namely the Expectile Value-at-Risk (EVaR) and the Range Value-at-Risk (RVaR). We construct quantum algorithms to calculate them. These algorithms are based on quantum amplitude estimation. In a case study, we compare their performance with the quantum-based algorithms for VaR and CVaR. We find that all of the algorithms perform sufficiently well on a quantum simulator. Further, the calculations of EVaR and VaR are robust against noise on a real quantum device. This is not the case for CVaR and RVaR.

Title: Chaos in Optomechanical Systems coupled to a Non-Markovian environment
Authors: Pengju Chen, Nan Yang, Austen Couvertier, Quanzhen Ding, Rupak Chatterjee, Ting Yu
Abstract: We study the chaotic motion of a semi-classical optomechanical system coupled to a non-Markovian environment with a finite correlation time. We show that the non-Markovian environment can significantly enhance chaos, by studying the emergence of chaos using Lyapunov exponent with the changing non-Markovian parameter. It is observed that non-Markovian environment characterized by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type noise can modify the generation of chaos with different environmental memory times. As a comparison, the crossover properties from Markov to non-Markovian regimes are also discussed. Our findings indicate that the quantum memory effects on the onset of chaos may become a useful property to be investigated in quantum manipulations and control.

Title: Decoherence, Branching, and the Born Rule in a Mixed-State Everettian Multiverse
Authors: Eugene Y. S. Chua, Eddy Keming Chen
Abstract: In Everettian quantum mechanics, justifications for the Born rule appeal to self-locating uncertainty or decision theory. Such justifications have focused exclusively on a pure-state Everettian multiverse, represented by a wave function. Recent works in quantum foundations suggest that it is viable to consider a mixed-state Everettian multiverse, represented by a (mixed-state) density matrix. Here, we develop the conceptual foundations for decoherence and branching in a mixed-state multiverse, and extend arguments for the Born rule to this setting. This extended framework provides a unification of 'classical' and 'quantum' probabilities, and additional theoretical benefits, for the Everettian picture.

Title: Distance-preserving stabilizer measurements in hypergraph product codes
Authors: Argyris Giannisis Manes, Jahan Claes
Abstract: Unlike the surface code, quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes can have a finite encoding rate, potentially lowering the error correction overhead. However, finite-rate QLDPC codes have nonlocal stabilizers, making it difficult to design stabilizer measurement circuits that are low-depth and do not decrease the effective distance. Here, we demonstrate that a popular family of finite-rate QLDPC codes, hypergraph product codes, has the convenient property of distance-robustness: any stabilizer measurement circuit preserves the effective distance. In particular, we prove the depth-optimal circuit in [Tremblay et al, PRL 129, 050504 (2022)] is also optimal in terms of effective distance.

Title: Quantum Entanglement Phase Transitions and Computational Complexity: Insights from Ising Models
Authors: Hanchen Liu, Vikram Ravindranath, Xiao Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we construct 2-dimensional bipartite cluster states and perform single-qubit measurements on the bulk qubits. We explore the entanglement scaling of the unmeasured 1-dimensional boundary state and show that under certain conditions, the boundary state can undergo a volume-law to an area-law entanglement transition driven by variations in the measurement angle. We bridge this boundary state entanglement transition and the measurement-induced phase transition in the non-unitary 1+1-dimensional circuit via the transfer matrix method. We also explore the application of this entanglement transition on the computational complexity problems. Specifically, we establish a relation between the boundary state entanglement transition and the sampling complexity of the bipartite $2$d cluster state, which is directly related to the computational complexity of the corresponding Ising partition function with complex parameters. By examining the boundary state entanglement scaling, we numerically identify the parameter regime for which the $2$d quantum state can be efficiently sampled, which indicates that the Ising partition function can be evaluated efficiently in such a region.

Title: Coherence in resonance fluorescence
Authors: Xu-Jie Wang, Guoqi Huang, Ming-Yang Li, Yuan-Zhuo Wang, Li Liu, Bang Wu, Hanqing Liu, Haiqiao Ni, Zhichuan Niu, Weijie Ji, Rongzhen Jiao, Hua-Lei Yin, Zhiliang Yuan
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak monochromatic excitation. These properties are commonly explained in terms of two disjoined pictures, i.e., the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the spectral and correlation properties of the emission. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole resonance fluorescence and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides an intuitive understanding of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.

Title: Quasi-Probabilistic Readout Correction of Mid-Circuit Measurements for Adaptive Feedback via Measurement Randomized Compiling
Authors: Akel Hashim, Arnaud Carignan-Dugas, Larry Chen, Christian Juenger, Neelay Fruitwala, Yilun Xu, Gang Huang, Joel J. Wallman, Irfan Siddiqi
Abstract: Quantum measurements are a fundamental component of quantum computing. However, on modern-day quantum computers, measurements can be more error prone than quantum gates, and are susceptible to non-unital errors as well as non-local correlations due to measurement crosstalk. While readout errors can be mitigated in post-processing, it is inefficient in the number of qubits due to a combinatorially-large number of possible states that need to be characterized. In this work, we show that measurement errors can be tailored into a simple stochastic error model using randomized compiling, enabling the efficient mitigation of readout errors via quasi-probability distributions reconstructed from the measurement of a single preparation state in an exponentially large confusion matrix. We demonstrate the scalability and power of this approach by correcting readout errors without matrix inversion on a large number of different preparation states applied to a register of eight superconducting transmon qubits. Moreover, we show that this method can be extended to mid-circuit measurements used for active feedback via quasi-probabilistic error cancellation, and demonstrate the correction of measurement errors on an ancilla qubit used to detect and actively correct bit-flip errors on an entangled memory qubit. Our approach enables the correction of readout errors on large numbers of qubits, and offers a strategy for correcting readout errors in adaptive circuits in which the results of mid-circuit measurements are used to perform conditional operations on non-local qubits in real time.

Title: Variational Neural and Tensor Network Approximations of Thermal States
Authors: Sirui Lu, Giacomo Giudice, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: We introduce a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for approximating finite-temperature quantum many-body systems, based on the minimization of a modified free energy. This approach directly approximates the state at a fixed temperature, allowing for systematic improvement of the ansatz expressiveness without accumulating errors from iterative imaginary time evolution. We employ a variety of trial states -- both tensor networks as well as neural networks -- as variational Ansätze for our numerical optimization. We benchmark and compare different constructions in the above classes, both for one- and two-dimensional problems, with systems made of up to $N=100$ spins. Our results demonstrate that while restricted Boltzmann machines show limitations, string bond tensor network states exhibit systematic improvements with increasing bond dimensions and the number of strings.

Title: Optimal Scheduling of Graph States via Path Decompositions
Authors: Samuel J. Elman, Jason Gavriel, Ryan L. Mann
Abstract: We study the optimal scheduling of graph states in measurement-based quantum computation, establishing an equivalence between measurement schedules and path decompositions of graphs. We define the spatial cost of a measurement schedule based on the number of simultaneously active qubits and prove that an optimal measurement schedule corresponds to a path decomposition of minimal width. Our analysis shows that approximating the spatial cost of a graph is $\textsf{NP}$-hard, while for graphs with bounded spatial cost, we establish an efficient algorithm for computing an optimal measurement schedule.

Title: Theory of Multimode Squeezed Light Generation in Lossy Media
Authors: Denis A. Kopylov, Torsten Meier, Polina R. Sharapova
Abstract: A unified theoretical approach to describe the properties of multimode squeezed light generated in a lossy medium is presented. This approach is valid for Markovian environments and includes both a model of discrete losses based on the beamsplitter approach and a generalized continuous loss model based on the spatial Langevin equation. For an important class of Gaussian states, we derive master equations for the second-order correlation functions and illustrate their solution for both frequency-independent and frequency-dependent losses. Studying the mode structure, we demonstrate that in a lossy environment no broadband basis without quadrature correlations between the different broadband modes exists. Therefore, various techniques and strategies to introduce broadband modes can be considered. We show that the Mercer expansion and the Williamson-Euler decomposition do not provide modes in which the maximal squeezing contained in the system can be measured. In turn, we find a new broadband basis that maximizes squeezing in the lossy system and present an algorithm to construct it.

Title: Benchmarking Quantum Optimization for the Maximum-Cut Problem on a Superconducting Quantum Computer
Authors: Maxime Dupont, Bhuvanesh Sundar, Bram Evert, David E. Bernal Neira, Zedong Peng, Stephen Jeffrey, Mark J. Hodson
Abstract: Achieving high-quality solutions faster than classical solvers on computationally hard problems is a challenge for quantum optimization to deliver utility. Using a superconducting quantum computer, we experimentally investigate the performance of a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm inspired by semidefinite programming approaches for solving the maximum-cut problem on 3-regular graphs up to several thousand variables. We leverage the structure of the input problems to address sizes beyond what current quantum machines can naively handle. We attain an average approximation ratio of 99% over a random ensemble of thousands of problem instances. We benchmark the quantum solver against similarly high-performing classical heuristics, including the Gurobi optimizer, simulated annealing, and the Burer-Monteiro algorithm. A run-time analysis shows that the quantum solver on large-scale problems is competitive against Gurobi but short of others on a projected 100-qubit quantum computer. We explore multiple leads to close the gap and discuss prospects for a practical quantum speedup.

Title: Heralded photonic graph states with inefficient quantum emitters
Authors: Maxwell Gold, Jianlong Lin, Eric Chitambar, Elizabeth A. Goldschmidt
Abstract: Quantum emitter-based schemes for the generation of photonic graph states offer a promising, resource efficient methodology for realizing distributed quantum computation and communication protocols on near-term hardware. We present a heralded scheme for making photonic graph states that is compatible with the typically poor photon collection from state-of-the-art coherent quantum emitters. We demonstrate that the construction time for large graph states can be polynomial in the photon collection efficiency, as compared to the exponential scaling of current emitter-based schemes, which assume deterministic photon collection. The additional overhead here consists of an extra spin qubit plus one additional spin-spin entangling gate per photon added to the graph. While the proposed scheme requires both non-demolition measurement and efficient storage of photons in order to generate graph states for arbitrary applications, we show that many useful tasks, including measurement-based quantum computation, can be implemented without these requirements. As a use-case of our scheme, we construct a protocol for secure two-party computation that can be implemented efficiently on current hardware. Estimates of the fidelity to produce graph states used in the computation are given assuming current and near-term fidelities for highly coherent quantum emitters.

Title: Conservation of angular momentum on a single-photon level
Authors: Lea Kopf, Rafael Barros, Shashi Prabhakar, Enno Giese, Robert Fickler
Abstract: Identifying conservation laws is central to every subfield of physics, as they illuminate the underlying symmetries and fundamental principles. A prime example can be found in quantum optics: The conservation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) during spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) enables the generation of a photon pair with entangled OAM. In this article, we report on the first study of OAM conservation in SPDC pumped by single photons. Our results present the first implementation of cascaded down-conversion without waveguides, setting the stage for experiments on the direct generation of multi-photon high-dimensional entanglement using all degrees of freedom of light.

Title: Interplay between time and energy in bosonic noisy quantum metrology
Authors: Wojciech Górecki, Francesco Albarelli, Simone Felicetti, Roberto Di Candia, Lorenzo Maccone
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and coherence often allow for protocols that outperform classical ones in estimating a system's parameter. When using infinite-dimensional probes (such as a bosonic mode), one could in principle obtain infinite precision in a finite time for both classical and quantum protocols, which makes it hard to quantify potential quantum advantage. However, such a situation is unphysical, as it would require infinite resources, so one needs to impose some additional constraint: typically the average energy employed by the probe is finite. Here we treat both energy and time as a resource, showing that, in the presence of noise, there is a nontrivial interplay between the average energy and the time devoted to the estimation. Our results are valid for the most general metrological schemes (e.g. adaptive schemes which may involve entanglement with external ancillae or any kind of continuous measurement). We apply recently derived precision bounds for all parameters characterizing the paradigmatic case of a bosonic mode, subject to Lindbladian noise. We show how the time employed in the estimation should be partitioned in order to achieve the best possible precision. In most cases, the optimal performance may be obtained without the necessity of adaptivity or entanglement with ancilla. We compare results with classical strategies. Interestingly, for temperature estimation, applying a fast-prepare-and-measure protocol with Fock states provides better scaling with the number of photons than any classical strategy.

Title: The construction of quantum mechanics from electromagnetism. Theory and hydrogen atom
Authors: Hernán Gustavo Solari, Mario Alberto Natiello
Abstract: We reconstruct Quantum Mechanics in a way that harmonises with classical mechanics and electromagnetism, free from mysteries or paradoxes as the \emph{collapse of the wave-function} or \emph{Schrödinger's cat.} The construction is inspired by de Broglie's and Schrödinger's wave mechanics while the unifying principle is Hamilton's principle of least action, which separates natural laws from particular circumstances such as initial conditions and leads to the conservation of energy for isolated systems. In Part I we construct the Quantum Mechanics of a charged unitary entity and prescribe the form in which the entity interacts with other charged entities and matter in general. In Part II we address the quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom, testing the correctness and accuracy of the general description. The relation between electron and proton in the atom is described systematically in a construction that is free from analogies or ad-hoc derivations and it supersedes conventional Quantum Mechanics (whose equations linked to measurements can be recovered). We briefly discuss why the concept of isolation built in Schrödinger's time evolution is not acceptable and how it immediately results in the well known measurement paradoxes of quantum mechanics. We also discuss the epistemic grounds of the development and provide a criticism of instrumentalism, the leading philosophical perspective behind conventional Quantum Mechanics.

Title: Stabilizer entropy in non-integrable quantum evolutions
Authors: Jovan Odavić, Michele Viscardi, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and a novel quantity assessing their interplay - called anti-flatness, after a quantum quench of a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.

Title: Characterizing quantum state-space with a single quantum measurement
Authors: Matthew B. Weiss
Abstract: Can the state-space of $d$-dimensional quantum theory be derived from studying the behavior of a single "reference" measuring device? The answer is yes, if the measuring device corresponds to a complex-projective 3-design. In this privileged case, not only does each quantum state correspond to a probability distribution over the outcomes of a single measurement, but also the probability distributions which correspond to quantum states can be elegantly characterized as those which respect a generalized uncertainty principle. The latter takes the form of a lower-bound on the variance of a natural class of observables as measured by the reference. We also give simple equations which pure-state probability distributions must satisfy, and contextualize these results by showing how 3-designs allow the structure-coefficients of the Jordan algebra of observables to be extracted from the probabilities which characterize the reference measurement itself. This lends credence to the view that quantum theory ought to be primarily understood as a set of normative constraints on probability assignments which reflect nature's lack of hidden variables, and further cements the significance of 3-designs in quantum information science.

Title: GroverGPT: A Large Language Model with 8 Billion Parameters for Quantum Searching
Authors: Haoran Wang, Pingzhi Li, Min Chen, Jinglei Cheng, Junyu Liu, Tianlong Chen
Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting non-Von Neumann paradigm, offering provable speedups over classical computing for specific problems. However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability. This work suggests task-specific LLMs can surpass general-purpose models like GPT-4o in quantum algorithm learning and serve as powerful tools for advancing quantum research.

Title: Certifying entanglement dimensionality by reduction moments
Authors: Changhao Yi, Xiaodi Li, Huangjun Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we combine the k-reduction map, the moment method, and the classical shadow method into a practical protocol for certifying the entanglement dimensionality. Our approach is based on the observation that a state with entanglement dimensionality at most k must stay positive under the action of the k-reduction map. The core of our protocol utilizes the moment method to determine whether the k-reduced operator, i.e., the operator obtained after applying the k-reduction map on a quantum state, contains negative eigenvalues or not. Notably, we propose a systematic method for constructing reduction moment criteria, which apply to a much wider range of states than fidelity-based methods. The performance of our approach gets better and better with the moment order employed, which is corroborated by extensive numerical simulation. To apply our approach, it suffices to implement a unitary 3-design instead of a 4-design, which is more feasible in practice than the correlation matrix method. In the course of study, we show that the k-reduction negativity, the absolute sum of the negative eigenvalues of the k-reduced operator, is monotonic under local operations and classical communication for pure states.

Title: QuantumNAT: Quantum Noise-Aware Training with Noise Injection, Quantization and Normalization
Authors: Hanrui Wang, Jiaqi Gu, Yongshan Ding, Zirui Li, Frederic T. Chong, David Z. Pan, Song Han
Abstract: Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) are promising towards quantum advantage on near-term quantum hardware. However, due to the large quantum noises (errors), the performance of PQC models has a severe degradation on real quantum devices. Take Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as an example, the accuracy gap between noise-free simulation and noisy results on IBMQ-Yorktown for MNIST-4 classification is over 60%. Existing noise mitigation methods are general ones without leveraging unique characteristics of PQC; on the other hand, existing PQC work does not consider noise effect. To this end, we present QuantumNAT, a PQC-specific framework to perform noise-aware optimizations in both training and inference stages to improve robustness. We experimentally observe that the effect of quantum noise to PQC measurement outcome is a linear map from noise-free outcome with a scaling and a shift factor. Motivated by that, we propose post-measurement normalization to mitigate the feature distribution differences between noise-free and noisy scenarios. Furthermore, to improve the robustness against noise, we propose noise injection to the training process by inserting quantum error gates to PQC according to realistic noise models of quantum hardware. Finally, post-measurement quantization is introduced to quantize the measurement outcomes to discrete values, achieving the denoising effect. Extensive experiments on 8 classification tasks using 6 quantum devices demonstrate that QuantumNAT improves accuracy by up to 43%, and achieves over 94% 2-class, 80% 4-class, and 34% 10-class classification accuracy measured on real quantum computers. The code for construction and noise-aware training of PQC is available in the TorchQuantum library.

Title: Black Hole from Entropy Maximization
Authors: Yuki Yokokura
Abstract: One quantum characterization of a black hole motivated by (local) holography and thermodynamics is that it maximizes thermodynamic entropy for a given surface area. In the context of quantum gravity, this could be more fundamental than the classical characterization by a horizon. As a step, we explore this possibility by solving the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation with many matter fields. For highly-excited spherically-symmetric static configurations, we apply local typicality and estimate the entropy including self-gravity to derive its upper bound. The saturation condition uniquely determines the entropy-maximized configuration: self-gravitating quanta condensate into a radially-uniform dense configuration with no horizon, where the self-gravity and a large quantum pressure induced by the curvatures are balanced and no singularity appears. The interior metric is a self-consistent and non-perturbative solution in Planck's constant. The maximum entropy, given by the volume integral of the entropy density, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula through self-gravity, deriving the Bousso bound for thermodynamic entropy. Finally, 10 future prospects are discussed, leading to a speculative view that the configuration represents a quantum-gravitational condensate in a semi-classical manner.

Title: Decoherence of Histories: Chaotic Versus Integrable Systems
Authors: Jiaozi Wang, Philipp Strasberg
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.

Title: Autonomous Bootstrapping of Quantum Dot Devices
Authors: Anton Zubchenko, Danielle Middlebrooks, Torbjørn Rasmussen, Lara Lausen, Ferdinand Kuemmeth, Anasua Chatterjee, Justyna P. Zwolak
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising platform for multiple different qubit implementations, all of which are voltage controlled by programmable gate electrodes. However, as the QD arrays grow in size and complexity, tuning procedures that can fully autonomously handle the increasing number of control parameters are becoming essential for enabling scalability. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm for initializing a depletion-mode QD device in preparation for subsequent phases of tuning. During bootstrapping, the QD device functionality is validated, all gates are characterized, and the QD charge sensor is made operational. We demonstrate the bootstrapping protocol in conjunction with a coarse-tuning module, showing that the combined algorithm can efficiently and reliably take a cooled-down QD device to a desired global-state configuration in under 8 min with a success rate of 96 %. Finally, by following heuristic approaches to QD device initialization and combining the efficient ray-based measurement with the rapid radio-frequency reflectometry measurements, the proposed algorithm establishes a reference in terms of performance, reliability, and efficiency against which alternative algorithms can be benchmarked.

Title: Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States
Authors: Xi Dong, Jonah Kudler-Flam, Pratik Rath
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even Rényi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th Rényi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k<1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.

Title: A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography
Authors: Taishi Kawamoto
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.

Title: Unveiling the Dance of Molecules: Ro-Vibrational Dynamics of Molecules under Intense Illumination at Complex Plasmonic Interfaces
Authors: Maxim Sukharev, Joseph E. Subotnik, Abraham Nitzan
Abstract: Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavity systems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics. This work develops a comprehensive self-consistent model simulating electromagnetic interactions of diatomic molecules with quantum ro-vibrational degrees of freedom in resonant optical cavities. The approach employs an efficient numerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in real space-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecular mapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble of molecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavities and at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations reveal dramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to free space, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising from cavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of a previously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing of the collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates that strong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectra of chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.

Title: Deterministic role of chemical bonding in the formation of altermagnetism: Reflection from correlated electron system NiS
Authors: Arijit Mandal, Arindom Das, B.R.K. Nanda
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state, has gained significant attention in the last few years, and the underlying mechanisms driving this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary description of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in this work, we explore the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and realistic mechanism to explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principles calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, we establish a set of selection rules for the formation of altermagnetism in the NiAs prototype compounds (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.). Broadly, if single orbitals from Ni and S sites are involved in the bonding, the second neighbor interaction between the nonmagnetic atoms is a must to modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite spin sublattices so that the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is lifted and momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin split (ASS) appears. However, when multiple orbitals are involved from the Ni and S sites in the chemical bonding, altermagnetism is naturally present. Together they amplify the ASS. Further, we propose twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal crystals, where ASS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, ASS increases with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands it can go beyond 1eV. The present study opens up new pathways to design chemical bonding driven selection rules in addition to the existing crystal symmetry criteria to tailor tunable altermagnetism.
