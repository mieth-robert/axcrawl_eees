Title: Generalized Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill States on a Quantum Torus
Authors: Sijo K. Joseph, Sudhir Singh
Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of a Generalized Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state that resolves all of its foundational pathologies, such as infinite energy, non-normalizability, and or- thogonality. We demonstrate that these issues are artifacts of defining the code on an unbounded phase-space. By considering the compact quantum-phase-space intrinsic to systems like coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, we have obtained a Generalized GKP (GGKP) state that is both exact and physically realizable. This is achieved by applying an obtained Quantum Zak Transform (QZT) to Squeezed Coherent States, which reveals that Riemann-Theta functions are the natural representation of these states on the quantum torus phase-space. This framework not only provides a well-behaved quantum state, but also reveals a deep connection between quantum error correc- tion, non-commutative geometry, and the theory of generalized Theta functions. This opens a new avenue for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing.

Title: Structure-Fair Quantum Circuit Complexity: An Information-Theoretic Lower Bound
Authors: HongZheng Liu, YiNuo Tian, Zhiyue Wu
Abstract: Fairly quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structures (such as symmetries or encodings) is a fundamental challenge for benchmarking quantum technologies. We introduce the "Reference-Contingent Complexity" (RCC). Its core idea is to utilize the quantum relative entropy to measure the extent to which a state deviates from its "structured vacuum" (the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace), thereby only pricing the generation of non-trivial information. We establish a central theorem, establishing that the RCC is a rigorous information-theoretic lower bound on universal quantum circuit complexity, a bound that features a linear leading term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction for the non-uniformity of the spectral distribution. Furthermore, we establish an operational protocol based on quantum hypothesis testing, which connects this theoretical lower bound to experimentally accessible observables. This work provides a structurally-fair yardstick for quantum technologies and offers a new perspective for exploring the intrinsic connection between computational cost and the generation of non-trivial information.

Title: Joint momenta-coordinates states as pointer states in quantum decoherence
Authors: Nomenjanahary Tanjonirina Manampisoa, Ravo Tokiniaina Ranaivoson, Roland Raboanary, Raoelina Andriambololona, Rivo Herivola Manjakamanana Ravelonjato
Abstract: Quantum decoherence provides a framework to study the emergence of classicality from quantum system by showing how interactions with the environments suppress interferences and select robust states known as pointer states. Earlier studies have linked Gaussian coherent states with pointer states. More recently, it was conjectured that more general quantum states called joint momenta-coordinates states could also be considered as more suitable candidates to be pointer states. These states are associated to the concept of quantum phase space and saturate, by definition, generalized uncertainty relations. In this work, we rigorously prove this conjecture. Building on the Lindblad framework for the damped harmonic oscillator and applying Zurek's predictability-sieve criterion, we analyze both underdamped and overdamped regimes. We show that only in the underdamped case do joint momenta-coordinates states remain pure and robust for all times, establishing them as the true pointer states. This extends Isar's earlier underdamped treatment, generalizes the concept beyond Gaussian approximations, and embeds classical robustness in the quantum phase space formalism, with potential applications in error-resilient quantum information.

Title: Order from chaos with adaptive circuits on quantum hardware
Authors: Bibek Pokharel, Haining Pan, Kemal Aziz, Luke C. G. Govia, Sriram Ganeshan, Thomas Iadecola, Justin H. Wilson, Barbara A. Jones, Abhinav Deshpande, Jedediah H. Pixley, Maika Takita
Abstract: Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.

Title: Training the classification capability of large-scale quantum cellular automata
Authors: Mario Boneberg, Simon Kochsiek, Gabriele Perfetto, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: In the vicinity of a phase transition ergodicity can be broken. Here, different initial many-body configurations evolve towards one of several fixed points, which are macroscopically distinguishable through an order parameter. This mechanism enables state classification in quantum cellular automata and feed-forward quantum neural networks. We demonstrate that this capability can be efficiently learned from training data even in extremely high-dimensional state spaces. We illustrate this using a quantum cellular automaton that allows binary classification, which is closely connected to the dynamics of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric Ising model with local interactions and dissipation. This approach can be generalized beyond binary classification and offers a natural framework for exploring the link between emergent many-body phenomena and the interpretation of data processing capabilities in the context of quantum machine learning.

Title: Efficient Quantum Protein Structure Prediction with Problem-Agnostic Ansatzes
Authors: Hanna Linn, Rui-Hao Li, Alexander Holden, Abdullah Ash Saki, Frank DiFilippo, Tomas Radivoyevitch, Daniel Blankenberg, Laura García-Álvarez, Göran Johansson
Abstract: Accurately predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences remains a fundamental challenge in computational biology, with profound implications for understanding biological functions and enabling structure-based drug discovery. Quantum computing approaches based on coarse-grained lattice models combined with variational algorithms have been proposed as an initial step towards predicting protein structures using quantum computers. In this work, we introduce a more efficient quantum protein structure prediction workflow that bypasses the need for explicit Hamiltonian construction by employing a problem-agnostic ansatz. The ansatz is trained to minimize an energy-based cost function that can be efficiently computed on classical computers, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing circuit depth compared to previous Hamiltonian-based methods. This enables a more scalable approach for larger proteins and facilitates the inclusion of higher-order interactions, previously hard to achieve in quantum approaches. We validate our method by benchmarking a hardware-efficient ansatz on a large set of proteins with up to 26 amino acids, modeled on the tetrahedral, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic lattices, incorporating up to second-nearest-neighbor interactions. We assess the performance on both a noise-free simulator and the ibm_kingston quantum computer using a set of distinct metrics to probe different aspects of the prediction quality. These experiments push the boundaries of quantum methods for protein structure prediction, targeting sequences that are longer than those typically addressed in prior studies. Overall, the results highlight the scalability and versatility of our approach, while also identifying key areas for improvement to inform future algorithm development and hardware advancements.

Title: Transversal STAR architecture for megaquop-scale quantum simulation with neutral atoms
Authors: Refaat Ismail, I-Chi Chen, Chen Zhao, Ronen Weiss, Fangli Liu, Hengyun Zhou, Sheng-Tao Wang, Andrew Sornborger, Milan Kornjača
Abstract: Quantum computing experiments have made remarkable progress in demonstrating key components of quantum error correction, a prerequisite for scalable quantum computation. While we anticipate the arrival of early fault-tolerant quantum hardware capable of a million reliable quantum operations, the cost of preparing low-noise `magic resource states' presents a formidable challenge. The recently proposed partially-fault-tolerant architecture based on a space-time efficient analog rotation (STAR) approach attempts to address this challenge by using post-selection to prepare low-noise, small-angle magic states. Its proposed physical implementation, however, assumes fixed qubit connectivity, resulting in implementation costs closer to leading fully-fault-tolerant approaches. Here, we propose the transversal STAR architecture and co-design it with neutral-atom quantum hardware, deriving significant savings in logical layout, time, and space overhead. Through circuit-level simulations, we derive the logical noise model for surface-code-based transversal STAR gadgets and verify their composability. At its limit, the transversal STAR architecture can efficiently simulate local Hamiltonians with a total simulation volume exceeding 600. Achieving this limit would require approximately 10,000 physical qubits at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$. This is equivalent to a fully-fault-tolerant computation requiring over $10^6$-$10^7$ $T$ gates. Finally, we extend the transversal STAR architecture to high-rate quantum codes, demonstrating how a limited set of highly parallel transversal Clifford gates and generalized small-angle magic injection can be utilized for effective quantum simulation. We anticipate that the co-designed transversal STAR architecture could substantially reduce the physical resources necessary for early-fault-tolerant quantum simulation at the megaquop scale.

Title: A sharper Magnus expansion bound woven in binary branches
Authors: Harriet Apel, Toby Cubitt, Emilio Onorati
Abstract: The Magnus expansion provides an exponential representation of one-parameter operator families, expressed as a series expansion in its generators. This is useful for example in quantum mechanics for expressing a unitary evolution determined by a time-dependent Hamiltonian generator of the dynamics. The solution is constructed as a series expansion in terms of increasingly complex nested commutators that rapidly become challenging to compute directly. This work establishes a universal upper bound, agnostic to the generator, on the error incurred when the Magnus expansion is truncated at an arbitrary given order. The main technical ingredient of the proof is the binary tree representation introduced by Iserles and Norsett from which we derive a recursion formula to delimit the magnitude of any term in the expansion. We complement our analytic results for the truncation error with explicit calculation of the first 24 terms in the Magnus series, illustrating that they follow the scaling behaviour we have derived. With these findings we aim to contribute to the understanding of the accuracy and limitations of the Magnus expansion technique, and to provide a sharper bound for approximating quantum dynamics without requiring assumptions on the structure of their generators.

Title: Chiral Color Code : Single-shot error correction for exotic topological order
Authors: Dongjin Lee, Beni Yoshida
Abstract: We present a family of simple three-dimensional stabilizer codes, called the chiral color codes, that realize fermionic and chiral topological orders. In the qubit case, the code realizes the topological phase of a single copy of the fermionic toric code. For qudit systems with local dimension $d$, the model features a chiral parameter $\alpha$ and realizes 3D topological phases characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_d^{(\alpha)}$ anyon theories with anomalous chiral surface topological order. On closed manifolds, the code has a unique ground state after removing bulk transparent fermions or bosons. Furthermore, we prove that the bulk is short-range entangled (for odd $d$, coprime $\alpha$) by constructing an explicit local quantum channel that prepares the ground state. The chiral color codes are constructed within the gauge color code, and hence inherit its fault-tolerant features: they admit single-shot error correction and allow code switching to other stabilizer color codes. These properties position the chiral color codes as particularly useful platforms for realizing and manipulating fermions and chiral anyons.

Title: Optimal scheme for distributed quantum metrology
Authors: Zhiyao Hu, Allen Zang, Jianwei Wang, Tian Zhong, Haidong Yuan, Liang Jiang, Zain H. Saleem
Abstract: Optimal strategies for local quantum metrology -- including the preparation of optimal probe states, implementation of optimal control and measurement strategies, are well established. However, for distributed quantum metrology, where the goal is to estimate global properties of multiple spatially distributed parameters, the optimal scheme -- particularly the role of optimal control -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we address this challenge by developing optimal schemes for distributed quantum metrology that characterize the ultimate precision limits in distributed systems. We derive the optimal probe state, optimal control protocols, and measurement strategies in estimating a linear combination of $N$ independent unknown parameters coupled to $d$ networked sensors. Crucially, we prove that the optimal control operations can be implemented locally on each sensor, eliminating the need for non-local control operations across distant nodes. This result significantly reduces the complexity of implementing optimal strategies in distributed quantum metrology. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we apply it to several key scenarios.

Title: Qubit Instrumentation of Entanglement
Authors: Mark Carney
Abstract: This chapter and the experiments described within explore how `human entanglement' might be represented and even emulated by physical entanglement. To achieve this, a notion of `tonal centrality' between two musicians is captured via MIDI and passed as a parameter into a quantum simulation taking place on an embedded device (a Raspberry Pi Pico). The results of these simulations are then coded back into MIDI and sent to the players' instruments. The closer the musicians' tonality is, the more their instruments will be entangled in a $|\Phi^+ \rangle$ state, and the further away they are the more their instruments will be entangled in a $|\Psi^+ \rangle$ state. The intention is to create random parameters that are correlative - \emph{i.e.} the same on both instruments - or anti-correlative - \emph{i.e.} the bit-wise opposite of each other, influenced by the tonal relationship from the players. These random parameters sharing these particular properties add a new dimension for quantum-musical expression. This concept was realised experimentally, and the full code and sample outputs are provided. This work aims to pave the way for musicians to explore and experience quantum emulations of their own musical experiences, adding a new nuance and possibilities for the future of \emph{entangled ensembles.}

Title: Scalable Steady-State Entanglement with Floquet-Engineered Stabilizer Pumping in Neutral Atom Arrays
Authors: F. Q. Guo, Shi-Lei Su, Weibin Li, X. Q. Shao
Abstract: We propose a dissipative protocol for preparing nonequilibrium steady-state entanglement in neutral atom arrays within a Floquet-Lindblad framework. Stabilizer pumping is implemented through noninstantaneous kicks, where each period consists of a short resonant laser pulse followed by a detuned strong $\pi$ pulse that couples the atomic ground state to a Rydberg state. This scheme is intrinsically fast and robust against the Doppler shifts and interatomic spatial fluctuations, as adiabatic requirements on the laser field are avoided. As such the engineered dissipation channels induce a fast decay rate, dramatically accelerating convergence toward the desired steady states. We show that this approach is inherently scalable and enables high-fidelity preparation of arbitrary multipartite graph states in the neutral atom array at zero and finite temperatures. Our study not only facilitates the preparation of resource states for measurement-based quantum computation but also provides a passive error-correction mechanism in the undergoing computation.

Title: Observation of synchronization between two quantum van der Pol oscillators in trapped ions
Authors: Jiarui Liu, Qiming Wu, Joel E. Moore, Hartmut Haeffner, Christopher W. Wächtler
Abstract: Synchronization is a hallmark of nonlinear dynamics. It drives self-organized behavior across systems ranging from astronomy to chemistry. Among the simplest systems, the van der Pol oscillator captures the essence of limit-cycle behavior and forms the basis for diverse physical and biological models. While mutual synchronization has long been established in classical systems, it has yet to be experimentally observed in quantum limit-cycle oscillators, despite a decade of theoretical exploration. Here, we demonstrate synchronization between two quantum van der Pol oscillators using trapped ions. The synchronized state manifests itself as a stable relative phase, while the individual oscillator phases remain inaccessible. In view of potential sensing applications, we investigate the response of the synchronized system to an external field. Our results establish limit-cycle synchronization in the quantum regime and pave the way toward exploring complex synchronized dynamics in larger networks, where persistence of quantum features remains an open question.

Title: Shift of quantum critical point of discrete time crystal on a noisy quantum simulator
Authors: Yuta Hirasaki, Toshinari Itoko, Naoki Kanazawa, Eiji Saitoh
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technology have enabled the simulation of quantum many-body systems on real quantum devices. However, such quantum simulators are inherently subject to decoherence, and its impact on system dynamics - particularly near quantum phase transitions - remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we experimentally investigate how decoherence in quantum devices affects the dynamics of quantum time crystals, using a 156-qubit IBM Quantum system. We find that decoherence shifts the location of critical behavior associated with the phase transition, suggesting that noisy simulations can lead to inaccurate identification of phase boundaries. Our results underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating decoherence to reliably simulate quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.

Title: Machine learning approach to single-shot multiparameter estimation for the non-linear Schrödinger equation
Authors: Louis Rossignol, Tangui Aladjidi, Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Quentin Glorieux
Abstract: The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model for wave dynamics in nonlinear media ranging from optical fibers to Bose-Einstein condensates. Accurately estimating its parameters, which are often strongly correlated, from a single measurement remains a significant challenge. We address this problem by treating parameter estimation as an inverse problem and training a neural network to invert the NLSE mapping. We combine a fast numerical solver with a machine learning approach based on the ConvNeXt architecture and a multivariate Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss function. From single-shot field (density and phase) images, our model estimates three key parameters: the nonlinear coefficient $n_2$, the saturation intensity $I_{sat}$, and the linear absorption coefficient $\alpha$. Trained on 100,000 simulated images, the model achieves a mean absolute error of $3.22\%$ on 12,500 unseen test samples, demonstrating strong generalization and close agreement with ground-truth values. This approach provides an efficient route for characterizing nonlinear systems and has the potential to bridge theoretical modeling and experimental data when realistic noise is incorporated.

Title: Characterizing Noise in Controlling Superconducting Qubits
Authors: Yuanzheng Paul Tan, Yung Szen Yap, Long Hoang Nguyen, Rangga P. Budoyo, Patrick Bore, Kun Hee Park, Christoph Hufnagel, Rainer Dumke
Abstract: Meaningful quantum computing is currently bottlenecked by the error rates of current generation Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. To improve the fidelity of the quantum logic gates, it is essential to recognize the contributions of various sources of errors, including background noise. In this work, we investigate the effects of noise when applied to superconducting qubit control pulses to observe the dependency of the gate fidelity with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We propose a model on how the noise of the control electronics interacts with the qubit system and demonstrate a method for characterizing the noise environment of the qubit control.

Title: Mitigating Phase Correlations in Quantum Key Distribution Using Path-Selection Modulation
Authors: Amita Gnanapandithan, Li Qian, Hoi-Kwong Lo
Abstract: Phase correlations are an under-explored vulnerability in QKD. Here, we present an experimental and simulated characterization of correlations arising from electro-optic phase encoding, over repetition rates up to the GHz level. To mitigate this vulnerability (and all side channels arising from active phase modulators), we propose a "path-selection modulation" source that eliminates the need for active phase modulation altogether. Encoding is achieved by randomly selecting between multiple paths, each path corresponding to one of the desired encoded states. Phase randomization is achieved using gain-switching. We characterize this source at a clock rate of 1 GHz.

Title: Re-uploading quantum data: A universal function approximator for quantum inputs
Authors: Hyunho Cha, Daniel K. Park, Jungwoo Lee
Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.

Title: Universality in fidelity-based quantum metrology
Authors: Luis Aragón-Muñoz, Chryssomalis Chryssomalakos, Ana Gabriela Flores-Delgado, John Martin, Eduardo Serrano-Ensástiga
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the quantum spin states that are the optimal sensors of a given transformation averaged over all possible orientations of the spin system. Our geometric approach to the problem is based on a fidelity criterion and is entirely general, encompassing both unitary transformations (such as rotations and squeezing) and non-unitary transformations (such as Lorentz boosts). This formalism leads to a universality result: There exists a zero-measure subset of states that will be optimal sensors for certain transformations and the worst sensors for others, and this set does not depend on the transformation under consideration. In other words, some spin states are simply the best (or worst) sensors, regardless of what they detect.

Title: Robust quantum communication through lossy microwave links
Authors: James D. Teoh, Nathanael Cottet, Patrick Winkel, Luke D. Burkhart, Luigi Frunzio, Robert J. Schoelkopf
Abstract: Entanglement generation lies at the heart of many quantum networking protocols as it enables distributed and modular quantum computing. For superconducting qubits, entanglement fidelity is typically limited by photon loss in the links that connect these qubits together. We propose and realize a new scheme for heralded entanglement generation that almost entirely circumvents this limit. We produce Bell states with $92\pm1\%$ state fidelity, including state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, between separated superconducting bosonic qubits in a high-loss regime where direct deterministic state transfer fails. Our scheme exploits simple but fundamental physics found in microwave links, specifically the ability to treat our communication channel as a single standing wave mode. Combining this with local measurements on bosonically encoded qubits allows us to herald entanglement with success probabilities approaching the scheme's upper limit of 50% per attempt. We then use the heralded Bell state as a resource to deterministically teleport a qubit between modules with an average state transfer fidelity of $90\pm1\%$. This is achieved despite the link possessing a direct single photon transfer efficiency of 2%. Our work informs the design of future superconducting quantum networks, by demonstrating fast coupling rates and low loss links are no longer strict requirements for high-fidelity quantum communication in the microwave regime.

Title: Compressed Permutation Oracles
Authors: Joseph Carolan
Abstract: The analysis of quantum algorithms which query random, invertible permutations has been a long-standing challenge in cryptography. Many techniques which apply to random oracles fail, or are not known to generalize to this setting. As a result, foundational cryptographic constructions involving permutations often lack quantum security proofs. With the aim of closing this gap, we develop and prove soundness of a compressed permutation oracle. Our construction shares many of the attractive features of Zhandry's original compressed function oracle: the purification is a small list of input-output pairs which meaningfully reflect an algorithm's knowledge of the oracle. We then apply this framework to show that the Feistel construction with seven rounds is a strong quantum PRP, resolving an open question of (Zhandry, 2012). We further re-prove essentially all known quantum query lower bounds in the random permutation model, notably the collision and preimage resistance of both Sponge and Davies-Meyer, hardness of double-sided zero search and sparse predicate search, and give new lower bounds for cycle finding and the one-more problem.

Authors: Jose Blanchet, Mark S. Squillante, Mario Szegedy, Guanyang Wang
Abstract: This tutorial paper introduces quantum approaches to Monte Carlo computation with applications in computational finance. We outline the basics of quantum computing using Grover's algorithm for unstructured search to build intuition. We then move slowly to amplitude estimation problems and applications to counting and Monte Carlo integration, again using Grover-type iterations. A hands-on Python/Qiskit implementation illustrates these concepts applied to finance. The paper concludes with a discussion on current challenges in scaling quantum simulation techniques.

Title: Scalable bayesian shadow tomography for quantum property estimation with set transformers
Authors: Hyunho Cha, Wonjung Kim, Jungwoo Lee
Abstract: A scalable Bayesian machine learning framework is introduced for estimating scalar properties of an unknown quantum state from measurement data, which bypasses full density matrix reconstruction. This work is the first to integrate the classical shadows protocol with a permutation-invariant set transformer architecture, enabling the approach to predict and correct bias in existing estimators to approximate the true Bayesian posterior mean. Measurement outcomes are encoded as fixed-dimensional feature vectors, and the network outputs a residual correction to a baseline estimator. Scalability to large quantum systems is ensured by the polynomial dependence of input size on system size and number of measurements. On Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state fidelity and second-order Rényi entropy estimation tasks -- using random Pauli and random Clifford measurements -- this Bayesian estimator always achieves lower mean squared error than classical shadows alone, with more than a 99\% reduction in the few copy regime.

Title: Barycentric decompositions for extensive monotone divergences
Authors: Erkka Haapasalo
Abstract: We study sets of divergences or dissimilarity measures in a generalized real-algebraic setting which includes the cases of classical and quantum multivariate divergences. We show that a special subset of divergences, the so-called test spectrum, characterizes the rest of the divergences through barycentres and that the extreme points of relevant convex subsets of general divergences are contained within the test spectrum. Only some special parts of the test spectrum may contain non-extreme elements. We are able to fully characterize the test spectrum in the case of classical multivariate divergences. The quantum case is much more varied, and we demonstrate that essentially all the bivariate and multivariate quantum divergences suggested previously in literature are within the test spectrum and extreme within the set of all quantum (multivariate) divergences. This suggests that the variability of quantum divergences is real since all the previously suggested divergences are independent of each other.

Title: Overcoming limitations on gate fidelity in noisy static exchange-coupled surface qubits
Authors: Hoang-Anh Le, Saba Taherpour, Denis Janković, Christoph Wolf
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrated that the spin state of individual atoms on surfaces can be quantum-coherently controlled through all-electric electron spin resonance. By constructing interacting arrays of atoms this results in an atomic-scale qubit platform. However, the static exchange coupling between qubits, limited lifetime and polarization of the initial state, impose significant limits on high-fidelity quantum control. We address this issue using open quantum systems simulation and quantum optimal control theory. We demonstrate the conditions under which high-fidelity operations ($\mathcal{F} \gtrsim 0.9$) are feasible in this qubit platform, and show how the Krotov method of quantum optimal control theory adapts to specific noise sources to outperform the conventional Rabi drivings. Finally, we re-examine the experimental setup used in the initial demonstration of this qubit platform and propose optimized experimental designs to maximize gate fidelity in this platform.

Title: Bell state measurements in quantum optics: a review of recent progress and open challenges
Authors: Luca Bianchi, Carlo Marconi, Davide Bacco
Abstract: Bell state measurements, which project bipartite qubit systems onto the maximally entangled Bell basis, are central to a wide range of quantum information processing tasks, including quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, and fusion-gate quantum computation. In photonic quantum platforms, where information is encoded in optical degrees of freedom, the realization of efficient Bell state measurements is particularly challenging, especially when constrained to linear optical elements. In this review, we provide a comprehensive examination of existing proposals for implementing Bell state measurements, highlighting their fundamental limitations and the strategies developed to overcome them. Additionally, we survey recent advances in Bell state measurements for high-dimensional systems, an area of growing interest due to its relevance in scalable quantum networks and high-capacity quantum communication.

Title: Virtual Quantum Markov Chain of four-qubit systems
Authors: Zhixing Chen, Lin Chen
Abstract: We extend the framework of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs) from tripartite systems to the four-qubit setting. Structural criteria such as the kernel-inclusion condition are analyzed, showing that they are necessary but not sufficient for the existence of a valid recovery map. By explicit examples, we demonstrate that the four-qubit W state admits a recovery channel and thus qualifies as a VQMC, while the GHZ state does not. We further provide semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations to test recoverability and quantify sampling overhead, and establish the non-convexity of the VQMC set through mixed-state counterexamples. These results supply both theoretical insights and computational tools for studying correlations and recoverability in multipartite quantum systems.

Title: Quantum-memory-assisted on-demand microwave-optical transduction
Authors: Hai-Tao Tu, Kai-Yu Liao, Si-Yuan Qiu, Xiao-Hong Liu, Yi-Qi Guo, Zheng-Qi Du, Yang Xu, Xin-Ding Zhang, Hui Yan, Shi-Liang Zhu
Abstract: Microwave-optical transducers and quantum memories are fundamental components of quantum repeaters, essential for developing a quantum internet in which solid-state quantum computers serve as nodes interconnected by optical fibers for data transmission. Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles in quantum information processing.

Title: Trading modes against energy
Authors: Lukas Brenner, Beatriz Dias, Robert Koenig
Abstract: We ask how much energy is required to weakly simulate an $n$-qubit quantum circuit (i.e., produce samples from its output distribution) by a unitary circuit in a hybrid qubit-oscillator model. The latter consists of a certain number of bosonic modes coupled to a constant number of qubits by a Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. We find that efficient approximate weak simulation of an $n$-qubit quantum circuit of polynomial size with inverse polynomial error is possible with (1) a linear number of bosonic modes and a polynomial amount of energy, or (2) a sublinear (polynomial) number of modes and a subexponential amount of energy, or (3) a constant number of modes and an exponential amount of energy. Our construction encodes qubits into high-dimensional approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. It provides new insight into the trade-off between system size (i.e., number of modes) and the amount of energy required to perform quantum computation in the continuous-variable setting.

Title: Braiding of dynamical eigenvalues of Hermitian bosonic Kitaev chains
Authors: Heming Wang, Shanhui Fan
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and the spectra are restricted to be real. However, the dynamics of the underlying fields may allow complex eigenvalues and therefore create the possibility of braiding structures. Here we study the braiding of dynamical eigenvalues in quantum systems by considering Hermitian bosonic Kitaev chains with multiple bands. The dynamics of the quantum fields in these systems are described by their dynamic matrices, which have complex eigenvalues. We show that there are symmetry constraints imposed on these dynamic eigenvalues. Despite these constraints, braiding is possible for frequencies within the effective gain and loss regions of the complex plane. We explicitly construct two- and three-strand braidings using the exceptional points found in the system and discuss possible implementations.

Authors: Pierre Rouchon
Abstract: A detailed analysis of the diffusive Stochastic Master Equation (SME) for qubit/cavity systems with dispersive coupling is provided. This analysis incorporates classical input signals and output signals (measurement outcomes through homodyne detection). The dynamics of the qubit/cavity density operator is shown to converge exponentially towards a slow invariant manifold, parameterized via a time-varying deterministic Kraus map by the density operator of a fictitious qubit. This fictitious qubit is governed by a SME incorporating the classical input/output signals. Extension where the qubit is replaced by any qudit dispersively coupled to an arbitrary set of modes with collective input/output classical signals.

Abstract: An integer winding, i.e., topological charge, is a characteristic of skyrmions, which are topologically nontrivial spin patterns in magnets. They emerge when smooth two-dimensional spin configurations are stabilized by conflicting interactions such as exchange, anisotropy, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, or geometric frustration. These nanoscale textures, which are typically a few to tens of nanometers in size, are strong 'particle-like' excitations because they are shielded by energy barriers connected to their topology. By exploiting their helicity, i.e., spin rotation angle or associated internal modes, as a two-level system, skyrmions can function as quantum bits or qubits. Two quantized helicity states of a nanometer-scale skyrmion encode the logical value states in a 'skyrmion qubit.' Interestingly, skyrmion qubits are topologically protected and macroscopic, i.e., they involve a large number of spins; however, external influences can still affect them. When the texture is tiny and disconnected, the helicity angle of the skyrmion becomes quantized. A qubit basis is made up of the lowest two energy eigenstates, i.e., symmetric or antisymmetric superpositions of opposite helicity, for example. Therefore, Skyrmion textures can provide valuable insights for different purposes. However, is it possible to synthetically generate skyrmion textures using quantum computing? This paper investigates the possibility and generates a few hundred different textures, producing sample comparisons from various types, which indicate a novel direction for skyrmion-based research based on quantum randomness and other criteria.

Title: Quantum Annealing for Minimum Bisection Problem: A Machine Learning-based Approach for Penalty Parameter Tuning
Authors: Renáta Rusnáková, Martin Chovanec, Juraj Gazda
Abstract: The Minimum Bisection Problem is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, with practical applications in areas such as parallel computing, network design, and machine learning. In this paper, we examine the potential of using D-Wave Systems' quantum annealing solvers to solve the Minimum Bisection Problem, which we formulate as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization model. A key challenge in this formulation lies in choosing an appropriate penalty parameter, as it plays a crucial role in ensuring both the quality of the solution and the satisfaction of the problem's constraints. To address this, we introduce a novel machine learning-based approach for adaptive tuning of the penalty parameter. Specifically, we use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model trained to predict suitable penalty parameter values based on structural properties of the input graph, the number of nodes and the graph's density. This method enables the penalty parameter to be adjusted dynamically for each specific problem instance, improving the solver's ability to balance the competing goals of minimizing the cut size and maintaining equally sized partitions. We test our approach on a large dataset of randomly generated Erdős-Rényi graphs with up to 4,000 nodes, and we compare the results with classical partitioning algorithms, Metis and Kernighan-Lin. Experimental findings demonstrate that our adaptive tuning strategy significantly improves the performance of the quantum annealing hybrid solver and consistently outperforms the classical methods used, indicating its potential as an alternative for the graph partitioning problem.

Title: High harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Philipp Stammer
Abstract: Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate.

Title: Improving QAOA to find approximate QUBO solutions in O(1) shots
Authors: A. Yu. Chernyavskiy, D. A. Kulikov, B. I. Bantysh, Yu. I. Bogdanov, A. K. Fedorov, E. O. Kiktenko
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides one of the most promising quantum frameworks for addressing discrete optimization problems with broad real-world applications, particularly quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. However, the widely used hybrid quantum--classical implementation faces significant challenges due to statistical noise and barren plateaus. A prominent approach to mitigate these issues is fixed-point QAOA (fpQAOA), where circuit parameters are trained on small problem instances and subsequently transferred to larger ones. In this work, we develop a modified fpQAOA scheme that combines (i) considering the probability of achieving a target approximation ratio (AR) rather than requiring the exact optimum, (ii) setting the number of layers equal to the problem size with the sine--cosine encoding of QAOA angles, and (iii) rescaling the problem coefficient matrices to unit Frobenius norm. We demonstrate that this combination leads to a decreasing median number of shots required to obtain approximate solutions as the problem size increases, with ARs being within a few percent from the optimum for the considered problem classes. Extrapolation of these results suggests an $O(1)$ shot complexity while retaining at most quadratic circuit depth, underscoring the potential of our approach to overcome key bottlenecks in QAOA implementations and scalability estimations. Remarkably, omitting even a single one of the modifications (i)--(iii) results in exponential growth of the number of shots required as the problem size increases.

Title: Nonadiabatic processes in dynamical controls
Authors: Yoshiaki Teranishi, Satoshi Morita, Seiji Miyashita
Abstract: In the real-time manipulation of quantum states, it is necessary to dynamically control the parameters of the system's Hamiltonian, which is a highly nontrivial task. We have studied the survival probability during the conveyance of a particle by a trapping potential, where the particle may escape from the potential well due to quantum mechanical processes (Morita et al., Phys. Rev. Research 6, 043329 (2024)). We pointed out that the escape mechanisms can be classified into two categories. One is an initial disturbance caused by a non-analytic change of parameters at the starting point, the significance of which had been pointed out earlier by one of the authors (Morita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 104001 (2007)). The other is adiabatic tunneling, a phenomenon that occurs due to quantum tunneling during the acceleration process. We have proposed a formula for the survival probability as a function of acceleration protocols, taking both mechanisms into account. In this paper, we quantitatively examine the survival probabilities in conveyance processes. Surprisingly, we find that the decay behaviors under different acceleration protocols are almost perfectly explained by the combined effects of the initial and final disturbances, together with an integral form of adiabatic tunneling throughout the transport process. Therefore, once these disturbance factors and the adiabatic tunneling contribution are determined, the survival probability for any acceleration protocol can be estimated without performing dynamical simulations for each individual case. We also analyze the effects of the disturbances at the initial and final points from the perspective of adiabatic theory.

Title: Quantum Autoencoder: An efficient approach to quantum feature map generation
Authors: Shengxin Zhuang, Yusen Wu, Xavier F. Cadet, Du Q. Huynh, Wei Liu, Philippe Charton, Cedric Damour, Frederic Cadet, Jingbo B. Wang
Abstract: Quantum machine learning methods often rely on fixed, hand-crafted quantum encodings that may not capture optimal features for downstream tasks. In this work, we study the power of quantum autoencoders in learning data-driven quantum representations. We first theoretically demonstrate that the quantum autoencoder method is efficient in terms of sample complexity throughout the entire training process. Then we numerically train the quantum autoencoder on 3 million peptide sequences, and evaluate their effectiveness across multiple peptide classification problems including antihypertensive peptide prediction, blood-brain barrier-penetration, and cytotoxic activity detection. The learned representations were compared against Hamiltonian-evolved baselines using a quantum kernel with support vector machines. Results show that quantum autoencoder learned representations achieve accuracy improvements ranging from 0.4\% to 8.1\% over Hamiltonian baselines across seven datasets, demonstrating effective generalization to diverse downstream datasets with pre-training enabling effective transfer learning without task-specific fine-tuning. This work establishes that quantum autoencoder architectures can effectively learn from large-scale datasets (3 million samples) with compact parameterizations ($\sim$900 parameters), demonstrating their viability for practical quantum applications.

Title: Who Let the Diamonds Out?
Authors: Vincent Halde, Olivier Bernard, Mathieu Brochu, Laurier Dufresne, Nicolas Fleury, Kayla Johnson, Benjamin Moffet, David Roy-Guay
Abstract: Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center magnetometry is a highly promising quantum sensing technology, with early prototypes demonstrating impressive sensitivity in compact sensing heads. Yet, most existing implementations remain tied to laboratory setups, lacking the portability and environmental robustness needed to unlock their full potential in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a fully portable, hand-held NV-based magnetometer that delivers a vector sensitivity of approximately 400 pT/sqrt(Hz), heading errors below 5 nT in Earth's field, and a wide signal bandwidth that supports on-field recalibration and operation on moving platforms. We further demonstrate the system's technological maturity through environmental qualification such as thermal, vibration, radiation and other operational stresses related to deployment in low Earth orbit, and through successful deployments in demanding scenarios, including northern Canadian weather conditions, drone-mounted surveys and high-altitude balloon flights. Together, these achievements establish this NV-based magnetometer as a robust, versatile tool ready to bring quantum sensing performance to a broad range of field and autonomous applications.

Title: Quantum Krylov Algorithm for Szegö Quadrature
Authors: William Kirby, Yizhi Shen, Daan Camps, Anirban Chowdhury, Katherine Klymko, Roel Van Beeumen
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm to evaluate matrix elements of functions of unitary operators. The method is based on calculating quadrature nodes and weights using data collected from a quantum processor. Given a unitary $U$ and quantum states $|\psi_0\rangle$, $|\psi_1\rangle$, the resulting quadrature rules form a functional that can then be used to classically approximate $\langle\psi_1|f(U)|\psi_0\rangle$ for any function $f$. In particular, the algorithm calculates Szegö quadrature rules, which, when $f$ is a Laurent polynomial, have the optimal relation between degree of $f$ and number of distinct quantum circuits required. The unitary operator $U$ could approximate a time evolution, opening the door to applications like estimating properties of Hamiltonian spectra and Gibbs states, but more generally could be any operator implementable via a quantum circuit. We expect this algorithm to be useful as a subroutine in other quantum algorithms, much like quantum signal processing or the quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitaries. Key advantages of our algorithm are that it does not require approximating $f$ directly, via a series expansion or in any other way, and once the output functional has been constructed using the quantum algorithm, it can be applied to any $f$ classically after the fact.

Title: Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Two-level Systems directly after Cryogenic Alternating Bias

Abstract: Two-level systems (TLSs) are tunneling states commonly found in amorphous materials that electrically couple to qubits, resonators, and vibrational modes in materials, leading to energy loss in those systems. Recent studies suggest that applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure, potentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study, we probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS dynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the strongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric field. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their densities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the steady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating bias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency fluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these effects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a reversible mechanism. Importantly, the intrinsic loss tangent of the LC oscillator remains unchanged before and after the application of the alternating bias. We propose that the disappearance of the steady-state spectrum are caused by non-equilibrium energy build up from strain in the oxide film introduced by the pulsed voltage bias sequence. Understanding this non-equilibrium energy could inform future models of time-dependent TLS dynamics.

Title: Not All Qubits are Utilized Equally
Authors: Jeremie Pope, Swaroop Ghosh
Abstract: Improvements to the functionality of modern Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers have coincided with an increase in the total number of physical qubits. Quantum programmers do not commonly design circuits that directly utilize these qubits; instead, they rely on various software suites to algorithmically transpile the circuit into one compatible with a target machine's architecture. For connectivity-constrained superconducting architectures in particular, the chosen syntheses, layout, and routing algorithms used to transpile a circuit drastically change the average utilization patterns of physical qubits. In this paper, we analyze average qubit utilization of a quantum hardware as a means to identify how various transpiler configurations change utilization patterns. We present the preliminary results of this analysis using IBM's 27-qubit Falcon R4 architecture on the Qiskit platform for a subset of qubits, gate distributions, and optimization configurations. We found a persistent bias towards trivial mapping, which can be addressed through increased optimization provided that the overall utilization of an architecture remains below a certain threshold. As a result, some qubits are overused whereas other remain underused. The implication of our study are many-fold namely, (a) potential reduction in calibration overhead by focusing on overused qubits, (b) refining optimization, mapping and routing algorithms to maximize the hardware utilization and (c) pricing underused qubits at low rate to motivate their usage and improve hardware throughput (applicable in multi-tenant environments).

Title: Uniqueness of Complementary Recovery in Holographic Error-Correcting Codes
Authors: Julia Jones, Jason Pollack
Abstract: Holographic codes are a type of error-correcting code with extra geometric structure ensured by a ``complementary recovery'' property: given a division of the physical Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ into $\mathcal{H}_A$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}$, and an algebra of physical operators $\mathcal{M}\subseteq (\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_A)\otimes I_{\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}})$, the logical operators in $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_L)\simeq \mathcal{L}(P\mathcal{H})$ which can be created by acting in $\mathcal{M}$ are identical to the logical operators whose expectation values cannot be altered by acting in the commutant $\mathcal{M}^\prime$, and vice versa. In arXiv:2110.14691, a uniqueness theorem was stated: the only possible tuple of (code, bipartition, algebra) which can exhibit complementary recovery is the maximal one $\mathcal{M}=P(\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_A)\otimes I_{\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}})P$. We point out a counterexample to this result, using a ``non-adjacent'' bipartition of a four-qubit code proposed in arXiv:2110.14691. We show that the failure of uniqueness is due to a failure to enforce error correction against erasure of $\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}$, which requires enforcing the algebraic Knill-Laflamme condition $[P E_i^\dagger E_j P,\mathcal{M}]=0$ for each pair of error operators. When we add the additional requirement that $\mathcal{M}$ be correctable with respect to this channel, uniqueness is restored, and we re-prove the theorem of arXiv:2110.14691 with this added assumption. We present the list of bipartitions of the ``atomic'' holographic codes in arXiv:2110.14691 in which the correctability assumption can be violated.

Title: Extension of the Jordan-Wigner mapping to nonorthogonal spin orbitals for quantum computing application to valence bond approaches
Authors: Alessia Marruzzo, Mosè Casalegno, Piero Macchi, Fabio Mascherpa, Bernardino Tirri, Guido Raos, Alessandro Genoni
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising platform to address the computational challenges inherent in quantum chemistry, and particularly in valence bond (VB) methods, which are chemically appealing but suffer from high computational cost due to the use of nonorthogonal orbitals. While various fermionic-to-spin mappings exist for orthonormal spin orbitals, such as the widely used Jordan-Wigner transformations, an analogous framework for nonorthogonal spin orbitals remains undeveloped. In this work, we propose an alternative Jordan-Wigner-type mapping tailored for the nonorthogonal case, with the goal of enabling efficient quantum simulations of VB-type wavefunctions. Our approach paves the way towards the development of chemically interpretable and computationally feasible valence bond algorithms on near-term quantum devices. An initial theoretical analysis and a preliminary application demonstrate the feasibility of this encoding and its potential for extending the applicability of VB methods to larger and more complex systems.

Title: Localization and topological signatures under periodic twisting
Authors: James Walkling, Antonio Štrkalj, F. Nur Ünal
Abstract: We theoretically explore a dynamical generalization of the Aubry-André model in two dimensions formed by superimposing two square-lattice potentials. Motivated by the rich physics emerging at different twist angles between the two lattices at equilibrium, we introduce periodic twisting by continuously rotating one of the lattices with respect to the other in the plane. We demonstrate that the distinct time-dependent twisting in this system gives rise to an intricate form of periodic multi-frequency driving that changes with the distance from the rotation axis. We find that the incommensurate nature of the potential no longer plays the pivotal role as it does in the static case. Rather, the tunneling can be understood in terms of a local, spatially varying dynamical localization effect, which we show to yield ring-shaped states localized within the bulk that have interesting transport signatures. Quantifying the eigenstates with the Bott index and local Chern marker, we find that there is a zoo of states with non-trivial topological signatures, the most ubiquitous of which result in relatively uniform ring-shaped regions of the Chern marker. We investigate the origin of these effects from various angles and identify that hybridization between different delocalized ring states plays a vital role. Lastly, we discuss possible experimental realizations in quantum simulation settings. Our results open a new avenue of investigation with periodic twisting inducing a spatially varying multi-frequency drive.

Title: A Quantum Computational Determination of the Weak Mixing Angle in the Standard Model
Authors: Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin
Abstract: The weak mixing angle $s_W$ is a fundamental constant in the Standard Model (SM) and measured at the $Z$ boson mass to be $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z) = 0.23129 \pm 0.00004$ in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ renormalization scheme, where $m_Z=91.2\ \text{GeV}$. On the other hand, non-stabilizerness - the magic - characterizes the computational advantage of a quantum system over classical computers. We consider the production of magic from stabilizer initial states, which carry zero magic, in the 2-to-2 scattering of charged leptons in the SM at the tree level, which is mediated by the photon and the $Z$ boson. Using the second order stabilizer Rényi entropy, and averaging over all 60 initial stabilizer states and the scattering angle, we compute and minimize the magic production as a function of $s^2_W$ in the Møller scattering $e^-e^-\to e^-e^-$, which is free of kinematic thresholds. At the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=m_Z$, there is a unique minimum in magic production at $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W(m_Z)=0.2317$, which agrees with the measured $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z)$ at the sub-percent level. At higher energies, the magic-minimizing $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W$ continues to agree with the empirical value at the percent level or better, up to 10 TeV. The finding suggests the electroweak sector of the SM tends to generate minimal quantum resources from the computational viewpoint.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization in 1+1-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled with Dynamical Fermions
Authors: Diptarka Das, Lukas Ebner, Saurabh V. Kadam, Indrakshi Raychowdhury, Andreas Schäfer, Xiaojun Yao
Abstract: We test the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in 1+1-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with one flavor of dynamical fermions. Using the loop-string-hadron framework of the LGT with a bosonic cut-off, we exactly diagonalize the Hamiltonian for finite size systems and calculate matrix elements (MEs) in the eigenbasis for both local and non-local operators. We analyze different indicators to identify the parameter space for quantum chaos at finite lattice sizes and investigate how the ETH behavior emerges in both the diagonal and off-diagonal MEs. Our investigations allow us to study various time scales of thermalization and the emergence of random matrix behavior, and highlight the interplays of the several diagnostics with each other. Furthermore, from the off-diagonal MEs, we extract a smooth function that is closely related to the spectral function for both local and non-local operators. We find numerical evidence of the spectral gap and the memory peak in the non-local operator case. Finally, we investigate aspects of subsystem ETH in the lattice gauge theory and identify certain features in the subsystem reduced density matrix that are unique to gauge theories.

Title: Physics-informed time series analysis with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks under Ehrenfest constraints
Authors: Abhijit Sen, Illya V. Lukin, Kurt Jacobs, Lev Kaplan, Andrii G. Sotnikov, Denys I. Bondar
Abstract: The prediction of quantum dynamical responses lies at the heart of modern physics. Yet, modeling these time-dependent behaviors remains a formidable challenge because quantum systems evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, often rendering traditional numerical methods computationally prohibitive. While large language models have achieved remarkable success in sequential prediction, quantum dynamics presents a fundamentally different challenge: forecasting the entire temporal evolution of quantum systems rather than merely the next element in a sequence. Existing neural architectures such as recurrent and convolutional networks often require vast training datasets and suffer from spurious oscillations that compromise physical interpretability. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally new approach: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) augmented with physics-informed loss functions that enforce the Ehrenfest theorems. Our method achieves superior accuracy with significantly less training data: it requires only 5.4 percent of the samples (200) compared to Temporal Convolution Networks (3,700). We further introduce the Chain of KANs, a novel architecture that embeds temporal causality directly into the model design, making it particularly well-suited for time series modeling. Our results demonstrate that physics-informed KANs offer a compelling advantage over conventional black-box models, maintaining both mathematical rigor and physical consistency while dramatically reducing data requirements.

Title: Exceptional-point-induced dynamic sensitivity to particle-number parity
Authors: J. Y. Liu-Sun, Z. Song
Abstract: As an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, the existence of exceptional points (EPs) depends not only on the details of the Hamiltonian but also on the particle-number filling and the particle statistics. In this paper, we study many-particle EPs in a Bose Hubbard chain with two end-site resonant imaginary potentials. Starting from a single-particle coalescing eigenstate, we construct $n$-particle condensate eigenstates for the cases with zero and infinite $U$. Compared with the free bosonic case, where the $ n $-particle condensate eigenstate is an $(n+1)$-th-order coalescing state, the hardcore-boson counterpart is a second-order coalescing state for odd $n$ , while it is not for even $n$. The difference in particle-number parity results in distinct quenching dynamics of the condensate states, highlighting the role of parity in system behavior. Our finding may stimulate research on the dynamic sensitivity to particle-number parity.

Title: A Verified Compiler for Quantum Simulation
Authors: Liyi Li, Fenfen An, Federico Zahariev, Zhi Xiang Chong, Amr Sabry, Mark Gordon
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a central application of quantum computing, with significant potential in modeling physical systems and solving complex optimization problems. Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus on low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability and offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation pipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for compiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second quantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum particle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety and correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and enforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both digital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics, from static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue, including its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are fully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end verified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation.

Title: Octahedral dynamics and local symmetry in hybrid perovskite FAPbI3 under thermal excitation
Authors: H. Joshi, K. C. Bhamu, A. Shankar, Rana Biswas, M. Wlazło
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have been employed to investigate the evolution of local motifs within the tetragonal phase of FAPbI3 under thermal excitation. Our results reveal a distinct broadening in the distribution of PbI6 octahedral volumes with increasing temperature, indicating a gradual breakdown of symmetry and emergence of diverse local environments. These octahedral volume distortions are primarily driven by the dynamic behaviour of the FA cation leading to softening of PbI6 octahedra, evident from calculated mean octahedral volume and Pb-I-Pb bond angles. The examination of electronic structure confirmed that this dynamic structural phenomenon is directly responsible for the change in fundamental band gap value, highlighting the role of PbI6 octahedra in modifying and modulating the electronic properties in FAPbI3. The results demonstrate the microscopic origin of thermally induced dynamical behaviour to the macroscopic electronic properties and underscore the pivotal role of local motifs in hybrid perovskites.

Title: Cusp solitons mediated by a topological nonlinearity
Authors: Harvey Cao, Daniel Leykam
Abstract: Nonlinearity in the Schrödinger equation gives rise to rich phenomena such as soliton formation, modulational instability, and self-organization in diverse physical systems. Motivated by recent advances in engineering nonlinear gauge fields in Bose-Einstein condensates, we introduce a nonlinear Schrödinger model whose dynamics are dependent on the curvature of the wavefunction intensity and show that this has a direct link to a topological quantity from persistent homology. Our model energetically penalizes or favours the formation of local extrema and we demonstrate through numerical simulations that this topological nonlinearity leads to the emergence of robust, cusp-like soliton structures and supports flat-top beams which do not suffer from conventional modulational instability. These findings suggest that topological nonlinearities could serve as a versatile tool for controlling nonlinear waves in optics and Bose-Einstein condensates.

Authors: Brandon J. Sandoval, Andrew D. Beyer, Pierre M. Echternach, Sunil R. Golwala, William D. Ho, Lanqing Yuan, Karthik Ramanathan
Abstract: Phonon sensitive superconducting qubits promise to provide sub-eV energy deposit thresholds, useful for future rare-event experiments looking for interactions from dark matter and neutrinos. We detail here engineering results from a Quantum Parity Detector (QPDs), one of a class of phonon sensitive qubits, and, as a first measurement, show that this device has a quiescent quasiparticle density of $1.8 \pm 0.8 \mu \mathrm{m}^{-3}$, in line with expectation. We also outline an argon ion-mill process for multi-step Josephson Junction fabrication, expanding the sparse literature on this topic, which proves useful in avoiding secondary parasitic junctions.

Title: Magnon-photon coupling in the YIG-based disk and ring microcavities
Authors: S.S. Demirchyan, D.M. Krichevsky, V.I. Belotelov
Abstract: Optomagnonic dielectric resonators offer a promising platform for the bidirectional conversion of microwave and optical photons at the single quantum level. Current implementation of such a conversion lacks from low magneto-optical interaction strength, limiting its practical utilization in quantum technologies. The main bottleneck is the small spatial overlap between optical and magnon modes. Here, we show that utilization of a disk and ring geometries notably increases the mode overlap. We analyze the interaction volume of optical whispering gallery and magnon Kittel modes inside yttrium iron garnet disk and ring microcavities of various sizes and found a significant improvement in modes coupling up to $\sim4.5~kHz$ . Maximal theoretical conversion efficiency for small disks with radius $5~\mu m$ can reach unity for optimal optical power $\sim100~\mu W$, which is experimentally feasible. Strategies for further improvements of interactions are discussed.

Title: Size-dependent critical localization
Authors: Hui-Qiang Liang, Linhu Li, Guo-Fu Xu
Abstract: Studying critical states in quasiperiodic systems is of great importance in localization physics. Previously identified critical states share a common characteristic: they exhibit persistent critical features in the thermodynamic limit. In this Letter, we predict an exotic type of critical state, termed size-dependent critical states, which exhibit a fundamentally distinct behavior. Specifically, they display critical localization signatures only at finite sizes, but transition to Anderson localization in the thermodynamic limit. We establish that the physical origin of size-dependent critical states lies in the synergistic interplay between local non-reciprocal domain wall and NHSE. By revealing a critical phase that challenges the established paradigm of critical localization, our work opens new avenues for exploring localization phenomena in quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Intrinsic-perturbation induced anomalous higher-order boundary states in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Hui-Qiang Liang, Zuxuan Ou, Linhu Li, Guo-Fu Xu
Abstract: The behavior of higher-order boundary states in non-Hermitian systems is elusive and thereby finding the mechanism behind these states is both essential and significant. Here, we uncover a novel mechanism that induces anomalous higher-order boundary states. The mechanism originates from the sensitivity of the non-normal boundary Hamiltonian to intrinsic perturbations, where intrinsic perturbations here refer to the influence of the bulk on the topological boundaries. Based on the mechanism, we reveal a new kind of phase transition, i.e., the transition between hybrid skin-topological states and scale-free topological boundary states. We also find that scale-free topological boundary states exhibit size-dependent spectra, influencing the existence of higher-order topological boundary states. Unlike conventional hybrid skin-topological states or higher-order non-Hermitian skin effect, the above two kinds of anomalous higher-order boundary states exhibit size-dependent characteristics. Our work opens a new horizon for the control of higher-order boundary states and topological properties of non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Impact of Static Disorder and Dephasing on Quantum Transport in LH1-RC Models
Authors: Stephon Alexander, Roger Andrews, Oliver Fox, Sarben Sarkar
Abstract: We numerically study excitation transfer in an artificial LH1--RC complex -- an $N$-site donor ring coupled to a central acceptor -- driven by a narrowband optical mode and evolved under a Lindblad master equation with loss and dephasing. In the absence of disorder, the light-driven system exhibits a tall, narrow on-resonance efficiency peak (near unity for our parameters); dephasing lowers and narrows this peak without shifting its position. Off resonance, the efficiency shows environmentally assisted transport with a clear non-monotonic dependence on dephasing and a finite optimum. Under static disorder, two regimes emerge: photon--ring coupling and diagonal energetic disorder mix the drive into dark ring modes, activate dissipative channels, and depress efficiency over a detuning window, whereas intra-ring coupling disorder has a much smaller impact in the tested range; increasing the intra-ring coupling $g$ moves dark-mode crossings away from the operating detuning and restores near-peak performance. In the ordered, symmetric, single-excitation, narrowband limit we \emph{analytically derive} closed-form transfer efficiencies by projecting onto the $k{=}0$ bright mode and solving the photon--bright mode--acceptor trimer via a Laplace/linear-algebra (determinant) formula; these expressions include a probability-conservation identity $\eta + \sum_k L_k = 1$ that benchmarks the simulations and quantitatively predicts the resonant line shape and its dephasing-induced narrowing. A minimal ring toy model further reproduces coherent trapping and its relief by moderate dephasing (ENAQT). These analytics are exact in the ordered limit and serve as mechanistic guides outside this limit, yielding practical design rules for robust, bio-inspired light-harvesting devices.

Title: Intrinsic Heisenberg Lower Bounds on Schwarzschild and Weyl-Class Spacelike Slices
Authors: Thomas Schürmann
Abstract: We establish a coordinate-invariant Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r_g$ on horizon-regular spacelike slices of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat (AF) black-holes. Via a variance-eigenvalue equivalence the momentum uncertainty reduces to the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, yielding a slice-uniform Hardy baseline $\sigma_p r_g \ge \hbar/2$ under mild convexity assumptions on the balls; the bound is never attained and admits a positive gap both on compact interior regions and uniformly far out. For the Schwarzschild Painlevé-Gullstrand (PG) slice, whose induced 3-geometry is Euclidean, one recovers the exact Euclidean scale $\sigma_p r_g \ge \pi\hbar$, which is optimal among all admissible slices. The entire construction extends across the black-hole horizon, and it transfers to the static axisymmetric Weyl class, where the Hardy floor, strict gap, and AF $\pi$-scale persist (a global PG-like optimum need not exist).

Title: Testing trajectory-based determinism via time probability distributions
Authors: Matheus V. Scherer, Alexandre D. Ribeiro, Renato M. Angelo
Abstract: It is notorious that quantum mechanics cannot predict well-defined values for all physical quantities. Less well-known, however, is the fact that quantum mechanics is unable to furnish -- without additional assumptions -- probabilistic predictions even in emblematic scenarios such as the double-slit experiment. In contrast, trajectory-equipped theories naturally have more predictive power. This work formalizes the aforementioned assertions and illustrates them through three case studies: (i) free particle, (ii) free fall under a uniform gravitational field, and (iii) the double-slit experiment. Specifically, we introduce a prescription for constructing an arrival-time probability distribution within generic trajectory-equipped theories and then derive a conditional probability distribution that is unreachable by quantum mechanics. Our results can, in principle, be tested experimentally, thereby assessing the validity of trajectory-based determinism without the need for experiments involving the direct measurement of arrival time.

Title: Lossless Postselected Quantum Metrology with Quasi-pure Mixed States
Authors: Jing Yang
Abstract: Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.

Title: Optimizing quantum circuits with evolutionary algorithms for stable Boolean gates, elementary cellular automata, and highly entangled quantum states
Authors: Shailendra Bhandari, Stefano Nichele, Sergiy Denysov, Pedro G. Lind
Abstract: We investigate the potential of bio-inspired evolutionary algorithms for designing quantum circuits with specific goals, focusing on two particular tasks. The first one is motivated by the ideas of Artificial Life that are used to reproduce stochastic cellular automata with given rules. We test the robustness of quantum implementations of the cellular automata for different numbers of quantum gates The second task deals with the sampling of quantum circuits that generate highly entangled quantum states, which constitute an important resource for quantum computing. In particular, an evolutionary algorithm is employed to optimize circuits with respect to a fitness function defined with the Mayer-Wallach entanglement measure. We demonstrate that, by balancing the mutation rate between exploration and exploitation, we can find entangling quantum circuits for up to five qubits. We also discuss the trade-off between the number of gates in quantum circuits and the computational costs of finding the gate arrangements leading to a strongly entangled state. Our findings provide additional insight into the trade-off between the complexity of a circuit and its performance, which is an important factor in the design of quantum circuits.

Title: Enhanced Fault-tolerance in Photonic Quantum Computing: Comparing the Honeycomb Floquet Code and the Surface Code in Tailored Architecture
Authors: Théo Dessertaine, Boris Bourdoncle, Aurélie Denys, Grégoire de Gliniasty, Pierre Colonna d'Istria, Gerard Valentí-Rojas, Shane Mansfield, Paul Hilaire
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing is crucial for realizing large-scale quantum computation, and the interplay between hardware architecture and quantum error-correcting codes is a key consideration. We present a comparative study of two quantum error-correcting codes - the surface code and the honeycomb Floquet code - implemented on the spin-optical quantum computing architecture, either with controlled-Z operations or with direct parity measurements. This allows for a direct comparison of the codes using consistent noise models. Notably, we achieve a loss threshold of 6.3% with the honeycomb Floquet code implemented on our tailored architecture, almost twice as high as the loss threshold obtained with the surface code on the previous architecture, all the while requiring less physical qubits. This finding is particularly significant given that photon loss is the primary source of errors in photon-mediated quantum computing. Moreover, we benchmark the general performances of the two codes in a multi-error setting by computing the volume of the fault-tolerant region, and show that the fault-tolerant region of the honeycomb code is over twice as large as that of the surface code.

Authors: Huan-Yu Liu, Xi-Ning Zhuang, Chao Wang, Qing-Song Li, Meng-Han Dou, Zhao-Yun Chen, Cheng Xue, Yu-Chun Wu, Guo-Ping Guo, Guang-Can Guo
Abstract: In recent years, quantum computation has been rapidly advancing, driving a technological revolution with significant potential across various sectors, particularly in finance. Despite this, the insurance industry, an essential tool for mitigating unforeseen risks and losses, has received limited attention. This paper provides an initial exploration into the realm of quantum computational insurance and actuarial science. After introducing key insurance models and challenges, we discuss quantum algorithms that can address insurance problems based on their mathematical nature. Our study includes experimental and numerical demonstrations of quantum applications in non-life insurance, life insurance, and reinsurance. Additionally, we explore the timeline for quantum insurance, the development of quantum-enhanced insurance products, and the challenges posed by quantum computational advancements. This work systematically constructs the connection between quantum computation and the insurance industry, enhancing the development of insurance while promoting the application of quantum computation to more realistic problems.

Title: Local fermion-to-qudit mappings: a practical recipe for four-level systems
Authors: Rodolfo Carobene, Stefano Barison, Andrea Giachero, Jannes Nys
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.

Title: Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine
Authors: Kushagra Aggarwal, Alberto Rolandi, Yikai Yang, Joseph Hickie, Daniel Jirovec, Andrea Ballabio, Daniel Chrastina, Giovanni Isella, Mark T. Mitchison, Martí Perarnau-Llobet, Natalia Ares
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.

Title: Hybrid Photon-magnon Systems: Exploring the Purcell Effect
Authors: Sachin Verma, Abhishek Maurya, Fizaan Khan, Kuldeep Kumar Srivastava, Rajeev Singh, Biswanath Bhoi
Abstract: We present a novel approach to observing the Purcell effect in a photon-magnon coupled (PMC) hybrid system consisting of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film and a hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) arranged in a planar geometry. This hybrid system has been designed and simulated using the commercial electromagnetic full-wave simulator CST Microwave Studio for various values of damping constant (alpha) of the YIG film while keeping the HRR properties constant. Our results reveal that as the magnon damping increases, the anti-crossing behavior between photon and magnon modes in the transmission spectra diminishes, transitioning the coupled modes into the Purcell regime. This transition is attributed to an enhanced spontaneous emission rate of microwave photons when coupled to lossy magnons, driving the PMC system into the Purcell regime. To elucidate this behavior, we developed a comprehensive theoretical framework based on a quantum model, which accurately describes the observed Purcell phenomena and provides estimations of the PMC strength (g/2pi). Notably, by tuning alpha from 1.4 x 10^-5 to 2.8 x 10^-2, we achieved precise control over (g/2pi) ranging from 63 MHz to 127 MHz. This study highlights the Purcell effect's role in enhancing photon decay rates and establishes a clear relationship with PMC strength. Our work offers a comprehensive method for controlling photon resonance dissipation, opening new avenues for exploring the Purcell effect and its applications in on-chip functional devices leveraging magnon-photon interactions for quantum technologies.

Title: A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier
Authors: Guanyu Zhu
Abstract: We develop a topological theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial or CW complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation. One can further deformation retract the manifold back to a CW complex which supports a non-topological code with minimal overhead suitable for near-term implementation. Both types of codes admit cohomology operations including cup product which can induce non-Clifford gates. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to logical CCZ on 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-König bound for conventional topological codes with the aid of non-Euclidean geometries. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources ('magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.

Title: Contextuality of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes
Authors: Derek Khu, Andrew Tanggara, Chao Jin, Kishor Bharti
Abstract: Universal fault-tolerant quantum computation requires overcoming the Eastin--Knill theorem on quantum error correction (QEC) codes that protect information from noise. This is often accomplished through strategies like magic state distillation, which prepares computational resources -- namely, magic states -- whose power is rooted in quantum contextuality, a fundamental nonclassical feature generalizing Bell nonlocality. Yet, the broader role of contextuality in enabling universality, including its significance as an inherent feature of QEC codes and protocols themselves, has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a rigorous framework for contextuality in QEC and prove three main results. Fundamentally, we show that subsystem stabilizer codes with two or more gauge qubits are strongly contextual in their partial closure, while others are noncontextual, establishing a clear criterion for identifying contextual codes. Mathematically, we unify Abramsky--Brandenburger's sheaf-theoretic and Kirby--Love's tree-based definitions of contextuality, resolving a conjecture of Kim and Abramsky. Practically, we prove that many widely studied code-switching protocols which admit universal transversal gate sets, such as the doubled color codes introduced by Bravyi and Cross, are necessarily strongly contextual in their partial closure. Collectively, our results establish quantum contextuality as an intrinsic characteristic of fault-tolerant quantum codes and protocols, complementing entanglement and magic as resources for scalable quantum computation. For quantum coding theorists, this provides a new invariant: contextuality classifies which subsystem stabilizer codes can participate in universal fault-tolerant protocols. These findings position contextuality not only as a foundational concept but also as a practical guide for the design and analysis of future QEC architectures.

Title: Imaging cross-degree-of-freedom structures in biphoton spatial-polarization hyperentanglement
Authors: Cheng Li, Girish Kulkarni, Isaac Soward, Yingwen Zhang, Jeremy Upham, Duncan England, Andrei Nomerotski, Ebrahim Karimi, Robert Boyd
Abstract: Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement across more than one degree of freedom (DoF), is a valuable resource in photonic quantum technology. Although hyperentangled states inherently facilitate access to high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, their distinguishing feature lies in the cross-DoF structures beyond independent entanglement in each DoF, which can be leveraged to enable novel and robust information processing schemes. In particular, for a spatial-polarization hyperentangled state generated from spontaneous parametric downconversion, the resulting polarization entanglement is structured by the spatial distribution of all interacting optical fields. Characterizing such cross-DoF structures is a crucial step towards employing hyperentangled states for practical quantum applications. Here, by performing polarization state tomography on all spatially correlated photon pairs, we have, for the first time, resolved the full-field spatial-polarization structure in a 251-dimensional hyperentangled biphoton state. We observe an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303 \pm 0.0004$, characterized by biphoton polarization phases that exhibit radial and linear gradients induced by the transverse momenta of the down-converted photons and the pump beam, respectively. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the high dimensionality and cross-DoF correlations in hyperentangled states for future quantum technologies.

Title: Variational decision diagrams for quantum-inspired machine learning applications
Authors: Vladimir Vargas-Calderón, Santiago Acevedo-Mancera, Herbert Vinck-Posada
Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) have emerged as an efficient tool for simulating quantum circuits due to their capacity to exploit data redundancies in quantum states and quantum operations, enabling the efficient computation of probability amplitudes. However, their application in quantum machine learning (QML) has remained unexplored. This paper introduces variational decision diagrams (VDDs), a novel graph structure that combines the structural benefits of DDs with the adaptability of variational methods for efficiently representing quantum states. We investigate the trainability of VDDs by applying them to the ground state estimation problem for transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg Hamiltonians. Analysis of gradient variance suggests that training VDDs is possible, as no signs of vanishing gradients--also known as barren plateaus--are observed. This work provides new insights into the use of decision diagrams in QML as an alternative to design and train variational ansätze.

Title: Purest Quantum State Identification
Authors: Yingqi Yu, Honglin Chen, Jun Wu, Wei Xie, Xiangyang Li
Abstract: Quantum noise constitutes a fundamental obstacle to realizing practical quantum technologies. To address the pivotal challenge of identifying quantum systems least affected by noise, we introduce the purest quantum state identification, which can be used to improve the accuracy of quantum computation and communication. We formulate a rigorous paradigm for identifying the purest quantum state among $K$ unknown $n$-qubit quantum states using total $N$ quantum state copies. For incoherent strategies, we derive the first adaptive algorithm achieving error probability $\exp\left(- \Omega\left(\frac{N H_1}{\log(K) 2^n }\right) \right)$, fundamentally improving quantum property learning through measurement optimization. By developing a coherent measurement protocol with error bound $\exp\left(- \Omega\left(\frac{N H_2}{\log(K) }\right) \right)$, we demonstrate a significant separation from incoherent strategies, formally quantifying the power of quantum memory and coherent measurement. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound by demonstrating that all strategies with fixed two-outcome incoherent POVM must suffer error probability exceeding $ \exp\left( - O\left(\frac{NH_1}{2^n}\right)\right)$. This research advances the characterization of quantum noise through efficient learning frameworks. Our results establish theoretical foundations for noise-adaptive quantum property learning while delivering practical protocols for enhancing the reliability of quantum hardware.

Title: Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra
Authors: Iren Simko, Norah M. Hoffmann
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is fundamentally quantum or classical is essential for building accurate theoretical models and guiding experimental design. Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.

Title: Two-Photon Resonance Fluorescence in a Three-Level Ladder-Type Atom
Authors: Jacob Ngaha, Scott Parkins, Howard J. Carmichael
Abstract: In this work, we consider a three-level ladder-type atom driven by a coherent field, inspired by the experimental work of Gasparinetti et al. [Phys. Rev. A 100, 033802 (2019)]. When driven on two-photon resonance, the atom is excited into its highest energy state $| f \rangle$ by absorbing two photons simultaneously. The atom then de-excites via a cascaded decay $| f \rangle \rightarrow | e \rangle \rightarrow | g \rangle$. Here we present a theoretical study of the atomic fluorescence spectrum where, upon strong coherent driving, the spectrum exhibits seven distinct frequencies corresponding to transitions amongst the atomic dressed states. We characterize the quantum statistics of the emitted photons by investigating the second-order correlation functions of the emitted field. We do so by considering the total field emitted by the atom and focusing on each of the dressed-state components, taking in particular a secular-approximation and deriving straightforward, transparent analytic expressions for the second-order auto- and cross-correlations.

Title: Efficient simulation of non-trivial dissipative spin chains via stochastic unraveling
Authors: Andrew Pocklington, Aashish A. Clerk
Abstract: We present a new technique for efficiently simulating (in polynomial time) a class of one-dimensional (1D) dissipative spin chains that, when mapped to fermions, have quadratic Hamiltonians, with the only nonlinearity coming from Jordan-Wigner strings appearing in the jump operators, despite the fact that these models cannot be mapped to quadratic fermionic master equations. We show that many such Lindblad master equations admit an exact stochastic unraveling, with individual trajectories evolving as Gaussian fermionic states, even though the full master equation describes a system inequivalent to free fermions. This allows one to calculate arbitrary observables efficiently without sign problems, and with bounded sampling complexity. We utilize this new technique to study three paradigmatic dissipative effects: the melting of antiferromagnetic order in the presence of local loss, many-body subradiant phenomenon in systems with correlated loss, and nonequilibrium steady states of a 1D dissipative transverse-field Ising model. Beyond simply providing a powerful numerical technique, our method can also be used to gain both qualitative and quantitative insights into the role of interactions in these models.

Title: Spontaneous Emission from Electronic Metastable Resonance States
Authors: Amir Sivan, Milan Šindelka, Meir Orenstein, Nimrod Moiseyev
Abstract: We demonstrate that calculating the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable resonance states (states with finite lifetimes embedded in the continuum) requires considering transitions to all continuum states, not just to lower states. This holds even when the lifetimes of the metastable states are very long and might be effectively considered as bound states in the continuum. However, employing complex-scaling transformations, this computationally prohibitive task becomes feasible by utilizing methods originally designed for excited bound states for calculation of complex poles of the scattering matrix. As an illustrative example, these methods are applied to calculate the spontaneous emission decay rates of metastable resonance states in a double-barrier potential. The rapid numerical convergence of this approach highlights a new avenue for studying spontaneous emission from metastable states in real-life systems, particularly in many-electron systems, where calculation of the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable resonances (e.g., autoionization states) is computationally difficult, if not impossible, using the standard (Hermitian) formalism of quantum mechanics.

Title: Minimally Universal Parity Quantum Computing
Authors: Isaac D. Smith, Berend Klaver, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Wolfgang Lechner, Hans J. Briegel
Abstract: In parity quantum computing, multi-qubit logical gates are implemented by single-qubit rotations on a suitably encoded state involving auxiliary qubits. Consequently, there is a correspondence between qubit count and the size of the native gate set. One might then wonder: what is the smallest number of auxiliary qubits that still allows for universal parity computing? Here, we demonstrate that the answer is one, if the number of logical qubits is even, and two otherwise. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for a given parity gate set to be universal. This leads to a variety of different universal parity gate sets corresponding to different numbers of auxiliary qubits, and more generally contributes to the understanding of which entangling gates are required to augment the set of single-qubit unitaries to perform universal quantum computing. As a consequence, we obtain (i) minimal implementations of the parity framework on e.g., a triangular lattice, (ii) hardware specific implementations of the parity flow framework on e.g., a heavy-hex lattice, and (iii) novel universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC).

Title: Quantum-assisted anomaly detection with multivariate Gaussian distribution
Authors: Chao-Hua Yu, Hong-Miao Rao, Ying-Pei Wu, De-Xi Liu, Xi-Ping Liu, Lin-Chun Wan
Abstract: Anomaly detection with multivariate Gaussian distribution, which we refer to as Gassian anomaly detection (GAD), is a prominent task in data mining and machine learning. The core task of GAD is to obtain the mean value vector and the covariance matrix that characterize the probability density function of an unknown multivariate Gaussian distribution used to detect anomalies, which could be time-consuming when addressing a large dataset. Recently, several quantum algorithms have been proposed for GAD with substantial speedup over the classical GAD. However, they all require quantum phase estimation as key subroutines so that their quantum ciruits have long depth and are unfavorable in the noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum eras. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for GAD biult on arithmetic-free black-box quantum state preparation (AFQSP), which significantly shortens the quantum circuit depth and reduces the burden of quantum hardware. Specifically, we take advantage of AFQSP to estimate the magnitude of every mean value and that of every covariance matrix element in the classical form, and develop a technique referred to as Hadamard sign test to further reveal their signs, so that anomaly detection of any data point can be done immediately on a classical computer at little cost. It is shown that our quantum algorithm for GAD achieves exponential speedup over the classical GAD when handling low-dimensional datasets with well-conditioned data matrices, and is also time competitive compared to the prior quantum algorithms for GAD. Moreover, our algorithm releases the requirements of input data being quantum, mean centered, or feature correlated in the prior quantum algorithms for GAD, meaning that our algorithm is more practical on input data. Our work highlights the role of AFQSP in bringing quantum machine learning closer to reality.

Title: A Resource Efficient Quantum Kernel
Authors: Utkarsh Singh, Jean-Frédéric Laprade, Aaron Z. Goldberg, Khabat Heshami
Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional feature maps, for encoding data onto a quantum circuit are currently impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a quantum feature map designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization when using our feature map as a kernel for characterization, as compared to state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulation results, combined with lower resource requirements, highlight our map's ability to function within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. While quantum kernels are typically stymied by exponential concentration, our approach is affected with a slower rate with respect to both the number of qubits and features, which allows practical applications to remain within reach. Our findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.

Title: Benchmarking Quantum and Classical Sequential Models for Urban Telecommunication Forecasting
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Yun-Cheng Tsai
Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM (QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.

Title: Q-DPTS: Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting via Variational Quantum Circuits
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen
Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.

Title: Fermion-to-Fermion Low-Density Parity-Check Codes
Authors: Chong-Yuan Xu, Ze-Chuan Liu, Yong Xu
Abstract: Simulating fermionic systems on qubit-based quantum computers often demands significant computational resources due to the requirement to map fermions to qubits. Thus, designing a fault-tolerant quantum computer that operates directly with fermions offers an effective solution to this challenge. Here, we introduce a protocol for fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computation utilizing fermion-to-fermion low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Our method employs a fermionic LDPC memory, which transfers its state to fermionic color code processors, where logical operations are subsequently performed. We propose using odd-weight logical Majorana operators to form the code space, serving as memory for the fermionic LDPC code, and provide an algorithm to identify these logical operators. We present examples showing that the coding rate of fermionic codes often matches that of qubit codes, while the logical error rate can be significantly lower than the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose two methods for performing fermionic lattice surgery to facilitate state transfer. Finally, we simulate the dynamics of a fermionic system using our protocol, illustrating effective error suppression.

Title: Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators
Authors: Hong-Ye Hu, Abigail McClain Gomez, Liyuan Chen, Aaron Trowbridge, Andy J. Goldschmidt, Zachary Manchester, Frederic T. Chong, Arthur Jaffe, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Title: Unquestionable Bell theorem for interwoven frustrated down conversion processes
Authors: Paweł Cieśliński, Marcin Markiewicz, Konrad Schlichtholz, Jan-Åke Larsson, Marek Żukowski
Abstract: Interwoven frustrated parametric down conversion (PDC) processes produce interference effects based on path identity [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 080401 (2017)]. In this letter we show Bell nonclassicality of the processes: a proper violation of the Clauser-Horne inequality when the local measurements are controlled by on-off switching of the final local PDC processes. Such a non-standard approach is needed because if only the local phase shifts are used for the measurement settings, as done in the experiment reported in Sci. Adv. 11, 1794 (2025), there exists a local realistic model of the interference, which we also present in this letter. Nevertheless, the reported destructive interference is deep enough to violate the inequality when using on-off switching, so our result establishes a firm footing for non-classicality of the new interferometry, in both theory and experiment. The on-off approach to Bell analysis of path-identity-based interference forms a new platform for seeking new highly counterintuitive quantum phenomena.

Title: Optimal Finite-Time Thermodynamics of Effective Two-Level Systems
Authors: Alberto Rolandi
Abstract: The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010) to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain "real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.

Title: Quantum Tomography of Suspended Carbon Nanotubes
Authors: Jialiang Chang, Nicholas Pietrzak, Cristian Staii
Abstract: We present an all-mechanical protocol for coherent control and full quantum-state reconstruction of the fundamental flexural mode of a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT). Calibrated impulses from a nearby atomic force microscope (AFM) tip serve a dual role: they implement mechanical pi/2 rotations for Ramsey interferometry and realize phase-space displacements for Wigner function tomography via displaced-parity sampling. The same actuator thus unifies control and tomography while avoiding optical heating and eliminating on-chip microwave drive lines at the resonator. We derive explicit control pulse sequences and a master-equation description that map measured signals onto the energy-relaxation and phase-coherence times, as well as onto parity-based quantum signatures, including negative regions of the Wigner function. The approach is compatible with several readout modalities: direct AFM deflection, dispersive coupling to a Cooper-pair box, and dispersive microwave cavity probing. Together, these techniques provide complete access to populations, coherence, and parity within a single device architecture. This minimal scheme provides a practical route to all-mechanical quantum control and state-resolved characterization of decoherence in mesoscopic mechanical systems.

Title: Response of a classical mesoscopic oscillator to a two-level quantum system
Authors: Felipe Sobrero, Luca Abrahão, Thiago Guerreiro, Pedro V. Paraguassú
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a classical mechanical oscillator coupled to the simplest quantum system, a single qubit. The qubit's influence manifests as deterministic and stochastic forces, highly dependent on its initial quantum state, imprinting unique measurable quantum-induced signatures onto the oscillator's response. The present results suggest a pathway to quantum state reconstruction through classical noise spectroscopy, with potential applications to mesoscopic optomechanical experiments, quantum metrology, and tabletop tests of the quantum nature of gravity.

Title: A Modular, Adaptive, and Scalable Quantum Factoring Algorithm
Authors: Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula
Abstract: Shor's algorithm for integer factorization offers an exponential speedup over classical methods but remains impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware due to the need for many coherent qubits and very deep circuits. Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from a large number of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four phase qubits were sufficient for the computational examples considered in this work), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.

Title: Oganesson versus Uranium Hydrogen-like Ions and Beyond (from the Viewpoint of Old Quantum Mechanics)
Authors: Kamal Barley, Andreas Ruffing, Sergei K. Suslov
Abstract: We compare, within the framework of the old Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model, Uranium (Z=92) versus hypothetical Oganesson (Z=118) relativistic hydrogen-like ions and beyond. Existence of a self-intersecting orbit in the super strong static Coulomb field is demonstrated with the aid of Mathematica computer algebra system. A possibility of a similar 'Oganesson-type' effect in a strong gravitational field is also mentioned. Appearance of a multi self-intersecting trajectory is demonstrated in a hypothetical Unbibium, an element with Z = 122, and beyond with Z< 136. A topological classification of the strength for Coulomb fields in the superheavy transuranium elements may be given in terms of the 'winding' numbers.

Title: Cross-Resonant Gates in Hybrid Fluxonium-Transmon Systems
Authors: Nikola D. Dimitrov, Chen Wang, Vladimir E. Manucharyan, Maxim G. Vavilov
Abstract: We propose a scalable fluxonium-transmon-fluxonium (FTF) system that utilizes a central transmon to mediate high-fidelity gates and parity checks between two fluxonium qubits without the need for strong non-local interactions. This approach suppresses unwanted long-range interactions, which is critical for developing larger quantum processors. First, we analyze the performance of cross-resonance (CR) CNOT gates between a fluxonium and a transmon. We show that even in the presence of a spectator qubit, these gates maintain high fidelity with coherent errors on the order of $10^{-5}$. We then demonstrate that these gates, when applied sequentially, enable high-fidelity parity checks and logical fluxonium-fluxonium CNOT gates. In addition, the central transmon can facilitate the readout of the neighboring fluxoniums, consolidating multiple critical functions into a single ancilla. Our work establishes the viability of a dual-species architecture as a promising path toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Generalised two-dimensional nonlinear oscillator with a position-dependent effective mass and the thermodynamic properties
Authors: S. E. Bokpe, F. A. Dossa, G. Y. H. Avossevou
Abstract: We investigate a two-dimensional nonlinear oscillator with a position-dependent effective mass in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method, we obtain exact analytical expressions for the energy spectrum and wave functions. Based on the canonical partition function, we derive key thermodynamic quantities, including internal energy, specific heat, free energy, and entropy. Our results show that, unlike the one-dimensional case, where the specific heat is unaffected by the nonlinearity parameter $k$, the two-dimensional system exhibits a strong $k-$dependence. At high temperatures, the specific heat becomes temperature-independent for fixed values of $k$, in line with the Dulong-Petit law. However, these behaviors occur only for negative values of $k$. These findings highlight the impact of effective mass nonlinearity on macroscopic thermodynamic quantities and suggest that tuning the parameter $k$ could serve as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of quantum devices, including thermal machines and optoelectronic components.

Title: Observation of topological Phenomena in a Weyl Exceptional Ring with Single Photons
Authors: Zhong-Sheng Chen, Wei-Xin Chen, Fan Wu, Zhong-Wei Xu, Jing Ma, Yun-Kun Jiang, Huai-Zhi Wu, Shi-Biao Zheng
Abstract: Compared with Hermitian theory, non-Hermitian physics offers a fundamentally different mathematical framework, enabling the observation of topological phenomena that have no analogue in Hermitian systems. Among these, the exceptional point (EP) ring stands out as a quintessential topological feature unique to non-Hermitian systems. In this study, we employ single-photon interferometry to overcome the experimental challenge of precise phase control in quantum systems, thereby enabling a complete simulation of the non-Hermitian EP ring in three-dimensional parameter space without invoking any additional symmetry assumptions. By measuring the non-Hermitian dynamics in three-dimensional parameter space, we determine the system's eigenstates, which allows us to characterize the topological band structure of the system under different conditions. We describe the topological properties of the EP ring by extracting the Chern number and Berry phase for different parameter manifolds and observe the topological critical phenomena of the system. Our work paves the way for further exploration of topological non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Quantum Simulation Programming via Typing
Authors: Liyi Li, Federico Zahariev, Chandeepa Dissanayake, Jae Swanepoel, Amr Sabry, Mark S. Gordon
Abstract: Quantum simulations are designed to model quantum systems, and many compilation frameworks have been developed for executing such simulations on quantum computers. Most compilers leverage the capabilities of digital and analog quantum computers by representing quantum particle systems with Pauli strings or digital quantum circuits, making it challenging for users in physics, chemistry, and biology to program simulations effectively. QBLUE is proposed as the first programming language for describing the behaviors of quantum systems in terms of second quantization Hamiltonians. Within QBLUE, a novel type system is proposed to clearly define states across different quantum systems and treat quantum computers as quantum particle systems of specific types. The type system is compatible with the compilation of quantum simulations expressed in QBLUE for digital and analog quantum computers. With QBLUE, users can specify the desired quantum particle system and model the system on quantum computers.

Title: Stabilizer Rényi Entropy and its Transition in the Coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model
Authors: Pengfei Zhang, Shuyan Zhou, Ning Sun
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.

Title: Bosonic content of three-fermion high-spin states
Authors: Jerzy Cioslowski, Krzysztof Strasburger, Denis K. Sunko
Abstract: A rigorous characterization of the information content of any high-spin threefermion wave function is presented. It is based upon a formal decomposition of the wave function into a finite set of fixed invariants, called shapes, whose sole purpose is to satisfy the Pauli principle, and a variable part, constituting the bosonic excitations of these invariants, that provides its physical content. As an example, this decomposition is applied to a benchmark-quality approximate wave function of the lowest-energy quartet electronic state of the lithium atom. This wave function, which comprises hundreds of basis functions, is reduced to eleven shape blocks, only five of which are numerically significant. Such a compact characterization is a generic example of the appearance of superselection rules in configuration space, and provides a qualitative aid in the search for robust few-particle entangled states

Title: Time-tronics: from temporal printed circuit board to quantum computer
Authors: Krzysztof Giergiel, Peter Hannaford, Krzysztof Sacha
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.

Title: Linking Edge Modes and Geometrical Clocks in Linearized Gravity
Authors: Kristina Giesel, Viktoria Kabel, Wolfgang Wieland
Abstract: Reference frames are crucial for describing local observers in general relativity. In quantum gravity, different proposals exist for how to treat reference frames. There are models with either classical or quantum reference frames. Recently, different choices appeared for investigating these possibilities at the level of the classical and quantum algebra of observables. One choice is based on the covariant phase space approach, using gravitational edge modes. In the canonical approach, there is another choice, relational clocks, built from matter or geometry itself. In this work, we extend existing results and show how to relate edge modes and geometrical clocks in linearized gravity. We proceed in three steps. First, we introduce an extension of the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) phase space to account for covariant gauge fixing conditions and the explicit time dependence they add to Hamilton's equations. Second, we show how these gauge fixing conditions recover a specific choice of geometrical clocks in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero connection variables. Third, we study the effect of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter on the generators of asymptotic symmetries and the corresponding charges. This parameter, which disappears from metric gravity, affects the generators for angle-dependent asymptotic symmetries and the corresponding super-translation charges, while it has no effect on the global charges.

Abstract: The unique features of the hybrid quantum-classical computing model implied by the specification of OpenQASM 3.0 motivate new approaches to quantum program verification. We implement and thoroughly test a QASM 3.0 parser in TypeScript to enable implementations of verification and validation software, compilers, and more. We aim to help the community to formalize the logic of hybrid quantum-classical computing by providing tools that may help with such efforts.

Title: A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings
Authors: Jeet Shah, Gautam Nambiar, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.

Title: $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Fermi-Hubbard gas with three-body losses: symmetries and dark states
Authors: Alice Marché, Alberto Nardin, Hosho Katsura, Leonardo Mazza
Abstract: We study an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ invariant Fermi-Hubbard gas undergoing on-site three-body losses. The model presents eight independent strong symmetries preventing the complete depletion of the gas. By making use of a basis of semi-standard Young tableaux states, we reveal the presence of a rich phenomenology of stationary states. We classify the latter according to the irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ to which they belong. We finally discuss the presence of three-particle stationary states that are not protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry.

Title: Subsystem localization
Authors: Arpita Goswami, Pallabi Chatterjee, Ranjan Modak, Shaon Sahoo
Abstract: We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-André (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'>t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties shows that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. The fractal phase also appears in a narrow region along the boundary between the delocalized and localized phases. An analysis of the projected wavepacket dynamics in the subsystem shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, the narrow fractal phase shows a super- to subdiffusive behavior as we go from the delocalized to localized phase. When $t'<t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also an anomalous crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Beyond the ballistic phase observed at low $V$, we also identify a superdiffusive regime emerging in the limit $t'/V \ll 1$, which continuously approaches the ballistic behavior as $t' \to 0$. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model.

Title: Thermoelectric energy conversion in molecular junctions out of equilibrium
Authors: R. Tuovinen, Y. Pavlyukh
Abstract: Understanding time-resolved quantum transport is crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies, particularly in nano- and molecular junctions subjected to time-dependent perturbations. Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved thermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene molecular junction.

Title: Entanglement features in scattering mediated by heavy particles
Authors: Chon Man Sou, Yi Wang, Xingkai Zhang
Abstract: The amount of information propagated by an intermediate heavy particle exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.

Title: QSpark: Towards Reliable Qiskit Code Generation
Authors: Kiana Kheiri, Aamna Aamir, Andriy Miranskyy, Chen Ding
Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model with two RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49%, both beating all general-purpose baselines; on the original HumanEval they score 65.90% and 63.00%. GRPO performs well on basic tasks (44/78) and excels on intermediate ones (41/68), but neither GRPO nor ORPO solves any of the five advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted quantum programming.

Title: SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains
Authors: Yueshui Zhang, Ying-Hai Wu, Meng Cheng, Hong-Hao Tu
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.

Title: Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method
Authors: Merzuk Kaltak, Alexander Hampel, Martin Schlipf, Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, Bongjae Kim, Georg Kresse
Abstract: We present a constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA method generally produces larger Hubbard U interaction values compared to conventional approaches. When applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$ , s-cRPA yields interaction parameters that align more closely with those required within DFT+U to reproduce the experimentally observed insulating state, addressing the metallic behaviour predicted by standard density functionals. We examine the issue of negative interaction values encountered in the projec- tor cRPA method for filled d-shells. We show that s-cRPA provides improved numerical stability by preserving electron number conservation, a constraint that is violated in the projector cRPA method. The s-cRPA approach addresses some limitations of standard cRPA methods, particularly the tendency to underestimate U values, suggesting its potential utility for the community. Addi- tionally, we have enhanced our implementation to include computation of multi-centre interactions for analysing spatial decay and developed an efficient low-scaling variant employing a compressed Matsubara grid to obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.

Title: Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras
Authors: Sanjaye Ramgoolam, Michał Studziński
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.

Title: Exact large deviations and emergent long-range correlations in sequential quantum East circuits
Authors: Jimin Li, Bruno Bertini, Juan P. Garrahan, Robert L. Jack
Abstract: Exploiting quantum measurements is a promising route for preparation of correlated quantum states. We use methods from large deviation theory to solve this problem exactly for a specific system: the deterministic quantum East circuit with boundary measurements. We show that conditioning on measurement outcomes generates a long-range correlated state, despite typical trajectories being trivial. We derive the channel that optimally realizes the rare measurement trajectories, and establish a formal connection with the Petz recovery (time-reversal) map. We compute one- and two-point correlation functions in the conditioned state, revealing finite two-body correlations at arbitrarily large separations, and an underlying fractal structure, related to the Sierpiński triangle. These results demonstrate explicitly how boundary measurements can be used to control bulk properties of a quantum system.

Title: Zero-energy resonances in ultracold hydrogen sticking to liquid helium films of finite thickness
Authors: R. Karakhanyan, A. Voronin, V. Nesvizhevsky, A. Semakin, S. Vasiliev
Abstract: We investigated quantum states of ultracold hydrogen atoms in a combined potential comprising the H-He film interaction in the presence of a substrate and the Earth gravitational field. We show that the shift and width of the gravitational quantum states are determined by the complex scattering length for the H-He film-substrate potential. We demonstrate that for specific helium film thicknesses above a substrate, zero-energy resonances occur if the combined potential supports a bound state exactly at the threshold. This effect leads to a complete restructuring of the bound states spectrum. The dynamics of gravitational levels as a function of the van der Waals interaction depth controlled by the helium film thickness is analyzed. It reveals the critical thicknesses at about 6.1 and 1.8 nm, at which resonances appear in the case of the conductive substrate. With imaginary integral operators, we incorporate non-perturbatively the inelastic effects originating from the ripplon coupling. The inelastic effects show dramatic changes in the sticking-coefficient behavior near the critical points. The enhanced sticking coefficients provide a probe for studying critical phenomena and measuring atom-surface interaction parameters with unprecedented sensitivity.
