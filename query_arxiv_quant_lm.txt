Title: HARLI CQUINN: Higher Adjusted Randomness with Linear In Complexity QUantum INspired Networks for K-Means
Authors: Jiten Oswal, Saumya Biswas
Abstract: We contrast a minimalistic implementation of quantum k-means algorithm to classical k-means algorithm. With classical simulation results, we demonstrate a quantum performance, on and above par, with the classical k-means algorithm. We present benchmarks of its accuracy for test cases of both well-known and experimental datasets. Despite extensive research into quantum k-means algorithms, our approach reveals previously unexplored methodological improvements. The encoding step can be minimalistic with classical data imported into quantum states more directly than existing approaches. The proposed quantum-inspired algorithm performs better in terms of accuracy and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) with respect to the bare classical k-means algorithm. By investigating multiple encoding strategies, we provide nuanced insights into quantum computational clustering techniques.

Title: A vapor-cavity-QED system for quantum computation and communication
Authors: Sharoon Austin, Dhruv Devulapalli, Khoi Hoang, Feng Zhou, Kartik Srinivasan, Alexey V. Gorshkov
Abstract: In this work, we propose performing key operations in quantum computation and communication using room-temperature atoms moving across a grid of high-quality-factor, small-mode-volume cavities. These cavities enable high-cooperativity interactions with single atoms to be achieved with a characteristic timescale much shorter than the atomic transit time, allowing multiple coherent operations to take place. We study scenarios where we can drive a Raman transition to generate photons with specific temporal shapes and to absorb, and hence detect, single photons. The strong atom-cavity interaction can also be used to implement the atom-photon controlled-phase gate, which can then be used to construct photon-photon gates, create photonic cluster states, and perform non-demolition detection of single photons. We provide numerics validating our methods and discuss the implications of our results for several applications.

Title: Efficient and optimal quantum state discrimination via quantum belief propagation
Authors: Christophe Piveteau, Joseph M. Renes
Abstract: We present an efficient quantum algorithm for a structured state discrimination problem we call the subspace decoding task. Building on this, we show that the algorithm enables efficient and optimal decoding of certain families of structured classical linear codes transmitted over binary-input classical-quantum pure-state channels. Such decoders can substantially enhance the performance of quantum algorithms based on Regev's reduction, such as decoded quantum interferometry. In particular, we obtain optimal and efficient quantum decoders for all classical codes with efficient trellis representations. As an application, we design a quantum decoder for turbo codes and, through density evolution, demonstrate decoding thresholds that surpass the Shannon bound and closely approach the Holevo bound.

Title: Separate and efficient characterization of state-preparation and measurement errors using single-qubit operations
Authors: Muhammad Qasim Khan, Leigh M. Norris, Lorenza Viola
Abstract: In many platforms, errors from state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) dominate single-qubit gate errors. To inform further hardware improvements and the development of more effective SPAM mitigation strategies, it is necessary to separately characterize the error contributions from state-preparation (SP) and measurement (M). Here, we show how to construct a protocol that can efficiently and separately characterize the SP and M error parameters by using only high-fidelity single-qubit gates and repeated single-qubit measurements without reset. The measurements are assumed to be non-destructive and M errors are taken to be (spatially and temporally) uncorrelated and classical. Notably, the circuit depth of the protocol is independent of system size, and the target parameters may be characterized to a precision that is only limited by the number of experimental repetitions. We employ our protocol for the parallel characterization of SPAM errors on multiple qubits in the IBM Quantum Platform devices, where we find SP infidelities up to $6.57\%$ and readout assignment errors up to $19.1\%$. Using numerical simulations, we also demonstrate how measurement-error mitigation that does not properly account for SP errors generally leads to a biased estimate of measured observable expectation values.

Title: Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence
Authors: Lane P. Hughston, Levent A. Mengütürk
Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.

Title: Non-local mass superpositions and optical clock interferometry in atomic ensemble quantum networks
Authors: Charles Fromonteil, Denis V. Vasilyev, Torsten V. Zache, Klemens Hammerer, Ana Maria Rey, Jun Ye, Hannes Pichler, Peter Zoller
Abstract: Quantum networks are emerging as powerful platforms for sensing, communication, and fundamental tests of physics. We propose a programmable quantum sensing network based on entangled atomic ensembles, where optical clock qubits emulate mass superpositions in atom and atom-clock interferometry. Our approach uniquely combines scalability to large atom numbers with minimal control requirements, relying only on collective addressing of internal atomic states. This enables the creation of both non-local and local superpositions with spatial separations beyond those achievable in conventional interferometry. Starting from Bell-type seed states distributed via photonic channels, collective operations within atomic ensembles coherently build many-body mass superpositions sensitive to gravitational redshift. The resulting architecture realizes a non-local Ramsey interferometer, with gravitationally induced phase shifts observable in network-based interference patterns. Beyond extending the spatial reach of mass superpositions, our scheme establishes a scalable, programmable platform to probe the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity, and offers a new experimental pathway to test atom and atom-clock interferometer proposals in a network-based quantum laboratory.

Title: Steady state dynamics of quantum frequency combs in microring resonators
Authors: Patrick Tritschler, Torsten Ohms, André Zimmermann, Peter Degenfeld-Schonburg
Abstract: Optical frequency combs are utilized in a wide range of optical applications, including atomic clocks, interferometers, and various sensing technologies. They are often generated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in chip-integrated microring resonators, a method that requires low optical input power due to the high quality factor of the resonator, making it highly efficient. While the classical properties of optical frequency combs are well-established, this work investigates the quantum-mechanical characteristics of the individual comb modes. We derive simple equations describing the squeezing, second-order correlation and joint spectral intensity (JSI) between the generated signal and idler modes. Even with the resonator's detuning limiting the generation of signal- and idler pairs with significant photon numbers, many still exhibit substantial squeezing and entanglement. It is demonstrated that the design and dispersion characteristics of the ring resonator significantly impact the quantum features of the modes. Depending on the design, it is possible to enhance either the particle or mode entanglement of specific signal- and idler pairs. Thus, our findings enable the optimization for utilizing quantum frequency combs in various applications, including quantum sensing, computing and communication.

Title: InterQnet: A Heterogeneous Full-Stack Approach to Co-designing Scalable Quantum Networks

Saleem, Rajkumar Kettimuthu
Abstract: Quantum communications have progressed significantly, moving from a theoretical concept to small-scale experiments to recent metropolitan-scale demonstrations. As the technology matures, it is expected to revolutionize quantum computing in much the same way that classical networks revolutionized classical computing. Quantum communications will also enable breakthroughs in quantum sensing, metrology, and other areas. However, scalability has emerged as a major challenge, particularly in terms of the number and heterogeneity of nodes, the distances between nodes, the diversity of applications, and the scale of user demand. This paper describes InterQnet, a multidisciplinary project that advances scalable quantum communications through a comprehensive approach that improves devices, error handling, and network architecture. InterQnet has a two-pronged strategy to address scalability challenges: InterQnet-Achieve focuses on practical realizations of heterogeneous quantum networks by building and then integrating first-generation quantum repeaters with error mitigation schemes and centralized automated network control systems. The resulting system will enable quantum communications between two heterogeneous quantum platforms through a third type of platform operating as a repeater node. InterQnet-Scale focuses on a systems study of architectural choices for scalable quantum networks by developing forward-looking models of quantum network devices, advanced error correction schemes, and entanglement protocols. Here we report our current progress toward achieving our scalability goals.

Title: Comment on 'Collectively enhanced quantum measurements at the Heisenberg limit'
Authors: D. Ballester, Yu. V. Arkhipov, I. M. Tkachenko
Abstract: In a seminal paper [8] it was shown that Heisenberg-limited measurements could be achieved without using entangled states by coupling the quantum resources to a common environment that could be measured, at least, in part. The authors also claimed that their method would be robust under decoherence, and, in particular, applied it to derive an analytical expression to measure the change in length of an optical cavity within the Tavis-Cummings model using the superradiance approximation, which would still have a 1/N scaling. Here, we show that the analytical derivations in [8] are incompatible with the cavity superradiance, leading to the standard quantum-limited scaling 1/\sqrt{N}.

Title: Photon-starved polarimetry via functional classical shadows
Authors: Matteo Rosati, Miranda Parisi, Linda Sansoni, Eleonora Stefanutti, Andrea Chiuri, Marco Barbieri
Abstract: Polarimetry and optical imaging techniques face challenges in photon-starved scenarios, where the low number of detected photons imposes a trade-off between image resolution, integration time, and sample sensitivity. Here we introduce a quantum-inspired method, functional classical shadows, for reconstructing a polarization profile in the low photon-flux regime. Our method harnesses correlations between neighbouring datapoints, based on the recent realisation that machine learning can estimate multiple physical quantities from a small number of non-identical samples. This is applied to the experimental reconstruction of polarization as a function of the wavelength. Although the quantum formalism helps structuring the problem, our approach suits arbitrary intensity regimes.

Title: Probing Non-Markovian Quantum Channels via Hilbert-Schmidt Speed and Fidelity Enhanced Teleportation Protocols
Authors: Safae Gaidi, Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, Mohammed El Falaki, Rachid Ahl Laamara
Abstract: The reliable transmission of quantum information remains a central challenge in the presence of environmental noise. In particular, maintaining high teleportation fidelity in open quantum systems is hindered by decoherence, which disrupts quantum coherence and entanglement. Traditional noise mitigation techniques often neglect the rich temporal correlations present in realistic environments. This raises a key question: can non-Markovian memory effects be harnessed to improve the performance of quantum teleportation? In this work, we address this problem by analyzing how non-Markovian dynamics influence teleportation fidelity. We employ a statistical speed approach based on the Hilbert Schmidt norm to witness information backflow and monitor the system's instantaneous evolution rate. Our study focuses on two measurement-based strategies: weak measurement (WM) combined with quantum measurement reversal (QMR), and a hybrid protocol integrating environment-assisted measurement (EAM) with post selection and QMR. Through analytical expressions and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that both strategies can enhance teleportation fidelity under non-Markovian noise. Notably, the EAM-based scheme exhibits superior robustness, achieving high fidelity even without fine-tuned parameters. Our results establish a concrete link between non-Markovian memory effects, statistical speed, and coherence preservation, offering practical insights for the design of resilient quantum communication protocols.

Title: Propagation of intense squeezed vacuum light in non-linear media
Authors: J. Rivera-Dean, D. Kanti, P. Stammer, N. Tsatrafyllis, M. Lewenstein, P. Tzallas
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong-field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on interactions with single-atoms only, neglecting that under realistic conditions light propagates through the media. This raises two key questions: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media, and under what conditions it can generate observable nonlinear signals? We address these questions by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media using high-harmonic generation as a nonlinear observable. We found that the infrared photon losses, atomic ground-state depletion and atomic ionization, induce decoherence effects which significantly limit the propagation length in the medium, and reduce the harmonic yield by more than two orders of magnitude compared to that produced by coherent laser light. Nevertheless, we establish the conditions under which BSV generated harmonics can be detected. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation in all states of matter.

Title: Efficient block-encodings require structure
Authors: Parker Kuklinski, Benjamin Rempfer, Justin Elenewski, Kevin Obenland
Abstract: Block-encodings are ubiquitous in quantum computing as a way to represent data within a unitary operator. While several unstructured methods are applicable to arbitrary data, these techniques are burdened by hidden costs and poor accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that, even for a small 6-qubit encoding, these structure-agnostic techniques require wildly intractable resources. We compare these resources with an encoding method which respects a mathematical representation of the block, leading to the conclusion that unstructured encoding mehtods should only be used in the most extenuating circumstances. This finding runs contrary to existing literature on quantum algorithms which often employ structure-agnostic methods.

Title: Quantum metrology in presence of correlated noise via Markovian embedding
Authors: Arpan Das, Rafał Demkowicz-Dobrzański
Abstract: We analyze quantum metrological protocols, where the sensing system is linearly coupled to a bosonic environment, by performing a Markovian embedding of the problem based on pseudomode formalism. This allows us to effectively model the problem using low-dimensional environment and apply recently developed powerful tools that yield optimal metrological protocols and fundamental metrological bounds for correlated-noise models. We illustrate the method by investigating a frequency estimation protocol in the presence of noise modeled effectively as a damped Jaynes-Cummings dynamics.

Title: Amplituhedra for Generic Quantum Processes from Computation-Scattering Correspondence
Authors: Chris Fields, James F. Glazebrook, Antonino Marcianò, Emanuele Zappala
Abstract: We study the relationship between computation and scattering both operationally (hence phenomenologically) and formally. We show how topological quantum neural networks (TQNNs) enable universal quantum computation, using the Reshetikhin-Turaev and Turaev-Viro models to show how TQNNs implement quantum error-correcting codes. We then exhibit a formal correspondences between TQNNs and amplituhedra to support the existence of amplituhedra for generic quantum processes. This construction shows how amplituhedra are geometric representations of underlying topological structures. We conclude by pointing to applications areas enabled by these results.

Title: Piezomechanical scattering loss in electro-optics quantum transducers
Authors: Mai Zhang, Xin-Biao Xu, Ming Li, Jia-Qi Wang, Guang-Can Guo, Chang-Ling Zou
Abstract: Quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for building scalable quantum networks, with electro-optics conversion emerging as a promising approach. Recent experiments, however, observe significant quality factor degradation in superconducting microwave cavities when realizing the electro optics transducers. Here, we identify the piezomechanical scattering, where microwave photon loss through phonon radiation into substrate, as a universal dissipation mechanism in these hybrid quantum devices. By establishing a direct analogy to Rayleigh scattering theory, we derive universal scaling laws governing phononic dissipation process. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off that optimizing coherent transduction coupling inevitably increases dissipation, regardless of the configurations of microwave and optical cavities. We propose potential strategies to overcome this challenge. These findings establish piezomechanical scattering as a critical design constraint for quantum transducers and provide insights to optimize their performances toward practical quantum networking.

Title: Information-theoretic analysis of complex eigenmodes across avoided crossings in open microcavities
Authors: Kyu-won Park, soojoon-Lee, Kabgyun Jeong
Abstract: Avoided crossings (ACs) are hallmark signatures of mode interaction in quantum and wave systems. Open microcavities whose resonances are naturally described as quasi-normal modes (QNMs) with complex eigenfrequencies offer a convenient platform to observe how openness and loss reorganize modal structure. We introduce a compact \emph{quadrature space} framework that represents a complex QNM by probability weights on its real and imaginary quadratures, and we apply Shannon-type measures to these distributions. This representation separates marginal spreading of each quadrature from inter quadrature correlation and is robust to nodal sets and exterior zero amplitude points. Applying the method to AC regions, we find that delocalization is driven not only by broadening of individual quadratures but also by a pronounced increase in internal correlation near at the AC, revealing an internal reorganization of resonant modes in non-Hermitian settings. The approach is broadly transferable to other open resonator platforms and provides a general information-theoretic diagnostic for openness-driven mode interactions.

Title: Dynamically Optimal Unraveling Schemes for Simulating Lindblad Equations
Authors: Yu Cao, Mingfeng He, Xiantao Li
Abstract: Stochastic unraveling schemes are powerful computational tools for simulating Lindblad equations, offering significant reductions in memory requirements. However, this advantage is accompanied by increased stochastic uncertainty, and the question of optimal unraveling remains open. In this work, we investigate unraveling schemes driven by Brownian motion or Poisson processes and present a comprehensive parametric characterization of these approaches. For the case of a single Lindblad operator and one noise term, this parametric family provides a complete description for unraveling scheme with pathwise norm-preservation. We further analytically derive dynamically optimal quantum state diffusion (DO-QSD) and dynamically optimal quantum jump process (DO-QJP) that minimize the short-time growth of the variance of an observable. Compared to jump process ansatz, DO-QSD offers two notable advantages: firstly, the variance for DO-QSD can be rigorously shown not to exceed that of any jump-process ansatz locally in time; secondly, it has very simple expressions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DO-QSD scheme may achieve substantial reductions in the variance of observables and the resulting simulation error.

Title: Weak anharmonicity sensing by single- and two-photon drives
Authors: Shi-Yu Zeng, Chao-Qun Ai, Xi Cheng, Ming-Wei Yan, Xun-Wei Xu
Abstract: The optical cavity undergoes a quantum phase transition when the strength of a two-photon drive exceeds a critical point (CP), and the great sensitivity of CP in sensing has been recognized. However, these methodologies are customized to sense linear perturbations, and quantum noise is divergent at the CP. Here, we propose a scheme for sensing the weak Kerr nonlinearity in an optical cavity by both single- and two-photon drives, based on the CP for phase transition. We show that the mean photon number around the CP induced by the two-photon drive sensitively depends on the Kerr coefficient in the optical cavity, so that the weak anharmonicity in the optical cavity can be measured sensitively by detecting the mean photon number. Moreover, we demonstrate that the single-photon drive provides an effective way to suppress the quantum noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This scheme can be applied to detecting the weak nonlinear interactions in a wide range of optical systems.

Title: Local reminiscence in the PXP model
Authors: Francesco Perciavalle, Gian Marco Rizzo, Francesco Plastina, Nicola Lo Gullo
Abstract: We study the emergence of local reminiscence in the PXP model, a constrained spin system realized in Rydberg atom arrays. The spectrum of this model is characterized by a majority of eigenstates that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, alongside a set of nonthermal eigenstates, known as quantum many-body scars, that violate it. While generic initial states lead to thermalization consistent with eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, special configurations generate non-ergodic dynamics and preserve memory of the initial state. In this work, we explore local memory retention using local fidelity and the dynamics of local observables. We find that two specific states, $\theta$-symmetric and blockaded states, exhibit robust local reminiscence, with fidelities near unity and suppressed fluctuations as the system size increases. Our results show that non-ergodic regimes can sustain stable local memory while still allowing for complex global dynamics, providing new insights into quantum many-body scars and constrained dynamics.

Title: Computational complexity of injective projected entangled pair states
Authors: Dylan Harley, Freek Witteveen, Daniel Malz
Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) constitute a variational family of quantum states with area-law entanglement. PEPS are particularly relevant and successful for studying ground states of spatially local Hamiltonians. However, computing local expectation values in these states is known to be postBQP-hard. Injective PEPS, where all constituent tensors fulfil an injectivity constraint, are generally believed to be better behaved, because they are unique ground states of spatially local Hamiltonians. In this work, we therefore examine how the computational hardness of contraction depends on the injectivity. We establish that below a constant positive injectivity threshold, evaluating local observables remains postBQP-complete, while above a different constant nontrivial threshold there exists an efficient classical algorithm for the task. This resolves an open question from (Anshu et al., STOC `24).

Title: No Quantum Advantage in Decoded Quantum Interferometry for MaxCut
Authors: Ojas Parekh
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a framework for approximating special kinds of discrete optimization problems that relies on problem structure in a way that sets it apart from other classical or quantum approaches. We show that the instances of MaxCut on which DQI attains a nontrivial asymptotic approximation guarantee are solvable exactly in classical polynomial time. We include a streamlined exposition of DQI tailored for MaxCut that relies on elementary graph theory instead of coding theory to motivate and explain the algorithm.

Title: Exact Solvability and Integrability Signatures in a Periodically Driven Infinite-Range Spin Chain: The Case of Floquet interval $π/2$
Authors: Harshit Sharma, Sashmita Rout, Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale
Abstract: We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.

Title: Induced electric dipole moment coupling in Dirac equation
Authors: K. Bakke
Abstract: We introduce a nonminimal coupling into the Dirac equation as a model of describing the interaction of a Dirac neutral particle with an induced electric dipole moment with magnetic and electric fields. Then, we obtain a relativistic geometric quantum phase from the interaction of the induced electric dipole moment with electric and magnetic fields. Further, we include the permanent magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac neutral particle besides the induced electric dipole moment and obtain the relativistic geometric quantum phase.

Title: Refine coherent control of atomic qubits via wave-function approach conditioned on no-decay
Authors: Yuan Sun
Abstract: As a fundamental phenomenon in quantum systems, spontaneous emission constitutes an inevitable source of error, which ultimately degrades the fidelity of quantum logic gates. A successful quantum logic gate needs to operate on the condition that no decay event, such as spontaneous emission, occurs. Such successes can be ensured by post-selection based on syndrome extraction according to the theory of quantum error correction or quantum error mitigation. In this case, the wave function of qubits remains a pure state but is subject to additional influences from spontaneous emission, even without actual decay events. Therefore, such a process must be appropriately described by a modified version of Schrödinger equation for the dynamics conditioned on no-decay. Calculations reveal that this effect must be seriously taken into consideration for the design of high-fidelity quantum logic gates. With respect to realistic experimental conditions, even if the coherence is well preserved, improving the fidelity of manipulating physical qubits requires careful consideration of the subtle influences of decay processes such as spontaneous emission. Specifically, the gate and readout processes in the atomic qubit platform are discussed.

Title: Nontrivial multi-product commutation relation for reducing T-count in sequential Pauli-based computation
Authors: Yusei Mori, Hideaki Hakoshima, Keisuke Fujii
Abstract: Quantum compilers that reduce the number of T gates are essential for minimizing the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computation. To achieve effective T-count reduction, it is necessary to identify equivalent circuit transformation rules that are not yet utilized in existing tools. In this paper, we rewrite any given Clifford+T circuit using a Clifford block followed by a sequential Pauli-based computation, and introduce a nontrivial and ancilla-free equivalent transformation rule, the multi-product commutation relation (MCR). This rule constructs gate sequences based on specific commutation properties among multi-Pauli operators, yielding seemingly non-commutative instances that can be commuted. To evaluate whether existing compilers account for this commutation rule, we create a benchmark circuit dataset using quantum circuit unoptimization. This technique intentionally adds redundancy to the circuit while keeping its equivalence. By leveraging the known structure of the original circuit before unoptimization, this method enables a quantitative evaluation of compiler performance by measuring how closely the optimized circuit matches the original one. Our numerical experiments reveal that the transformation rule based on MCR is not yet incorporated into current compilers. This finding suggests an untapped potential for further T-count reduction by integrating MCR-aware transformations, paving the way for improvements in quantum compilers.

Title: Multichannel highly sensitive diamond quantum magnetometer

Abstract: We demonstrate a highly sensitive real-time magnetometry method at two measurement points. This magnetometry method is based on the frequency-division multiplexing of continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance. We use two ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers separated by 3.6 mm to measure a magnetic field. A different bias field is applied to the two NV ensembles to resolve the resonance peak for each ensemble in the frequency space and enables the multiplexed magnetometry at the two points. The sensitivities achieved at the measurement points are $21~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and $22~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$. The proposed magnetometry method can be expanded to include more measurement points and shorter spacing. The capability of real-time measurement at numerous points with short spacing and high sensitivity is beneficial for various applications, including biomagnetic sensing, geophysical research, and material science.

Title: A Comparison of Quadratic and Higher-Order Representations for QAOA
Authors: Kristina Bell, Adam Lowe, Emily Coles, Nathanael Ridgway, Gillian Marshall
Abstract: In this work we consider a routing problem and compare quadratic and higher-order representations using the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA). The majority of works investigating QAOA use quadratic Hamiltonians to represent the considered problems, which can lead to poor scaling in qubit requirements. We address the gap of direct comparisons between quadratic and higher-order forms through an investigation into two distinct formulations of the same use case. We find that the higher-order form yields better solution quality and scales better in terms of numbers of qubits, but requires more two-qubit gates. We additionally consider a factoring method to reduce the gate depth of the higher-order version, which achieves a significant reduction in the number of two-qubit gates when run on real IBM hardware.

Title: Ergodic Properties of Quantum Markov Semigroups
Authors: Nicolas Mousset, Nina H. Amini
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ergodic theorem for infinite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups, originally introduced by Frigerio and Verri in 1982, and its latest version developed by Carbone and Girotti in 2021. We provide a sufficient condition that ensures exponential convergence towards the positive recurrent subspace, a well-known result for irreducible quantum Markov semigroups in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Several illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the ergodic theorem. Moreover, we show that the positive recurrent subspace plays a crucial role in the study of global asymptotic stability.

Title: Digital Signal Processing from Classical Coherent Systems to Continuous-Variable QKD: A Review of Cross-Domain Techniques, Applications, and Challenges
Authors: Davi Juvêncio Gomes de Sousa, Caroline da Silva Morais Alves, Valéria Loureiro da Silva, Nelson Alves Ferreira Neto
Abstract: This systematic review investigates the application of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques -- originally developed for coherent optical communication systems to continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). The convergence of these domains has enabled significant advances in CV-QKD performance, particularly in phase synchronization, polarization tracking, and excess noise mitigation. To provide a comprehensive and reproducible synthesis of this emerging field, we employed the APISSER methodology, a task-oriented framework adapted from the PRISMA protocol. A structured search across IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases (2021-2025) yielded 220 relevant publications, which were screened, classified, and analyzed to address six research questions. Our findings highlight that many classical DSP algorithms, such as Kalman filtering, carrier recovery, adaptive equalization, and machine-learning-assisted signal estimation, have been successfully adapted to the quantum regime, often requiring modifications to meet security and noise constraints. We also identify a range of recent DSP innovations in coherent optical communication systems with high potential for future CV-QKD integration, including neural equalization, probabilistic shaping, and joint retiming-equalization filters. Despite these advances, challenges remain in achieving robust phase tracking under ultra-low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, real-time polarization compensation, and secure co-existence with classical channels. This review maps current trends, technical barriers, and emerging opportunities at the intersection of signal processing for quantum and classical communication, supporting the development of scalable and resilient CV-QKD systems.

Title: AI-enhanced Quantum Simulation of Schwinger Model
Authors: Ao-Ning Wang, Min-Quan He, Z. D. Wang
Abstract: The Schwinger Model from Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) has long served as a valuable simplified model for exploring key physical phenomena in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)-a field rich with fundamental insights but is substantially more complex. While the phase diagram of the Schwinger Model bears extraordinary significance and remains challenging to investigate, recent progress on the model mainly focuses on detailed case studies. Here, we propose a model that we refer as the Neural Network Facilitated Implicit Quantum Simulation (NN-IQS) model as a solution. After training on limited discrete data points on the Schwinger Model phase diagram, the NN-IQS model allows quick generation of extra sample points over a continuous domain. The model can even generalize beyond its training range, maintaining robust performance in previously unexplored parameter space and system sizes.

Title: Dequantization and Hardness of Spectral Sum Estimation
Authors: Roman Edenhofer, Atsuya Hasegawa, François Le Gall
Abstract: We give new dequantization and hardness results for estimating spectral sums of matrices, such as the log-determinant. Recent quantum algorithms have demonstrated that the logarithm of the determinant of sparse, well-conditioned, positive matrices can be approximated to $\varepsilon$-relative accuracy in time polylogarithmic in the dimension $N$, specifically in time $\mathrm{poly}(\mathrm{log}(N), s, \kappa, 1/\varepsilon)$, where $s$ is the sparsity and $\kappa$ the condition number of the input matrix. We provide a simple dequantization of these techniques that preserves the polylogarithmic dependence on the dimension. Our classical algorithm runs in time $\mathrm{polylog}(N)\cdot s^{O(\sqrt{\kappa}\log \kappa/\varepsilon)}$ which constitutes an exponential improvement over previous classical algorithms in certain parameter regimes. We complement our classical upper bound with $\mathsf{DQC1}$-completeness results for estimating specific spectral sums such as the trace of the inverse and the trace of matrix powers for log-local Hamiltonians, with parameter scalings analogous to those of known quantum algorithms. Assuming $\mathsf{BPP}\subsetneq\mathsf{DQC1}$, this rules out classical algorithms with the same scalings. It also resolves a main open problem of Cade and Montanaro (TQC 2018) concerning the complexity of Schatten-$p$ norm estimation. We further analyze a block-encoding input model, where instead of a classical description of a sparse matrix, we are given a block-encoding of it. We show $\mathsf{DQC}1$-completeness in a very general way in this model for estimating $\mathrm{tr}[f(A)]$ whenever $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are sufficiently smooth. We conclude our work with $\mathsf{BQP}$-hardness and $\mathsf{PP}$-completeness results for high-accuracy log-determinant estimation.

Title: A Quantum Algorithm For Computing Contextuality Bounds
Authors: Colm Kelleher, Frédéric Holweck
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is a limitation on deterministic hidden variable models, testable in measurement scenarios where outcomes differ under quantum or classical descriptions due to a common set of constraints. When considering measurements of $N$-qubit spin operators, constraints arise from commutation relations and classical bounds are determined by the $\textit{degree}$ of contextuality, an NP-hard quantity to compute in general, related to the larger class of optimisation problems known as $\texttt{MaxLin2}$. In this work we give a quantum algorithm based on Grover's search algorithm, computing the degree of contextuality in $O(\sqrt{n} \log\log{n})$ in $n$ states, a speedup over classical brute force method. We also study variations of Grover which encode the relevant information in the phases of the basis states, reducing circuit width and depth requirements with indicative complexity of $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}}(\log{n})^{2}\log\log{n})$. Testing on contemporary quantum backends with the IBM quantum experience gives inconclusive outputs due to noise-induced errors, an issue hopefully fixed by future hardware.

Title: Fidelity zeros and Lee-Yang theory of quantum phase transitions
Authors: Tian-Yi Gu, Gaoyong Sun
Abstract: Lee-Yang theory is central to the analysis of thermal phase transitions. However, the underlying mechanism of the theory and the nature of Lee-Yang zeros in quantum many-body systems remains elusive. Here, we develop a unified framework for understanding quantum phase transitions from fidelity zeros induced by symmetry breaking. These zeros, arising from transitions between symmetry sectors, obey the Lee-Yang theorem and give rise to fidelity edges near critical points. Quantum criticality is further characterized through the finite-size scaling of fidelity zeros. As concrete examples, we analytically and numerically investigate fidelity zeros in one- and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models under a complex magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of Lee-Yang theory and open avenues for exploring unexplored landscapes of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Quantum speed limits based on Jensen-Shannon and Jeffreys divergences for general physical processes
Authors: Jucelino Ferreira de Sousa, Diego Paiva Pires
Abstract: We discuss quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems undergoing a general physical process. These QSLs were obtained using two families of entropic measures, namely the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which in turn defines a faithful distance of quantum states, and the square root of the quantum Jeffreys divergence. The results apply to both closed and open quantum systems, and are evaluated in terms of the Schatten speed of the evolved state, as well as cost functions that depend on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of both initial and instantaneous states of the quantum system. To illustrate our findings, we focus on the unitary and nonunitary dynamics of mixed single-qubit states. In the first case, we obtain speed limits $\textit{à la}$ Mandelstam-Tamm that are inversely proportional to the variance of the Hamiltonian driving the evolution. In the second case, we set the nonunitary dynamics to be described by the noisy operations: depolarizing channel, phase damping channel, and generalized amplitude damping channel. We provide analytical results for the two entropic measures, present numerical simulations to support our results on the speed limits, comment on the tightness of the bounds, and provide a comparison with previous QSLs. Our results may find applications in the study of quantum thermodynamics, entropic uncertainty relations, and also complexity of many-body systems.

Title: Nonlocal Games and Self-tests in the Presence of Noise
Authors: Honghao Fu, Minglong Qin, Haochen Xu, Penghui Yao
Abstract: Self-testing is a key characteristic of certain nonlocal games, which allow one to uniquely determine the underlying quantum state and measurement operators used by the players, based solely on their observed input-output correlations [MY04]. Motivated by the limitations of current quantum devices, we study self-testing in the high-noise regime, where the two players are restricted to sharing many copies of a noisy entangled state with an arbitrary constant noise rate. In this setting, many existing self-tests fail to certify any nontrivial structure. We first characterize the maximal winning probabilities of the CHSH game [CHSH69], the Magic Square game [Mer90a], and the 2-out-of-n CHSH game [CRSV18] as functions of the noise rate, under the assumption that players use traceless observables. These results enable the construction of device-independent protocols for estimating the noise rate. Building on this analysis, we show that these three games--together with an additional test enforcing the tracelessness of binary observables--can self-test one, two, and n pairs of anticommuting Pauli operators, respectively. These are the first known self-tests that are robust in the high-noise regime and remain sound even when the players' measurements are noisy. Our proofs rely on Sum-of-Squares (SoS) decompositions and Pauli analysis techniques developed in the contexts of quantum proof systems and quantum learning theory.

Title: Introduction to some of the simplest topological phases of matter
Authors: Frank Schindler
Abstract: These lecture notes explain the classification of some simple fermionic topological phases of matter in a pedestrian manner, with an aim to be maximally pedagogical = doing things in excruciating detail. We focus on a many-body perspective, even if many of the models we work with are non-interacting. We start out with symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of free fermions that are protected by U(1) symmetry = topological insulators. We then look at fermion topological phases that don't even need a symmetry = topological superconductors, and explain how their classification changes in presence of spinless time-reversal symmetry. We close by perturbatively checking which of the 1D topological phases we had found are stable to interactions.

Title: A unified relativistic path integral origin for noise-activated collapse and decoherence
Authors: Wei Wen
Abstract: Relativity and quantum mechanics are two cornerstones of modern physics, yet their unification within a single-particle path integral and a dynamical account of quantum measurement remain unresolved. Here we show that these puzzles are linked. We construct a relativistic path integral that, from a single action principle, recovers the Dirac, Klein-Gordon, and Schrödinger equations, while also exposing a latent nonlocal term in the propagator. This term dormant in differentiable potentials but is activated by non-differentiable noise, driving outcome probabilities through bounded-martingale stochastic process. In this regime, the pointer basis emerges as absorbing boundaries, Born's rule arises from first-passage statistics, and collapse occurs in finite, parameter-dependent time, thereby reducing measurement axioms to dynamical consequences. Crucially, our work recovers the standard GKSL master equation by averaging over the stochastic record, and thus provides a first-principles foundation for decoherence. Because the trigger is the noise spectrum, our work shows that engineering ``colored'' noise can expedite or steer collapse, suggesting practical routes to fast qubit reset, preserved coherence, and quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit.

Title: Unifying framework for non-Hermitian and Hermitian topology in driven-dissipative systems
Authors: Clara C. Wanjura, Andreas Nunnenkamp
Abstract: Recently, a one-to-one correspondence between non-trivial non-Hermitian topology and directional amplification has been demonstrated, theoretically and experimentally, for the case of one complex band. Here, we extend our framework to multiple bands and higher spatial dimension. This proves to be far from trivial. Building on the singular value decomposition, we introduce a new quantity that we dub generalised singular spectrum (GSS). The GSS allows us to define physically meaningful bands related to the system's scattering behaviour and to define invariants for novel notions of point gaps (non-Hermitian topology) and line gaps (Hermitian-like topology), respectively. For both invariants, we prove a bulk-boundary correspondence and show that they give rise to two different kinds of topological edge modes. We illustrate our results with a 1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and a 2D non-Hermitian model that features corner-to-corner amplification. Our work is relevant for many state-of-the-art experimental platforms and it sets the stage for applications such as novel directional amplifiers and non-reciprocal sensors.

Title: Dynamical correlation effects in twisted bilayer graphene under strain and lattice relaxation
Authors: Lorenzo Crippa, Gautam Rai, Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, B. Andrei Bernevig, Roser Valentí, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Tim Wehling
Abstract: We study the impact of lattice effects due to heterostrain and relaxation on the correlated electron physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, by applying dynamical mean-field theory to the topological heavy fermion model. Heterostrain is responsible for splitting the 8-fold degenerate flat bands into two 4-fold degenerate subsets, while relaxation breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the unperturbed THF model. The interplay of dynamical correlation effects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a wide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band degeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent maximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully reproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy results alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy of local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy measurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the stronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the electron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and stability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping. Our results show that even fine-level structures in the experimental data can now be faithfully reproduced and understood.

Title: Quantum Dynamics of Electron Scattering from Skyrmions
Authors: Hareram Swain, Arijit Mandal, S. Satpathy, B.R.K. Nanda
Abstract: Scattering of electrons from chiral spin textures such as the skyrmions is an emerging research area due to its richness in topological quantum transport, which is significant for spintronic devices. We study the dynamical process of scattering of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of Gaussian wavepackets from skyrmions with the aid of the non-relativistic time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The scattering cross section shows a rich angular dependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the spin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial outcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities irrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts associated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound state at the scattering center. In addition to the rich and intriguing physics, the numerical recipe developed here can be easily adopted for any arbitrary spin texture, which will prepare a playground to explore tunable spin transport.

Title: There and Back Again: A Gauging Nexus between Topological and Fracton Phases
Authors: Pranay Gorantla, Abhinav Prem, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Dominic J. Williamson
Abstract: Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work [arXiv:2505.13604], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper, we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of matter.

Title: Vacuum birefringence in the polarized X-ray emission of a radio magnetar

Abstract: The quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory predicts that the quantum vacuum becomes birefringent in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields -- a fundamental effect yet to be directly observed. Magnetars, isolated neutron stars with surface fields exceeding $10^{14}$~G, provide unique astrophysical laboratories to probe this elusive prediction. Here, we report phase- and energy-resolved X-ray polarization measurements of the radio-emitting magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 obtained with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), in coordination with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and Parkes/Murriyang radio observations. We detect a high phase-averaged polarization degree of 65% at 2 keV, where the surface thermal emission is dominant, rising to nearly 80% at certain rotational phases, and remaining at $\gtrsim40\%$ throughout the radio beam crossing. We also observe a strong decrease in polarization from 2~keV to 4~keV. Detailed atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, coupled with geometrical constraints from radio polarization, demonstrate that the observed polarization behavior cannot be consistently explained without invoking magnetospheric vacuum birefringence (VB) influences. These observational findings combined with the theoretical results represent compelling evidence for naturally occurring quantum VB. This work marks a significant advance toward confirming this hallmark prediction of QED and lays the foundation for future tests of strong-field quantum physics using next-generation X-ray polarimeters.

Title: Rapid Autotuning of a SiGe Quantum Dot into the Single-Electron Regime with Machine Learning and RF-Reflectometry FPGA-Based Measurements

Abstract: Spin qubits need to operate within a very precise voltage space around charge state transitions to achieve high-fidelity gates. However, the stability diagrams that allow the identification of the desired charge states are long to acquire. Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state increases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability diagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor. Currently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach shows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in the number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an autotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by harnessing the FPGA embedded in Keysight's Quantum Engineering Toolkit (QET), the measurement time of stability diagrams has been reduced by a factor of 9.8. This led to an acceleration factor of 2.2 for the total initialization time of a SiGe quantum dot into the single-electron regime, which is limited by the Python code execution.

Title: BALANCE: Bitrate-Adaptive Limit-Aware Netcast Content Enhancement Utilizing QUBO and Quantum Annealing
Authors: Animesh Rajpurohit, Michael Kelley, Wei Wang, Krishna Murthy Kattiyan Ramamoorthy
Abstract: In an era of increasing data cap constraints, optimizing video streaming quality while adhering to user-defined data caps remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Bitrate-Adaptive Limit-Aware Netcast Content Enhancement (BALANCE), a novel Quantum framework aimed at addressing this issue. BALANCE intelligently pre-selects video segments based on visual complexity and anticipated data consumption, utilizing the Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) metric to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE). We compare our method against traditional bitrate ladders used in Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming, demonstrating a notable improvement in QoE under equivalent data constraints. We compare the Slack variable approach with the Dynamic Penalization Approach (DPA) by framing the bitrate allocation problem through Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) to effectively enforce data limits. Our results indicate that the DPA consistently outperforms the Slack Variable Method, delivering more valid and optimal solutions as data limits increase. This new quantum approach significantly enhances streaming satisfaction for users with limited data plans.

Title: Holographic Aspects of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Kouichi Okunishi, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT, particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition in the deep interior.

Title: Quantum Computing Beyond Ground State Electronic Structure: A Review of Progress Toward Quantum Chemistry Out of the Ground State
Authors: Alan Bidart, Prateek Vaish, Tilas Kabengele, Yaoqi Pang, Yuan Liu, Brenda M. Rubenstein
Abstract: Quantum computing offers the promise of revolutionizing quantum chemistry by enabling the solution of chemical problems for substantially less computational cost. While most demonstrations of quantum computation to date have focused on resolving the energies of the electronic ground states of small molecules, the field of quantum chemistry is far broader than ground state chemistry; equally important to practicing chemists are chemical reaction dynamics and reaction mechanism prediction. Here, we review progress toward and the potential of quantum computation for understanding quantum chemistry beyond the ground state, including for reaction mechanisms, reaction dynamics, and finite temperature quantum chemistry. We discuss algorithmic and other considerations these applications share, as well as differences that make them unique. We also highlight the potential speedups these applications may realize and challenges they may face. We hope that this discussion stimulates further research into how quantum computation may better inform experimental chemistry in the future.

Title: Parameter Estimation for Jump-Diffusion Stochastic Master Equations
Authors: Weichao Liang, Shuixin Xiao, Daoyi Dong, Ian R. Petersen
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter estimation for open quantum systems under continuous observation, whose conditional dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion stochastic master equations (SMEs) associated with quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements. Estimation of model parameters such as coupling strengths or measurement efficiencies is essential, yet in practice these parameters are often uncertain. We first establish the existence and well-posedness of a reduced quantum filter: for an N-level system, the conditional evolution can be represented in an O(N)-dimensional real state space rather than the full O(N^2) density-matrix state space. Building on this, we extend the stability theory of quantum filters, showing that exponential convergence persists not only under mismatched initial states but also in the presence of parameter mismatch. Finally, we develop an estimation framework for continuous parameter domains and prove almost sure consistency of the estimator in the long-time limit. These results yield a rigorous treatment of parameter estimation for jump-diffusion SMEs, combining structural reduction with stability and identifiability analysis, and thereby extend the mathematical theory of parameter estimation for open quantum systems.

Title: Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder
Authors: Kadir Çeven, Lukas Peinemann, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.

Title: You Only Measure Once: On Designing Single-Shot Quantum Machine Learning Models
Authors: Chen-Yu Liu, Leonardo Placidi, Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Gabriel Matos
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Title: Superfluid-Mott transition in a frustrated triangular optical lattice
Authors: Mehedi Hasan, Luca Donini, Sompob Shanokprasith, Daniel Braund, Tobias Marozsak, Moritz Epping, Daniel Reed, Max Melchner, Tiffany Harte, Ulrich Schneider
Abstract: Geometric frustration can significantly increase the complexity and richness of many-body physics and, for instance, suppress antiferromagnetic order in quantum magnets. Here, we employ ultracold bosonic $^{39}$K atoms in a triangular optical lattice to study geometric frustration by stabilizing the gas at the frustrated upper band edge using negative absolute temperatures. We find that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength for the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase transition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics of the transition. Although the emergence of coherence during fast ramps from MI to the ($\chi$-)SF regime is continuous in both cases, for ramps longer than a few tunnelling times, significant differences emerge. In the \frs case, no long-range order emerges on the studied timescales, highlighting a significantly reduced rate or even saturation of the emerging coherence. This work opens the door to quantum simulations of frustrated systems that are often intractable by classical simulations.

Title: Entropic and operational characterizations of dynamic quantum resources
Authors: Kaiyuan Ji, Eric Chitambar
Abstract: We offer new methods for characterizing general closed and convex quantum resource theories, including dynamic ones, based on entropic concepts and operational tasks. We propose a resource-theoretic generalization of the quantum conditional min-entropy, termed the free conditional min-entropy (FCME), in the sense that it quantifies an observer's ``subjective'' degree of uncertainty about a quantum system given that the observer's information processing is limited to free operations of the resource theory. Using this generalized concept, we provide a complete set of entropic conditions for free convertibility between quantum states or channels in any closed and convex quantum resource theory. We also derive an information-theoretic interpretation for the resource global robustness of a state or a channel in terms of a mutual-information-like quantity based on the FCME. Apart from this entropic approach, we characterize dynamic resources by also analyzing their performance in operational tasks. We construct operationally meaningful and complete sets of resource monotones with these tasks, which enable faithful tests of free convertibility between quantum channels. Finally, we show that every well-defined robustness-based measure of a channel can be interpreted as an operational advantage of the channel over free channels in a communication task.

Title: Accelerating Quantum Relaxation via Temporary Reset: A Mpemba-Inspired Approach
Authors: Ruicheng Bao, Zhonghuai Hou
Abstract: Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a protocol that enables significant acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems by temporarily coupling the system to a reset channel, inspired by the Mpemba effect. Crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol may suppress multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.

Title: Potential renormalisation, Lamb shift and mean-force Gibbs state -- to shift or not to shift?
Authors: Luis A. Correa, Jonas Glatthard
Abstract: Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.

Title: On High-Dimensional Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Ronny Müller, Mujtaba Zahidy, Leif Katsuo Oxenløwe, Søren Forchhammer, Davide Bacco
Abstract: Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a QKD protocol that uses single-photon interference to perform QKD over long distances. QKD protocols that encode information using high-dimensional quantum states can benefit from increased key rates and higher noise resilience. We define the essence of Twin-Field QKD and explore its generalization to higher dimensions. Further, we show that, ultimately, the Twin-Field protocol cannot be generalized to higher dimensions in accordance with our definition.

Abstract: Finding better solutions to combinatorial optimization problems could have a large positive impact on many real-world application areas, such as logistics. For this reason, significant efforts have been made to design novel optimisation paradigms. Here we show an early instance of such paradigm in an optical setting, the entropy computing paradigm. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses optical measurement and feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.

Title: Characterizing Translation-Invariant Bell Inequalities using Tropical Algebra and Graph Polytopes
Authors: Mengyao Hu, Eloïc Vallée, Tim Seynnaeve, Patrick Emonts, Fatemeh Mohammadi, Jordi Tura
Abstract: Nonlocality is one of the key features of quantum physics, which is revealed through the violation of a Bell inequality. In large multipartite systems, nonlocality characterization quickly becomes a challenging task. A common practice is to make use of symmetries, low-order correlators, or exploiting local geometries, to restrict the class of inequalities. In this paper, we characterize translation-invariant (TI) Bell inequalities with finite-range correlators in one-dimensional geometries. We introduce a novel methodology based on tropical algebra tensor networks and highlight its connection to graph theory. Surprisingly, we find that the TI Bell polytope has a number of extremal points that can be uniformly upper-bounded with respect to the system size. We give an efficient method to list all vertices of the polytope for a particular system size, and characterize the tightness of a given TI Bell inequality. The connections highlighted in our work allow us to re-interpret concepts developed in the fields of tropical algebra and graph theory in the context of Bell nonlocality, and vice-versa. This work extends a parallel article [M. Hu \textit{et al.}, arXiv: 2208.02798 (2022)] on the same subject.

Title: Quantum circuit compilation with quantum computers
Authors: Davide Rattacaso, Daniel Jaschke, Marco Ballarin, Ilaria Siloi, Simone Montangero
Abstract: Compilation optimizes quantum algorithms performances on real-world quantum computers. To date, it is performed via classical optimization strategies. We introduce a class of quantum algorithms to perform compilation via quantum computers, paving the way for a quantum advantage in compilation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach via Quantum and Simulated Annealing-based compilation: we successfully compile a Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation with up to 64 qubits and 64 time-steps and a Quantum Fourier Transform with up to 40 qubits and 771 time steps. We show that, for a translationally invariant circuit, the compilation results in a fidelity gain that grows extensively in the size of the input circuit, outperforming any local or quasi-local compilation approach.

Title: Characterizing the Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Non-Gaussian Continuous-Variable States with a Single Evolution Operator
Authors: Mingsheng Tian, Xiaoting Gao, Boxuan Jing, Feng-Xiao Sun, Matteo Fadel, Manuel Gessner, Qiongyi He
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information tasks, but characterizing entanglement structures in continuous variable systems remains challenging, especially in multimode non-Gaussian scenarios. In this work, we introduce an efficient method for detecting multipartite entanglement structures in continuous-variable states. Based on the quantum Fisher information, we propose a systematic approach to identify an optimal encoding operator that can capture the quantum correlations in multimode non-Gaussian states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on over $10^5$ randomly generated multimode-entangled quantum states, achieving a very high success rate in entanglement detection. Additionally, the robustness of our method can be considerably enhanced against losses by expanding the set of accessible operators. This work provides a general framework for characterizing entanglement structures in diverse continuous variable systems, enabling a number of experimentally relevant applications.

Title: Spectator-Aware Frequency Allocation in Tunable-Coupler Quantum Architectures
Authors: Evan McKinney, Israa G. Yusuf, Girgis Falstin, Gaurav Agarwal, Michael Hatridge, Alex K. Jones
Abstract: This paper addresses frequency crowding in SNAIL-based superconducting quantum modules. First, we present design constraints by describing a physical model for realizable gates within a module, and building a fidelity model using error budgeting derived from device characteristics. Second, we tackle the allocation problem by analyzing the impact of frequency crowding on gate fidelity as the radix of the module increases. We explore whether the heuristic gate fidelity can be optimized with a discrete set of qubit frequencies while adhering to defined separation thresholds. By leveraging a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we demonstrate scalable frequency allocation strategies that minimize spectator-induced errors. Our results further indicate that removing edges leads to improved gate fidelities while maintaining sufficient connectivity, suggesting that edge density is not a limiting factor for NISQ-scale benchmarks. The findings have implications for designing robust, high-fidelity quantum systems with practical constraints on hardware and connectivity.

Authors: Cheng-Ju Lin, Zi-Wen Liu, Victor V. Albert, Alexey V. Gorshkov
Abstract: We show that a subset of the basis for the irreducible representations of a tensor-product SU(2) rotation forms a covariant approximate quantum error-correcting code with transversal U(1) logical gates. Generalizing previous work on ``thermodynamic codes" to general local spin and different irreducible representations using only properties of the angular momentum algebra, we obtain bounds on the code inaccuracy under generic noise on any known $d$ sites, under independent and identically distributed noise, and under heralded $d$-local erasures. We demonstrate that this family of codes protects a probe state with quantum Fisher information surpassing the standard quantum limit when the sensing parameter couples to the generator of the U(1) logical gate.

Title: TE-PAI: Exact Time Evolution by Sampling Random Circuits
Authors: Chusei Kiumi, Bálint Koczor
Abstract: Simulating time evolution under quantum Hamiltonians is one of the most natural applications of quantum computers. We introduce TE-PAI, which simulates time evolution exactly by sampling random quantum circuits for the purpose of estimating observable expectation values at the cost of an increased circuit repetition. The approach builds on the Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (PAI) technique and we prove that it simulates time evolution without discretisation or algorithmic error while achieving shallow circuit depths with optimal scaling that saturates the Lieb-Robinson bound. Another significant advantage of TE-PAI is that it only requires executing random circuits that consist of Pauli rotation gates of only two kinds of rotation angles $\pm\Delta$ and $\pi$, along with measurements. While TE-PAI is highly beneficial for NISQ devices, we additionally develop an optimised early fault-tolerant implementation using catalyst circuits and repeat-until-success teleportation, concluding that the approach requires orders of magnitude fewer T-states than conventional techniques, such as Trotterization -- we estimate $3 \times 10^{5}$ T states are sufficient for the fault-tolerant simulation of a $100$-qubit Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian. Furthermore, TE-PAI allows for a highly configurable trade-off between circuit depth and measurement overhead by adjusting the rotation angle $\Delta$ arbitrarily. We expect that the approach will be a major enabler in the late NISQ and early fault-tolerant periods as it can compensate circuit-depth and qubit-number limitations through an increased circuit repetition.

Title: Stabilizer Scars
Authors: Jeremy Hartse, Lukasz Fidkowski, Niklas Mueller
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are eigenstates in non-integrable isolated quantum systems that defy typical thermalization paradigms, violating the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and quantum ergodicity. We identify exact analytic scar solutions in a 2+1 dimensional lattice gauge theory in a quasi-1d limit as zero-magic resource stabilizer states.

Title: Proposal for an autonomous quantum heat engine
Authors: Miika Rasola, Vasilii Vadimov, Tuomas Uusnäkki, Mikko Möttönen
Abstract: We propose and theoretically analyse a superconducting electric circuit which can be used to experimentally realize an autonomous quantum heat engine. Using a quasiclassical, non-Markovian theoretical model, we demonstrate that coherent microwave power generation can emerge solely from the heat flow through the circuit determined by non-linear circuit quantum electrodynamics. The predicted energy generation rate is sufficiently high for experimental observation with contemporary techniques, rendering this work a significant step toward the first experimental realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine based on Otto cycles.

Title: Quantum dual extended Hamming code immune to collective coherent errors
Authors: En-Jui Chang
Abstract: Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a new family of constant-excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r - (r+1), 4]]$. The smallest instance, the $[[8,1,4]]$ code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.

Title: Stabilizer Entanglement Enhances Magic Injection
Authors: Zong-Yue Hou, ChunJun Cao, Zhi-Cheng Yang
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We address this by analyzing a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup, where we show that entanglement acts as a conduit that teleports magic across the system, thereby enhancing magic injection. Using exact calculations, we prove that when a Haar-random unitary $U_A$ is applied to a subsystem $A$ of an entangled stabilizer state, the total injected magic increases with the entanglement between $A$ and its complement. More generally, for any unitary $U_A$, we show that this enhancement is maximized when $A$ is maximally entangled with its complement, in which case the total injected magic is exactly given by the unitary stabilizer Rényi entropy we introduce. This quantity provides both a directly computable measure of unitary magic and a lower bound on the minimum number of $T$ gates required to synthesize $U_A$. We further extend our analysis to tripartite stabilizer entanglement, non-stabilizer entanglement, and magic injection via shallow-depth brickwork circuits, finding that the qualitative picture remains unchanged.

Title: No-Go Theorems for Universal Quantum State Purification via Classically Simulable Operations
Authors: Keming He, Chengkai Zhu, Hongshun Yao, Jinguo Liu, Yinan Li, Xin Wang
Abstract: Quantum state purification, a process that aims to recover a state closer to a system's principal eigenstate from multiple copies of an unknown noisy quantum state, is crucial for restoring noisy states to a more useful form in quantum information processing. Fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on stabilizer operations, which are classically simulable protocols critical for error correction but inherently limited in computational power. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classically simulable operations for quantum state purification. We demonstrate that while certain classically simulable operations can enhance fidelity for specific noisy state ensembles, they cannot achieve universal purification. We prove that neither deterministic nor probabilistic protocols using only classically simulable operations can achieve universal purification of two-copy noisy states for qubit systems and all odd dimensions. We further extend this no-go result of state purification using three and four copies via numerical solutions of semidefinite programs. Our findings highlight the indispensable role of non-stabilizer resources and the inherent limitations of classically simulable operations in quantum state purification, emphasizing the necessity of harnessing the full power of quantum operations for more robust quantum information processing.

Title: Optimal phase-insensitive force sensing with non-Gaussian states
Authors: Piotr T. Grochowski, Radim Filip
Abstract: Quantum metrology enables sensitivity to approach the limits set by fundamental physical laws. Even a single continuous mode offers enhanced precision, with the improvement scaling with its occupation number. Due to their high information capacity, continuous modes allow for the engineering of quantum non-Gaussian states, which not only improve metrological performance but can also be tailored to specific experimental platforms and conditions. Recent advancements in control over continuous platforms operating in the quantum regime have renewed interest in sensing weak forces, also coupling to massive macroscopic objects. In this work, we investigate a force-sensing scheme where a physical process completely randomizes the direction of the induced phase-space displacement, and the unknown force strength is inferred through excitation-number-resolving measurements. We find that $N$-spaced states, where only every $N^{\text{th}}$ Fock state occupation is nonzero, approach the achievable sensing bound. Additionally, non-Gaussian states are shown to be more resilient against decoherence than their Gaussian counterparts with the same occupation number. While Fock states typically offer the best protection against decoherence, we uncover a transition in the metrological landscape -- revealed through a tailored decoherence-aware Fisher-information-based reward functional -- where experimental constraints favor a family of number-squeezed Schrödinger cat states. Specifically, by implementing quantum optimal control in a minimal spin-boson system, we identify these states as maximizing force sensitivity under lossy dynamics and finite system controllability. Our results provide a pathway for enhancing force sensing in a variety of continuous quantum systems, ranging from massive systems like mechanical oscillators to massless systems such as quantum light and microwave resonators.

Title: Context-aware gate set tomography: Improving the self-consistent characterization of trapped-ion universal gate sets by leveraging non-Markovianity
Authors: Pablo Viñas, Alejandro Bermudez
Abstract: To progress in the characterization of noise for current quantum computers, gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a self-consistent tomographic protocol that can accurately estimate the complete set of noisy quantum gates, state preparations, and measurements. In its original incarnation, GST improves the estimation precision by applying the gates sequentially, provided that the noise makes them a set of fixed completely-positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps independent of the history of previous gates in the sequence. This 'Markovian' assumption is sometimes in conflict with experimental evidence, as there might be time-correlated noise leading to non-Markovian dynamics or, alternatively, slow drifts and cumulative calibration errors that lead to context dependence, such that the CP-divisible maps composed during a sequence actually change with the circuit depth. In this work, we address this issue for trapped-ion devices with phonon-mediated two-qubit gates. By a detailed microscopic modeling of high-fidelity light-shift gates, we tailor GST to capture the main source of context dependence: motional degrees of freedom. Rather than invalidating GST, we show that context dependence can be incorporated in the parametrization of the gate set, allowing us to reduce the sampling cost of GST. Our results identify a promising research avenue that might be applicable to other platforms where microscopic modeling can be incorporated: the development of a context-aware GST.

Title: Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem
Authors: Hao-Chung Cheng, Po-Chieh Liu
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, the bound implies the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate, even in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding. Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.

Abstract: Many quantum networking applications require efficient photonic interfaces to quantum memories which can be produced at scale and with high yield. Synthetic diamond offers unique potential for the implementation of this technology as it hosts color centers which retain coherent optical interfaces and long spin coherence times in nanophotonic structures. Here, we report a technique enabling wafer-scale processing of thin-film diamond that combines ion implantation and membrane liftoff, high-quality overgrowth, targeted color center implantation, and serial, high-throughput thermocompression bonding with yields approaching unity. The deterministic deposition of thin diamond membranes onto semiconductor substrates facilitates consistent integration of photonic crystal cavities with silicon-vacancy (SiV) quantum memories. We demonstrate reliable, strong coupling of SiVs to photons with cooperativities approaching 100. Furthermore, we show that photonic crystal cavities can be reliably fabricated across several membranes bonded to the same handling chip. Our platform enables modular fabrication where the photonic layer can be integrated with functionalized substrates featuring electronic control lines such as coplanar waveguides for microwave delivery. Finally, we implement passive optical packaging with sub-decibel insertion loss. Together, these advances pave the way to the scalable assembly of optically addressable quantum memory arrays which are a key building block for modular photonic quantum interconnects.

Title: Quantum computing on encrypted data with arbitrary rotation gates
Authors: Mohit Joshi, Manoj Kumar Mishra, S. Karthikeyan
Abstract: An efficient technique of computing on encrypted data allows a client with limited capability to perform complex operations on a remote fault-tolerant server without leaking anything about the input or output. Quantum computing provides information-theoretic security to solve such a problem, and many such techniques have been proposed under the premises of half-blind quantum computation. However, they are dependent on a fixed non-parametric resource set that comprises some universal combination of $H,S,T,CX, CZ$ or $CCX$ gates. In this study, we show that recursive decryption of the parametric gate, $R_z(\theta)$, is possible exactly when $\theta=\pm\pi/2^m$ for $m\in \mathbb{Z^{+}}$, and approximately with arbitrary precision $\epsilon$ for given $\theta$. We also show that a blind algorithm based on such a technique needs at most $O(\log_2^2(\pi/\epsilon))$ computation steps and communication rounds, while the techniques based on a non-parametric resource set require $O(\ln^{3.97}(1/\epsilon))$ rounds. We use these results to propose a universal scheme of half-blind quantum computation for computing on encrypted data using arbitrary rotation gates. This substantial reduction in the depth of blind circuit is an affirmative step towards the practical application of such techniques in secure NISQ-era computing.

Title: Assessing the dynamical assumptions in Tsirelson inequality tests of non-classicality in harmonic oscillators
Authors: Arush Garg, Jonathan Halliwell, Taejas Venkataraman
Abstract: "Macrorealism" posits that a system possesses definite properties at all times and that we can discover these properties, in principle, without disturbing the system's subsequent behaviour. The Leggett-Garg inequalities are derived under these assumptions and are readily violated by standard quantum mechanics, thereby providing a scheme to test whether demonstrably macroscopic systems can exhibit quantum coherence. Unfortunately, Leggett-Garg tests suffer from the ineludible clumsiness loophole - the difficulty of proving that sequential measurements have not inadvertently disturbed the system. The recently uncovered Tsirelson inequality is derived from the simple dynamical assumption of uniform precession, obeyed by many classical systems, and requires only single-time measurements. However, Tsirelson inequality violations could be explained by a macrorealistic system that merely breaks the dynamical assumption, rather than genuine quantum behaviour. By carrying out a quantum-mechanical analysis of the Tsirelson inequality in the harmonic oscillator, we develop a protocol to rule out this possibility by assessing generalised conditions of uniform precession. We show that various measures of uniform precession, some of which related to Leggett-Garg quantities, are satisfied well enough that the presence of quantum-mechanical interference terms must be implied. We derive several incidental mathematical results relating to maximally-violating states, concerning dwell time, crossing number and probability currents, and also consider a group theoretic analysis of the Tsirelson operator.

Title: Efficient Preparation of Resource States for Hamiltonian Simulation and Universal Quantum Computation
Authors: Thierry N. Kaldenbach, Isaac D. Smith, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Matthias Heller, Hans J. Briegel
Abstract: The direct compilation of algorithm-specific graph states in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) can lead to resource reductions in terms of circuit depth, entangling gates, and even the number of physical qubits. In this work, we extend previous studies on algorithm-tailored graph states to periodic sequences of generalized Pauli rotations, which commonly appear in, e.g., Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation. We first implement an enhanced simulated-annealing-based algorithm to find optimal periodic graph states within local-Clifford equivalent MBQC resources. In addition, we derive a novel scheme for the preparation of resource states based on a graph state and a ladder of CNOT gates, which we term anticommutation-based MBQC, since it uncovers a direct relationship between the graph state and the anticommutation matrix for the set of Hamiltonians generating the computation. We also deploy our two approaches to derive universal resource states from minimal universal sets of generating Hamiltonians. Finally, we demonstrate and compare both of our methods based on various examples from condensed matter physics and universal quantum computation.

Title: How to simulate magic state cultivation with around $8$ Clifford terms on average
Authors: Kwok Ho Wan, Zhenghao Zhong
Abstract: Building upon [arXiv:2509.01224], we present a sketch on how to simulate the non-Clifford $d=5$ magic state cultivation circuits [arXiv:2409.17595] with a sum of $\approx 8$ Clifford ZX-diagrams on average, at $0.1\%$ noise. Compared to a magic cat state stabiliser decomposition of all $53$ non-Clifford spiders ($6{,}377{,}292$ terms required), this is more than $7 \times 10^{5}$ times reduction in the number of terms. Our stabiliser decomposition has the advantage of representing the final non-Clifford state (in light of circuit errors) as a sum of Clifford ZX-diagrams. This will be useful in simulating the escape stage of magic state cultivation, where one needs to port the resultant state of cultivation into a larger Clifford circuit with many more qubits. Still, it's necessary to only track $\approx 8$ Clifford terms. Our result sheds light on the simulability of operationally relevant, high $T$-count quantum circuits with some internal structure.

Title: Enlarging the GKP stabilizer group for enhanced noise protection
Authors: Jonathan Pelletier, Baptiste Royer
Abstract: Encoding a qubit in a larger Hilbert space of an oscillator is an efficient way to protect its quantum information against decoherence. Promising examples of such bosonic encodings are the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. In this work, we investigate how redefining the stabilizer group of the GKP codes to include all operations with trivial action on the code space can contribute to the search for an optimal implementation of a logical circuit when it is affected by noise. We find the generators of the Gaussian stabilizer group, allowing us to search for different physical implementations of a Clifford operation. We then propose an algorithm that finds the optimal implementation of a given logical Clifford circuit on GKP codes, such that the state is less affected by loss errors during the computation. Finally, we demonstrate numerically, with logical randomized benchmarking, that such a compiler can increase the lifetime of square-GKP qubits while running Clifford circuits, compared to a random walk compiler.

Title: Efficiently learning depth-3 circuits via quantum agnostic boosting
Authors: Srinivasan Arunachalam, Arkopal Dutt, Alexandru Gheorghiu, Michael de Oliveira
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum agnostic learning of phase states with respect to a function class $\mathsf{C}\subseteq \{c:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}\}$: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\textsf{opt}$ with a phase state $|\phi_c\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{x\in \{0,1\}^n}(-1)^{c(x)}|x\rangle$ for some $c\in \mathsf{C}$, output $|\phi\rangle$ which has fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \textsf{opt}-\varepsilon$. To this end, we give agnostic learning protocols for the following classes: (i) Size-$t$ decision trees which runs in time $\textsf{poly}(n,t,1/\varepsilon)$. This also implies $k$-juntas can be agnostically learned in time $\textsf{poly}(n,2^k,1/\varepsilon)$. (ii) $s$-term DNF formulas in time $\textsf{poly}(n,(s/\varepsilon)^{\log \log (s/\varepsilon) \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon)})$. Our main technical contribution is a quantum agnostic boosting protocol which converts a weak agnostic learner, which outputs a parity state $|\phi\rangle$ such that $|\langle \phi|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt}/\textsf{poly}(n)$, into a strong learner which outputs a superposition of parity states $|\phi'\rangle$ such that $|\langle \phi'|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt} - \varepsilon$. Using quantum agnostic boosting, we obtain a $n^{O(\log \log n \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))}$-time algorithm for learning $\textsf{poly}(n)$-sized depth-$3$ circuits (consisting of $\textsf{AND}$, $\textsf{OR}$, $\textsf{NOT}$ gates) in the uniform $\textsf{PAC}$ model given quantum examples, which is near-polynomial time for constant $\varepsilon$. Classically, obtaining an algorithm with a similar complexity has been an open question in the $\textsf{PAC}$ model and our work answers this given quantum examples.

Title: Quantum Simulation Programming via Typing
Authors: Liyi Li, Federico Zahariev, Chandeepa Dissanayake, Jae Swanepoel, Amr Sabry, Mark S. Gordon
Abstract: Quantum simulations are designed to model quantum systems, and many compilation frameworks have been developed for executing such simulations on quantum computers. Most compilers leverage the capabilities of digital and analog quantum computers by representing quantum particle systems with Pauli strings or digital quantum circuits, making it challenging for users in physics, chemistry, and biology to program simulations effectively. QBLUE is proposed as the first programming language for describing the behaviors of quantum systems in terms of second quantization Hamiltonians. Within QBLUE, a novel type system is proposed to clearly define states across different quantum systems and treat quantum computers as quantum particle systems of specific types. The type system is compatible with the compilation of quantum simulations expressed in QBLUE for digital and analog quantum computers. With QBLUE, users can specify the desired quantum particle system and model the system on quantum computers.

Title: Measuring space-time curvature using maximally path-entangled quantum states
Authors: Thomas B. Mieling, Christopher Hilweg, Philip Walther
Abstract: Experiments at the interface of quantum field theory and general relativity would greatly benefit theoretical research towards their unification. The gravitational aspects of quantum experiments performed so far can be explained either within Newtonian gravity or by Einstein's equivalence principle. Here, we describe a way to measure components of the Riemann curvature tensor with maximally path-entangled quantum states of light. We show that the entanglement-induced increase in sensitivity also holds for gravitationally-induced phases in Mach-Zehnder interferometers. As a result, the height difference between the two interferometer arms necessary to rule out flat space-time by measuring gravity gradients can be significantly reduced.

Title: Interaction dependence of the Hall response for the Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder
Authors: Catalin-Mihai Halati, Thierry Giamarchi
Abstract: We explore the behavior of the Hall response of a Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder in a magnetic field as a function of the repulsive on-site atomic interactions. We consider a wide range of interaction strengths, from the weakly interacting limit to the hardcore regime. This is realized by computing the Hall polarization following the quench of a weak linear potential which induces the flow of a current through the system, using time-dependent matrix product state numerical simulations. We complement our understanding in the regime of small magnetic fields by analytical calculations of the equilibrium value of the Hall polarization for non-interacting bosonic atoms, or under a mean-field assumption. The Bose-Hubbard triangular flux ladder exhibits a rich phase diagram, containing Meissner, vortex and biased-chiral superfluid phases. We show that the Hall response can be employed to fingerprint the various chiral state, the frustration effects occurring in the limit of strong interactions, and the phase boundaries of the equilibrium phase diagram.

Title: Optical lattice quantum simulator of dynamics beyond Born-Oppenheimer
Authors: Javier Argüello-Luengo, Alejandro González-Tudela, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Here, we propose a platform based on ultra-cold fermionic molecules trapped in optical lattices to simulate nonadiabatic effects, as they appear in certain molecular dynamical problems. The idea consists of a judicious choice of two rotational states as the simulated electronic or nuclear degrees of freedom, in which their dipolar interactions induce the required attractive or repulsive interactions between them. We benchmark our proposal by studying the scattering of an electron or a proton against a hydrogen atom, showing the effect of electronic exchange and inelastic ionization as the mass ratio between the simulated nuclei and electrons -- a tunable experimental parameter in our simulator -- becomes comparable. These benchmarks illustrate how the simulator can qualitatively emulate phenomena like those appearing in molecular dynamical problems even if the simulated interaction occurs in two-dimensions with a dipolar scaling. Beyond the molecular implementation proposed here, our proposal can be readily extrapolated to other atomic platforms, e.g., based on fermionic Rydberg atoms.

Title: Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians
Authors: Heiko Georg Menzler, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.

Title: Light-based electron aberration corrector
Authors: Marius Constantin Chirita Mihaila, Petr Koutenský, Kamila Moriová, Martin Kozák
Abstract: Achieving atomic resolution in electron microscopy has historically been hindered by spherical aberration, a fundamental limitation of conventional electron lenses. Its correction typically requires complex assemblies of electromagnetic multipoles. Here, we demonstrate that spherical aberration in a cylindrically symmetric electron lens can be fully compensated via interaction with a shaped light field. By analyzing distortions in high-magnification point-projection electron images of optical standing waves, we quantify the spherical aberration before and after light-induced correction. This approach introduces a new paradigm for optical control in electron beam shaping and opens a pathway towards compact and tunable light-based aberration correctors for high-resolution electron microscopy.

Title: Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost
Authors: Linqing Peng, Shuanglong Liu, Xing Zhang, Xiao Chen, Chenghan Li, Hai-Ping Cheng, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.

Title: On Araki-Type Trace Inequalities

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a trace inequality $\text{Tr}[ f(A) A^s B^s ] \leq \text{Tr}[ f(A) (A^{1/2} B A^{1/2} )^s ]$ for any positive and monotone increasing function $f$, $s\in[0,1]$, and positive semi-definite matrices $A$ and $B$. On the other hand, for $s\in[0,1]$ such that the map $x\mapsto x^s g(x)$ is positive and decreasing, then $ \text{Tr}[ g(A) (A^{1/2} B A^{1/2} )^s ] \leq \text{Tr}[ g(A) A^s B^s ]$.

Title: Principle of Diminishing Potentialities in Large N Algebras
Authors: Bik Soon Sia
Abstract: A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of an extension of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.

Title: QEDtool: a Python package for numerical quantum information in quantum electrodynamics
Authors: Jesse Smeets, Preslav Asenov, Alessio Serafini
Abstract: This is the manual of the first version of QEDtool, an object-oriented Python package that performs numerical quantum electrodynamics calculations, with focus on full state reconstruction in the internal degrees of freedom, correlations and entanglement quantification. Our package rests on the evaluation of Feynman amplitudes in the momentum-helicity basis within a relativistic framework. Users can specify both pure and mixed initial scattering states in polarization space. From the specified initial state and Feynman amplitudes, QEDtool reconstructs correlations that fully characterize the quantum polarization and entanglement within the final state. These quantities can be expressed in any inertial frame by arbitrary, built-in Lorentz transformations.
