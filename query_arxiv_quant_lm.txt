Title: Sampling the spatial coherence of light
Authors: M. Vitek, M. Peterek, D. Koutny, M. Paur, L. Motka, B. Stoklasa, J. Rehacek, Z. Hradil, L. L. Sanchez-Soto
Abstract: We introduce a novel application of the Hartmann sensor, traditionally designed for wavefront sensing, to measure the coherence properties of optical signals. By drawing an analogy between the coherence matrix and the density matrix of a quantum system, we recast the sensor operation as a quantum estimation problem. We experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness in the regime where signals from different apertures significantly overlap, enabling information extraction beyond the reach of standard wavefront sensing.

Title: Catalytic Activation of Bell Nonlocality
Authors: Jessica Bavaresco, Nicolas Brunner, Antoine Girardin, Patryk Lipka-Bartosik, Pavel Sekatski
Abstract: The correlations of certain entangled states can be perfectly simulated classically via a local model. Hence such states are termed Bell local, as they cannot lead to Bell inequality violation. Here, we show that Bell nonlocality can nevertheless be activated for certain Bell-local states via a catalytic process. Specifically, we present a protocol where a Bell-local state, combined with a catalyst, is transformed into a Bell-nonlocal state while the catalyst is returned exactly in its initial state. Importantly, this transformation is deterministic and based only on local operations. Moreover, this procedure is possible even when the state of the catalyst is itself Bell local, demonstrating a new form of superactivation of Bell nonlocality, as well as an interesting form of quantum catalysis. On the technical level, our main tool is a formal connection between catalytic activation and many-copy activation, which is of independent interest.

Title: Universal efficiency boost in prethermal quantum heat engines
Authors: Alberto Brollo, Adolfo del Campo, Alvise Bastianello
Abstract: Heat engines near the adiabatic limit typically assume a working medium at thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body systems often showcase conservation laws that hinder thermalization, leading to prethermalization in exotic stationary phases. This work explores whether prethermalization enhances or reduces engine efficiency. We investigate Otto cycles in quantum systems with varying numbers of conserved quantities. We find that additional conservation laws reduce efficiency at positive temperatures, but enhance it in regimes of negative temperatures. Our findings stem from general thermodynamic inequalities for infinitesimal cycles, and we provide evidence for integrable models undergoing finite cycles using the theoretical framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics. The relevance of our results for quantum simulators is also discussed.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking for nonautonomous Hermitian or non-Hermitian systems
Authors: L. F. Alves da Silva, M. H. Y. Moussa
Abstract: Here we first present an alternative approach to the Lewis & Riesenfeld theorem for solving the Schrödinger equation for time-dependent Hermitian or pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Then, we apply this framework to the problem of spontaneous breaking of time-dependent antilinear symmetries associated with those Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that if the general antilinear symmetry is unbroken, the Lewis & Riesenfeld phases are real odd functions of time, which allows up to recover the real spectra of time-independent pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. For the spontaneously broken regime, imaginary components of the Lewis & Riesenfeld phases arise as even functions of time, resulting in the coalescence of the real eigenvalues of the unbroken regime. We present an illustrative example of the unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry for a time-dependent Hamiltonian modeling the non-Hermitian dynamical Casimir effect.

Title: Extending quantum annealing to continuous domains: a hybrid method for quadratic programming
Authors: Hristo N. Djidjev
Abstract: We propose Quantum Enhanced Simulated Annealing (QESA), a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates quantum annealing (QA) into simulated annealing (SA) to tackle continuous optimization problems. While QA has shown promise in solving binary problems such as those expressed in Ising or QUBO form, its direct applicability to real-valued domains remains limited. QESA bridges this gap by using QA to select discrete search directions that guide SA through the continuous solution space, enabling the use of quantum resources without requiring full problem discretization. We demonstrate QESA's effectiveness on box-constrained quadratic programming (QP) problems, a class of non-convex optimization tasks that frequently arise in practice. Experimental results show that QESA consistently outperforms classical baselines in solution quality, particularly on larger and more ill-conditioned problems, while maintaining competitive runtime. As quantum annealing hardware matures, QESA offers a scalable and flexible strategy for leveraging quantum capabilities in continuous optimization.

Title: Exact Dynamics and Bloch Oscillations in a Non Hermitian Zigzag Glauber Fock Lattice
Authors: G.S. Fahara-Ojeda, L.A. Tapia-Alarcón, B.M. Villegas-Martínez, G.K. Thiruvathukal, A. Francisco Neto, S. Gesing, T. Battelle, V. Stankovski, I.A. Bocanegra-Garay, A. Venegas-Gomez, J.J. Escobedo-Alatorre R.A. Beltrán-Vargas
Abstract: The discrete dynamics of a one-dimensional non-hermitian zigzag waveguide array is studied theoretically. This system is characterized by unbalanced left/right nearest-neighbor hopping and reciprocal second-neighbor interactions in both hopping directions. The interplay between the unbalanced hopping amplitudes and the waveguide setup results in Non-Hermitian Bloch oscillations, where energy transport is either amplified or dissipated at specific locations, depending on the relative strengths of the left and right hopping terms. We demonstrate that by applying an appropriate non-unitary transformation, the original system can be mapped into an equivalent reciprocalwaveguide with Hermitian dynamics. This transformation allows us to derive a closed-form analytic solution, which is then compared with the numerical solution of the system.

Title: Dissipation-Assisted Steady-State Entanglement Engineering based on Electron Transfer Models
Authors: Mingjian Zhu, Visal So, Guido Pagano, Han Pu
Abstract: We propose a series of dissipation-assisted entanglement generation protocols that can be implemented on a trapped-ion quantum simulator. Our approach builds on the single-site molecular electron transfer (ET) model recently realized in the experiment [So et al. Sci. Adv. 10, eads8011 (2024)]. This model leverages spin-dependent boson displacement and dissipation controlled by sympathetic cooling. We show that, when coupled to external degrees of freedom, the ET model can be used as a dissipative quantum control mechanism, enabling the precise tailoring of both spin and phonon steady state of a target sub-system. We derive simplified analytical formalisms that offer intuitive insights into the dissipative dynamics. Using realistic interactions in a trapped-ion system, we develop a protocol for generating $N$-qubit and $N$-boson $W$ states. Additionally, we generalize this protocol to realize generic $N$-qubit Dicke states with tunable excitation numbers. Finally, we outline a realistic experimental setup to implement our schemes in the presence of noise sources.

Title: Quantum algorithms through graph composition
Authors: Arjan Cornelissen
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the graph composition framework, a generalization of the st-connectivity framework for generating quantum algorithms, where the availability of each of the graph's edges is computed by a span program. We provide an exact characterization of the resulting witness sizes in terms of effective resistances of related graphs. We also provide less-powerful, but easier-to-use upper bounds on these witness sizes. We give generic time-efficient implementations of algorithms generated through the graph composition framework, in the quantum read-only memory model, which is a weaker assumption than the more common quantum random-access model. Along the way, we simplify the span program algorithm, and remove the dependence of its analysis on the effective spectral gap lemma. We unify the quantum algorithmic frameworks that are based on span programs or the quantum adversary bound. In particular, we show how the st-connectivity framework subsumes the learning graph framework, the weighted-decision-tree framework, and a zero-error version of the latter. We show that the graph composition framework subsumes part of the quantum divide and conquer framework, and that it is itself subsumed by the multidimensional quantum walk framework. Moreover, we show that the weighted-decision-tree complexity is quadratically related to deterministic query complexity, and to the GT-bound with polynomial exponent 3/2. For the latter, we also provide a matching separation. We apply our techniques to give improved algorithms for various string-search problems, namely the Dyck-language recognition problem of depth 3, the 3-increasing subsequence problem, and the OR $\circ$ pSEARCH problem. We also simplify existing quantum algorithms for the space-efficient directed st-connectivity problem, the pattern-matching problem and the infix-search problem.

Title: Braided Majorana qubits as a minimal setting for Topological Quantum Computation?
Authors: Francesco Toppan
Abstract: I point out that a possible minimal setting to realize Kitaev's proposal of a Topological Quantum Computation which offers topological protection from decoherence could in principle be realized by braided Majorana qubits. Majorana qubits and their braiding were introduced in Nucl. Phys. B 980, 115834 (2022) and further analyzed in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 435203 (2024). Braided Majorana qubits implement a Gentile-type parastatistics with at most $s-1$ excited states accommodated in a multiparticle sector (the integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$ labels quantum group reps at roots of unity). It is argued that braided Majorana qubits could play, for topological quantum computers, the same role as standard bits for ordinary computers and as qubits for "ordinary" quantum computers.

Title: Floquet quantum many-body scars in the tilted Fermi-Hubbard chain
Authors: Jun-Yin Huang, Li-Li Ye, Ying-Cheng Lai
Abstract: The one-dimensional tilted, periodically driven Fermi-Hubbard chain is a paradigm in the study of quantum many-body physics, particularly for solid-state systems. We uncover the emergence of Floquet scarring states, a class of quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) states that defy random thermalization. The underlying physical mechanism is identified to be the Floquet resonances between these degenerate Fock bases that can be connected by one hopping process. It is the first-order hopping perturbation effect. Utilizing the degenerate Floquet perturbation theory, we derive the exact conditions under which the exotic QMBS states emerge. Phenomena such as quantum revivals and subharmonic responses are also studied. Those results open the possibility of modulating and engineering solid-state quantum many-body systems to achieve nonergodicity.

Title: Energy spectrum and quantum phase transition of the coupled single spin and an infinitely coordinated Ising chain
Authors: S.S. Seidov, N.G. Pugach, A.S. Sidorenko
Abstract: We consider a spin model, composed of a single spin, connected to an infinitely coordinated Ising chain. Theoretical models of this type arise in various fields of theoretical physics, such as theory of open systems, quantum control and quantum computations. In the thermodynamic limit of infinite chain we map the chain Hamiltonian to the Hamiltonian of the Lipkin--Meshkov--Glick model and the system as a whole is described by a generalized Rabi Hamiltonian. Next the effective Hamiltonian is obtained using Foulton--Gouterman transformation. In thermodynamic limit we obtain the spectrum of the whole system and study the properties of the ground state quantum phase transition.

Title: HQCC: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Classifier with Adaptive Structure
Authors: Ren-Xin Zhao, Xinze Tong, Shi Wang
Abstract: Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) with fixed structures severely degrade the performance of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). To address this, a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Classifier (HQCC) is proposed. It opens a practical way to advance QML in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era by adaptively optimizing the PQC through a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) driven dynamic circuit generator, utilizing a local quantum filter for scalable feature extraction, and exploiting architectural plasticity to balance the entanglement depth and noise robustness. We realize the HQCC on the TensorCircuit platform and run simulations on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving up to 97.12\% accuracy on MNIST and outperforming several alternative methods.

Title: Mode Protection and Synchronization of Anyonic Oscillators
Authors: Eric R. Bittner, Bhavay Tyagi
Abstract: We derive the Lindblad master equation that governs dissipative dynamics in anyon oscillators and extend the formalism to multiple coupled oscillator systems using symmetric and antisymmetric operators. We also formulate adjoint equations in the Heisenberg picture. By analyzing the eigenvalues and normal modes of the coupled system, we obtain the complete equations of motion for the creation and annihilation operators. A unitary transformation diagonalizes the two-anyon Hamiltonian and reveals anyon-modified normal modes. Our analysis demonstrates that tuning $\xi$ allows selective protection of normal modes from dissipation, with implications for topological quantum systems.

Title: Numerical Framework for Multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings Models Incorporating the Modified Langevin Noise Formalism: Non-Markovian Analysis of Atom-Field Interactions in Dissipative Electromagnetic Environments
Authors: Hyunwoo Choi, Weng Cho Chew, Dong-Yeop Na
Abstract: We present a novel numerical framework that integrates the modified Langevin noise formalism into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings models, enabling a first-principles, non-Markovian analysis of atom-field interactions in dissipative electromagnetic (EM) environments that account for both radiative losses and absorptive dissipation in lossy dielectric media (or satisfying general inhomogeneous causal media exhibiting both dispersion and absorption effects). In the modified Langevin noise formalism, the boundary- and medium-assisted (BA and MA) fields, which constitute a continuum set of EM modes in dissipative EM environments, are numerically obtained using the finite-element method (FEM). Specifically, BA field modes are extracted by solving plane-wave scattering problems, while MA field modes are determined through point-source radiation problems. These numerically obtained BA and MA field modes are then incorporated into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings models such that the coupling strength between atoms and BA-MA field modes can be calculated for the study of atom-field interactions in dissipative EM environments. The proposed methodology captures non-Markovian atomic dynamics that cannot be described by traditional quantum master equations under the Markovian approximation. To validate the accuracy of the proposed numerical framework, we present four numerical examples: (i) a two-level system (TLS) in a perfect electric conductor (PEC) half-space; (ii) dissipative cavity electrodynamics with two limiting cases approaching spontaneous emission in free space and ideal Rabi oscillations; (iii) super-radiance in TLS arrays; and (iv) entanglement sudden death of two TLSs inside dissipative cavities. The proposed methodology can serve as a ground-truth numerical simulator for studying atom-field interactions in general dissipative EM environments.

Title: Photon-number-resolving single-photon detector with a system detection efficiency of 98% and photon-number resolution of 32
Authors: Chaomeng Ding, Xingyu Zhang, Jiamin Xiong, You Xiao, Tianzhu Zhang, Jia Huang, Hongxin Xu, Xiaoyu Liu, Lixing You, Zhen Wang, Hao Li
Abstract: Efficiently distinguishing photon numbers is a crucial yet challenging technology for various quantum information and quantum metrology applications. While superconducting transition edge sensors offer good photon-number-resolving (PNR) capabilities, they are hampered by low detection speed, timing jitter, and complex cooling and readout requirements. In this work, we present a significant advancement toward achieving high-fidelity PNR single-photon detectors. The unique twin-layer configuration of superconducting nanowire atop a dielectric mirror ensures the near-unity detection efficiency. The segmented design enables spatial multiplexing, establishing a mapping relationship between pulse amplitude and registered photons. The fabricated detector exhibits impressive performance metrics, including a single-photon system detection efficiency (SDE) of ~ 98% at a dark count rate of 20 cps and photon-number resolution capability up to 32. Further characterization through detector tomography reveals high fidelities for two-, three-, and four-photon events, approximately 87%,73%, and 40% respectively. Moreover, the detector operates at a high count rate of 41 MHz at 3dB-SDE, with a low timing jitter of as low as 40 ps. With its near-unity efficiency, high photon-number resolution, low dark count rate and fast detection speed, we expect significant interest in these detectors, promising substantial benefits for weak light detection and optical quantum information applications.

Title: Monotonicity of the von Neumann Entropy under Quantum Convolution
Authors: Salman Beigi, Hami Mehrabi
Abstract: The quantum entropy power inequality, proven by König and Smith (2012), states that $\exp(S(\rho \boxplus \sigma)/m)\geq \frac 12 (\exp(S(\rho)/m) + \exp(S(\sigma)/m))$ for two $m$-mode bosonic quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$. One direct consequence of this inequality is that the sequence $\big\{ S(\rho^{\boxplus n}): n\geq 1 \big\}$ of von Neumann entropies of symmetric convolutions of $\rho$ has a monotonically increasing subsequence, namely, $S(\rho^{\boxplus 2^{k+1}})\geq S(\rho^{\boxplus 2^{k}})$. In the classical case, it has been shown that the whole sequence of entropies of the normalized sums of i.i.d.~random variables is monotonically increasing. Also, it is conjectured by Guha (2008) that the same holds in the quantum setting, and we have $S(\rho^{\boxplus n}) \geq S(\rho^{\boxplus (n-1)})$ for any $n$. In this paper, we resolve this conjecture by establishing this monotonicity. We in fact prove generalizations of the quantum entropy power inequality, enabling us to compare the von Neumann entropy of the $n$-fold symmetric convolution of $n$ arbitrary states $\rho_1, \cdots, \rho_n$ with the von Neumann entropy of the symmetric convolution of subsets of these quantum states. Additionally, we propose a quantum-classical version of this entropy power inequality, which helps us better understand the behavior of the von Neumann entropy under the convolution action between a quantum state and a classical random variable.

Title: Quantum Gibbs states are locally Markovian
Authors: Chi-Fang Chen, Cambyse Rouzé
Abstract: The Markov property entails the conditional independence structure inherent in Gibbs distributions for general classical Hamiltonians, a feature that plays a crucial role in inference, mixing time analysis, and algorithm design. However, much less is known about quantum Gibbs states. In this work, we show that for any Hamiltonian with a bounded interaction degree, the quantum Gibbs state is locally Markov at arbitrary temperature, meaning there exists a quasi-local recovery map for every local region. Notably, this recovery map is obtained by applying a detailed-balanced Lindbladian with jumps acting on the region. Consequently, we prove that (i) the conditional mutual information (CMI) for a shielded small region decays exponentially with the shielding distance, and (ii) under the assumption of uniform clustering of correlations, Gibbs states of general non-commuting Hamiltonians on $D$-dimensional lattices can be prepared by a quantum circuit of depth $e^{O(\log^D(n/\epsilon))}$, which can be further reduced assuming certain local gap condition. Our proofs introduce a regularization scheme for imaginary-time-evolved operators at arbitrarily low temperatures and reveal a connection between the Dirichlet form, a dynamic quantity, and the commutator in the KMS inner product, a static quantity. We believe these tools pave the way for tackling further challenges in quantum thermodynamics and mixing times, particularly in low-temperature regimes.

Title: Decidabilities of local unitary equivalence for entanglement witnesses and states
Authors: Yi Shen, Lin Chen
Abstract: The problem of determining whether two states are equivalent by local unitary (LU) operations is important for quantum information processing. In this paper we propose an alternative perspective to study this problem by comparing the decidabilities of LU equivalence (also known as LU decidabilities for short) between entanglement witnesses and states. We introduce a relation between sets of Hermitian operators in terms of the LU decidability. Then we compare the LU decidability for the set of entanglement witness to those decidabilities for several sets of states, and establish a hierarchy on LU decidabilities for these sets. Moreover, we realize that the simultaneous LU (SLU) equivalence between tuples of mutually orthogonal projectors is crucial to LU equivalent operators. We reveal by examples that for two tuples of projectors, the partial SLU equivalence cannot ensure the overall SLU equivalence. Generally, we present a necessary and sufficient condition such that two tuples of states are SLU equivalent.

Title: On the Clustering of Conditional Mutual Information via Dissipative Dynamics
Authors: Kohtaro Kato, Tomotaka Kuwahara
Abstract: Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant attention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in many-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in finite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive. Previous work addressed this problem in the high-temperature regime using cluster expansion techniques [T. Kuwahara, K. Kato, F.G.S.L. Brandão, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 220601 (2020)]; however, flaws in the proof have been pointed out, and the method does not provide a uniformly convergent expansion at arbitrarily high temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that the cluster expansion approach indeed fails to converge absolutely, even at any high-temperatures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach to proving the spatial decay of CMI. Our method leverages the connection between CMI and quantum recovery maps, specifically utilizing the Fawzi-Renner theorem. We show that such recovery maps can be realized through dissipative dynamics, and by analyzing the locality properties of these dynamics, we establish the exponential decay of CMI in high-temperature regimes. As a technical contribution, we also present a new result on the perturbative stability of quasi-local Liouvillian dynamics. Our results indicate that, contrary to common intuition, high-temperature Gibbs states can exhibit nontrivial mathematical structure, particularly when multipartite correlations such as CMI are considered.

Title: Quantum Deep Sets and Sequences
Authors: Vladimir Vargas-Calderón
Abstract: This paper introduces the quantum deep sets model, expanding the quantum machine learning tool-box by enabling the possibility of learning variadic functions using quantum systems. A couple of variants are presented for this model. The first one focuses on mapping sets to quantum systems through state vector averaging: each element of the set is mapped to a quantum state, and the quantum state of the set is the average of the corresponding quantum states of its elements. This approach allows the definition of a permutation-invariant variadic model. The second variant is useful for ordered sets, i.e., sequences, and relies on optimal coherification of tristochastic tensors that implement products of mixed states: each element of the set is mapped to a density matrix, and the quantum state of the set is the product of the corresponding density matrices of its elements. Such variant can be relevant in tasks such as natural language processing. The resulting quantum state in any of the variants is then processed to realise a function that solves a machine learning task such as classification, regression or density estimation. Through synthetic problem examples, the efficacy and versatility of quantum deep sets and sequences (QDSs) is demonstrated.

Title: A direct algebraic proof for the non-positivity of Liouvillian eigenvalues in Markovian quantum dynamics
Authors: Yikang Zhang, Thomas Barthel
Abstract: Markovian open quantum systems are described by the Lindblad master equation $\partial_t\rho =\mathcal{L}(\rho)$, where $\rho$ denotes the system's density operator and $\mathcal{L}$ the Liouville super-operator, which is also known as the Liouvillian. For systems with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, it is a fundamental property of the Liouvillian, that the real-parts of all its eigenvalues are non-positive which, in physical terms, corresponds to the stability of the system. The usual argument for this property is indirect, using that $\mathcal{L}$ generates a quantum channel and that quantum channels are contractive. We provide a direct algebraic proof based on the Lindblad form of Liouvillians.

Title: Perturbative Variational Quantum Eigensolver based on Reduced Density Matrix Method
Authors: Yuhan Zheng, Yibin Guo, Huili Zhang, Jie Liu, Xiongzhi Zeng, Xiaoxia Cai, Zhenyu Li, Jinlong Yang
Abstract: Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices lack the quantum resources required for practical applications. To address this, we propose the perturbative variational quantum eigensolver (PT-VQE). In PT-VQE, VQE is used to capture key correlations within a carefully selected active space, while perturbation theory efficiently incorporates interactions in the remaining space, without requiring additional qubits or circuit depth. When the VQE-optimized state closely approximates the true ground state in the active space, excitations cannot act solely in the active space, since their contributions to perturbative correction are negligible. This reduces the highest-order required RDM from 4-RDM to 3-RDM, significantly reducing computational costs. We validate PT-VQE by calculating the ground-state potential energy surfaces (PESs) of $\rm{HF}$ and $\rm{N}_2$, as well as the ground-state energy of ferrocene ($\rm{Fe(C_5H_5)_2}$). Additionally, PT-VQE is performed on a quantum computer to compute the PES of ${\rm F}_2$. The consistent results obtained from both PT-VQE with the highest 3-RDM and 4-RDM confirm the reliability of the constraint. PT-VQE significantly outperforms standard VQE, achieving chemical accuracy. This method offers a resource-efficient and practical approach for accurate quantum simulations of larger systems.

Abstract: Quantum networking technologies use spin qubits and their interface to single photons as core components of a network node. This necessitates the ability to co-design the magnetic- and optical-dipole response of a quantum system. These properties are notoriously difficult to design in many solid-state systems, where spin-orbit coupling and the crystalline environment for each qubit create inhomogeneity of electronic g-factors and optically active states. Here, we show that GaAs quantum dots (QDs) obtained via the quasi-strain-free local droplet etching epitaxy growth method provide spin and optical properties predictable from assuming the highest possible QD symmetry. Our measurements of electron and hole g-tensors and of transition dipole moment orientations for charged excitons agree with our predictions from a multiband k.p simulation constrained only by a single atomic-force-microscopy reconstruction of QD morphology. This agreement is verified across multiple wavelength-specific growth runs at different facilities within the range of 730 nm to 790 nm for the exciton emission. Remarkably, our measurements and simulations track the in-plane electron g-factors through a zero-crossing from -0.1 to 0.3 and linear optical dipole moment orientations fully determined by an external magnetic field. The robustness of our results demonstrates the capability to design - prior to growth - the properties of a spin qubit and its tunable optical interface best adapted to a target magnetic and photonic environment with direct application for high-quality spin-photon entanglement.

Title: Interference trapping of populations in a semi-infinite coupled-resonator waveguide
Authors: Qinglian Fu, Jing Li, Jing Lu, Zhihui Peng, Lan Zhou
Abstract: We study the energy structure and dynamics of a two-level emitter (2LE) locally coupled to a semi-infinite one-dimensional (1D) coupled-resonator array (CRA). The energy spectrum in the single-excitation subspace features a continuous band with scattering states, discrete levels with bound states, and a quantum phase transition characterized by the change of the number of bound states. The number of bound states is revealed by the behavior of the excited-state population at long times with quantum beat, residual oscillation, a constant with either non-zero or zero.

Title: Quantum Key Distribution over Complex Networks
Authors: Luca Mariani, Raja Yehia, Carlos Pascual-García, Federico Centrone, Jasper van der Kolk, M. Ángeles Serrano, Antonio Acín
Abstract: There exist several initiatives worldwide to deploy quantum key distribution (QKD) over existing fibre networks and achieve quantum-safe security at large scales. To understand the overall QKD network performance, it is required to transition from the analysis of individual links, as done so far, to the characterization of the network as a whole. In this work, we undertake this study by embedding QKD protocols on complex networks, which correctly model the existing fiber networks. We focus on networks with trusted nodes and on continuous-variable (CV) schemes, which have much higher key rates than their discrete-variable (DV) counterparts. In the effective CV network, however, many of the unique properties of complex networks, such as small-worldness and the presence of hubs, are lost due to the fast decay of the key rate with physical distance for CV systems. These properties can be restored when considering a hybrid network consisting of both CV and DV protocols, achieving at the same time high average rate and inter-connectivity. Our work opens the path to the study of QKD complex networks in existing infrastructures.

Title: Quantum singular value transformation without block encodings: Near-optimal complexity with minimal ancilla
Authors: Shantanav Chakraborty, Soumyabrata Hazra, Tongyang Li, Changpeng Shao, Xinzhao Wang, Yuxin Zhang
Abstract: We develop new algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework underlying a wide range of quantum algorithms. Existing implementations of QSVT rely on block encoding, incurring $O(\log L)$ ancilla overhead and circuit depth $\widetilde{O}(d\lambda L)$ for polynomial transformations of a Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{k=1}^L \lambda_k H_k$, where $d$ is polynomial degree, and $\lambda=\sum_k |\lambda_k|$. We introduce a new approach that eliminates block encoding, needs only a single ancilla qubit, and maintains near-optimal complexity, using only basic Hamiltonian simulation methods such as Trotterization. Our method achieves a circuit depth of $\widetilde{O}(L(d\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}})^{1+o(1)})$, without any multi-qubit controlled gates. Here, $\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}}$ depends on the nested commutators of the $H_k$'s and can be much smaller than $\lambda$. Central to our technique is a novel use of Richardson extrapolation, enabling systematic error cancellation in interleaved sequences of arbitrary unitaries and Hamiltonian evolution operators, establishing a broadly applicable framework beyond QSVT. Additionally, we propose two randomized QSVT algorithms for cases with only sampling access to Hamiltonian terms. The first uses qDRIFT, while the second replaces block encodings in QSVT with randomly sampled unitaries. Both achieve quadratic complexity in $d$, which we establish as a lower bound for any randomized method implementing polynomial transformations in this model. Finally, as applications, we develop end-to-end quantum algorithms for quantum linear systems and ground state property estimation, achieving near-optimal complexity without oracular access. Our results provide a new framework for quantum algorithms, reducing hardware overhead while maintaining near-optimal performance, with implications for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Quantum Annealing
Authors: Alessia Ciacco, Francesca Guerriero, Eneko Osaba
Abstract: The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes, which are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that can be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the total travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum approach to address it. Specifically, we employ quantum annealing using D-Wave's hardware to explore its potential for solving this problem. To enhance computational feasibility, we develop a preprocessing method that effectively reduces the network size. Our experimental results demonstrate that this reduction technique significantly decreases the problem complexity, making the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, the standard input for quantum annealers, better suited for existing quantum hardware. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential of quantum annealing as a promising and innovative approach for solving the STSP.

Title: Isospectral oscillators as a resource for quantum information processing
Authors: Abdelatif Chabane, Sidali Mohammdi, Abdelhakim Gharbi, Matteo G. A. Paris
Abstract: We address quantum systems isospectral to the harmonic oscillator, as those found within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, as potential resources for continuous variable quantum information. These deformed oscillator potentials share the equally spaced energy levels of the shifted harmonic oscillator but differ significantly in that they are non-harmonic. Consequently, their ground states and thermal equilibrium states are no longer Gaussian and exhibit non-classical properties. We quantify their non-Gaussianity and evaluate their non-classicality using various measures, including quadrature squeezing, photon number squeezing, Wigner function negativity, and quadrature coherence scale. Additionally, we employ quantum estimation theory to identify optimal measurement strategies and establish ultimate precision bounds for inferring the deformation parameter. Our findings prove that quantum systems isospectral to the harmonic oscillator may represent promising platforms for quantum information with continuous variables. In turn, non-Gaussian and non-classical stationary states may be obtained and these features persist at non-zero temperature.

Although studied in various systems both in theory and experiment, the redirection of single photons with many output ports, compatible with large-scale photonic circuits, still needs to be explored. Here, we demonstrate a direction switchable single-photon emitter using a Rydberg polariton. The Rydberg component of the stored photon is changed using a stimulated Raman transition with a specific intermediate state. By adjusting the direction of the retrieval laser, we can redirect the emitted photon into a rich variety of alternative modes. Building upon this scheme, we propose a quantum routing of single photons with \textit{N} output channels and unity routing efficiency. In addition, the protocol reduces the effect of motional dephasing increasing the photon lifetime to $>10~\mu$s ($>20$ times photon processing time), enabling functional quantum devices based on Rydberg polaritons.

Title: Measure-independent description of wave-particle duality via coherence
Authors: Zhaofang Bai, ShuanpingDu
Abstract: Wave-particle duality as one of the expression of Bohr complementarity is a significant concept in the field of quantum mechanics. Quantitative analysis of wave-particle duality aims to establish a complementary relation between the particle and wave properties. Beyond the conventional quantitative analysis depending on special choice of quantum information measures, we are aimed to provide a measure-independent complementary relation via coherence. By employing maximally coherent states in the set of all states with fixed diagonal elements, a measure-independent complementary relation is proposed. Based on this, we give a measure-independent description of wave-particle-mixedness triality in d-path interferometers. Our complementary relations reveal the relationship between wave-particle duality and quantum coherence, and also give a justification to coherence as it truly brings out the wave nature of quantum systems at its heart.

Title: Derivation of the Landau-Zener formula via functional equations
Authors: Chen Sun
Abstract: The Landau-Zener formula describes the diabatic transition probability of a two-level system under linear driving. Its rigorous derivation typically relies on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the Landau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach via functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This derivation is rigorous and mathematically simple. Our work provides new insight into the origin of the exponential form of the Landau-Zener transition probability.

Title: A Scalable Synthesis Algorithm for Reversible Functions
Authors: Moein Sarvaghad-Moghaddam, Morteza Saheb Zamani, Mehdi Sedighi
Abstract: Reversible computation is an emerging technology that has gained significant attention due to its critical role in quantum circuit synthesis and low-power design. This paper introduces a transformation-based method for exact synthesis of reversible circuits. The proposed approach utilizes a modified Quine-McCluskey algorithm to eliminate input-output discrepancies in the truth table, transforming the permutation matrix into an identity matrix. Furthermore, a novel search space reduction technique is presented which, combined with the primary method, enables the synthesis algorithm to handle high-input reversible functions. This approach combines the influence of multiple control qubits on a target qubit, evaluating their collective impact. This aggregation can decrease the control qubit count within quantum gates. Consequently, it proves beneficial for applications like surface code error correction architectures as well as current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardwares. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art exact synthesis methods, achieving up to 99% improvements in terms of the number of levels of T-gates.

Title: Quantized Markov chain couplings that prepare Qsamples
Authors: Kristan Temme, Pawel Wocjan
Abstract: We present a novel approach to quantizing Markov chains. The approach is based on the Markov chain coupling method, which is frequently used to prove fast mixing. Given a particular coupling, e.g., a grand coupling, we construct a completely positive and trace preserving map. This quantum map has a unique fixed point, which corresponds to the quantum sample (qsample) of the classical Markov chain's stationary distribution. We show that the convergence time of the quantum map is directly related to the coupling time of the Markov chain coupling.

Title: QUITS: A modular Qldpc code circUIT Simulator
Authors: Mingyu Kang, Yingjia Lin, Hanwen Yao, Mert Gökduman, Arianna Meinking, Kenneth R. Brown
Abstract: To achieve quantum fault tolerance with lower overhead, quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising alternative to topological codes such as the surface code, offering higher code rates. To support their study, an end-to-end framework for simulating QLDPC codes at the circuit level is needed. In this work, we present QUITS, a modular and flexible circuit-level simulator for QLDPC codes. Its design allows users to freely combine LDPC code constructions, syndrome extraction circuits, decoding algorithms, and noise models, enabling comprehensive and customizable studies of the performance of QLDPC codes under circuit-level noise. QUITS supports several leading QLDPC families, including hypergraph product codes, lifted product codes, and balanced product codes. As part of the framework, we introduce a syndrome extraction circuit improved from Tremblay, Delfosse, and Beverland [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 050504 (2022)] that applies to all three code families. In particular, for a small hypergraph product code, our circuit achieves lower depth than the conventional method, resulting in improved logical performance. Using \QUITS, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art QLDPC codes and decoders under various settings, revealing trade-offs between the decoding runtime and the logical failure rate. The source code of QUITS is available online.

Title: Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of more than 10 indistinguishable atoms
Authors: Martin Quensen, Mareike Hetzel, Luis Santos, Augusto Smerzi, Géza Tóth, Luca Pezzè, Carsten Klempt
Abstract: When two indistinguishable bosons interfere at a beam splitter, they both exit through the same output port. This foundational quantum-mechanical phenomenon, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, has become a cornerstone in the field of quantum information. It also extends to many indistinguishable particles, resulting in complex interference patterns. However, despite of its fundamental and applied interest, the many-particle effect has only been observed in notoriously lossy photonic systems, but a realization with atomic systems has remained elusive until now. Here, we demonstrate HOM interference with up to 12 indistinguishable neutral atoms in a system with negligible loss. Our single-particle counting clearly reveals parity oscillations, a bunching envelope and genuine multi-partite entanglement, defining features of the multi-particle HOM effect. Our technique offers the potential for scaling to much larger numbers, presenting promising applications in quantum information with indistinguishable particles and Heisenberg-limited atom interferometry.

Title: Learning quantum Gibbs states locally and efficiently
Authors: Chi-Fang Chen, Anurag Anshu, Quynh T. Nguyen
Abstract: Learning the Hamiltonian underlying a quantum many-body system in thermal equilibrium is a fundamental task in quantum learning theory and experimental sciences. To learn the Gibbs state of local Hamiltonians at any inverse temperature $\beta$, the state-of-the-art provable algorithms fall short of the optimal sample and computational complexity, in sharp contrast with the locality and simplicity in the classical cases. In this work, we present a learning algorithm that learns each local term of a $n$-qubit $D$-dimensional Hamiltonian to an additive error $\epsilon$ with sample complexity $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{e^{\mathrm{poly}(\beta)}}{\beta^2\epsilon^2}\right)\log(n)$. The protocol uses parallelizable local quantum measurements that act within bounded regions of the lattice and near-linear-time classical post-processing. Thus, our complexity is near optimal with respect to $n,\epsilon$ and is polynomially tight with respect to $\beta$. We also give a learning algorithm for Hamiltonians with bounded interaction degree with sample and time complexities of similar scaling on $n$ but worse on $\beta, \epsilon$. At the heart of our algorithm is the interplay between locality, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition, and the operator Fourier transform at arbitrary temperatures.

Title: Critical Scaling of the Quantum Wasserstein Distance
Authors: Gonzalo Camacho, Benedikt Fauseweh
Abstract: Distinguishing quantum states with minimal sampling overhead is of fundamental importance to teach quantum data to an algorithm. Recently, the quantum Wasserstein distance emerged from the theory of quantum optimal transport as a promising tool in this context. Here we show on general grounds that the quantum Wasserstein distance between two ground states of a quantum critical system exhibits critical scaling. We demonstrate this explicitly using known closed analytical expressions for the magnetic correlations in the transverse field Ising model, to numerically extract the critical exponents for the distance close to the quantum critical point, confirming our analytical derivation. Our results have implications for learning of ground states of quantum critical phases of matter.

Title: Quantum synchronization blockade induced by nonreciprocal coupling
Authors: Tobias Kehrer, Christoph Bruder
Abstract: Recently, the synchronization of coupled quantum oscillators has attracted a great deal of interest. Synchronization requires driven constituents, and in such systems, the coupling can be designed to be nonreciprocal. Nonreciprocally-coupled oscillators exhibit a rich variety of behavior including active traveling-wave type states. In this work, we study the interplay of three competing synchronization mechanisms in a setup of two nonreciprocally-coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators. One of the oscillators is driven externally which induces phase locking. A dissipative interaction leads to anti-phase locking, whereas a coherent interaction nurtures bistable phase locking and active states. We approximate the phase diagram of the quantum case by evaluating the synchronization measure of a perturbation expansion of the steady state. Furthermore, we study the phase diagrams of two and three oscillators in the mean-field limit and find highly nontrivial active states.

Title: Bacon-Shor Board Games
Authors: M. Sohaib Alam, Jiajun Chen, Thomas R. Scruby
Abstract: We identify a period-4 measurement schedule for the checks of the Bacon-Shor code that fully covers spacetime with constant-weight detectors, and is numerically observed to provide the code with a threshold. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not rely on code concatenation and instead arises as the solution to a coloring game on a square grid. Under a uniform circuit-level noise model, we observe a threshold of approximately $0.3\%$ when decoding with minimum weight perfect matching, and we conjecture that this could be improved using a more tailored decoder.

Title: Robust entangled photon generation by Floquet-engineered two-colour pulses
Authors: Jun-Yong Yan, Paul C. A. Hagen, Hans-Georg Babin, Andreas D. Wieck, Arne Ludwig, Chao-Yuan Jin, Vollrath M. Axt, Da-Wei Wang, Moritz Cygorek, Feng Liu
Abstract: Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast all-optical Floquet engineering. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%. Our scheme highlights the great impact of Floquet-engineered multicolour excitation protocols for on-demand quantum light sources.

Title: Beating full state tomography for unentangled spectrum estimation
Authors: Angelos Pelecanos, Xinyu Tan, Ewin Tang, John Wright
Abstract: How many copies of a mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ are needed to learn its spectrum? To date, the best known algorithms for spectrum estimation require as many copies as full state tomography, suggesting the possibility that learning a state's spectrum might be as difficult as learning the entire state. We show that this is not the case in the setting of unentangled measurements, by giving a spectrum estimation algorithm that uses $n = O(d^3\cdot (\log\log(d) / \log(d))^4 )$ copies of $\rho$, which is asymptotically fewer than the $n = \Omega(d^3)$ copies necessary for full state tomography. Our algorithm is inspired by the technique of local moment matching from classical statistics, and shows how it can be applied in the quantum setting. As an important subroutine in our spectrum estimation algorithm, we give an estimator of the $k$-th moment $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^k)$ which performs unentangled measurements and uses $O(d^{3-2/k})$ copies of $\rho$ in order to achieve a constant multiplicative error. This directly translates to an additive-error estimator of quantum Renyi entropy of order $k$ with the same number of copies. Finally, we present numerical evidence that the sample complexity of spectrum estimation can only improve over full state tomography by a sub-polynomial factor. Specifically, for spectrum learning with fully entangled measurements, we run simulations which suggest a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{2 - \gamma})$ copies for any constant $\gamma > 0$. From this, we conclude the current best lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ is likely not tight.

Title: Suppression of decoherence dynamics by a dissipative bath at strong coupling
Authors: Jitian Chen, Jakub Garwoła, Dvira Segal
Abstract: Control of decoherence in open quantum systems has become a topic of great interest due to the emergence of quantum technologies that depend on quantum coherent effects. In this work, we investigate the decoherence dynamics of systems coupled to multiple baths through noncommuting systems' operators, and beyond the weak system-bath coupling limit. By building on cooperative effects between baths, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate rapid decoherence. Concretely, we study the dynamics of a qubit coupled to multiple environments with arbitrary interaction strengths, and along different coordinates. Based on insights gained on the decoherence dynamics from the analytical Effective Hamiltonian method, we carry out numerical simulations using the Reaction Coordinate quantum master equation method. In contrast to standard expectations, we show that when the system strongly interacts with a decohering bath, increasing its coupling to a second, dissipative bath slows down the decoherence dynamics. Our work offers insights into the preservation of quantum coherences in open quantum systems based on frustration effects, by utilizing cooperative effects between different heat baths.

Title: Quantum theory does not need complex numbers
Authors: Timothee Hoffreumon, Mischa P. Woods
Abstract: The longstanding debate over whether quantum theory fundamentally requires complex numbers--or if their use is merely a convenient choice--has persisted for decades. Until recently, this question was considered open. However, in [M.-O. Renou et al, Nature 600, 625-629, 2021], a decisive argument was presented asserting that quantum theory needs complex numbers. In this work, we demonstrate that a formulation of quantum theory based solely on real numbers is indeed possible while retaining key features such as theory-representation locality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to the states) and the positive semi-definiteness of its states and effects. We observe that the standard system combination rule--the tensor product--was derived after the development of single-system complex quantum theory. By starting from a single-system quantum theory using only real numbers, we derive a combination rule that produces a real quantum theory with properties analogous to those of conventional complex quantum theory. We also prove that the conventional tensor product rule can also lead to a real and representation-local theory, albeit with a modified characterization of the state space. We thus conclude that complex numbers are a mere convenience in quantum theory.

Title: In-situ three-dimensional strain engineering of solid-state quantum emitters in photonic structures towards scalable quantum networks
Authors: Yan Chen, Xueshi Li, Shunfa Liu, Jiawei Yang, Yuming Wei, Kaili Xiong, Yangpeng Wang, Jiawei Wang, Pingxing Chen, Xiao Li, Chaofan Zhang, Ying Yu, Tian Jiang, Jin Liu
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters are pivotal for modern photonic quantum technology, yet their inherent spectral inhomogeneity imposes a critical challenge in pursuing scalable quantum network. Here, we develop a cryogenic-compatible strain-engineering platform based on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp that is not obviously working properly at cryogenic temperature. In-situ three-dimensional (3D) strain control is achieved for quantum dots (QDs) embedded in photonic nanostructures. The compliant PDMS enables independent tuning of emission energy and elimination of fine structure splitting (FSS) of single QDs, as demonstrated by a 7 meV spectral shift with a near-vanishing FSS in circular Bragg resonators and an unprecedented 15 meV tuning range in the micropillar. The PDMS-based 3D strain-engineering platform, compatible with diverse photonic structures at cryogenic temperature, provides a powerful and versatile tool for exploring fundamental strain-related physics and advancing integrated photonic quantum technology.

Title: Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors

Abstract: SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the electron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K. TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate an irradiated NbN SNSPD exhibiting a well-defined saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by irradiation-induced modifications and an avalanche-assisted detection mechanism with weak wavelength dependence. Our findings provide valuable insights into ion irradiation as a post-processing technique for SNSPDs, offering a pathway to enhancing IDE and tailoring thermal properties. This work also advances the understanding of SNSPD physics and defect engineering in superconducting thin films, expanding the potential applications of irradiation techniques in superconducting optoelectronics.

Title: Finite steady-state current defies non-Hermitian many-body localization
Authors: Pietro Brighi, Marko Ljubotina, Federico Roccati, Federico Balducci
Abstract: Non-Hermitian many-body localization (NH MBL) has emerged as a possible scenario for stable localization in open systems, as suggested by spectral indicators identifying a putative transition for finite system sizes. In this work, we shift the focus to dynamical probes, specifically the steady-state spin current, to investigate transport properties in a disordered, non-Hermitian XXZ spin chain. Through exact diagonalization for small systems and tensor-network methods for larger chains, we demonstrate that the steady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially with disorder strength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values far beyond the previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy between spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport behavior, which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of dynamical observables in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional spectral measures may not fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity of limits in system size and time, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size studies. These findings challenge the existence of NH MBL in the studied model and underscore the need for alternative approaches to understand localization in non-Hermitian settings.

Title: An Overview of Josephson Junctions Based QPUs
Authors: Omid Mohebi, Alireza Hesam Mohseni
Abstract: Quantum processing units (QPUs) based on superconducting Josephson junctions promise significant advances in quantum computing. However, they face critical challenges. Decoherence, scalability limitations, and error correction overhead hinder practical, fault-tolerant implementations. This paper investigates these issues by exploring both fundamental quantum phenomena and practical engineering challenges. We analyze key quantum mechanical principles such as superposition, entanglement, and decoherence that govern the behavior of superconducting qubits. We also discuss quantum tunneling, Cooper pair formation, and the operational mechanics of Josephson junctions in detail. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis with alternative architectures, including ion trap and photonic systems. This comparison highlights the unique advantages and trade-offs of Josephson junction-based QPUs. Our findings emphasize the critical role of material innovations and optimized control techniques. These advances are essential for mitigating noise and decoherence and for realizing robust, scalable quantum computing.

Title: The role of spectator modes in the quantum-logic spectroscopy of single trapped molecular ions
Authors: Mikolaj Roguski, Aleksandr Shlykov, Ziv Meir, Stefan Willitsch
Abstract: Quantum-logic spectroscopy has become an increasingly important tool for the state detection and readout of trapped atomic and molecular ions which do not possess easily accessible closed-optical-cycling transitions. In this approach, the internal state of the target ion is mapped onto a co-trapped auxiliary ion. This mapping is typically mediated by normal modes of motion of the two-ion Coulomb crystal in the trap. The present study investigates the role of spectator modes not directly involved in a measurement protocol relying on a state-dependent optical-dipole force. We identify a Debye-Waller-type effect that modifies the response of the two-ion string to the force and show that cooling all normal modes of the string allows for the detection of the rovibrational ground state of a N$_2^+$ molecular ion with a fidelity exceeding 99.99% improving on previous experiments by more than an order of magnitude. This marked improvement in sensitivity paves the way for simultaneously identifying multiple rovibrational states at a fixed set of experimental parameters.

Title: Self-bound monolayer crystals of ultracold polar molecules
Authors: Matteo Ciardi, Kasper Rønning Pedersen, Tim Langen, Thomas Pohl
Abstract: We investigate the physics of ultracold dipolar molecules using path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and construct the complete phase diagram extending from weak to strong interactions and from small to mesoscopic particle numbers. Our calculations predict the formation of self-bound quantum droplets at interaction strengths lower than previously anticipated. For stronger interactions, the droplet continuously loses superfluidity as correlations develop, and is eventually found to undergo a transition to a crystalline monolayer that remains self-bound without external confinement. The spontaneous formation of such two-dimensional phases from a three-dimensional quantum gas is traced back to the peculiar anisotropic form of the dipole-dipole interaction generated by microwave-dressing of rotational molecular states. For sufficiently large particle numbers, crystallization takes place for comparably low interaction strengths that do not promote two-body bound states and should thus be observable in ongoing experiments without limitations from three-body recombination.

Title: Monitored Fluctuating Hydrodynamics
Authors: Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced ``sharpening'' phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known charge-sharpening transition for diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.

Title: Logarithmic entanglement lightcone from eigenstate correlations in the many-body localised phase
Authors: Ratul Thakur, Bikram Pain, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: We investigate the operator entanglement of the time-evolution operator through the framework of eigenstate correlations. Focusing on strongly disordered quantum many-body systems in the many-body localised (MBL) regime, we analyse the operator entanglement across various spatiotemporal cuts, revealing the logarithmic lightcone of entanglement spreading. We demonstrate that this logarithmic lightcone arises directly from a hierarchy of energyscales and lengthscales encoded in eigenstate correlations. By characterising the statistics of these hierarchical scales, we develop a microscopic theory for the spatiotemporal structure of entanglement spreading in MBL systems -- without invoking phenomenological constructs such as $\ell$-bits. This approach reveals the fundamental connection between eigenstate correlations and the emergent entanglement structure in MBL systems.

Title: Observation of non-Hermitian dislocation bound states and dislocation skin effects
Authors: Jia-Xin Zhong, Bitan Roy, Yun Jing
Abstract: The confluence of Non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding edge dislocations in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. These NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states as the system arrives at the shore of fostering exceptional points in the Brillouin zone under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.

Title: Quantum Algorithm for Green's Functions Measurements in the Fermi-Hubbard Model
Authors: Gino Bishop, Dmitry Bagrets, Frank K. Wilhelm
Abstract: In the framework of the hybrid quantum-classical variational cluster approach (VCA) to strongly correlated electron systems one of the goals of a quantum subroutine is to find single-particle correlation functions of lattice fermions in polynomial time. Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard test for this purpose, which requires an implementation of controlled single-particle fermionic operators. However, for a number of locality-preserving mappings to encode fermions into qubits, a direct construction of such operators is not possible. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm, which uses an analog of the Kubo formula adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly using only bilinears of fermionic operators and circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We test our new algorithm in practice by using open-access simulators of noisy IBM superconducting chips.

Title: Noise-Agnostic Quantum Error Mitigation with Data Augmented Neural Models
Authors: Manwen Liao, Yan Zhu, Giulio Chiribella, Yuxiang Yang
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation, a data processing technique for recovering the statistics of target processes from their noisy version, is a crucial task for near-term quantum technologies. Most existing methods require prior knowledge of the noise model or the noise parameters. Deep neural networks have a potential to lift this requirement, but current models require training data produced by ideal processes in the absence of noise. Here we build a neural model that achieves quantum error mitigation without any prior knowledge of the noise and without training on noise-free data. To achieve this feature, we introduce a quantum augmentation technique for error mitigation. Our approach applies to quantum circuits and to the dynamics of many-body and continuous-variable quantum systems, accommodating various types of noise models. We demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it both on simulated noisy circuits and on real quantum hardware.

Title: Imaginary eigenvalues of Hermitian Hamiltonian with an inverted potential well and transition to the real spectrum at exceptional point by a non-Hermitian interaction
Authors: Ni Liu, Meng Luo, J. -Q. Liang
Abstract: We in this paper study the hermiticity of Hamiltonian and energy spectrum for the SU(1; 1) systems. The Hermitian Hamiltonian can possess imaginary eigenvalues in contrast with the common belief that hermiticity is a suffcient condition for real spectrum. The imaginary eigenvalues are derived in algebraic method with imaginary-frequency boson operators for the Hamiltonian of inverted potential well. Dual sets of mutually orthogonal eigenstates are required corresponding respectively to the complex conjugate eigenvalues. Arbitrary order eigenfunctions seen to be the polynomials of imaginary frequency are generated from the normalized ground-state wave functions, which are spatially non localized. The Hamiltonian including a non-Hermitian interaction term can be converted by similarity transformation to the Hermitian one with an effective potential of reduced slope, which is turnable by the interaction constant. The transformation operator should not be unitary but Hermitian different from the unitary transformation in ordinary quantum mechanics. The effective potential vanishes at a critical value of coupling strength called the exceptional point, where all eigenstates are degenerate with zero eigenvalue and transition from imaginary to real spectra appears. The SU(1; 1) generator $\widehat{S}_{z}$ with real eigenvalues determined by the commutation relation of operators, however, is non-Hermitian in the realization of imaginay-frequency boson operators. The classical counterpart of the quantum Hamiltonian with non-Hermitian interaction is a complex function of the canonical variables. It becomes by the canonical transformation of variables a real function indicating exactly the one to one quantum-classical correspondence of Hamiltonians.

Title: Controlling measurement-induced phase transitions with tunable detector coupling
Authors: Ritu Nehra, Alessandro Romito, Dganit Meidan
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.

Title: Lower bounds on entanglement entropy without twin copy
Authors: Yannick Meurice
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of estimating experimentally the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts (bitstrings) for a $single$ copy of a prepared state. Using exact diagonalization and analog simulations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the Shannon entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the bitstrings of adiabatically prepared ground states and the reduced entropies $S_A^X$ and $S_B^X$ obtained from the marginal probabilities in $A$ and $B$. We then calculate the classical mutual information $I^X_{AB}=S_A^X+S_B^X-S_{AB}^X$, which is a lower bound on $S_{A}^{vN}$. We show that for a broad range of lattice spacing and detuning, $I^X_{AB}$ is typically 20 percent below $S_{A}^{vN}$ in regions where $S_{A}^{vN}$ is large and a less close bound in regions where $S_{A}^{vN}$ is low. We argue that this use of the easily available bitstrings provides a robust and efficient way to explore empirically the phase diagram of qubit-based quantum simulators and identify critical regions.

Title: Photon distillation schemes with reduced resource costs based on multiphoton Fourier interference
Authors: F.H.B. Somhorst, B.K. Sauër, S.N. van den Hoven, J.J. Renema
Abstract: We present a scalable scheme to achieve photon distillation, i.e. the preparation of a single photon with reduced indistinguishability error out of multiple imperfect photons, based on multiphoton interference in Fourier matrices. Our scheme achieves arbitrary error reduction in a single step, removing the need to concatenate multiple rounds of the protocol. Our scheme has resource costs linear in the error reduction, and a constant probability of success for arbitrary error reductions. We find that the scheme both raises the threshold of error correcting codes in photonic quantum computers, as well as reduces the resources required to construct a photonic quantum computer, making it highly promising for implementation in such devices.

Title: Quantum state preparation for multivariate functions
Authors: Matthias Rosenkranz, Eric Brunner, Gabriel Marin-Sanchez, Nathan Fitzpatrick, Silas Dilkes, Yao Tang, Yuta Kikuchi, Marcello Benedetti
Abstract: A fundamental step of any quantum algorithm is the preparation of qubit registers in a suitable initial state. Often qubit registers represent a discretization of continuous variables and the initial state is defined by a multivariate function. We develop protocols for preparing quantum states whose amplitudes encode multivariate functions by linearly combining block-encodings of Fourier and Chebyshev basis functions. Without relying on arithmetic circuits, quantum Fourier transforms, or multivariate quantum signal processing, our algorithms are simpler and more effective than previous proposals. We analyze requirements both asymptotically and pragmatically in terms of near/medium-term resources. Numerically, we prepare bivariate Student's t-distributions, 2D Ricker wavelets and electron wavefunctions in a 3D Coulomb potential, which are initial states with potential applications in finance, physics and chemistry simulations. Finally, we prepare bivariate Gaussian distributions on the Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum processor using 24 qubits and up to 237 two-qubit gates.

Title: Phases and phase transition in Grover's algorithm with systematic noise
Authors: Sasanka Dowarah, Chuanwei Zhang, Vedika Khemani, Michael H. Kolodrubetz
Abstract: While limitations on quantum computation by Markovian environmental noise are well-understood in generality, their behavior for different quantum circuits and noise realizations can be less universal. Here we consider a canonical quantum algorithm - Grover's algorithm for unordered search on $L$ qubits - in the presence of systematic noise. This allows us to write the behavior as a random Floquet unitary, which we show is well-characterized by random matrix theory (RMT). The RMT analysis enables analytical predictions for phases and phase transitions of the many-body dynamics. We find two separate transitions. At moderate disorder $\delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}\sim L^{-1}$, there is a ergodicity breaking transition such that a finite-dimensional manifold remains non-ergodic for $\delta < \delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}$. Computational power is lost at a much smaller disorder, $\delta_{c,\mathrm{comp}} \sim L^{-1/2}2^{-L/2}$. We comment on relevance to non-systematic noise in realistic quantum computers, including cold atom, trapped ion, and superconducting platforms.

Title: Resource-Optimized Grouping Shadow for Efficient Energy Estimation
Authors: Min Li, Mao Lin, Matthew J. S. Beach
Abstract: The accurate and efficient energy estimation of quantum Hamiltonians consisting of Pauli observables is an essential task in modern quantum computing. We introduce a Resource-Optimized Grouping Shadow (ROGS) algorithm, which optimally allocates measurement resources by minimizing the estimation error bound through a novel overlapped grouping strategy and convex optimization. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that ROGS requires significantly fewer unique quantum circuits for accurate estimation accuracy compared to existing methods given a fixed measurement budget, addressing a major cost factor for compiling and executing circuits on quantum computers.

Title: Topological Insights from State Manipulation in a Classical Elastic System
Authors: Kazi T. Mahmood, M. Arif Hasan
Abstract: The exploration of the Berry phase in classical mechanics has opened new frontiers in understanding the dynamics of physical systems, analogous to quantum mechanics. Here, we show controlled accumulation of the Berry phase in a two-level elastic bit, which are classical counterparts of qubits, achieved by manipulating coupled granules with external drivers. Employing the Bloch sphere representation, the paper demonstrates the manipulation of elastic bit states and the realization of quantum-analogue logic gates. A key achievement is the calculation of the Berry phase for various system states, revealing insights into the system's topological nature. Unique to this study is the use of external parameters to explore topological transitions, contrasting with traditional approaches focusing on internal system modifications. By linking the classical and quantum worlds through the Berry phase of an elastic bit, this work extends the potential applications of topological concepts in designing new materials and computational models.

Title: Protecting entanglement witnesses with randomized measurements
Authors: Jing-Tao Qiu, Wei-Jie Jiang, Xiao-Dong Yu
Abstract: Entanglement is one of the most prominent features of quantum mechanics and serves as an essential resource in quantum information science. Therefore, the certification of entanglement is crucial for quantum information processing tasks. While entanglement witnesses are the most frequently used method for entanglement certification in experiments, recent research shows that even tiny errors in measurements may significantly undermine the effectiveness of a witness. In this work, we propose a randomized-measurement-based method to solve this problem. Through this method, the errors in measurement results can be substantially suppressed, thereby restoring the certification capability of entanglement witnesses. Our method is not only applicable to general types of witnesses, including multi-party entanglement and high-dimensional entanglement witnesses, but also experimentally friendly in the sense that only slight modifications are needed to the original measurement settings.

Title: The dynamical $α$-Rényi entropies of local Hamiltonians grow at most linearly in time
Authors: Daniele Toniolo, Sougato Bose
Abstract: We consider a generic one dimensional spin system of length $ L $, arbitrarily large, with strictly local interactions, for example nearest neighbor, and prove that the dynamical $ \alpha $-Rényi entropies, $ 0 < \alpha \le 1 $, of an initial product state grow at most linearly in time. This result arises from a general relation among dynamical $ \alpha $-Rényi entropies and Lieb-Robinson bounds. We extend our bound on the dynamical generation of entropy to systems with exponential decay of interactions, for values of $\alpha$ close enough to $ 1 $. We provide a non rigorous argument to extend our results to initial pure states with low entanglement of $ O(\log L) $. This class of states includes many examples of spin systems ground states, and also critical states. We establish that low entanglement states have an efficient MPS representation that persists at least up to times of order $ \log L $. The main technical tools are the Lieb-Robinson bounds, to locally approximate the dynamics of the spin chain, a strict upper bound of Audenaert on $ \alpha $-Rényi entropies and a bound on their concavity. Such a bound, that we provide in an appendix, can be of independent interest.

Title: Dephasing-Induced Distribution of Entanglement in Tripartite Quantum Systems
Authors: Sovik Roy, Md. Manirul Ali, Abhijit Mandal, Chandrashekar Radhakrishnan
Abstract: Preserving multipartite entanglement amidst decoherence poses a pivotal challenge in quantum information processing. However, assessing multipartite entanglement in mixed states amid decoherence presenting a formidable task. Employing reservoir memory offers a means to attenuate the decoherence dynamics impacting multipartite entanglement, thereby slowing its degradation. One of the important measures which can be implemented to quantify entanglement is the relative entropy of entanglement. Although this measure is not monogamous \cite{horodeckirev2009}, it can universally be applied to both pure and mixed states. Based on this fundamental novelty, in this work, therefore, we introduce a quantifier which will investigate how entanglement remain distributed among the qubits of multipartite states when these states are exposed to multipartite dephasing setting. For our study we use various pure and mixed tripartite states subjected to finite temperature in both Markovian and non-Markovian local/common bath. Here, we consider situations where the three qubits interact with a common reservoir as well as a local bosonic reservoir. We also show that the robustness of a quantum system to decoherence depends on the distribution of entanglement and its interaction with various configurations of the bath. When each qubit has its own local environment, the system exhibits different distribution dynamics compared to when all three qubits share a common environment with one exception regarding a mixed state.

Title: A quantum random access memory (QRAM) using a polynomial encoding of binary strings
Authors: Priyanka Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: Quantum algorithms claim significant speedup over their classical counterparts for solving many problems. An important aspect of many of these algorithms is the existence of a quantum oracle, which needs to be implemented efficiently in order to realize the claimed advantages. A quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a promising architecture for realizing these oracles. In this paper we develop a new design for QRAM and implement it with Clifford+T circuit. We focus on optimizing the T-count and T-depth since non-Clifford gates are the most expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. Integral to our design is a polynomial encoding of bit strings and so we refer to this design as $\text{QRAM}_{poly}$. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art bucket brigade architecture for QRAM, we achieve an exponential improvement in T-depth, while reducing T-count and keeping the qubit count same. Specifically, if $N$ is the number of memory locations, then $\text{QRAM}_{poly}$ has T-depth $O(\log\log N)$, T-count $O(N-\log N)$ and qubit count $O(N)$, while the bucket brigade circuit has T-depth $O(\log N)$, T-count $O(N)$ and qubit count $O(N)$. Combining two $\text{QRAM}_{poly}$ we design a quantum look-up-table, $\text{qLUT}_{poly}$, that has T-depth $O(\log\log N)$, T-count $O(\sqrt{N})$ and qubit count $O(\sqrt{N})$. A qLUT or quantum read-only memory (QROM) has restricted functionality than a QRAM and needs to be compiled each time the contents of the memory change. The previous state-of-the-art CSWAP architecture has T-depth $O(\sqrt{N})$, T-count $O(\sqrt{N})$ and qubit count $O(\sqrt{N})$. Thus we achieve a double exponential improvement in T-depth while keeping the T-count and qubit-count asymptotically same. Additionally, with our polynomial encoding of bit strings, we develop a method to optimize the Toffoli-count of circuits, specially those consisting of multi-controlled-NOT gates.

Title: Optimization of partially isolated quantum harmonic oscillator memory systems by mean square decoherence time criteria
Authors: Igor G. Vladimirov, Ian R. Petersen
Abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum harmonic oscillators with position-momentum system variables, whose internal dynamics and interaction with the environment are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations. A recently proposed approach to such systems as Heisenberg picture quantum memories exploits their ability to approximately retain initial conditions over a decoherence horizon. Using the quantum memory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on a weighted mean-square deviation of the system variables from their initial values, we apply this approach to a partially isolated subsystem of the oscillator, which is not directly affected by the external fields. The partial isolation leads to an appropriate system decomposition and a qualitatively different short-horizon asymptotic behaviour of the deviation, which yields a longer decoherence time in the high-fidelity limit. The resulting approximate decoherence time maximization over the energy parameters for improving the quantum memory performance is discussed for a coherent feedback interconnection of such systems.

Title: Scalable quantum eraser for superconducting integrated circuits
Authors: Ciro Micheletti Diniz, Celso J. Villas Bôas, Alan C. Santos
Abstract: A fast and scalable scheme for multi-qubit resetting in superconducting quantum processors is proposed by exploiting the feasibility of frequency-tunable transmon qubits and transmon-like couplers to engineer a full programmable superconducting erasing head. The scalability of the device is verified by simultaneously resetting two qubits, where we show that collectivity effects may emerge as an fundamental ingredient to speed up the erasing process. Conversely, we also describe the appearance of decoherence-free subspace in multi-qubit chips, causing it to damage the device performance. To overcome this problem, a special set of parameters for the tunable frequency coupler is proposed, which allows us to erase even states within such subspace. To end, we offer a proposal to buildup integrated superconducting processors that can be efficiently connected to erasure heads in a scalable way.

Title: Magnetic Field Detection Using a Two-Qubit System Under Noisy Heisenberg Interaction
Authors: George Biswas, Sayan Sengupta, Anindya Biswas
Abstract: We propose a method to design a magnetic field detector using a noisy two-qubit system. The system evolves under a noisy Heisenberg interaction Hamiltonian, and we investigate its behavior by calculating both the $l_1$-norm of quantum coherence and the return probability in the presence and absence of an external magnetic field. We allow for decoherence modeled by quasi-static charge noise in the exchange coupling of the two-qubit system and find that, while the magnetic field does not significantly influence the decoherence process, it introduces a distinct oscillation in the return probability over time. Importantly, the oscillation frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field, providing a clear signature that can be used for magnetic field detection. These results point towards the feasibility of realizing a practical quantum-based magnetic field detector, with the ability to operate under noisy conditions while maintaining sensitivity to the field strength.

Title: Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders
Authors: Mainak Pal, Madhumita Sarkar, K. Sengupta, Arnab Sen
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both Néel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder-free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display nonzero long-time averages for Néel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain. Finally, we identify additional exact mid-spectrum zero modes that stay unchanged as a function of $\Delta$ and violate ETH.

Title: A finite-resources description of a measurement process and its implications for the "Wigner's Friend" scenario
Authors: Fernando de Melo, Gabriel Dias Carvalho, Pedro S. Correia, Paola Concha Obando, Thiago R. de Oliveira, Raúl O. Vallejos
Abstract: Quantum mechanics started out as a theory to describe the smallest scales of energy in Nature. After a hundred years of development it is now routinely employed to describe, among others, quantum computers with thousands of qubits. This tremendous progress turns the debate of foundational questions into a technological imperative. In what follows we introduce a model of a quantum measurement process that consistently includes the impact of having access only to finite resources when describing a macroscopic system, like a measurement apparatus. Leveraging modern tools from equilibration of closed systems and typicality, we show how the measurement collapse can be seen as an effective description of a closed dynamics, of which we do not know all its details. Our model is then exploited to address the ``Wigner Friend Scenario'', and we observe that an agreement is reached when both Wigner and his friend acknowledge their finite resources perspective and describe the measurement process accordingly.

Title: Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems
Authors: Andy Chia, Wai-Keong Mok, Leong-Chuan Kwek, Changsuk Noh
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schrödinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Liénard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.

Title: SparQSim: Simulating Scalable Quantum Algorithms via Sparse Quantum State Representations
Authors: Tai-Ping Sun, Zhao-Yun Chen, Yun-Jie Wang, Cheng Xue, Huan-Yu Liu, Xi-Ning Zhuang, Xiao-Fan Xu, Yu-Chun Wu, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: Efficient simulation of large-scale quantum algorithms is pivotal yet challenging due to the exponential growth of the state space inherent in both Schödinger-based and Feynman-based methods. While Feynman-based simulators can be highly efficient when the quantum state is sparse, these simulators often do not fully support the simulation of large-scale, complex quantum algorithms which rely on QRAM and other oracle-based operations. In this work, we present SparQSim, a quantum simulator implemented in C++ and inspired by the Feynman-based method. SparQSim operates at the register level by storing only the nonzero components of the quantum state, enabling flexible and resource-efficient simulation of basic quantum operations and integrated QRAM for advanced applications such as quantum linear system solvers. In particular, numerical experiments on benchmarks from QASMBench and MQTBench demonstrate that SparQSim outperforms conventional Schrödinger-based simulators in both execution time and memory usage for circuits with high sparsity. Moreover, full-process simulations of quantum linear system solvers based on a discrete adiabatic method yield results that are consistent with theoretical predictions. This work establishes SparQSim as a promising platform for the efficient simulation of scalable quantum algorithms.

Title: Quantum Dissipative Continuous Time Crystals
Authors: Felix Russo, Thomas Pohl
Abstract: Continuous time crystals, i.e., nonequilibrium phases with a spontaneously broken continuous time-translational symmetry, have been studied and recently observed in the long-time dynamics of open quantum systems. Here, we investigate a lattice of interacting three-level systems and find two distinct time-crystal phases that cannot be described within mean-field theory. Remarkably, one of them emerges only in the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our findings extend explorations of continuous time-translational symmetry breaking in dissipative systems beyond the classical phenomenology of periodic orbits in a low-dimensional nonlinear system. The proposed model applies directly to the laser-driven dynamics of interacting Rydberg states in neutral atom arrays and suggests that the predicted time-crystal phases are observable in such experiments.

Title: Quantum Generative Models for Image Generation: Insights from MNIST and MedMNIST
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Wei An Hou, Hsiang-Wei Hu, Zhen-Sheng Cai
Abstract: Quantum generative models offer a promising new direction in machine learning by leveraging quantum circuits to enhance data generation capabilities. In this study, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical image generation framework that integrates variational quantum circuits into a diffusion-based model. To improve training dynamics and generation quality, we introduce two novel noise strategies: intrinsic quantum-generated noise and a tailored noise scheduling mechanism. Our method is built upon a lightweight U-Net architecture, with the quantum layer embedded in the bottleneck module to isolate its effect. We evaluate our model on MNIST and MedMNIST datasets to examine its feasibility and performance. Notably, our results reveal that under limited data conditions (fewer than 100 training images), the quantum-enhanced model generates images with higher perceptual quality and distributional similarity than its classical counterpart using the same architecture. While the quantum model shows advantages on grayscale data such as MNIST, its performance is more nuanced on complex, color-rich datasets like PathMNIST. These findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of quantum generative models and lay the groundwork for future developments in low-resource and biomedical image generation.

Title: Output Prediction of Quantum Circuits based on Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Yuxiang Liu, Fanxu Meng, Lu Wang, Yi Hu, Zaichen Zhang, Xutao Yu
Abstract: The output prediction of quantum circuits is a formidably challenging task imperative in developing quantum devices. Motivated by the natural graph representation of quantum circuits, this paper proposes a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based framework to predict the output expectation values of quantum circuits under noisy and noiseless conditions and compare the performance of different parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). We construct datasets under noisy and noiseless conditions using a non-parameterized quantum gate set to predict circuit expectation values. The node feature vectors for GNNs are specifically designed to include noise information. In our simulations, we compare the prediction performance of GNNs in both noisy and noiseless conditions against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the same dataset and their qubit scalability. GNNs demonstrate superior prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Subsequently, we utilize the parameterized quantum gate set to construct noisy PQCs and compute the ground state energy of hydrogen molecules using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). We propose two schemes: the Indirect Comparison scheme, which involves directly predicting the ground state energy and subsequently comparing circuit performances, and the Direct Comparison scheme, which directly predicts the relative performance of the two circuits. Simulation results indicate that the Direct Comparison scheme significantly outperforms the Indirect Comparison scheme by an average of 36.2% on the same dataset, providing a new and effective perspective for using GNNs to predict the overall properties of PQCs, specifically by focusing on their performance differences.

Title: Observation of Quantum Darwinism and the Origin of Classicality with Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Zitian Zhu, Kiera Salice, Akram Touil, Zehang Bao, Zixuan Song, Pengfei Zhang, Hekang Li, Zhen Wang, Chao Song, Qiujiang Guo, H. Wang, Rubem Mondaini
Abstract: The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.

Title: Disentanglement as particles separate
Authors: B. C. Sanctuary
Abstract: Disentanglement refers to decoherence that destroys the quantum interference terms between particles as they separate. This process reduces the pure isotropic entangled EPR state to a mixed anisotropic state. Averaging over the ensemble of states leads to correlations between separated particles that satisfies Bell's inequalities. Applying disentanglement to EPR pairs of photons shows that entanglement is characterized by various two-particle symmetry properties. These symmetry properties are destroyed by disentanglement but photon helicity is conserved. This is sufficient to account for the correlations needed to resolve the EPR paradox. Apart from a numerical factor, the functional form for the correlations due to entanglement and disentanglement is identical, thereby making it difficult to distinguish between the two in the current experiments.

Title: The Statistical Interpretation of Entangled States
Authors: B. C. Sanctuary
Abstract: Entangled EPR spin pairs can be treated using the statistical ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics. As such the singlet state results from an ensemble of spin pairs each with an arbitrary axis of quantization. This axis acts as a quantum mechanical hidden variable. If the spins lose coherence they disentangle into a mixed state. Whether or not the EPR spin pairs retain entanglement or disentangle, however, the statistical ensemble interpretation resolves the EPR paradox and gives a mechanism for quantum "teleportation" without the need for instantaneous action-at-a-distance.

Title: A Note on Quantum-Secure PRPs
Authors: Mark Zhandry
Abstract: We show how to construct pseudorandom permutations (PRPs) that remain secure even if the adversary can query the permutation, both in the forward and reverse directions, on a quantum superposition of inputs. Such quantum-secure PRPs have found numerous applications in cryptography and complexity theory. Our construction combines a quantum-secure pseudorandom function together with constructions of classical format preserving encryption. By combining known results, we show how to construct quantum-secure PRP in this model whose security relies only on the existence of one-way functions.

Title: Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations
Authors: R. S. Watson, K. V. Kheruntsyan
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.

Title: Harnessing Nonlinear Dynamics for Time-Driven Berry Phase in Classical Systems
Authors: Kazi T. Mahmood, M. Arif Hasan
Abstract: Phases arising from cyclic processes are fundamental in physics, bridging quantum and classical domains and providing deeper insights into the topology and dynamics of physical systems. This study investigates the accumulation of a time-driven Berry phase in a classical nonlinear system comprised of two spherical granules and introduces a method in which gauge variants naturally evolve over time without altering internal or external conditions. We develop a perturbation-based model to map the system's elastic characteristics to Bloch states and confirm the theoretical predictions of the frequency-dependent Berry phase through experiments. Our findings reveal that the Berry phase can exhibit trivial and nontrivial values, influenced by external driving forces and static precompression. Our results demonstrate a rich array of vibrational modes, capable of displaying identical Berry phase signatures across different frequencies-a significant departure from previous studies that identified a single topological resonance. Multiple nontrivial Berry phases emerge in highly nonlinear settings, whereas more linear regimes exhibit a singular nontrivial phase. Notably, the behavior of the Berry phase in our system mirrors fundamental quantum mechanics concepts, such as path-dependent state evolution. This study highlights the potential of classical mechanical systems to mimic quantum phenomena, opening new pathways for quantum-inspired topological computation and offering fresh perspectives on using time-driven Berry phase accumulation to investigate topological properties in nonlinear media.

Title: Tensor tree learns hidden relational structures in data to construct generative models
Authors: Kenji Harada, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Naoki Kawashima
Abstract: Based on the tensor tree network with the Born machine framework, we propose a general method for constructing a generative model by expressing the target distribution function as the amplitude of the quantum wave function represented by a tensor tree. The key idea is dynamically optimizing the tree structure that minimizes the bond mutual information. The proposed method offers enhanced performance and uncovers hidden relational structures in the target data. We illustrate potential practical applications with four examples: (i) random patterns, (ii) QMNIST handwritten digits, (iii) Bayesian networks, and (iv) the pattern of stock price fluctuation pattern in S&P500. In (i) and (ii), the strongly correlated variables were concentrated near the center of the network; in (iii), the causality pattern was identified; and in (iv), a structure corresponding to the eleven sectors emerged.

Title: Interaction of Spinons with Magnetic Fields in a Fractionalized State
Authors: Yu Zhang, Hengdi Zhao, Tristan R. Cao, Rahul Nandkishore, Pedro Schlottmann, Lance Delong, Gang Cao
Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12 is believed to feature a universal heavy spinon Fermi surface that underpins both a quantum spin liquid (QSL) and an adjacent heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. The itinerant spinons act as heat carriers that render the charge-insulating QSL a much better thermal conductor than the HFSM [1]. We find that application of magnetic field up to 14 T surprisingly induces an abrupt rise in the heat capacity by as much as 5000%, which breaks the signature linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity of both phases below 150 mK. In contrast, the AC magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity show little response up to 14 T over the same milli-Kelvin temperature range. Applied magnetic field also readily suppresses the thermal conductivity by up to 40% with decreasing temperature below 4 K. All these complex thermal phenomena reveal that application of magnetic field drastically alters the behavior of spinons at low temperatures. The astonishing rise in the heat capacity (and thus entropy) at milli-Kelvin temperatures and strong magnetic fields presents a highly unusual situation that demands novel physics.

Title: A healthier stochastic semiclassical gravity: world without Schrödinger cats
Authors: Lajos Diósi
Abstract: Semiclassical gravity couples classical gravity to the quantized matter in meanfield approximation. The meanfield coupling is problematic for two reasons. First, it ignores the quantum fluctuation of matter distribution. Second, it violates the linearity of the quantum dynamics. The first problem can be mitigated by allowing stochastic fluctuations of the geometry but the second problem lies deep in quantum foundations. Restoration of quantum linearity requires a conceptual approach to hybrid classical-quantum coupling. Studies of the measurement problem and the quantum-classical transition point to the solution. It is based on a postulated mechanism of spontaneous quantum monitoring plus feedback. This approach eliminates Schrödinger cat states, takes quantum fluctuations into account, and restores the linearity of quantum dynamics. Such a captivating conceptionally `healthier' semiclassical theory exists in the Newtonian limit, but its relativistic covariance hits a wall. Here we will briefly recapitulate the concept and its realization in the nonrelativistic limit. We emphasize that the long-known obstacles to the relativistic extension lie in quantum foundations.

Title: Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Charlie Cummings
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on ``link complements'', i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to GHZ-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state. These results generalize to any three dimensional topological field theory with a dual chiral rational conformal field theory.

Title: Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles
Authors: Marek Gazdzicki, Daniel Kikola, Ivan Pidhurskyi, Leonardo Tinti
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a macroscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing. Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a 1+1D toy model of particle space-time evolution. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energies. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single $c\bar{c}$ pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments. Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei and the quark-gluon plasma hadronisation paradox. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties.

Title: Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.

Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.
