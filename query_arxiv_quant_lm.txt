Title: Matrix encoding method in variational quantum singular value algorithm
Authors: Alexander I. Zenchuk, Wentao Qi, Junde Wu
Abstract: We propose the variational quantum singular value decomposition based on encoding the elements of the considered matrix into the state of a quantum system of appropriate dimension. This method doesn't use the expansion of this matrix in terms of the unitary matrices. Conditional measurement is involved to avoid small success probability in ancilla measurement. The objective function for maximization algorithm can be obtained probabilistically via measurement of the state of a one-qubit subsystem. The circuit requires $O(\log N)$ qubits for realization of this algorithm whose depths is $O(\log N)$ as well.

Title: Entanglement of a spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg diamond spin cluster in the thermal bosonic bath
Authors: A. R. Kuzmak
Abstract: With the rapid development of quantum information over the last decade, there is a growing need to identify physical systems that can effectively implement quantum computing. One such system is the diamond spin cluster, which appears in various chemical compounds, including the natural mineral azurite, where copper ions are arranged in this structure. Here, we study the time evolution of a diamond spin cluster with Ising-Heisenberg interaction under the influence of a thermal bosonic bath, which simulates the environment. Using negativity as a measure, we analyze the entanglement behavior between the central spins of the system. We demonstrate how the environment influences the presence of entanglement in the system. Specifically, we show that for certain values of the environment parameters, entanglement increases significantly. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which entanglement reaches its maximum possible values.

Title: Simultaneous optical phase and loss estimation revisited: measurement and probe incompatibility
Authors: Matheus Eiji Ohno Bezerra, Francesco Albarelli, Rafal Demkowicz-Dobrzanski
Abstract: Quantum multiparameter metrology is hindered by incompatibility issues, such as finding a single probe state (probe incompatibility) and a single measurement (measurement incompatibility) optimal for all parameters. The simultaneous estimation of phase shift and loss in a single optical mode is a paradigmatic multiparameter metrological problem in which such tradeoffs are present. We consider two settings: single-mode or two-mode probes (with a reference lossless mode), and for each setting we consider either Gaussian states or arbitrary quantum states of light restricted only by a maximal number of photons allowed. We find numerically that, as the number of photons increases, there are quantum states of light for which probe incompatibility disappears both in the single- and two-mode scenarios. On the other hand, for Gaussian states, probe incompatibility is present in the single-mode case and may be removed only in the two-mode setting thanks to the entanglement with the reference mode. Finally, we provide strong arguments that the fundamental incompatibility aspect of the model is measurement incompatibility, which persists for all the scenarios considered, and unlike probe-incompatibility cannot be overcome even in the large photon number limit.

Title: Objective Reduction of the Wave Function Demonstrated on Superconducting Quantum Compute
Authors: James Tagg, William Reid
Abstract: We describe an experiment using superconducting transmon qubits that demonstrates wavefunction collapse consistent with Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) - the theory of consciousness proposed by Sir Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff. The experiment performs a partial measurement on a qubit. It uses the result of that measurement to move an estimated 10e-12 kg of mass in one of two locations separated by approximately 1 mm. In standard quantum mechanics, the partial measurement leaves the system in an improper mixture, a state that appears probabilistic but retains quantum coherence. This is mathematically indistinguishable from a proper mixture, where the state has genuinely collapsed. According to Penrose's theory, improper mixtures can lead to gravitationally induced collapse. Results of our experiment show a change in the circuit evolution that is consistent with wavefunction collapse driven by such an improper mixture. The experiment is performed on an IBM Eagle 127-qubit processor using IBM's programming framework Qiskit.

Title: An optimal bound on long-range distillable entanglement
Authors: Jonah Kudler-Flam, Vladimir Narovlansky, Nikita Sopenko
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.

Title: Magic State Injection with Erasure Qubits
Authors: Shoham Jacoby, Yotam Vaknin, Alex Retzker, Arne L. Grimsmo
Abstract: Erasure qubits constitute a promising approach for tackling the daunting resources required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. By heralding erasure errors, both the error-correction threshold and the sub-threshold scaling of the logical error rate are significantly improved. While previous research has focused primarily on fault-tolerant quantum memories, we extend this investigation to magic state injection--a critical yet resource-intensive component of fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that, after postselecting on erasures, the logical error rate of the injected magic state is set by the residual Pauli error, while the space-time overhead is only marginally increased as compared to non-erasure qubits with a similar noise strength. These conclusions hold both for injection into the surface code, and for injection and cultivation on the color code. For the former, we show that most of the gains can be achieved by using just three strategically placed erasure qubits in the surface code patch, independent of the patch size. For the latter, in contrast, it is beneficial to have all the qubits in the cultivation patch be erasure qubits. Our results for cultivation suggest that algorithmically relevant logical error rates may be within reach without magic state distillation for erasure rates $\lesssim 4\times 10^{-3}$ and residual Pauli error rates $\sim 10^{-4}$.

Title: Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics
Authors: Yu-Min Hu, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate in the context of dissipative state preparation how a system may asymptotically approach the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. Building on case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Treating the strength $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.

Title: Topological response in open quantum systems with weak symmetries
Authors: Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl, Xiao-Qi Sun
Abstract: In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the symmetry charge can be exchanged with the environment but remains conserved on average. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We validate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.

Title: Quantifiers and witnesses for the nonclassicality of measurements and of states
Authors: Yujie Zhang, Yìlè Yīng, David Schmid
Abstract: In a recent work, arXiv:2503.05884, we proposed a unified notion of nonclassicality that applies to arbitrary processes in quantum theory, including individual quantum states, measurements, channels, set of these, etc. This notion is derived from the principle of generalized noncontextuality, but in a novel manner that applies to individual processes rather than full experiments or theories. Here, we provide novel certificates and measures for characterizing and quantifying the nonclassicality inherent in states, measurements, and sets thereof, using semidefinite programming techniques. These are theory-dependent, complementing theory-independent methods based on noncontextuality inequalities. We provide explicit applications of these ideas to many illustrative examples.

Title: State Specific Measurement Protocols for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Davide Bincoletto, Jakob S. Kottmann
Abstract: A central roadblock in the realization of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum hardware is the high overhead associated with measurement repetitions, which hampers the computation of complex problems, such as the simulation of mid- and large-sized molecules. In this work, we propose a novel measurement protocol which relies on computing an approximation of the Hamiltonian expectation value. The method involves measuring cheap grouped operators directly and estimating the residual elements through iterative measurements of new grouped operators in different bases, with the process being truncated at a certain stage. The measured elements comprehend the operators defined by the Hard-Core Bosonic approximation, which encode electron-pair annihilation and creation operators. These can be easily decomposed into three self-commuting groups which can be measured simultaneously. Applied to molecular systems, the method achieves a reduction of 30% to 80% in the number of measurement and gates depth in the measuring circuits compared to state-of-the-art methods. This provides a scalable and cheap measurement protocol, advancing the application of variational approaches for simulating physical systems.

Title: Simulation of Atomic Layer Deposition with a Quantum Computer
Authors: Evgeny Plekhanov, Georgia Prokopiou, Michal Krompiec, Viktor Radovic, Pierre Desjardins, Pluton Pullumbi, David Muñoz Ramo
Abstract: In this work, we present the study of an atomic layer deposition (ALD) of zirconium by means of a quantum computation on an emulator representing the features of an architecture based on qubits implemented on carbon nanotubes. ALD process control is key in several technological applications such as spintronics, catalysis and renewable energy storage. We first derive a large ab-initio model of the precursor molecule approaching the infinite hydroxylated silicon (100) surface. In particular, we optimize geometry in three configurations: reactants, transition state and products. Subsequently, we derive an effective small cluster model for each state. Atomic valence active space (AVAS) transformation is then performed on these small clusters, leading to an effective qubit Hamiltonian, which is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We study the convergence of the reaction activation barrier with respect to the active space size and benchmark quantum calculations on a noiseless emulator and on an emulator representing a carbon nanotube qubit architecture, including an appropriate noise model and post-selection error mitigation. These calculations reveal an excellent agreement between the two emulation modes. Our VQE calculations provide the multi-configurational corrections to the single determinant DFT and HF states and pave the way for the routine quantum calculations of ALD reactions.

Title: Superresolution imaging with entanglement-enhanced telescopy
Authors: Isack Padilla, Aqil Sajjad, Babak N. Saif, Saikat Guha
Abstract: Long-baseline interferometry will be possible using pre-shared entanglement between two telescope sites to mimic the standard phase-scanning interferometer, but without physical beam combination. We show that spatial-mode sorting at each telescope, along with pre-shared entanglement, can be used to realize the most general multimode interferometry on light collected by any number of telescopes, enabling achieving quantitative-imaging performance at the ultimate limit pursuant to the baseline as afforded by quantum theory. We work out an explicit example involving two telescopes imaging two point sources.

Title: Controllable diatomic molecular quantum thermodynamic machines
Authors: C.O. Edet, E. P. Inyang, P. O. Amadi, O. Abah, N. Ali
Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system reveals different operational phases for the range of parameter regimes considered, such as a quantum heat engine. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.

Title: Signature of matter-field coupling in quantum-mechanical statistics
Authors: Ana María Cetto, Luis de la Peña
Abstract: The connection between the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of particles and the quantum statistics is established by considering the response of identical particles to a common background radiation field. For this purpose, the Hamiltonian analysis previously performed in stochastic electrodynamics to derive the quantum description of a one-particle system is extended to a system of two identical bound particles subject to the same field. Depending on the relative phase of the response of the particles to a common field mode, two types of particles are distinguished by their symmetry or antisymmetry with respect to particle exchange. While any number of identical particles responding in phase can occupy the same energy state, there can only be two particles responding in antiphase. Calculation of bipartite correlations between the response functions reveals maximum entanglement as a consequence of the parallel response of the particles to the common field. The introduction of an internal rotation parameter leads to a direct link between spin and statistics and to a physical rationale for the Pauli exclusion principle.

Title: Origin of the quantum operator formalism and its connection with linear response theory
Authors: Ana María Cetto, Luis de la Peña
Abstract: Linear response theory is concerned with the way in which a physical system reacts to a small change in the applied forces. Here we show that quantum mechanics in the Heisenberg representation can be understood as a linear response theory. To this effect, we first address the question of the physical origin of the quantum operator formalism by considering the interaction of a bound electron with the radiation field, including the zero-point component, following the approach of stochastic electrodynamics. Once the electron has reached a stationary state, it responds linearly and resonantly to a set of modes of the driving radiation field. Such a response can lead the system to a new stationary state. Identifying a one-to-one relationship between the response variables and the corresponding operators, results in the (x,p) commutator as the Poisson bracket of these variables with respect to the driving field amplitudes. To account for the order of the response variables, which is reflected in the non-commutativity of the operators, we introduce the concept of ordered covariance. The results obtained allow to establish a natural contact with linear response theory at the fundamental quantum level.

Title: SpinHex: A low-crosstalk, spin-qubit architecture based on multi-electron couplers
Authors: Rubén M. Otxoa, Josu Etxezarreta Martinez, Paul Schnabl, Normann Mertig, Charles Smith, Frederico Martins
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits are an attractive quantum computing platform that offers long qubit coherence times and compatibility with existing semiconductor fabrication technology for scale up. Here, we propose a spin-qubit architecture based on spinless multielectron quantum dots that act as low-crosstalk couplers between a two-dimensional arrangement of spin-qubits in a hexagonal lattice. The multielectron couplers are controlled by voltage signals, which mediate fast Heisenberg exchange and thus enable coherent multi-qubit operations. For the proposed architecture, we discuss the implementation of the rotated XZZX surface code and numerically study its performance for a circuit-level noise model. We predict a threshold of $0.18\%$ for the error rate of the entangling gates. We further evaluate the scalability of the proposed architecture and predict the need for $4480$ physical qubits per logical qubit with logical error rates of $10^{-12}$ considering entangling gate fidelities of $99.99\%$, resulting in a chip size of $2.6$cm$^2$ to host $10,000$ logical qubits.

Title: A Survey of Quantum Transformers: Approaches, Advantages, Challenges, and Future Directions
Authors: Hui Zhang, Qinglin Zhao
Abstract: Quantum Transformer models represent a significant research direction in quantum machine learning (QML), leveraging the parallelism and entanglement properties of quantum computing to overcome the computational complexity and expressive limitations of classical Transformers. Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC)-based Transformer models are the primary focus of current research, employing PQCs to achieve varying degrees of quantumization, including strategies such as QKV-only Quantum mapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Global Attention, and Quantum-Assisted Acceleration. These approaches are well-suited to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, demonstrating potential in small-scale tasks to reduce complexity or enhance performance. The strength of PQC-based methods lies in their compatibility with existing quantum hardware, positioning them as the main pathway toward the practical implementation of quantum Transformers. However, these methods face challenges such as limited scalability, the absence of standardized testing benchmarks, and the "barren plateau" problem during training. As a complementary approach, Quantum Linear Algebra (QLA)-based Transformer models rely on future fault-tolerant quantum computing, utilizing techniques like block-encoding and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) to achieve efficient matrix operations and theoretically significant complexity reductions, though they remain in the theoretical exploration stage. Future research should prioritize optimizing PQC-based hybrid architectures and quantum global attention models, establishing unified evaluation frameworks, and addressing training difficulties, while also exploring hybrid PQC-QLA approaches to advance the development of quantum Transformers.

Title: Quantum Optimization-Based Route Compression for Efficient Navigation Systems
Authors: Shunsuke Sotobayashi, Yuichiro Minato, Takao Tomono
Abstract: We present a novel quantum optimization-based route compression technique that significantly reduces storage requirements compared to conventional methods. Route optimization systems face critical challenges in efficiently storing selected routes, particularly under memory constraints. Our proposed method enhances route information compression rates by leveraging Higher Order Binary Optimization (HOBO), an extended formulation of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) commonly employed in quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) for combinatorial optimization problems. We implemented HOBO on real world map data and conducted comparative analysis between the traditional Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm and our proposed method. Results demonstrate that our approach successfully identifies yielding improved compression efficiency that scales with data size from candidate routes. Experimental validation confirms the technique viability for practical applications in navigation systems where memory constraints are critical. The HOBO formulation allows for representation of complex route that would be difficult to capture using classical compression algorithms. Our implementation demonstrates up to 30% improvement in compression rates while maintaining route fidelity within acceptable navigation parameters. This approach opens new possibilities for implementing quantum inspired optimization in transportation systems, potentially providing more efficient navigation services. This work represents a significant advancement in applying quantum optimization principles to practical transportation challenges.

Title: Improved Strategies for Fermionic Quantum Simulation with Global Interactions
Authors: Thierry N. Kaldenbach, Gabriel Breuil
Abstract: We present efficient quantum circuits for fermionic excitation operators tailored for ion trap quantum computers exhibiting the Mølmer-Sørensen (MS) gate. Such operators commonly arise in the study of static and dynamic properties in electronic structure problems using Unitary Coupled Cluster theory or Trotterized time evolution. We detail how the global MS interaction naturally suits the non-local structure of fermionic excitation operators under the Jordan-Wigner mapping and simultaneously provides optimal parallelism in their circuit decompositions. Compared to previous schemes on ion traps, our approach reduces the number of MS gates by factors of 2-, and 4, for single-, and double excitations, respectively. This improvement promises significant speedups and error reductions.

Title: Dynamically near-stable two-mode squeezing in optomechanical system
Authors: Shi-fan Qi
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme within a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, wherein a mechanical resonator is coupled to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the open-quantum-system framework. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unstable system dynamics. Moreover, the squeezing level can surpass the maximum achievable under stable system conditions. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.

Title: Hong-Ou-Mandel effect with two frequency-entangled photons of vastly different color
Authors: Felix Mann, Helen M. Chrzanowski, Felipe Gewers, Marlon Placke, Sven Ramelow
Abstract: In the original Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment -- when two identical photons are incident upon the input ports of a balanced beam-splitter -- they coalesce, always leaving via the same output port. It is often interpreted that this interference arises due to the indistinguishability of the single photons; the situation, however, is often more nuanced. Here, we demonstrate an analog of HOM interference between two photons of completely different color. To do so, we utilize a quantum frequency converter based on sum- and difference-frequency generation as an `active' beam-splitter -- coupling frequency-entangled red and telecom single photons with an octave-spanning energy difference of 282 THz. This work presents the first demonstration of HOM interference between two single photons of distinctly different color, deepening our understanding of what underlies quantum interference. It also suggests a novel approach to interfacing photonic qubits in heterogeneous quantum systems where frequency conversion and quantum interference are unified.

Title: Detecting underdetermination in parameterized quantum circuits
Authors: Marie Kempkes, Jakob Spiegelberg, Evert van Nieuwenburg, Vedran Dunjko
Abstract: A central question in machine learning is how reliable the predictions of a trained model are. Reliability includes the identification of instances for which a model is likely not to be trusted based on an analysis of the learning system itself. Such unreliability for an input may arise from the model family providing a variety of hypotheses consistent with the training data, which can vastly disagree in their predictions on that particular input point. This is called the underdetermination problem, and it is important to develop methods to detect it. With the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML) as a prospective alternative to classical methods for certain learning problems, the question arises to what extent they are subject to underdetermination and whether similar techniques as those developed for classical models can be employed for its detection. In this work, we first provide an overview of concepts from Safe AI and reliability, which in particular received little attention in QML. We then explore the use of a method based on local second-order information for the detection of underdetermination in parameterized quantum circuits through numerical experiments. We further demonstrate that the approach is robust to certain levels of shot noise. Our work contributes to the body of literature on Safe Quantum AI, which is an emerging field of growing importance.

Title: Chiral environment effects on the dynamics of a central chiral molecule
Authors: Daniel Martínez-Gil, Pedro Bargueño, Salvador Miret-Artés
Abstract: In this work, we develop a system {\it plus} environment approach for interacting chiral molecules under a quantum-classical description of the spin-spin model using a Caldeira-Leggett-like coupling. After presenting the interacting model, we show that a long-ranged parity-nonconserving interaction, encoded within a non-linear Schrödinger equation, produces an energy difference between the two enantiomers of the central chiral molecule when it interacts with a chiral environment. Three examples of such interactions are considered, with particular focus on $Z^0$-photon vacuum polarization. Finally, we reveal a {\it chirality transmission effect} phenomenon, where the time-averaged population difference of the central molecule is amplified when the chiral asymmetry of the environment is considered.

Title: Non-stabilizerness and violations of CHSH inequalities
Authors: Stefano Cusumano, Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Simone Cepollaro, Gianluca Esposito, Daniele Iannotti, Barbara Jasser, Jovan Odavi\' c, Michele Viscardi, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: We study quantitatively the interplay between entanglement and non-stabilizer resources in violating the CHSH inequalities. We show that, while non-stabilizer resources are necessary, they must have a specific structure, namely they need to be both asymmetric and (surprisingly) local. We employ stabilizer entropy (SE) to quantify the non-stabilizer resources involved and the probability of violation given the resources. We show how spectral quantities related to the flatness of entanglement spectrum and its relationship with non-local SE affect the CHSH inequality. Finally, we utilize these results - together with tools from representation theory - to construct a systematic way of building ensembles of states with higher probability of violation.

Title: Structured search algorithm: A quantum leap
Authors: Yash Prabhat, Snigdha Thakur, Ankur Raina
Abstract: Grover's quantum search algorithm showcases the prowess of quantum algorithms, phenomenally reducing the complexity of the search operation of unsorted data. This letter advances Grover's algorithm using a structured search method to attain an unbounded search speed. Remarkably, only two Oracle calls are required to search any element in a dataset of size $2^n$, $n$ being an integer. The algorithm leverages a fixed point approach, iteratively identifying the solution state for multiple qubits at a time, progressively narrowing the search space. The experimental outcomes affirm the algorithm's performance by searching a bit string in 5TB of unsorted binary data on QPU IBM Kyiv. The letter also hypothesizes a scalable classical simulation of the said algorithm.

Title: Exactly solvable models for universal operator growth
Authors: Oleksandr Gamayun, Murtaza Ali Mir, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Zoran Ristivojevic
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.

Title: Dividing and Conquering the Van Vleck Catastrophe
Authors: Sophia Simon, Gian-Luca R. Anselmetti, Raffaele Santagati, Matthias Degroote, Nikolaj Moll, Michael Streif, Nathan Wiebe
Abstract: The quantum-computational cost of determining ground state energies through quantum phase estimation depends on the overlap between an easily preparable initial state and the targeted ground state. The Van Vleck orthogonality catastrophe has frequently been invoked to suggest that quantum computers may not be able to efficiently prepare ground states of large systems because the overlap with the initial state tends to decrease exponentially with the system size, even for non-interacting systems. We show that this intuition is not necessarily true. Specifically, we introduce a divide-and-conquer strategy that repeatedly uses phase estimation to merge ground states of increasingly larger subsystems. We provide rigorous bounds for this approach and show that if the minimum success probability of each merge is lower bounded by a constant, then the query complexity of preparing the ground state of $N$ interacting systems is in $O(N^{\log\log(N)} {\rm poly}(N))$, which is quasi-polynomial in $N$, in contrast to the exponential scaling anticipated by the Van Vleck catastrophe. We also discuss sufficient conditions on the Hamiltonian that ensure a quasi-polynomial running time.

Title: Quantum conditional mutual information as a probe of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions
Authors: Yuichi Otsuka, Kazuhiro Seki, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.

Title: An all-fibred, telecom technology compatible, room temperature, single-photon source
Authors: Nathan Lecaron, Max Meunier, Grégory Sauder, Romain Dalidet, Yoann Pelet, Sébastien Tanzilli, Jesus Zuniga-Pérez, Olivier Alibart
Abstract: Single photon sources are essential building blocks for fundamental quantum optics but also for quantum information networks. Their widespread is currently hindered by unpractical features, such as operation at cryogenic temperature and emission wavelength lying outside telecom windows. Taking advantage of telecom technology and point defects in GaN crystals, we present, for the first time, the development of a fully-fibred source of single photons operating at room temperature, emitting photons in the telecom O-band and fulfilling the standards of telecom photonics. We characterise an emitter producting single photons at the wavelength of 1292\,nm, a spectral broadening compatible with CWDM channels of 13\,nm, and a brightness of 25 kcps per mW of pump power. The source shows a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.5 and an autocorrelation degree (purity) of 0,059 at room temperature, showing high potential for being integrated transportable quantum cryptography devices.

Title: Native-oxide-passivated trilayer junctions for superconducting qubits

Loreto, Joel Hätinen, Klaara Viisanen, Jukka I. Väyrynen, Alberto Ronzani, Antti Kemppinen, Visa Vesterinen, Mika Prunnila, Joonas Govenius
Abstract: Superconducting qubits in today's quantum processing units are typically fabricated with angle-evaporated aluminum--aluminum-oxide--aluminum Josephson junctions. However, there is an urgent need to overcome the limited reproducibility of this approach when scaling up the number of qubits and junctions. Fabrication methods based on subtractive patterning of superconductor--insulator--superconductor trilayers, used for more classical large-scale Josephson junction circuits, could provide the solution but they in turn often suffer from lossy dielectrics incompatible with high qubit coherence. In this work, we utilize native aluminum oxide as a sidewall passivation layer for junctions based on aluminum--aluminum-oxide--niobium trilayers, and use such junctions in qubits. We design the fabrication process such that the few-nanometer-thin native oxide is not exposed to oxide removal steps that could increase its defect density or hinder its ability to prevent shorting between the leads of the junction. With these junctions, we design and fabricate transmon-like qubits and measure time-averaged coherence times up to 30 $\mu$s at a qubit frequency of 5 GHz, corresponding to a qubit quality factor of one million. Our process uses subtractive patterning and optical lithography on wafer scale, enabling high throughput in patterning. This approach provides a scalable path toward fabrication of superconducting qubits on industry-standard platforms.

Title: Reducing quantum error correction overhead using soft information
Authors: Joonas Majaniemi, Elisha S. Matekole
Abstract: Imperfect measurements are a prevalent source of error across quantum computing platforms, significantly degrading the logical error rates achievable on current hardware. To mitigate this issue, rich measurement data referred to as soft information has been proposed to efficiently identify and correct measurement errors as they occur. In this work, we model soft information decoding across a variety of physical qubit platforms and decoders and showcase how soft information can make error correction viable at lower code distances and higher physical error rates than is otherwise possible. We simulate the effects of soft information decoding on quantum memories for surface codes and bivariate bicycle codes, and evaluate the error suppression performance of soft decoders against traditional decoders. For near-term devices with noise regimes close to the surface code threshold, our simulations show that soft information decoding can provide up to 10% higher error suppression on superconducting qubits and up to 20% stronger error suppression on neutral atom qubits.

Authors: Gian-Luca Schmid, Manel Bosch Aguilera, Chun Tat Ngai, Maryse Ernzer, Luiz Couto Correa Pinto Filho, Dennis Høj, Ulrik Lund Andersen, Florian Goschin, Philipp Treutlein
Abstract: We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.

Title: Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices
Authors: Simon M. Linsel, Lode Pollet, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and \mbox{(de-)confinement}. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.

Title: Wave-particle duality of gravitational radiation
Authors: Hudson A. Loughlin, Germain Tobar, Evan D. Hall, Vivishek Sudhir
Abstract: We study the continuous quantum measurement of gravitational radiation. This is typically done by coupling the radiation to a meter, such as a resonant mass detector or an interferometer, which is subsequently read out by a detector. We find that the detector employed determines whether the gravitational field exhibits wave or particle characteristics. A linear detector, such as a homodyne detector, yields no signal for a field in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude of a field in a coherent state. Such a linear detector thus supports a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton, resulting in a quantum jump in energy equal to the energy of the absorbed graviton. Our results extend the principle of complementarity to quantized gravitational radiation, demonstrating the detector dependence of the graviton, and indicates that conceptually simple modifications to gravitational-wave detectors can make them graviton counters.

Title: PHOENIX: Pauli-Based High-Level Optimization Engine for Instruction Execution on NISQ Devices
Authors: Zhaohui Yang, Dawei Ding, Chenghong Zhu, Jianxin Chen, Yuan Xie
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. PHOENIX employs the binary symplectic form (BSF) to formally describe Pauli strings and reformulates IR synthesis as reducing the column weights of BSF by appropriate Clifford transformations. It comes with a heuristic BSF simplification algorithm that searches for the most appropriate 2Q Clifford operators in sequence to maximally simplify the BSF at each step, until the BSF can be directly synthesized by basic 1Q and 2Q gates. PHOENIX further performs a global ordering strategy in a Tetris-like fashion for these simplified IR groups, carefully balancing optimization opportunities for gate cancellation, minimizing circuit depth, and managing qubit routing overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.

Title: Minimally Universal Parity Quantum Computing
Authors: Isaac D. Smith, Berend Klaver, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Wolfgang Lechner, Hans J. Briegel
Abstract: In parity quantum computing, multi-qubit logical gates are implemented by single-qubit rotations on a suitably encoded state involving auxiliary qubits. Consequently, there is a correspondence between qubit count and the size of the native gate set. One might then wonder: what is the smallest number of auxiliary qubits that still allows for universal parity computing? Here, we demonstrate that the answer is one, if the number of logical qubits is even, and two otherwise. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for a given parity gate set to be universal. This leads to a variety of different universal parity gate sets corresponding to different numbers of auxiliary qubits, and more generally contributes to the understanding of which entangling gates are required to augment the set of single-qubit unitaries to perform universal quantum computing. As a consequence, we obtain (i) minimal implementations of the parity framework on e.g., a triangular lattice, (ii) hardware specific implementations of the parity flow framework on e.g., a heavy-hex lattice, and (iii) novel universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC).

Title: Variational Quantum Self-Organizing Map
Authors: Amol Deshmukh
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum neural network architecture for unsupervised learning of classical and quantum data based on the kernelized version of Kohonen's self-organizing map. The central idea behind our algorithm is to replace the Euclidean distance metric with the fidelity between quantum states to identify the best matching unit from the low-dimensional grid of output neurons in the self-organizing map. The fidelities between the unknown quantum state and the quantum states containing the variational parameters are estimated by computing the transition probability on a quantum computer. The estimated fidelities are in turn used to adjust the variational parameters of the output neurons. Unlike $\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$ circuit evaluations needed in quantum kernel estimation, our algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(N)$ circuit evaluations for $N$ data samples. Analogous to the classical version of the self-organizing map, our algorithm learns a mapping from a high-dimensional Hilbert space to a low-dimensional grid of lattice points while preserving the underlying topology of the Hilbert space. We showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm by constructing a two-dimensional visualization that accurately differentiates between the three distinct species of flowers in Fisher's Iris dataset. In addition, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on quantum data by creating a two-dimensional map that preserves the topology of the state space in the Schwinger model and distinguishes between the two separate phases of the model at $\theta = \pi$.

Title: Quantum Search with In-Place Queries
Authors: Blake Holman, Ronak Ramachandran, Justin Yirka
Abstract: Quantum query complexity is typically characterized in terms of XOR queries |x,y> to |x,y+f(x)> or phase queries, which ensure that even queries to non-invertible functions are unitary. When querying a permutation, another natural model is unitary: in-place queries |x> to |f(x)>. Some problems are known to require exponentially fewer in-place queries than XOR queries, but no separation has been shown in the opposite direction. A candidate for such a separation was the problem of inverting a permutation over N elements. This task, equivalent to unstructured search in the context of permutations, is solvable with $O(\sqrt{N})$ XOR queries but was conjectured to require $\Omega(N)$ in-place queries. We refute this conjecture by designing a quantum algorithm for Permutation Inversion using $O(\sqrt{N})$ in-place queries. Our algorithm achieves the same speedup as Grover's algorithm despite the inability to efficiently uncompute queries or perform straightforward oracle-controlled reflections. Nonetheless, we show that there are indeed problems which require fewer XOR queries than in-place queries. We introduce a subspace-conversion problem called Function Erasure that requires 1 XOR query and $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ in-place queries. Then, we build on a recent extension of the quantum adversary method to characterize exact conditions for a decision problem to exhibit such a separation, and we propose a candidate problem.

Title: Quantum Speedups for Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods with Application to Optimization
Authors: Guneykan Ozgul, Xiantao Li, Mehrdad Mahdavi, Chunhao Wang
Abstract: We propose quantum algorithms that provide provable speedups for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods commonly used for sampling from probability distributions of the form $\pi \propto e^{-f}$, where $f$ is a potential function. Our first approach considers Gibbs sampling for finite-sum potentials in the stochastic setting, employing an oracle that provides gradients of individual functions. In the second setting, we consider access only to a stochastic evaluation oracle, allowing simultaneous queries at two points of the potential function under the same stochastic parameter. By introducing novel techniques for stochastic gradient estimation, our algorithms improve the gradient and evaluation complexities of classical samplers, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) in terms of dimension, precision, and other problem-dependent parameters. Furthermore, we achieve quantum speedups in optimization, particularly for minimizing non-smooth and approximately convex functions that commonly appear in empirical risk minimization problems.

Title: Maximal Entropy Formalism and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine
Authors: Vinit Singh, Rishabh Gupta, Manas Sajjan, Francoise Remacle, Raphael D. Levine, Sabre Kais
Abstract: The connection between the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) formalism and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) is natural, as both give rise to a Boltzmann-like distribution with constraints enforced by Lagrange multipliers, which corresponds to RBM parameters. We integrate RBMs into quantum state tomography (QST) by using them as probabilistic models to approximate quantum states while satisfying MaxEnt constraints. Additionally, we employ polynomially efficient quantum sampling techniques to enhance RBM training, enabling scalable and high-fidelity quantum state reconstruction. This approach provides a computationally efficient framework for applying RBMs to MaxEnt-based quantum tomography. Furthermore, our method applies to the general and previously unaddressed case of reconstructing arbitrary mixed quantum states from incomplete and potentially non-commuting sets of expectations of observables while still ensuring maximal entropy.

Title: Noise constraints on sensitivity scaling in super-Heisenberg quantum metrology
Authors: Noah Lordi, John Drew Wilson, Murray J. Holland, Joshua Combes
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced metrology surpasses classical metrology by improving estimation precision scaling with a resource $N$ (e.g., particle number or energy) from $1/\sqrt{N}$ to $1/N$. Through the use of nonlinear effects, Roy and Braunstein~\cite{Roy2008} derived a $1/2^N$ scaling. However, later works argued this exponential improvement is unphysical and that even modest gains, like $1/N^2$, may vanish under noise. We show that, in the presence of small errors, the nonlinear interactions enabling metrological enhancement induce emergent errors. The errors propagate through the sensing protocol and are magnified proportional to any intended non-linear enhancement. We identify a critical value of the parameter to be estimated, for a fixed error, below which the emergent errors can be avoided.

Title: Bootstrapping the Electronic Structure of Quantum Materials
Authors: Anna O. Schouten, Simon Ewing, David A. Mazziotti
Abstract: The last several decades have seen significant advances in the theoretical modeling of materials within the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, but many methods commonly applied to this problem struggle to capture strong electron correlation accurately. Recent widespread interest in quantum materials -- where strong correlation plays a crucial role in the quantum effects governing their behavior -- further highlights the need for theoretical methods capable of rigorously treating such correlation. Here, we present a periodic generalization of variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory, a bootstrapping-type method that minimizes the ground-state energy as a functional of the 2-RDM without relying on the wavefunction. The 2-RDM is computed directly by semidefinite programming with $N$-representability conditions, ensuring accurate treatment of strongly correlated electronic systems. By exploiting translational symmetry, we significantly reduce computational scaling, enabling applications to realistic materials-scale systems. Additionally, we introduce an alternative to conventional energy band structures: natural-orbital occupation-number bands, which, being independent of mean-field assumptions, offer deeper insights into electron correlation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying the theory to hydrogen chains, molybdenum disulfide, and nickel oxide, showing that natural-orbital occupation bands correctly capture electronic character in regimes where density functional theory fails. This work represents a major step toward accurately describing the electronic structure of quantum materials using reduced density matrices rather than wavefunctions.

Title: Quantum shockwave at the quasi-relativistic resonance
Authors: Marinko Jablan
Abstract: We analyze the electromagnetic field travelling on resonance with the limiting velocity of the quasi-relativistic particle. We show that a strong longitudinal field leads to the quantum wave function singularity in the form of a shockwave, accompanied by strong energy dissipation. We show that the effect is particularly strong in the case of Dirac electrons in graphene due to the small effective mass. We discuss several experimental tests of these predictions.

Title: Effective Mode Description for Macroscopic Fabry Pérot Cavities
Authors: Michael A.D. Taylor, Pengfei Huo
Abstract: We introduce an effective modes formalism to describe how the quasi-continuum of photonic modes in an optical cavity effectively behaves in the strong light-matter coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. By expressing these effective modes, we are able to solve current mysteries in the field, leveraging the formalism and intuition gained in this framework. Furthermore, we show that the mode volumes of these effective modes are independent of the physical area of the Fabry-Pérot cavity mirrors. These results also allow us to explain the recently discovered experimental phenomenon in vibrational polaritons, where chemical reactivities can only be modified if the molecules are coupled in resonance to the normal-incidence mode in a Fabry-Pérot cavity.

Title: Noise-Affected Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Biderang, Jesko Sirker
Abstract: We investigate the effects of uncorrelated noise on dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a quantum ramp across critical points in two different scenarios. First, we show that for a slow ramp in the XY model caused by a stochastically driven field an intriguing and counterintuitive phenomenon arises where the Loschmidt amplitude vanishes in an entire critical region in time. At the boundaries of such a region, DQPTs in the return rate with diverging slopes appear in contrast to the regular DQPTs with finite slopes for a ramp without noise. We also show that the critical ramp velocity beyond which DQPTs disappear entirely, as well as the critical ramp velocity separating the regime with critical regions in time from the regime with standard DQPTs, are both described by universal scaling functions. Second, we study the impact of the environment on DQPTs based on the Kubo-Anderson spectral diffusion process, where the environmental effects on the system are simulated as stochastic fluctuations in the energy levels of the post-ramp Hamiltonian. In this framework, the noise master equation can be solved analytically both for uncorrelated and correlated noise. The obtained analytical expression for the return rate reveals that DQPTs in this case are always completely eliminated.

Title: Thermodynamic Properties and Magnetocaloric Effect in a Rotating 2DEG under the Sagnac Effect
Authors: Cleverson Filgueiras, Moises Rojas, Vinicius T. Pieve, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of the Sagnac effect on the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a rotating sample under the influence of a uniform magnetic field. We analyze how rotation and the distinction between effective mass ($m^*$) and gravitational mass ($m_G$) affect the energy levels and resulting thermodynamic properties. The results show that rotation modifies the energy levels, the application of a magnetic field leads to the formation of Landau levels further altered by rotation and gravitational mass, and thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, specific heat, free energy, entropy, magnetization, and magnetocaloric effect) exhibit a strong dependence on these parameters. In particular, the difference between $m^*$ and $m_G$ influences magnetization and the magnetocaloric effect, with negative rotations potentially inducing a cooling effect when these masses are distinct. We conclude that rotational effects and effective mass properties are crucial for understanding the thermodynamics of electronic systems under magnetic fields, with implications for thermal modulation in semiconductor materials.

Title: Non-Hermitian optical scattering in cold atoms via four-wave mixing
Authors: Xiao Liu, M. Artoni, G. C. La Rocca, Jin-Hui Wu
Abstract: Nonlinear effects could play a crucial role in addressing optical nonreciprocal behaviors in scattering media. Such behaviors are, however, typically observed within a single transmission channel and predominantly in media with fixed optical structures, which inherently restrict the tunability of a nonreciprocal response. We suggest to combine the (intrinsic) nonlinearities of a coherent multi-level medium with a tailored driving geometry that relies on two phase-mismatched standing-wave (SW) beams. This combination is essential for creating extra scattering channels over which, in addition, fully tunable optical nonreciprocal reflection can be attained. Our general approach is here adapted to four-level double-$\Lambda$ atoms that are found to exhibit distinct forms of nonreciprocal multi-channel scattering and quite sensitive to easily tunable parameters of two SW driving beams. The numerical results we present offer valuable insights into the field of non-Hermitian optical scattering and arise indeed from the interplay of interference among scattering processes and Bragg reflection.

Title: Optical detection of charge defects near a graphene transistor using the Stark shift of fluorescent molecules
Authors: Carlotta Ciancico, Iacopo Torre, Bernat Terrés, Alvaro Moreno, Robert Smit, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Michel Orrit, Frank Koppens, Antoine Reserbat-Plantey
Abstract: Two-dimensional crystals and their heterostructures unlock access to a class of photonic devices, bringing nanophotonics from the nanometer scale down to the atomic level where quantum effects are relevant. Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are central in quantum photonics as quantum markers linked to their electrostatic, thermal, magnetic, or dielectric environment. This aspect is exciting in two-dimensional (2D) crystals and their heterostructures, where the environment can be abruptly modified through vertical stacking or lateral structuring, such as moiré or nano-patterned gates. To further develop 2D-based quantum photonic devices, there is a need for quantum markers that are capable of integration into various device geometries, and that can be read out individually, non-destructively, and without additional electrodes. Here, we show how to optically detect charge carrier accumulation using sub-GHz linewidth single-photon emitters coupled to a graphene device. We employ the single molecule Stark effect, sensitive to the electric fields generated by charge puddles, such as those at the graphene edge. The same approach enables dynamic sensing of electronic noise, and we demonstrate the optical read-out of low-frequency white noise in a biased graphene device. The approach described here can be further exploited to explore charge dynamics in 2D heterostructures using quantum emitter markers.

Title: A silicon spin vacuum: isotopically enriched $^{28}$silicon-on-insulator and $^{28}$silicon from ultra-high fluence ion implantation
Authors: Shao Qi Lim, Brett C. Johnson, Sergey Rubanov, Nico Klingner, Bin Gong, Alexander M. Jakob, Danielle Holmes, David N. Jamieson, Jim S. Williams, Jeffrey C. McCallum
Abstract: Isotopically enriched silicon (Si) can greatly enhance qubit coherence times by minimizing naturally occurring $^{29}$Si which has a non-zero nuclear spin. Ultra-high fluence $^{28}$Si ion implantation of bulk natural Si substrates was recently demonstrated as an attractive technique to ultra-high $^{28}$Si isotopic purity. In this work, we apply this $^{28}$Si enrichment process to produce $^{28}$Si and $^{28}$Si-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Experimentally, we produced a $^{28}$Si sample on natural Si substrate with $^{29}$Si depleted to 7~ppm (limited by measurement noise floor), that is at least 100 nm thick. This is achieved with an ion energy that results in a sputter yield of less than one and a high ion fluence, as supported by simulations. Further, our simulations predict the $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si depletion in our sample to be less than 1~ppm. In the case of SOI, ion implantation conditions are found to be more stringent than those of bulk natural Si in terms of minimizing threading dislocations upon subsequent solid phase epitaxy annealing. Finally, we report the observation of nanoscopic voids in our $^{28}$SOI and $^{28}$Si samples located in the depth region between the surface and 70~nm. These voids appear to be stabilized by the presence of gold impurities and can be annealed out completely by a standard SPE annealing protocol at 620°C for 10 minutes in the absence of gold.

Title: Competition of light- and phonon-dressing in microwave-dressed Bose polarons
Authors: G. M. Koutentakis, S. I. Mistakidis, F. Grusdt, H. R. Sadeghpour, P. Schmelcher
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the stationary properties of a spin-1/2 impurity immersed in a one-dimensional confined Bose gas. In particular, we consider coherently coupled spin states with an external field, where only one spin component interacts with the bath, enabling light dressing of the impurity and spin-dependent bath-impurity interactions. Through detailed comparisons with ab-initio many-body simulations, we demonstrate that the composite system is accurately described by a simplified effective Hamiltonian. The latter builds upon previously developed effective potential approaches in the absence of light dressing. It can be used to extract the impurity energy, residue, effective mass, and anharmonicity induced by the phononic dressing. Light-dressing is shown to increase the polaron residue, undressing the impurity from phononic excitations because of strong spin coupling. For strong repulsions-previously shown to trigger dynamical Bose polaron decay (a phenomenon called temporal orthogonality catastrophe), it is explained that strong light-dressing stabilizes a repulsive polaron-dressed state. Our results establish the effective Hamiltonian framework as a powerful tool for exploring strongly interacting polaronic systems and corroborating forthcoming experimental realizations.

Title: Optimizing Quantum Circuits via ZX Diagrams using Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Alexander Mattick, Maniraman Periyasamy, Christian Ufrecht, Abhishek Y. Dubey, Christopher Mutschler, Axel Plinge, Daniel D. Scherer
Abstract: Quantum computing is currently strongly limited by the impact of noise, in particular introduced by the application of two-qubit gates. For this reason, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is of paramount importance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. To advance towards more reliable quantum computing, we introduce a framework based on ZX calculus, graph-neural networks and reinforcement learning for quantum circuit optimization. By combining reinforcement learning and tree search, our method addresses the challenge of selecting optimal sequences of ZX calculus rewrite rules. Instead of relying on existing heuristic rules for minimizing circuits, our method trains a novel reinforcement learning policy that directly operates on ZX-graphs, therefore allowing us to search through the space of all possible circuit transformations to find a circuit significantly minimizing the number of CNOT gates. This way we can scale beyond hard-coded rules towards discovering arbitrary optimization rules. We demonstrate our method's competetiveness with state-of-the-art circuit optimizers and generalization capabilities on large sets of diverse random circuits.

Title: Entanglement and local holography in quantum gravity
Authors: Gabriel Wong
Abstract: The It from Qubit paradigm proposes that gravitational spacetimes emerge from quantum entanglement. So far, the main evidence for this involves holographic dualities, where the entangled qubits live in a dual nongravitational theory. In this essay, we argue that string theory provides the mechanism to define these entangled qubits in the bulk gravitating theory. This involves a local form of geometric transition, which is the stringy mechanism that underlies \emph{local} holography. We illustrate how this works in the A model topological string,

Title: Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians
Authors: Heiko Georg Menzler, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.

Title: Supersolid phase in two-dimensional soft-core bosons at finite temperature
Authors: Sebastiano Peotta, Gabriele Spada, Stefano Giorgini, Sebastiano Pilati, Alessio Recati
Abstract: The supersolid phase of soft-core bosons in two dimensions is investigated using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock and quantum Monte Carlo methods. An approximate phase diagram at finite temperatures is initially constructed using the mean-field approach, which is subsequently validated through precise path-integral simulations, enabling a microscopic characterization of the various phases. Superfluid and melting/freezing transitions are analyzed through the superfluid density and the long-range behavior of correlation functions associated with positional and orientational order, in accordance with the general picture of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. A broad region at low temperatures is identified where the supersolid phase exists, separating the uniform superfluid phase from the normal quasi-crystal phase. Additionally, a potential intermediate hexatic phase with quasi long-range orientational order is identified in a narrow region between the normal solid and fluid phases. These findings establish self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory beyond the local density approximation as an effective tool, complementary to computationally intensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, for investigating the melting of the supersolid phase and the possible emergence of the hexatic superfluid phase in bosonic systems with various interaction potentials.

Abstract: Metastability is a phenomenon encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale from a metastable to a stable state is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.

The time-dependent Dirac equations with Coulomb plus time-periodic monochromatic field potentials are solved for both cases. Such characteristics of the optical high harmonic generation, as average dipole moment and high harmonic generation spectra, are computed. A sketch for table-top experimental realization of the considered models is proposed.

Title: Instantaneous measurement can isolate the information
Authors: Iman Sargolzahi
Abstract: Consider a one-dimensional spin chain, from spin 1 to spin N, such that each spin interacts with its nearest neighbors. Performing a local operation (measurement) on spin N, we expect from the Lieb-Robinson velocity that, in general, the effect of this measurement achieves spin 1 after some while. But, in this paper, we show that if a) the measurement on spin N is performed instantaneously and b) the initial state of the spin chain is chosen appropriately, then the effect of the measurement on spin N never achieves spin 1. In other words, performing or not performing an instantaneous measurement on spin N at t=0 does not alter the reduced dynamics of spin 1 for all the times t>0. We can interpret this as the following: The information of performing an instantaneous measurement on spin N is isolated such that it cannot achieve spin 1.

Title: Accurate and Honest Approximation of Correlated Qubit Noise
Authors: F. Setiawan, Alexander V. Gramolin, Elisha S. Matekole, Hari Krovi, Jacob M. Taylor
Abstract: Accurate modeling of noise in realistic quantum processors is critical for constructing fault-tolerant quantum computers. While a full simulation of actual noisy quantum circuits provides information about correlated noise among all qubits and is therefore accurate, it is, however, computationally expensive as it requires resources that grow exponentially with the number of qubits. We propose an efficient systematic construction of approximate noise channels, where their accuracy can be enhanced by incorporating noise components with higher qubit-qubit correlation degree. To formulate such approximate channels, we first present a method, dubbed the cluster expansion approach, to decompose the Lindbladian generator of an actual noise channel into components based on interqubit correlation degree. We generate a $k$-th order approximate noise channel by truncating the cluster expansion and incorporating noise components with correlations up to the $k$-th degree. We require that the approximate noise channels must be accurate and also ``honest", i.e., the actual errors are not underestimated in our physical models. As an example application, we apply our method to model noise in a three-qubit quantum processor that stabilizes a [[2,0,2]] codeword, which is one of the four Bell states. We find that, for realistic noise strength typical for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits coupled via always-on static interactions, correlated noise beyond two-qubit correlation can significantly affect the code simulation accuracy. Since our approach provides a systematic characterization of multi-qubit noise correlations, it enables the potential for accurate, honest and scalable approximations to simulate large numbers of qubits from full modeling or experimental characterizations of small enough quantum subsystems, which are efficient yet still retain essential noise features of the entire device.

Title: Dynamical excitation control and multimode emission of an atom-photon bound state
Authors: Claudia Castillo-Moreno, Kazi Rafsanjani Amin, Ingrid Strandberg, Mikael Kervinen, Amr Osman, Simone Gasparinetti
Abstract: Atom-photon bound states arise from the coupling of quantum emitters to the band edge of dispersion-engineered waveguides. Thanks to their tunable-range interactions, they are promising building blocks for quantum simulators. Here, we study the dynamics of an atom-photon bound state emerging from coupling a frequency-tunable quantum emitter - a transmon-type superconducting circuit - to the band edge of a microwave metamaterial. Employing precise temporal control over the frequency detuning of the emitter from the band edge, we examine the transition from adiabatic to non-adiabatic behavior in the formation of the bound state and its melting into the propagating modes of the metamaterial. Moreover, we experimentally observe multi-mode emission from the bound state, triggered by a fast change of the emitter's frequency. Our study offers insight into the dynamic preparation of atom-photon bound states and provides a method to characterize their photonic content, with implications in quantum optics and quantum simulation.

Title: Steady-State Entanglement Generation via Casimir-Polder Interactions
Authors: Mohsen Izadyari, Onur Pusuluk, Kanu Sinha, Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu
Abstract: We investigate the generation of steady-state entanglement between two atoms resulting from the fluctuation-mediated Casimir-Polder (CP) interactions near a surface. Starting with an initially separable state of the atoms, we analyze the atom-atom entanglement dynamics for atoms placed at distances in the range of $\sim25$ nm away from a planar medium, examining the effect of medium properties and geometrical configuration of the atomic dipoles. We show that perfectly conducting and superconducting surfaces yield an optimal steady-state concurrence value of approximately 0.5. Furthermore, although the generated entanglement decreases with medium losses for a metal surface, we identify an optimal distance from the metal surface that assists in entanglement generation by the surface. While fluctuation-mediated interactions are typically considered detrimental to the coherence of quantum systems at nanoscales, our results demonstrate a mechanism for leveraging such interactions for entanglement generation.

Abstract: The $N$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is an important resource for quantum technologies. We consider the task of GHZ encoding using all-to-all interactions, which prepares the GHZ state in a special case, and is furthermore useful for quantum error correction, interaction-rate enhancement, and transmitting information using power-law interactions. The naive protocol based on parallelizing CNOT gates takes $\mathrm{O}(1)$-time of Hamiltonian evolution. In this work, we propose a fast protocol that achieves GHZ encoding with high accuracy. The evolution time $\mathrm{O}(\log^2N/N)$ almost saturates the theoretical limit $\Omega(\log N/N)$. Moreover, the final state is close to the ideal encoded one with high fidelity $> 1-10^{-3}$, up to large system sizes $N\lesssim 2000$. The protocol only requires a few stages of time-independent Hamiltonian evolution; the key idea is to use the data qubit as control, and to use fast spin-squeezing dynamics generated by e.g. two-axis-twisting.

Title: Quantum resolution limit of long-baseline imaging using distributed entanglement
Authors: Isack Padilla, Aqil Sajjad, Babak N. Saif, Saikat Guha
Abstract: It has been shown that shared entanglement between two telescope sites can in principle be used to localize a point source by mimicking the standard phase-scanning interferometer, but without physically bringing the light from the distant telescopes together. In this paper, we show that a receiver that employs spatial-mode sorting at each telescope site, combined with pre-shared entanglement and local quantum operations can be used to mimic the most general multimode interferometer acting on light collected from the telescopes. As an example application to a quantitative passive-imaging problem, we show that the quantum-limited precision of estimating the angular separation between two stars can be attained by an instantiation of the aforesaid entanglement based receiver. We discuss how this entanglement assisted strategy can be used to achieve the quantum-limited precision of any complex quantitative imaging task involving any number of telescopes. We provide a blueprint of this general receiver that involves quantum transduction of starlight into quantum memory banks and spatial mode sorters deployed at each telescope site, and measurements that include optical detection as well as qubit gates and measurements on the quantum memories. We discuss the relative Fisher-information contributions of local mode sorting at telescope sites vis-a-vis distributed entanglement-assisted interferometry, to the overall quantum-limited information about the scene, based on the ratio of the baseline distance to the individual telescope diameter.

Isaacs, Samuel D. Johnson, Luke Mathieson, Kevin M. Obenland, Matthew Otten, Rashmi Sundareswara, Adam Holmes
Abstract: Corrosion is a pervasive issue that impacts the structural integrity and performance of materials across various industries, imposing a significant economic impact globally. In fields like aerospace and defense, developing corrosion-resistant materials is critical, but progress is often hindered by the complexities of material-environment interactions. While computational methods have advanced in designing corrosion inhibitors and corrosion-resistant materials, they fall short in understanding the fundamental corrosion mechanisms due to the highly correlated nature of the systems involved. This paper explores the potential of leveraging quantum computing to accelerate the design of corrosion inhibitors and corrosion-resistant materials, with a particular focus on magnesium and niobium alloys. We investigate the quantum computing resources required for high-fidelity electronic ground-state energy estimation (GSEE), which will be used in our hybrid classical-quantum workflow. Representative computational models for magnesium and niobium alloys show that 2292 to 38598 logical qubits and $(1.04$ to $1962) \times 10^{13}$ T-gates are required for simulating the ground-state energy of these systems under the first quantization encoding using plane waves basis.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonians and the quasiparticle picture
Authors: Federico Rottoli, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) provides the most comprehensive characterization of bipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Ground states of local Hamiltonians inherit this locality, resulting in EHs that are dominated by local, few-body terms. Unfortunately, in non-equilibrium situations, analytic results are rare and largely confined to continuous field theories, which fail to accurately describe microscopic models. To address this gap, we present an analytic result for the EH following a quantum quench in non-interacting fermionic models, valid in the ballistic scaling regime. The derivation adapts the celebrated quasiparticle picture to operators, providing detailed insights into its physical properties. The resulting analytic formula serves as a foundation for engineering EHs in quantum optics experiments.

Title: Qudit-native measurement protocol for dynamical correlations using Hadamard tests
Authors: Pavel P. Popov, Kevin T. Geier, Valentin Kasper, Maciej Lewenstein, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Dynamical correlations reveal important out-of-equilibrium properties of the underlying quantum many-body system, yet they are notoriously difficult to measure in experiments. While measurement protocols for dynamical correlations based on Hadamard tests for qubit quantum devices exist, they do not straightforwardly extend to qudits. Here, we propose a modified protocol to overcome this limitation by decomposing qudit observables into unitary operations that can be implemented and probed in a quantum circuit. We benchmark our algorithm numerically at the example of quench dynamics in a spin-1 XXZ chain with finite shot noise and demonstrate advantages in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio over established protocols based on linear response. Our scheme can readily be implemented on various platforms and offers a wide range of applications like variational quantum optimization and probing thermalization in many-body systems.

Title: Quantum Data Management in the NISQ Era: Extended Version
Authors: Rihan Hai, Shih-Han Hung, Tim Coopmans, Tim Littau, Floris Geerts
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising tool for transforming the landscape of computing technology. Recent efforts have applied quantum techniques to classical database challenges, such as query optimization, data integration, index selection, and transaction management. In this paper, we shift focus to a critical yet underexplored area: data management for quantum computing. We are currently in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where qubits, while promising, are fragile and still limited in scale. After differentiating quantum data from classical data, we outline current and future data management paradigms in the NISQ era and beyond. We address the data management challenges arising from the emerging demands of near-term quantum computing. Our goal is to chart a clear course for future quantum-oriented data management research, establishing it as a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum computing in the NISQ era.

Title: Temporal Bell inequalities in non-relativistic many-body physics
Authors: A. Tononi, M. Lewenstein
Abstract: Analyzing the spreading of information in many-body systems is crucial to understanding their quantum dynamics. At the most fundamental level, this task is accomplished by Bell inequalities, whose violation by quantum mechanics implies that information cannot always be stored locally. While Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties perform measurements on systems at different positions, one could formulate temporal inequalities, in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected measurement events, these extensions are compatible with a local description, so that no intrinsically-quantum information spreading is involved in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for a nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. Since the chain constitutes the sole medium for the spreading of quantum information, it prevents the immediate vanishing of Bell correlations after the first measurement and it induces violation revivals. The dynamics we analyze shows that, as expected in a non-relativistic setup, the spreading of information is fundamentally limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. New insights on many-body quantum dynamics could emerge through future applications of our temporal Bell inequality to more general systems.

Title: Effects of dissipation in reservoir computing using a spin qubit array
Authors: Shion Mifune, Taro Kanao, Tetsufumi Tanamoto
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is one of the hottest research topic as an application of many physical devices because the device characteristics can be used directly in computing sequences. Quantum RC is also a promising candidate for application in small-number qubit systems. Here, we propose a quantum RC based on the spin qubit system that reflects the status of the spin qubits in experiments comprising a one-dimensional qubit array. Spin qubits are coupled via the Heisenberg interaction, and data sequences are inputted to one of the spin qubits via pulsed rotations. By introducing dissipation, we obtained a relatively good performance in the quantum RC.

Title: Engineering long-lived entanglement through dissipation in quantum hybrid solid-state platforms
Authors: Jayakrishnan M. P. Nair, Benedetta Flebus
Abstract: Spin squeezing, a form of many-body entanglement, is a crucial resource in quantum metrology and information processing. While experimentally viable protocols for generating stable spin squeezing have been proposed in quantum optics setups, there is growing interest in quantum hybrid solid-state systems as alternative platforms for both engineering and exploring many-body quantum phenomena. In this work, we propose a scheme to generate long-lived spin squeezing in an ensemble of solid-state qubits interacting with electromagnetic noise emitted by a squeezed solid-state bath. We identify the conditions under which quantum correlations within the bath can be transferred to the qubit array, driving it into an entangled state independently of its initial configuration. To assess the experimental feasibility of our approach, we analyze the dynamics of an array of solid-state spin defects coupled to a common ferromagnetic bath, which is driven into a non-equilibrium squeezed state through its interaction with a surface acoustic wave mode. Our results demonstrate that the ensemble can exhibit steady-state spin squeezing under suitable conditions, opening new pathways for the generation of robust many-body entanglement in solid-state spin ensembles.

Title: Cloning Games, Black Holes and Cryptography
Authors: Alexander Poremba, Seyoon Ragavan, Vinod Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: Quantum no-cloning is one of the most fundamental properties of quantum information. In this work, we introduce a new toolkit for analyzing cloning games; these games capture more quantitative versions of no-cloning and are central to unclonable cryptography. Previous works rely on the framework laid out by Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski and Wehner to analyze both the $n$-qubit BB84 game and the subspace coset game. Their constructions and analysis face the following inherent limitations: - The existing bounds on the values of these games are at least $2^{-0.25n}$; on the other hand, the trivial adversarial strategy wins with probability $2^{-n}$. Not only that, the BB84 game does in fact admit a highly nontrivial winning strategy. This raises the natural question: are there cloning games which admit no non-trivial winning strategies? - The existing constructions are not multi-copy secure; the BB84 game is not even $2 \mapsto 3$ secure, and the subspace coset game is not $t \mapsto t+1$ secure for a polynomially large $t$. Moreover, we provide evidence that the existing technical tools do not suffice to prove multi-copy security of even completely different constructions. This raises the natural question: can we design new cloning games that achieve multi-copy security, possibly by developing a new analytic toolkit? We study a new cloning game based on binary phase states and show that it is $t$-copy secure when $t=o(n/\log n)$. Moreover, for constant $t$, we obtain the first asymptotically optimal bounds of $O(2^{-n})$. We also show a worst-case to average-case reduction for a large class of cloning games, which allows us to show the same quantitative results for Haar cloning games. These technical ingredients together enable two new applications which have previously been out of reach; one in black hole physics, and one in unclonable cryptography.

Title: Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation
Authors: Morgan Hedges, Ankit Papneja, Karun Paul, Ben C Buchler
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.

Title: The effect of curvature on local observables in quantum field theory
Authors: Ahmed Shalabi, Matheus H. Zambianco, T. Rick Perche
Abstract: We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.

Title: Frame-dependent coherence of a quantum state
Authors: Nicolae Cotfas
Abstract: The tight frames can be regarded as a particular case of POVMs (positive operator-valued measures describing generalized measurements), namely the case when all the operators are rank-one. Each orthonormal basis is a tight frame, and conversely, every tight frame corresponds to an orthonormal basis via a direct sum Neumark extension. There exist several POVM-based definitions of coherence, and they are well-investigated. Our aim is to identify properties specific to the particular case of tight frames, and to look for some applications. All the POVM-based definitions use a Neumark extension. The frame-dependent coherence can be regarded as a particular case of POVM-based coherence, but it can be defined directly, without to use a Neumark extension. Its definition is a direct generalization of the basis-dependent $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, and offers a more accurate description because we can use a frame containing several orthogonal bases.

Title: Computing Quantum Resources using Tensor Cross Interpolation
Authors: Sven Benjamin Kožić, Gianpaolo Torre
Abstract: Quantum information quantifiers are indispensable tools for analyzing strongly correlated systems. Consequently, developing efficient and robust numerical methods for their computation is crucial. We propose a general procedure based on the family of Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) algorithms to address this challenge in a fully general framework, independent of the system or the quantifier under consideration. To substantiate our approach, we compute the non-stabilizerness Rényi entropy (SRE) and Relative Entropy of Coherence (REC) considering the 1D and 2D ferromagnetic Ising models with minimal modifications to the numerical procedure. This method not only demonstrates its versatility, but also provides a generic framework for exploring other quantum information quantifiers in complex systems.

Title: Implementation of a quantum addressable router using superconducting qubits
Authors: Connie Miao, Sébastien Léger, Ziqian Li, Gideon Lee, Liang Jiang, David I. Schuster
Abstract: The implementation of a quantum router capable of performing both quantum signal routing and quantum addressing (a Q2-router) represents a key step toward building quantum networks and quantum random access memories. We realize a Q2-router that uses fixed-frequency transmon qubits to implement a routing protocol based on two native controlled-iSWAP gates. These gates leverage a large ZZ interaction to selectively route information according to a quantum address. We find an estimated average routing fidelity of 95.3%, with errors arising primarily from decoherence or state preparation and measurement. We present a comprehensive calibration and characterization of both the c-iSWAP gates and the overall routing protocol through randomized benchmarking techniques and state tomography.

Title: Measurement-based Simulation of Geometric Gates in Topological Qubits on NISQ Devices
Authors: Matthew Brooks, Foster Sabatino, Charles Tahan, Silas Hoffman
Abstract: While the adiabatic exchange of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) enables a non-universal set of geometrically protected gates, realising an experimental implementation of MZM braiding remains challenging. In an alternative proposal, charge-parity measurement of two neighboring MZMs supports braiding by teleportation. Moreover, owing to the lack of definitive evidence of MZMs in semiconducting systems, there have been several simulations of MZMs on NISQ devices which more naturally lend themselves to braiding. In this work, measurement-based braiding about MZM Y-junctions are simulated by multi-qubit Pauli-parity measurements of a logical qubit. Logical single-qubit geometric $S^{(\dagger)}$-gates and entangling two-qubit gates is shown using two-physical-qubit joint measurements alone, whilst partial phase rotations such as a $T^{(\dagger)}$-gates require at least one three-qubit joint measurement. These relatively small scale circuits offer both novel measurement-based geometric gates as well as a measurement-based demonstration of quantum Hamiltonian simulation.

Title: Rapid quantum ground state preparation via dissipative dynamics
Authors: Yongtao Zhan, Zhiyan Ding, Jakob Huhn, Johnnie Gray, John Preskill, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan, Lin Lin
Abstract: Inspired by natural cooling processes, dissipation has become a promising approach for preparing low-energy states of quantum systems. However, the potential of dissipative protocols remains unclear beyond certain commuting Hamiltonians. This work provides significant analytical and numerical insights into the power of dissipation for preparing the ground state of non-commuting Hamiltonians. For quasi-free dissipative dynamics, including certain 1D spin systems with boundary dissipation, our results reveal a new connection between the mixing time in trace distance and the spectral properties of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, leading to an explicit and sharp bound on the mixing time that scales polynomially with system size. For more general spin systems, we develop a tensor network-based algorithm for constructing the Lindblad jump operator and for simulating the dynamics. Using this algorithm, we demonstrate numerically that dissipative ground state preparation protocols can achieve rapid mixing for certain 1D local Hamiltonians under bulk dissipation, with a mixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. We then prove the rapid mixing result for certain weakly interacting spin and fermionic systems in arbitrary dimensions, extending recent results for high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers to the zero-temperature regime. Our theoretical approaches are applicable to systems with singular stationary states, and are thus expected to have applications beyond the specific systems considered in this study.

Title: Exploring Non-Multiplicativity in the Geometric Measure of Entanglement
Authors: Daniel Dilley, Jerry Chang, Jeffrey Larson, Eric Chitambar
Abstract: The geometric measure of entanglement (GME) quantifies how close a multi-partite quantum state is to the set of separable states under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. The GME can be non-multiplicative, meaning that the closest product state to two states is entangled across subsystems. In this work, we explore the GME in two families of states: those that are invariant under bilateral orthogonal $(O \otimes O)$ transformations, and mixtures of singlet states. In both cases, a region of GME non-multiplicativity is identified around the anti-symmetric projector state. We employ state-of-the-art numerical optimization methods and models to quantitatively analyze non-multiplicativity in these states for d = 3. We also investigate a constrained form of GME that measures closeness to the set of real product states and show that this measure can be non-multiplicative even for real separable states.

Title: Joint estimation of position and momentum with arbitrarily high precision using non-Gaussian states
Authors: Massimo Frigerio, Matteo G. A. Paris, Carlos Ernesto Lopetegui, Mattia Walschaers
Abstract: We address the joint estimation of changes in the position and linear momentum of a quantum particle or, equivalently, changes in the complex field of a bosonic mode. Although these changes are generated by non-commuting operators, we show that leveraging non-Gaussianity enables their simultaneous estimation with arbitrarily high precision and arbitrarily low quantum incompatibility. Specifically, we demonstrate that any pure non-Gaussian state provides an advantage over all Gaussian states, whether pure or mixed. Moreover, properly tuned non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states can also serve as a resource.

Title: Mind and Matter
Authors: D.M.Appleby
Abstract: It is argued that the problem of interpreting quantum mechanics, and the philosophical problem of consciousness, both have their roots in the same set of misguided Cartesian assumptions. The confusions underlying those assumptions are analyzed in detail. It is sometimes suggested that quantum mechanics might explain consciousness. That is not the suggestion here. Rather it is suggested that an adequate non-Cartesian philosophy would transform our understanding of both quantum mechanics and consciousness. Consequently, it would change our ideas as to just what it is that we are trying to explain.

Title: Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations
Authors: R. S. Watson, K. V. Kheruntsyan
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.

Title: From decay of correlations to locality and stability of the Gibbs state
Authors: Ángela Capel, Massimo Moscolari, Stefan Teufel, Tom Wessel
Abstract: We show that whenever the Gibbs state of a quantum spin system satisfies decay of correlations, then it is stable, in the sense that local perturbations affect the Gibbs state only locally, and it satisfies local indistinguishability, i.e. it exhibits local insensitivity to system size. These implications hold in any dimension, require only locality of the Hamiltonian, and are based on Lieb-Robinson bounds and on a detailed analysis of the locality properties of the quantum belief propagation for Gibbs states. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we explicitly apply our results to several physically relevant models in which the decay of correlations is either known to hold or is proved by us. These include Gibbs states of one-dimensional spin chains with polynomially decaying interactions at any temperature, and high-temperature Gibbs states of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions in any dimension. We also prove exponential decay of correlations above a threshold temperature for Gibbs states of one-dimensional finite spin chains with translation-invariant and exponentially decaying interactions, and then apply our general results.

Title: Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Giuseppe Calajò, Giovanni Cataldi, Marco Rigobello, Darvin Wanisch, Giuseppe Magnifico, Pietro Silvi, Simone Montangero, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of weak ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.

Title: Stabilizing an individual charge fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot
Authors: Feiyang Ye, Ammar Ellaboudy, John M. Nichol
Abstract: Charge noise is a major obstacle to improved gate fidelities in silicon spin qubits. Numerous methods exist to mitigate charge noise, including improving device fabrication, dynamical decoupling, and real-time parameter estimation. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of techniques to mitigate charge noise in semiconductor quantum dots by controlling the noise sources themselves. Using two different classical feedback methods, we stabilize an individual charged two-level fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot by exploiting sensitive gate-voltage dependence of the switching times. These control methods reduce the low-frequency component of the noise power spectrum by an order of magnitude. These techniques also enable stabilizing the fluctuator in either of its states. In the future, such techniques may enable improved coherence times in quantum-dot spin qubits.

Title: Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability
Authors: Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.
