Title: Quantum Langevin Dynamics
Authors: Mohammad Attrash, Roi Baer
Abstract: Previous years researchers began to simulate open quantum system, taking into account the interaction between system and the environment. One approach to deal with this problem is to use the density matrix within the Liouville-von-Neumann formalism or the Markovian variant the Lindblad equations. Another way is to use a stochastic approach where a random force is added to the system. The benefit of the stochastic approach is to solve the dynamics of the system with less time and memory than the density matrix approaches. In this project we want to develop a stochastic approach that can deal with the stochastic wave functions approach. We did this on a 2-level system and found that it works well when comparing to a density matrix approach. Next, we tested a quantum particle connect to a bath of harmonic oscillators using the stochastic approach. We found that a friction term is necessary and applied it. Like in the classical Langevin equations the friction constant and the random force fluctuations are related by the fluctuation-dissipation constant. We showed that with friction the dynamics decays to an ensemble with energy of $E_{gs}+k_BT$. However, we also found here are problems. The system seems to absorb energy indefinitely if the temperature is higher than the zero point energy or if the system is a Morse oscillator. Thus more research is required to make this method work.

Title: Lower-depth local encoding circuits for the surface code
Authors: Jahan Claes
Abstract: The surface code is the most studied error-correcting code thanks to its high threshold, simple decoding, and locality in two dimensions (2D). A key component of any code is its encoding circuit, which maps an unencoded state to the corresponding encoded state. The best previous surface code encoding circuit compatible with 2D local connectivity requires depth $2d$ to encode distance-$d$ surface codes. This paper presents depth $d$ encoding circuits for the rotated surface code. Our circuit is constructed inductively from circuits that grow the code from $d$ to $(d+2)$. We prove that depth $d+O(1)$ is optimal for inductively constructed circuits.

Title: Optimal Waveforms for Dipole Moment Estimation with Coherent States
Authors: Karthik Chinni, Nicolás Quesada
Abstract: We investigate quantum sensing for spectroscopy in a system consisting of a two-level atom coupled to a continuum of modes. We focus on optimizing the pulse shape of a coherent state to maximize the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the emitted light with the aim of estimating the atom's dipole moment, which is proportional to its spontaneous emission rate. To achieve this, we derive a set of coupled differential equations, which include the standard optical Bloch equations as a subset and whose solution directly yields the QFI of the emitted light without resorting to finite-difference methods. Furthermore, we analyze the factors that govern its optimization, provide analytic solutions in both the long and the short pulse width limits, and examine the role of the average photon number of the pulses. We then show that under the closed (periodic) boundary conditions, the harmonic (plane-wave) with frequency equal to half the spontaneous emission rate and a phase determined by detuning are optimal in the long pulse width limit.

Title: Nearly optimal algorithms to learn sparse quantum Hamiltonians in physically motivated distances
Authors: Amira Abbas, Nunzia Cerrato, Francisco Escudero Gutiérrez, Dmitry Grinko, Francesco Anna Mele, Pulkit Sinha
Abstract: We study the problem of learning Hamiltonians $H$ that are $s$-sparse in the Pauli basis, given access to their time evolution. Although Hamiltonian learning has been extensively investigated, two issues recur in much of the existing literature: the absence of matching lower bounds and the use of mathematically convenient but physically opaque error measures. We address both challenges by introducing two physically motivated distances between Hamiltonians and designing a nearly optimal algorithm with respect to one of these metrics. The first, time-constrained distance, quantifies distinguishability through dynamical evolution up to a bounded time. The second, temperature-constrained distance, captures distinguishability through thermal states at bounded inverse temperatures. We show that $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with bounded operator norm can be learned in both distances with $O(s \log(1/\epsilon))$ experiments and $O(s^2/\epsilon)$ evolution time. For the time-constrained distance, we further establish lower bounds of $\Omega((s/n)\log(1/\epsilon) + s)$ experiments and $\Omega(\sqrt{s}/\epsilon)$ evolution time, demonstrating near-optimality in the number of experiments. As an intermediate result, we obtain an algorithm that learns every Pauli coefficient of $s$-sparse Hamiltonians up to error $\epsilon$ in $O(s\log(1/\epsilon))$ experiments and $O(s/\epsilon)$ evolution time, improving upon several recent results. The source of this improvement is a new isolation technique, inspired by the Valiant-Vazirani theorem (STOC'85), which shows that NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions. This isolation technique allows us to query the time evolution of a single Pauli coefficient of a sparse Hamiltonian--even when the Pauli support of the Hamiltonian is unknown--ultimately enabling us to recover the Pauli support itself.

Title: Comparative Studies of Quantum Annealing, Digital Annealing, and Classical Solvers for Reaction Network Pathway Analysis and mRNA Codon Selection
Authors: Milind Upadhyay, Mark Nicholas Jones
Abstract: For various optimization problems, the classical time to solution is super-polynomial and intractable to solve with classical bit-based computing hardware to date. Digital and quantum annealers have the potential to identify near-optimal solutions for such optimization problems using a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem formulation. This work benchmarks two use cases to evaluate the utility of QUBO solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, in order to determine if a QUBO formulation and annealing-based algorithms have an advantage over classical mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) solvers. Various QUBO and solver metrics such as problem mapping, quantitative interconnectivity, penalty structure, solver minimum cost (obtained optimal value) and solver time to solution have been applied to evaluate different QUBO problems. Constrained and unconstrained QUBO solvers are compared including the Fujitsu digital annealer (DA), various D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing solvers (QA, HQA), and the classical MIP/CP solvers HiGHS, Gurobi, SCIP, and CP-SAT. The two industrially relevant use cases are reaction network pathway analysis and mRNA codon selection. For reaction pathway analysis, classical MIP/CP solvers are observed to solve the problem to optimality in reasonable time frames while the DA is not able to do so. For mRNA codon selection, CP-SAT displayed the best performance for standard and large protein datasets (under 1500 amino acids). For the extra-large protein dataset (11000 to 14000 amino acids), the D-Wave Nonlinear HQA solver performed comparably to CP-SAT, outperforming it in minimum cost in 2 out of the 4 problems.

Title: Quantum sensing in the presence of pulse errors and qubit leakage
Authors: David M. Lancaster, Muhammad Ali Shahbaz, Hamed Goli Yousefabad, Sanway Chatterjee, Eegan Ram, Jonathan D. Weinstein
Abstract: Using both simulation and experiment, we investigate the robustness of dynamical decoupling sequences to pulse errors: rotation errors and detuning errors. Whereas prior work examined the effect of errors on coherence times, here we show that quantum sensing can be affected by pulse errors in dramatically different ways than coherence times alone. We also explore the effects of qubit leakage: off-resonant coupling to other quantum levels. We find order-of-magnitude differences between commonly-used dynamical decoupling sequences in both their sensitivity to pulse errors and leakage.

Title: Quantum Computing Technology Roadmaps and Capability Assessment for Scientific Computing -- An analysis of use cases from the NERSC workload
Authors: Daan Camps, Ermal Rrapaj, Katherine Klymko, Hyeongjin Kim, Kevin Gott, Siva Darbha, Jan Balewski, Brian Austin, Nicholas J. Wright
Abstract: The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), as the high-performance computing (HPC) facility for the Department of Energy's Office of Science, recognizes the essential role of quantum computing in its future mission. In this report, we analyze the NERSC workload and identify materials science, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics as the science domains and application areas that stand to benefit most from quantum computers. These domains jointly make up over 50% of the current NERSC production workload, which is illustrative of the impact quantum computing could have on NERSC's mission going forward. We perform an extensive literature review and determine the quantum resources required to solve classically intractable problems within these science domains. This review also shows that the quantum resources required have consistently decreased over time due to algorithmic improvements and a deeper understanding of the problems. At the same time, public technology roadmaps from a collection of ten quantum computing companies predict a dramatic increase in capabilities over the next five to ten years. Our analysis reveals a significant overlap emerging in this time frame between the technological capabilities and the algorithmic requirements in these three scientific domains. We anticipate that the execution time of large-scale quantum workflows will become a major performance parameter and propose a simple metric, the Sustained Quantum System Performance (SQSP), to compare system-level performance and throughput for a heterogeneous workload.

Title: Improved Quantum Lifting by Coherent Measure-and-Reprogram
Authors: Alexandru Cojocaru, Juan Garay, Qipeng Liu, Fang Song
Abstract: We give a tighter lifting theorem for security games in the quantum random oracle model. At the core of our main result lies a novel measure-and-reprogram framework that we call coherent reprogramming. This framework gives a tighter lifting theorem for query complexity problems, that only requires purely classical reasoning. As direct applications of our lifting theorem, we first provide a quantum direct product theorem in the average case - i.e., an enabling tool to determine the hardness of solving multi-instance security games. This allows us to derive in a straightforward manner the hardness of various security games, for example (i) the non-uniform hardness of salted games, (ii) the hardness of specific cryptographic tasks such as the multiple instance version of one-wayness and collision-resistance, and (iii) uniform or non-uniform hardness of many other games.

Title: NISQ Security and Complexity via Simple Classical Reasoning
Authors: Alexandru Cojocaru, Juan Garay, Qipeng Liu, Fang Song
Abstract: We give novel lifting theorems for security games in the quantum random oracle model (QROM) in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) settings such as the hybrid query model, the noisy oracle and the bounded-depth models. We provide, for the first time, a hybrid lifting theorem for hybrid algorithms that can perform both quantum and classical queries, as well as a lifting theorem for quantum algorithms with access to noisy oracles or bounded quantum depth. At the core of our results lies a novel measure-and-reprogram framework, called hybrid coherent measure-and-reprogramming, tailored specifically for hybrid algorithms. Equipped with the lifting theorem, we are able to prove directly NISQ security and complexity results by calculating a single combinatorial quantity, relying solely on classical reasoning. As applications, we derive the first direct product theorems in the average case, in the hybrid setting-i.e., an enabling tool to determine the hybrid hardness of solving multi-instance security games. This allows us to derive in a straightforward manner the NISQ hardness of various security games, such as (i) the non-uniform hardness of salted games, (ii) the hardness of specific cryptographic tasks such as the multiple instance version of one-wayness and collision-resistance, and (iii) uniform or non-uniform hardness of many other games.

Title: Orthogonal polynomials, quantum walks and the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem
Authors: Frederico Cançado, Gabriel Coutinho, Thomás Jung Spier
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the following problem. Define a quantum walk on a positively weighted path (linear chain). Can the weights be tuned so that perfect state transfer occurs between the first vertex and any other position? We do not fully answer this question - in fact, we show that a particular case of this problem is equivalent to a solution of a particular case of the well known Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem, deeming our original task certainly harder than anticipated. In our journey, we prove new results about sequences of orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recurrences. In particular, we provide a full characterization of when two polynomials belong to such a sequence, which (as far as we were able to ascertain) was known only for when their degrees differ by one.

Title: No oscillating subradiant correlations in a strongly driven quantum emitter array
Authors: Jiaming Shi, Nikita Leppenen, Ran Tessler, Alexander N. Poddubny
Abstract: We theoretically study time-dependent correlations in a strongly driven array of $N$ two-level atoms, coupled to photons in a waveguide. We focus on the spectrum $\{\lambda\}$ of the Liouvillian superoperator, which determines the correlation decay rates $-\Re \lambda$ and the frequencies $\Im\lambda$. Our main finding is the suppression of subradiant oscillating correlations between atomic states by a strong coherent of amplitude $\Omega$: $|\Re \lambda|\ge m\gamma/2$, where $\gamma$ is the single-atom spontaneous decay rate and $m=|\Im \lambda/(2\Omega)|$ is a nonzero integer for correlations oscillating in time $\propto \exp(\pm 2i m|\Omega| t)$. This limit is independent of the number of atoms $N$; it holds both for small arrays and in the macroscopic limit. We demonstrate the suppression of subradiance numerically and provide a rigorous proof based on the analytical decomposition of the Liouvillian using spectral theory of simplicial complexes and posets.

Title: Toward Minimum Graphic Parity Networks
Authors: Yixin Cao, Yiren Lu, Junhong Nie, Xiaoming Sun, Guojing Tian
Abstract: Quantum circuits composed of CNOT and $R_z$ are fundamental building blocks of many quantum algorithms, so optimizing the synthesis of such quantum circuits is crucial. We address this problem from a theoretical perspective by studying the graphic parity network synthesis problem. A graphic parity network for a graph $G$ is a quantum circuit composed solely of CNOT gates where each edge of $G$ is represented in the circuit, and the final state of the wires matches the original input. We aim to synthesize graphic parity networks with the minimum number of gates, specifically for quantum algorithms addressing combinatorial optimization problems with Ising formulations. We demonstrate that a graphic parity network for a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges requires at least $m+n-1$ gates. This lower bound can be improved to $m+\Omega(m) = m+\Omega(n^{1.5})$ when the shortest cycle in the graph has a length of at least five. We complement this result with a simple randomized algorithm that synthesizes a graphic parity network with expected $m + O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ gates. Additionally, we begin exploring connected graphs that allow for graphic parity networks with exactly $m+n-1$ gates. We conjecture that all such graphs belong to a newly defined graph class. Furthermore, we present a linear-time algorithm for synthesizing minimum graphic parity networks for graphs within this class. However, this graph class is not closed under taking induced subgraphs, and we show that recognizing it is $\textsf{NP}$-complete, which is complemented with a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by the treewidth.

Title: Perfect quantum state transfer via state restoring and ancilla measurement
Authors: E.B. Fel'dman, J. Wu, A.I. Zenchuk
Abstract: We propose the protocol for perfect state transfer of an arbitrary pure quantum state along the spin-1/2 chain governed by the Hamiltonian preserving the excitation number in the system. We show that the $k$-excitation pure sender's state can be restored at the receiver using only the local transformations over the qubits of the extended receiver. The restored state appears in the superposition with other states which form garbage. This garbage can be easily removed by including the ancilla whose state labels the garbage, and then measuring the {ancilla state} with desired output. The resulting state of the receiver coincides with the initial sender's state {up to the unimportant common phase factor.} Then, to transfer an arbitrary {pure} state of some system $S_0$, we encode this state into the $k$-excitation state of the sender, transfer and restore it and finally decode the restored $k$-excitation state {of the receiver} into the state of another subsystem $R_0$. After labeling and removing the garbage via measuring the state of the ancillae we complete the algorithm for PST.

Title: Bistability of optical properties of cesium vapor due to collective interaction of alignment and orientation under strong spin exchange conditions
Authors: M.V. Petrenko, A.K. Vershovskii
Abstract: Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.

Title: Exact Classicalization of N-Level Quantum Systems Interacting with a Bath: Theory and Applications
Authors: Daniel Martínez-Gil, Pedro Bargueño, Salvador Miret-Artés
Abstract: In this manuscript, starting from a five-step algorithmic procedure for exactly classicalizing the dynamics of N-level quantum systems, we incorporate a classical bath of harmonic oscillators to model environmental interactions. Using the geometry of complex projective spaces CP(N-1) and a Langevin formalism, we obtain N-1 Hamilton's equations which encode both the quantum system and the bath degrees of freedom, representing a generalization of the Caldeira-Legget model in a complex projective space. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by applying it to two paradigmatic systems: a two-qubit system in CP(3) under entangling interactions, reproducing quantum observables such as state populations, quaternionic population differences and concurrence, and the seven-state Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in CP(6), reproducing state populations in the picosecond timescale.

Title: Loss Behavior in Supervised Learning with Entangled States
Authors: Alexander Mandl, Johanna Barzen, Marvin Bechtold, Frank Leymann, Lavinia Stiliadou
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) aims to leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to speed up the process of solving machine learning problems or improve the quality of solutions. Among these principles, entanglement with an auxiliary system was shown to increase the quality of QML models in applications such as supervised learning. Recent works focus on the information that can be extracted from entangled training samples and their effect on the approximation error of the trained model. However, results on the trainability of QML models show that the training process itself is affected by various properties of the supervised learning task. These properties include the circuit structure of the QML model, the used cost function, and noise on the quantum computer. To evaluate the applicability of entanglement in supervised learning, we augment these results by investigating the effect of highly entangled training data on the model's trainability. In this work, we show that for highly expressive models, i.e., models capable of expressing a large number of candidate solutions, the possible improvement of loss function values in constrained neighborhoods during optimization is severely limited when maximally entangled states are employed for training. Furthermore, we support this finding experimentally by simulating training with Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Our findings show that as the expressivity of the PQC increases, it becomes more susceptible to loss concentration induced by entangled training data. Lastly, our experiments evaluate the efficacy of non-maximal entanglement in the training samples and highlight the fundamental role of entanglement entropy as a predictor for the trainability.

Title: Fluctuation-guided adaptive random compiler for Hamiltonian simulation
Authors: Yu-Xia Wu, Yun-Zhuo Fan, Dan-Bo Zhang
Abstract: Stochastic methods offer an effective way to suppress coherent errors in quantum simulation. In particular, the randomized compilation protocol may reduce circuit depth by randomly sampling Hamiltonian terms rather than following the deterministic Trotter-Suzuki sequence. However, its fixed sampling distribution does not adapt to the dynamics of the system, limiting its accuracy. In this work, we propose a fluctuation-guided adaptive algorithm that adaptively updates sampling probabilities based on fluctuations of Hamiltonian terms to achieve higher simulation fidelity. Remarkably, the protocol renders an intuitive physical understanding: Hamiltonian terms with greater sensitivity to the state evolution should be prioritized during sampling. The overload of measuring fluctuations necessary for updating the sampling probability is affordable, and can be further largely reduced by classical shadows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with numeral simulations across discrete-variable, continuous-variable and hybrid-variable systems.

Title: Evolution of moments in atmospheric scintillation
Authors: Filippus S. Roux
Abstract: Evolution equations for the moments of a photonic quantum state propagating through atmospheric turbulence are derived. These evolution equations are obtain from an evolution equation for the characteristic functional of the state, incorporating all spatiotemporal degrees of freedom. The measured quantities, such as the intensity or photon distribution, of the evolving state can be expressed in terms of such moments without having to know the exact final state. The case of an initial coherent state is considered as an example.

Title: Statistical Quantum Mechanics of the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS): A Self-Stabilizing True Uniform RNG
Authors: Randy Kuang
Abstract: We present the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS), a novel framework for true uniform randomness generation grounded in statistical quantum mechanics. RPSS is built on a pair of conjugate observables, the permutation count and the elapsed sorting time, whose heavy-tailed raw distributions synchronously converge to uniformity through modular reduction. This mathematically proven convergence establishes RPSS as a True Uniform Random Number Generator (TURNG). A practical implementation, QPP-RNG, demonstrates how intrinsic system jitter, arising from microarchitectural noise, memory latency, and scheduling dynamics, interacts with combinatorial complexity to yield a compact, self-stabilizing entropy source. Empirical validation under the NIST SP 800-90B framework confirms rapid entropy convergence and statistically uniform outputs. RPSS thus defines a new class of quantum-inspired entropy engines, where randomness is simultaneously harvested from unpredictable system jitter and amplified by combinatorial processes, offering a robust, platform-independent alternative to conventional entropy sources.

Title: Symplectic Lattices and GKP Codes -- Simple Randomized Constructions from Cryptographic Lattices
Authors: Johannes Blömer, Yinzi Xiao, Zahra Raissi, Stanislaw Soltan
Abstract: We construct good GKP (Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill) codes (in the sense of Conrad, Eisert and Seifert proposed) from standard short integer solution lattices (SIS) as well as from ring SIS and module SIS lattices, R-SIS and M-SIS lattices, respectively. These lattice are crucial for lattice-based cryptography. Our construction yields GKP codes with distance $\sqrt{n/\pi e}$. This compares favorably with the NTRU-based construction by Conrad et al. that achieves distance $\Omega(\sqrt{n/q}),$ with $n\le q^2/0.28$. Unlike their codes, our codes do not have secret keys that can be used to speed-up the decoding. However, we present a simple decoding algorithm that, for many parameter choices, experimentally yields decoding results similar to the ones for NTRU-based codes. Using the R-SIS and M-SIS construction, our simple decoding algorithm runs in nearly linear time. Following Conrad, Eisert and Seifert's work, our construction of GKP codes follows directly from an explicit, randomized construction of symplectic lattices with (up to constants $\approx 1$) minimal distance $(1/\sigma_{2n})^{1/2n}\approx \sqrt{\frac{n}{\pi e}}$, where $\sigma_{2n}$ is the volume of the 2n-dimensional unit ball. Before this result, Buser and Sarnak gave a non-constructive proof for the existence of such symplectic lattices.

Title: Quantum kernel and HHL-based support vector machines for multi-class classification
Authors: Gabriela Pinheiro, Donovan Slabbert, Luis Kowada, Francesco Petruccione
Abstract: We compare two quantum approaches that use support vector machines for multi-class classification on a reduced Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) dataset: the quantum kernel-based QSVM and the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd least-squares SVM (HHL LS-SVM). Both one-vs-rest and two-step hierarchical classification schemes were implemented. The QSVM involves angle encoding of ten features, two unitary operator blocks consisting of rotational operator gates, and a projective measurement that projects the final state to the zero state. The HHL-based method involves solving a system of linear equations using the HHL algorithm and using the solution in a support vector machine approach. The results indicate that the QSVM outperforms HHL LS-SVM in most cases. HHL LS-SVM performs somewhat competitively in selected cases, particularly when isolating galaxies (majority), however, it also performs poorly in others, especially when isolating QSOs (minority). Comparisons with classical SVMs confirm that quantum and classical methods achieve broadly similar performance, with classical models performing slightly ahead overall. Scaling analysis reveals a trade-off: QSVM performance suffers from quadratic scaling with the number of samples and features, but benefits from explicit feature representation during training, while HHL LS-SVM scales essentially constantly, with moderate fluctuations, but suffers from limited representative elements. The HHL-based method is also highly noise-sensitive. These results suggest that QSVM performs better overall and will perform better on current hardware as well, but that the more efficient scaling of HHL LS-SVM makes it a useful option for larger datasets with many samples, especially if we move past the NISQ era.

Title: Approaching the Multiparameter Quantum Cramér-Rao Bound via Classical Correlation and Entangling Measurements
Authors: Minghao Mi, Ben Wang, Lijian Zhang
Abstract: Multiparameter quantum metrology is essential for a wide range of practical applications. However, simultaneously achieving the ultimate precision for all parameters, as prescribed by the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB), remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a scheme termed local operation with entangling measurements (LOEM) strategy, which leverages classically correlated orthogonal pure states combined with entangling measurements to attain the multiparameter QCRB. We experimentally validate this scheme using a quantum photonic system. Additionally, we employ iterative interactions to demonstrate that the LOEM strategy can achieve the precision of Heisenberg scaling. By theoretically and experimentally demonstrating the saturation of the multiparameter QCRB with the LOEM strategy, our work advances the practical applications of quantum metrology in multiparameter estimation.

Title: Bohmian Chaos and Entanglement in a Two-Qubit System
Authors: Athanasios C. Tzemos, George Contopoulos, Foivos Zanias
Abstract: We study in detail the critical points of Bohmian flow, both in the inertial frame of reference (Y-points) and in the frames centered at the moving nodal points of the guiding wavefunction (X-points), and analyze their role in the onset of chaos in a system of two entangled qubits. We find the distances between these critical points and a moving Bohmian particle at varying levels of entanglement, with particular emphasis on the times at which chaos arises. Then, we find why some trajectories are ordered, without any chaos. Finally, we examine numerically how the Lyapunov Characteristic Number (LCN ) depends on the degree of quantum entanglement. Our results indicate that increasing entanglement reduces the convergence time of the finite-time LCN of the chaotic trajectories toward its final positive value.

Title: Beam-splitter-free, high-rate quantum key distribution inspired by intrinsic quantum mechanical spatial randomness of entangled photons
Authors: Ayan Kumar Nai, Gopal Prasad Sahu, Rutuj Gharate, C. M. Chandrashekar, G. K. Samanta
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) using entangled photon sources (EPS) is a cornerstone of secure communication. Despite rapid advances in QKD, conventional protocols still employ beam splitters (BSs) for passive random basis selection. However, BSs intrinsically suffer from photon loss, imperfect splitting ratios, and polarization dependence, limiting the key rate, increasing the quantum bit error rate (QBER), and constraining scalability, particularly over long distances. By contrast, EPSs based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) intrinsically exhibit quantum randomness in spatial and spectral degrees of freedom, offering a natural replacement for BSs in basis selection. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept spatial-randomness-based QKD scheme in which the annular SPDC emission ring is divided into four sections, effectively generating two independent EPSs. pair photons from these sources, distributed to Alice and Bob, enable H/V and D/A measurements. The quantum-random pair generation inherently mimics the stochastic basis choice otherwise performed by a BS. Experimentally, our scheme achieves a 6.4-fold enhancement in sifted key rate, a consistently reduced QBER, and a near-ideal encoding balance between logical bits 0 and 1. Furthermore, the need for four spatial channels can be avoided by employing wavelength demultiplexing to generate two EPSs at distinct wavelength pairs. Harnessing intrinsic spatial/spectral randomness thus enables robust, bias-free, high-rate, and low-QBER QKD, offering a scalable pathway for next-generation quantum networks.

Title: Certifying and learning quantum Ising Hamiltonians
Authors: Andreas Bluhm, Matthias C. Caro, Francisco Escudero Gutiérrez, Aadil Oufkir, Cambyse Rouzé
Abstract: In this work, we study the problems of certifying and learning quantum Ising Hamiltonians. Our main contributions are as follows: Certification of Ising Hamiltonians. We show that certifying an Ising Hamiltonian in normalized Frobenius norm via access to its time-evolution operator requires only $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon)$ time evolution. This matches the Heisenberg-scaling lower bound of $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ up to logarithmic factors. To our knowledge, this is the first nearly-optimal algorithm for testing a Hamiltonian property. A key ingredient in our analysis is the Bonami Lemma from Fourier analysis. Learning Ising Gibbs states. We design an algorithm for learning Ising Gibbs states in trace norm that is sample-efficient in all parameters. In contrast, previous approaches learned the underlying Hamiltonian (which implies learning the Gibbs state) but suffered from exponential sample complexity in the inverse temperature. Certification of Ising Gibbs states. We give an algorithm for certifying Ising Gibbs states in trace norm that is both sample and time-efficient, thereby solving a question posed by Anshu (Harvard Data Science Review, 2022). Finally, we extend our results on learning and certification of Gibbs states to general $k$-local Hamiltonians for any constant $k$.

Title: Tunable Magnetic Order in Chiral Coupled Spin Chains
Authors: Rafael D. Soares, J. M. Viana Parente Lopes, Hugo Terças
Abstract: We obtain the ground-state phase diagram of two spin chains consisting in a set two-level systems asymmetrically coupled to an XX chain through a chiral interaction. The interaction is parametrized by its magnitude and an angle defined by the relative orientation of the spins in different chains. From the entanglement spectrum, we identify the critical lines separating distinct magnetically ordered phases, with the interaction angle able to shift or fully suppress the transition. By increasing the coupling strength, the systems is driven through a quantum phase transition, leading to the formation of two types of in-plane antiferromagnetic stripes. The interaction strength sets stripe formation, while the angle controls the spins orientations. The chiral interaction also induces a non-trivial finite vector spin chirality with opposite orientation on the chains. We show that the vector spin chirality emerges smoothly from the decoupled limit and occurs for angles different from zero and $\pi/2$, where collinear order is favored instead.

Title: Confined few-particle systems beyond mean-field theory adopting Gaussian-type orbitals and Morse interparticle interaction
Authors: Matee ur Rehman, Paul Winter, Fabio Revuelta, Alejandro Saenz
Abstract: Recent advancements in optical tweezers enable the trapping of arbitrary numbers of neutral atoms and molecules, even arrays of tweezers with variable geometry can be realized. These fascinating breakthroughs require novel full-dimensional beyond mean-field treatments for systems with more than two confined particles spread over traps that are arranged arbitrarily in space. In this work, the suitability of a quantum-chemistry inspired approach adopting Cartesian Gaussians as basis functions is investigated. For this purpose, the six-dimensional integrals associated with a realistic atom-atom interaction described by a Morse model potential were implemented. The performance, correctness and efficiency of the implementation is assessed by comparing full configuration-interaction calculations (exact diagonalizations) for two atoms in an isotropic harmonic trap with quasi-exact reference results.

Title: Most incompatible measurements and sum-of-squares optimisation
Authors: Sébastien Designolle
Abstract: Measurement incompatibility, or joint measurability, is a cornerstone of quantum theory and a useful resource. For finite-dimensional systems, quantifying this resource and establishing universal bounds valid for all measurements is a long-standing problem. In this work, we exhibit analytical universal parent measurements giving access to bounds that beat the state of the art. In particular, we can show that, for relevant robustnesses, sets of anticommuting observables give rise to the most incompatible dichotomic measurements. We also formalise the construction of such universal parent measurements in the framework of sum-of-squares optimisation and obtain preliminary numerical results demonstrating the power of the method by improving on our own analytical values. All results find direct application for demonstrating genuine high-dimensional steering, that is, certifying the dimensionality of a quantum system in a one-sided device-independent manner.

Title: Optimizing Inter-chip Coupler Link Placement for Modular and Chiplet Quantum Systems
Authors: Zefan Du, Pedro Chumpitaz Flores, Wenqi Wei, Juntao Chen, Kaixun Hua, Ying Mao
Abstract: Quantum computing offers unparalleled computational capabilities but faces significant challenges, including limited qubit counts, diverse hardware topologies, and dynamic noise and error rates, which hinder scalability and reliability. Distributed quantum computing, particularly chip-to-chip connections, has emerged as a solution by interconnecting multiple processors to collaboratively execute large circuits. While hardware advancements, such as IBM's Quantum Flamingo, focus on improving inter-chip fidelity, limited research addresses efficient circuit cutting and qubit mapping in distributed systems. This project introduces InterPlace, a self-adaptive, hardware-aware framework for chip-to-chip distributed quantum systems. InterPlace analyzes qubit noise and error rates to construct a virtual system topology, guiding circuit partitioning and distributed qubit mapping to minimize SWAP overhead and enhance fidelity. Implemented with IBM Qiskit and compared with the state-of-the-art, InterPlace achieves up to a 53.0\% improvement in fidelity and reduces the combination of on-chip SWAPs and inter-chip operations by as much as 33.3\%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness in extensive evaluations on real quantum hardware topologies.

Title: Provable avoidance of barren plateaus for GM-QAOA
Authors: Boris Tsvelikhovskiy, Matthew Nuyten, Bojko N. Bakalov
Abstract: We analyze the dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) associated with the Grover-mixer variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (GM-QAOA). When the initial state is the uniform superposition of computational basis states, we show that the corresponding DLA is isomorphic to either $\mathfrak{su}_{r} \oplus \mathfrak{u}_{1}^{\oplus 2}$ or $\mathfrak{su}_{r} \oplus \mathfrak{u}_{1}$, where \(r\) denotes the number of distinct values of the objective function. We also establish an analogous classification for other choices of initial states and Grover-type mixers. Furthermore, we prove that the DLA of GM-QAOA has the largest possible commutant among all QAOA variants initialized with the same state $|\xi\rangle$, corresponding physically to the maximal set of conserved quantities. In addition, we derive an explicit formula for the variance of the GM-QAOA loss function in terms of the objective function values, and we show that, for a broad class of optimization problems, GM-QAOA with sufficiently many layers avoids barren plateaus.

Title: Quantum algorithms based on quantum trajectories
Authors: Evan Borras, Milad Marvian
Abstract: Quantum simulation has emerged as a key application of quantum computing, with significant progress made in algorithms for simulating both closed and open quantum systems. The simulation of open quantum systems, particularly those governed by the Lindblad master equation, has received attention recently with the current state-of-the-art algorithms having an input model query complexity of $O(T \mathrm{polylog}(T/\epsilon))$, where $T$ and $\epsilon$ are the requested time and precision of the simulation respectively. For the Hamiltonian simulation problem it has been show that the optimal Hamiltonian query complexity is $O(T + \log(1/\epsilon))$, additive in nature between the two parameter, but for Lindbladian simulation this question remains open. In this work we show that the additive complexity of $O(T + \log(1/\epsilon))$ is reachable for the simulation of a large class of Lindbladian by constructing a novel quantum algorithm based on quantum trajectories.

Title: Global vs. Local Discrimination of Locally Implementable Multipartite Unitaries
Authors: Satyaki Manna, Sneha Suresh, Anandamay Das Bhowmik, Debashis Saha
Abstract: We study single-shot distinguishability of locally implementable multipartite unitaries under Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) and global operations. As unitary discrimination depends on both the choice of probing states and the measurements on the evolved states, we classify LOCC and global distinguishability into two categories: adaptive strategies, where probing states are chosen based on measurement outcomes from other subsystems, and restricted strategies, where probing states remain fixed. Our findings uncover three surprising features in the bipartite setting and establish new structural limits for unitary discrimination: (i) Certain pairs of unitaries are globally distinguishable with restricted strategies but indistinguishable under LOCC, even with adaptive strategies. (ii) There exist sets of four unitaries that are distinguishable via LOCC, yet remain globally indistinguishable with restricted strategies. (iii) Some sets of unitaries are globally indistinguishable under adaptive strategies, when probed with separable states, but become distinguishable via LOCC.

Title: Maximally $ψ-$epistemic models cannot explain gambling with two qubits
Authors: Sagnik Ray, Anubhav Chaturvedi, Debashis Saha
Abstract: We investigate the minimal proof for ruling out maximally $\psi-$epistemic interpretations of quantum theory, in which the indistinguishable nature of two quantum states is fully explained by the epistemic overlap of their corresponding distributions over ontic states. To this end, we extend the standard notion of epistemic overlap by considering a penalized distinguishability game involving two states and three possible answers, named as Quantum Gambling. In this context, using only two pure states and their equal mixture, we present an experimentally robust no-go theorem for maximally $\psi-$epistemic models, showing that qubit states achieve the maximal difference between quantum and epistemic overlaps.

Title: Wafer-Scale Squeezed-Light Chips
Authors: Shuai Liu, Kailu Zhou, Yuheng Zhang, Abdulkarim Hariri, Nicholas Reynolds, Bo-Han Wu, Zheshen Zhang
Abstract: Squeezed-light generation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is essential for scalable continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. By suppressing quantum fluctuations below the shot-noise limit, squeezed states enable quantum-enhanced sensing and serve as a standard resource for CV quantum information processing. While chip-level squeezed-light sources have been demonstrated, extending this capability to the wafer level with reproducible strong squeezing to bolster large-scale quantum-enhanced sensing and information processing has been hindered by squeezed light's extreme susceptibility to device imperfections. Here, we report wafer-scale fabrication, generation, and characterization of two-mode squeezed-vacuum states on a fully complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) PIC platform. Across a 4-inch wafer, 8 dies yield 2.9-3.1 dB directly measured quadrature squeezing with $< 0.2$ dB variation, demonstrating excellent uniformity. This performance is enabled by co-integrating ultralow-loss, strongly overcoupled high-$Q$ microresonators, cascaded pump-rejection filters, and low-loss inverse-tapered edge couplers. The measurements agree with a first-principles theoretical model parameterized solely by independently extracted device parameters and experimental settings. The measured squeezing level can be further improved by enhancing the efficiencies of off-chip detection and chip-to-fiber coupling. These results establish a reproducible, wafer-scale route to nonclassical-light generation in integrated photonics and lay the groundwork for scalable CV processors, multiplexed entanglement sources, and quantum-enhanced sensing.

Title: Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors
Authors: Takayuki Kubo
Abstract: This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.

Title: A generalized independent atom model approach for net ionization of molecules by multiply-charged heavy-ion impact
Authors: Hans Jürgen Lüdde, Marko Horbatsch, Tom Kirchner
Abstract: The previously applied independent atom model (IAM) for highly charged ion-molecule collisions which implemented the suppression of multiple ionization and capture on the basis of geometric overlaps of cross-sectional areas representing ion-atom cross sections using a pixel counting method (PCM), [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 101}, 062709 (2020)] is extended to incorporate the possibility of multiple collisions within the molecule. This is accomplished on the basis of estimated mean free paths for sequential projectile-atom collisions. The IAM-PCM was demonstrated to be successful in describing proton-molecule collisions, and moderately-charged ion impact at high collision energies. The new model does agree with these results, but has important consequences for highly charged projectiles providing larger cross sections than IAM-PCM, but still well below the simple additivity rule results.

Title: Entanglement architecture of beyond-Landau quantum criticality
Authors: Menghan Song, Ting-Tung Wang, Liuke Lyu, William Witczak-Krempa, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Quantum critical points beyond the Landau paradigm exhibit fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Here, we use entanglement microscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions and subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the entanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and unconventional XY$^*$, and Néel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy configurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of three-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions. Similar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this multipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge theories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in beyond-Landau quantum critical theories.

Title: Density-Functional Tight Binding Meets Maxwell: Unraveling the Mysteries of (Strong) Light-Matter Coupling Efficiently
Authors: Dominik Sidler, Carlos M. Bustamante, Franco P. Bonafe, Michael Ruggenthaler, Maxim Sukharev, Angel Rubio
Abstract: Controlling chemical and material properties through strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities has gained considerable attention over the past decade. However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood, and a significant gap persists between experimental observations and theoretical descriptions. This challenge arises from the intrinsically multi-scale nature of the problem, where non-perturbative feedback occurs across different spatial and temporal scales. Collective coupling between a macroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as Fabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of individual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect the macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient computational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB) with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations (DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both the cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble. We demonstrate the potential for this method by tackling several open questions. First, we calculate non-perturbatively two-dimensional spectroscopic observable that directly connect to well-established experimental protocols. Second, we provide local, molecule-resolved information within collectively coupled ensembles, which is difficult to obtain experimentally. Third, we show how cavity designs can be optimized to target specific microscopic applications. Finally, we outline future directions to enhance the predictive power of this framework, including extension to finite temperature, condensed phases, and correlated quantum effects.

Title: A Symmetry-Integrated Approach to Surface Code Decoding
Authors: Hoshitaro Ohnishi, Hideo Mukai
Abstract: Quantum error correction, which utilizes logical qubits that are encoded as redundant multiple physical qubits to find and correct errors in physical qubits, is indispensable for practical quantum computing. Surface code is considered to be a promising encoding method with a high error threshold that is defined by stabilizer generators. However, previous methods have suffered from the problem that the decoder acquires solely the error probability distribution because of the non-uniqueness of correct prediction obtained from the input. To circumvent this problem, we propose a technique to reoptimize the decoder model by approximating syndrome measurements with a continuous function that is mathematically interpolated by neural network. We evaluated the improvement in accuracy of a multilayer perceptron based decoder for code distances of 5 and 7 as well as for decoders based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks and transformers for a code distance of 5. In all cases, the reoptimized decoder gave better accuracy than the original models, demonstrating the universal effectiveness of the proposed method that is independent of code distance or network architecture. These results suggest that re-framing the problem of surface code decoding into a regression problem that can be tackled by deep learning is a useful strategy.

Title: Coarse-Grained BCFT Tensor Networks and Holographic Reflected Entropy in 3D Gravity
Authors: Ning Bao, Jinwei Chu, Yikun Jiang, Jacob March
Abstract: We use the framework of $\textit{BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.

Title: Low-Frequency Scattering of TE and TM Waves by an Inhomogeneous Medium with Planar Symmetry
Authors: Farhang Loran, Ali Mostafazadeh
Abstract: Stationary scattering of TE and TM waves propagating in an isotropic medium with planar symmetry is described by Bergmann's equation in one dimension. This is a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer matrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency scattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the scattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the construction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose time-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct the low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and transmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of Brewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive analytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of this method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when the carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary conditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space. Because acoustic waves propagating in a compressible fluid with planar symmetry are also described by Bergmann's equation, our results apply to the low-frequency scattering of these waves.

Title: Noncontact friction in ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators near dielectric materials
Authors: Amirali Arabmoheghi, Alessio Zicoschi, Guillermo Arregui, Mohammad J. Bereyhi, Yi Xia, Nils J. Engelsen, Tobias J. Kippenberg
Abstract: Micro- and nanomechanical resonators are emerging as promising platforms for quantum technologies, precision sensors and fundamental science experiments. To utilize these devices for force sensing or quantum optomechanics, they must be brought in close proximity with other systems for functionalization or efficient readout. Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in nanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has led to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties. The mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and nanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature, setting their force sensitivities below 1 $\mathrm{aN}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, surpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs). Given this new regime of sensitivity, an intriguing question is whether the proximity of other materials hinders mechanical coherence. Here we show: it does. We report a novel dissipation mechanism that occurs in ultracoherent nanomechanical oscillators caused by the presence of nearby dielectrics. By studying the parameter scaling of the effect, we show that the mechanism is more severe for low-frequency mechanical modes and that it is due to dielectric loss within the materials caused by the motion of a resonator which carries static charges. Our observations are consistent with the noncontact friction (NCF) observed in AFMs. Our findings provide insights into limitations on the integration of ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators and highlight the adverse effects of charged defects in these systems.

Title: Towards a category-theoretic foundation of Classical and Quantum Information Geometry
Authors: Florio M. Ciaglia, Fabio Di Cosmo, Laura González-Bravo
Abstract: We introduce the category $\mathsf{NCP}$, whose objects are pairs of W$^\ast$-algebras and normal states and whose morphisms are state-preserving unital completely positive (CPU) maps, as a common stage for classical and quantum information geometry, and we formulate two results that will appear in forthcoming works. First, we recast the problem of classifying admissible Riemannian geometries on classical and quantum statistical models in terms of functors $\mathfrak{C}:\mathsf{NCP}\to\mathsf{Hilb}$.These functors provide a generalization of classical statistical covariance, and we call them fields of covariances. A prominent example being the so-called GNS functor arising from the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction. The classification of fields of covariances on $\mathsf{NCP}$ entails both Čencov's uniqueness of the Fisher-Rao metric tensor and Petz's classification of monotone quantum metric tensors as particular cases. Then, we show how classical and quantum statistical models can be realized as subcategories of $\mathsf{NCP}$ in a way that takes into account symmetries. In this setting, the fields of covariances determine Riemannian metric tensors on the model that reduce to the Fisher-Rao, Fubini-Study, and Bures-Helstrom metric tensor in particular cases.

Title: Witt Groups and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence for Stabilizer States
Authors: Błażej Ruba, Bowen Yang
Abstract: We establish a bulk--boundary correspondence for translation-invariant stabilizer states in arbitrary spatial dimension, formulated in the framework of modules over Laurent polynomial rings. To each stabilizer state restricted to half-space geometry we associate a boundary operator module. Boundary operator modules provide examples of quasi-symplectic modules, which are objects of independent mathematical interest. In their study, we use ideas from algebraic L-theory in a setting involving non-projective modules and non-unimodular forms. Our results about quasi-symplectic modules in one spatial dimension allow us to resolve the conjecture that every stabilizer state in two dimensions is characterized by a corresponding abelian anyon model with gappable boundary. Our techniques are also applicable beyond two dimensions, such as in the study of fractons.

Title: A linear-time algorithm for Chow decompositions
Authors: Alexander Taveira Blomenhofer, Benjamin Lovitz
Abstract: We propose a linear-time algorithm to compute low-rank Chow decompositions. Our algorithm can decompose concise symmetric 3-tensors in n variables of Chow rank n/3. The algorithm is pencil based, hence it relies on generalized eigenvalue computations. We also develop sub-quadratic time algorithms for higher order Chow decompositions, and Chow decompositions of 3-tensors into products of linear forms which do not lie on the generic orbit. In particular, we obtain a sub-quadratic-time algorithm for decomposing a symmetric 3-tensor into a linear combination of W-tensors.

Title: Schwinger-Keldysh non-perturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models
Authors: Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Federico Garcia-Gaitan, David J. Strachan, Petr Plechac, Stephen R. Clark, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for open quantum systems composed of many mutually interacting quantum spins, or any isomorphic systems like qubits and qudits, surrounded by one or more independent bosonic baths. Our framework, based on Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT), can handle arbitrary spin value S, dimensionality of space, and geometry, while being applicable to a large parameter space for system and bath or their coupling. It can probe regimes in which non-Markovian dynamics and nonperturbative effects pose formidable challenges for other state-of-the-art theoretical methods. This is achieved by working with the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, which resums classes of Feynman diagrams of SKFT to an infinite order. Furthermore, such diagrams are generated via an expansion in 1/N, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons we employ to map spin operators onto canonically commuting ones, rather than via conventional expansion in system-bath coupling constant. We carefully benchmark our SKFT+2PI-computed results vs. numerically (quasi)exact ones from tensor network calculations applied to the archetypical spin-boson model where both methodologies are applicable. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of SKFT+2PI to handle a much more complex spin-chain-boson model with multiple baths interacting with each spin where no benchmark from other methods is available at present. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by the SKFT+2PI framework with an increasing number of spins and time steps makes it a promising route for simulating driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing, quantum magnonics, and quantum spintronics.

Title: Composable Continuous-Variable Multi-User QKD with Discrete Modulation: Theory and Implementation
Authors: Florian Kanitschar, Adnan A. E. Hajomer, Michael Hentschel, Tobias Gehring, Christoph Pacher
Abstract: Establishing scalable, secure quantum networks requires advancing beyond conventional point-to-point quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols toward point-to-multipoint QKD protocols. Here, we generalize a well-established discrete-modulated continuous-variable (CV) QKD protocol from the point-to-point to the point-to-multipoint setting. We present a comprehensive security analysis across four trust scenarios and derive secret key rates for both loss-only and noisy channels, in the asymptotic and composable finite-size regimes. Experimentally, we validate the protocol in a passive optical network with 10 km access links, achieving a composable secure key rate of $2.185 \times 10^{-3}$ bits per symbol (0.273 Mbit/s) against independent and identically distributed collective attacks. Our results demonstrate that discrete-modulated CV-QKD can support access networks with multiple users while relying solely on cost-efficient, off-the-shelf telecommunication components, paving the way toward practical, scalable, and secure quantum networks.

Title: Cloning Games, Black Holes and Cryptography
Authors: Alexander Poremba, Seyoon Ragavan, Vinod Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new toolkit for analyzing cloning games, a notion that captures stronger and more quantitative versions of the celebrated quantum no-cloning theorem. This framework allows us to analyze a new cloning game based on binary phase states. Our results provide evidence that these games may be able to overcome important limitations of previous candidates based on BB84 states and subspace coset states: in a model where the adversaries are restricted to making a single oracle query, we show that the binary phase variant is $t$-copy secure when $t=o(n/\log n)$. Moreover, for constant $t$, we obtain the first optimal bounds of $O(2^{-n})$, asymptotically matching the value attained by a trivial adversarial strategy. We also show a worst-case to average-case reduction which allows us to show the same quantitative results for the new and natural notion of Haar cloning games. Our analytic toolkit, which we believe will find further applications, is based on binary subtypes and uses novel bounds on the operator norms of block-wise tensor products of matrices. To illustrate the effectiveness of these new techniques, we present two applications: first, in black-hole physics, where our asymptotically optimal bound offers quantitative insights into information scrambling in idealized models of black holes; and second, in unclonable cryptography, where we (a) construct succinct unclonable encryption schemes from the existence of pseudorandom unitaries, and (b) propose and provide evidence for the security of multi-copy unclonable encryption schemes.

Title: Quantum geometric tensor determines the i.i.d. conversion rate in the resource theory of asymmetry for any compact Lie group
Authors: Koji Yamaguchi, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Tomohiro Shitara, Hiroyasu Tajima
Abstract: Quantifying physical concepts in terms of the ultimate performance of a given task has been central to theoretical progress, as illustrated by thermodynamic entropy and entanglement entropy, which respectively quantify irreversibility and quantum correlations. Symmetry breaking is equally universal, yet lacks such an operational quantification. While an operational characterization of symmetry breaking through asymptotic state-conversion efficiency is a central goal of the resource theory of asymmetry (RTA), such a characterization has so far been completed only for the $U(1)$ group among continuous symmetries. Here, we identify the complete measure of symmetry breaking for a general continuous symmetry described by any compact Lie group. Specifically, we show that the asymptotic conversion rate between many copies of pure states in RTA is determined by the quantum geometric tensor, thereby establishing it as the complete measure of symmetry breaking. As an immediate consequence of our conversion rate formula, we also resolve the Marvian-Spekkens conjecture on conditions for reversible conversion in RTA, which has remained unproven for over a decade. By applying our analysis to a standard setup in quantum thermodynamics, we show that asymptotic state conversion under thermal operations generally requires macroscopic coherence in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Information upper bounds in composite quantum systems
Authors: Zhaoyang Dong, Yuexian Hou, Chenguang Zhang, Yingjie Gao, Dawei Song
Abstract: The intrinsic information of quantum systems refers to the information required to define a quantum state, and may reveal how the nature stores and processes microscopic information. However, there is an evident paradox due to the "\textit{information scale contrast}": Existing analytical results on the information bounds of quantum systems show that the information-carrying capacity of an $n$-qubit system is only $O(n)$. Nonetheless, the intrinsic information content (estimated by, e.g., the number of parameters or the complexity of ontic embedding) indicates that defining an $n$-qubit system often requires information of the order $O(2^n)$. In this paper, we aim to clarify the upper bound of intrinsic information in quantum systems, as well as explain and resolve the aforementioned paradox. Starting with an analysis of the dependence between the Bloch parameters, we take the structural constraints of the quantum state space as a prior and derive the posterior information content of a quantum state through the process of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation. We analytically prove that the upper bound of the posterior information content of a 2-qubit system is exactly equal to 2. Furthermore, we conjecturally generalized this result to $n$-qubit systems via a convex optimization process and numerical experiments. In summary, our main theoretical observation is that the tight structural constraints among the parameters of a quantum state make them highly interdependent, and thus unable to freely encode information. It turns out that the intrinsic information of an $n$-qubit system defined by posterior information is bounded by $n$ classical bits.

Title: Quantum thermodynamic advantage in work extraction from steerable quantum correlations
Authors: Tanmoy Biswas, Chandan Datta, Luis Pedro García-Pintos
Abstract: Inspired by the primary goal of quantum thermodynamics -- to characterize quantum signatures and leverage their benefits in thermodynamic scenarios -- , we design a work extraction game within a bipartite framework that exhibits a quantum thermodynamic advantage. The steerability of quantum correlations between the two parties is the key resource enabling such an advantage. In designing the game, we exploit the correspondence between steerability and the incompatibility of observables. Our work extraction protocol involves mutually unbiased bases, which exhibit maximum incompatibility and therefore maximum steerability, showcased in maximally entangled quantum states. We derive upper bounds on the extractable work for unsteerable and steerable correlations and devise a protocol that saturates the latter. The ratio between the extractable work in steerable and unsteerable scenarios, which encapsulates the quantum advantage, increases with the dimension of the underlying system (sometimes referred to as an unbounded advantage). This proves a quantum thermodynamic advantage arising from steerable quantum correlations.

Title: Measurement-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect
Authors: Giuseppe Di Giulio, Xhek Turkeshi, Sara Murciano
Abstract: Monitoring a quantum system can profoundly alter its dynamical properties, leading to nontrivial emergent phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate that dynamical measurements strongly influence the evolution of symmetry in many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that monitored systems governed by non-Hermitian dynamics exhibit a quantum Mpemba effect, where systems with stronger initial asymmetry relax faster to a symmetric state. Crucially, this phenomenon is purely measurement-induced: in the absence of measurements, we find states where the corresponding unitary evolution does not display any Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we uncover a novel measurement-induced symmetry restoration mechanism: below a critical measurement rate, the symmetry remains broken, but beyond a threshold, it is fully restored in the thermodynamic limit--along with the emergence of the quantum Mpemba effect.

Title: On the Random Schrödinger Equation and Geometric Quantum Control
Authors: Rufus Lawrence, Aleš Wodecki, Johannes Aspman, Llorenç Balada Gaggioli, Jakub Mareček
Abstract: We introduce the random Schrödinger equation, with a noise term given by a random Hermitian matrix as a means to model noisy quantum systems. We derive bounds on the error of the synthesised unitary in terms of bounds on the norm of the noise, and show that for certain noise processes these bounds are tight. We then show that in certain situations, minimising the error is equivalent to finding a geodesic on SU (n) with respect to a Riemannian metric encoding the coupling between the control pulse and the noise process. Our work thus extends the series of seminal papers by Nielsen et al. on the geometry of quantum gate complexity.

Title: Distributed quantum algorithm for divergence estimation and beyond
Authors: Honglin Chen, Wei Xie, Yingqi Yu, Hao Fu, Xiang-Yang Li
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of quantum information technology, designing efficient distributed quantum algorithms to perform various information processing tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we consider a distributed scenario where two parties, Alice and Bob, given access to matrices $A$ and $B$ respectively, aim to estimate ${\rm Tr}(f(A)g(B))$, where $f$ and $g$ are known functions. In this task, only local quantum operations, classical communication and single-qubit measurements are allowed due to the high cost of quantum communication and entangled measurements. We propose a distributed quantum algorithm framework to compute ${\rm Tr}(f(A)g(B))$ within an additive error $\varepsilon$. The proposed algorithm framework requires $\widetilde{O}\left(d^2 / (\delta \varepsilon^2)\right)$ quantum queries and two-qubit gates, assuming that the minimum singular value of each matrix $A, B \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ is at least $\delta$. Additionally, our algorithm framework uses a simple Hadamard test architecture, enabling easier quantum hardware implementation. This algorithm framework allows for various applications including quantum divergence estimation, distributed solving of linear system, and distributed Hamiltonian simulation, while preserving the privacy of both parties. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\max\left\{1 /\varepsilon^2, \sqrt{dr}/\varepsilon\right\}\right)$ on the query complexity for the task, where $r$ denotes the rank of the input matrices. We believe this framework holds broad applicability across a range of distributed quantum computing tasks.

Title: Quantum Dissipative Continuous Time Crystals
Authors: Felix Russo, Thomas Pohl
Abstract: Continuous time crystals, i.e., nonequilibrium phases with a spontaneously broken continuous time-translational symmetry, have been studied and recently observed in the long-time dynamics of open quantum systems. Here, we investigate a lattice of interacting three-level particles and find two distinct time-crystal phases that cannot be described within mean-field theory. Remarkably, one of them emerges only in the presence of correlations, upon accounting for beyond-mean-field effects. Our findings extend explorations of continuous time-translational symmetry breaking in dissipative systems beyond the classical phenomenology of periodic orbits in a low-dimensional nonlinear system. The proposed model applies directly to the laser-driven dynamics of interacting Rydberg states in neutral atom arrays and suggests that the predicted time-crystal phases are observable in such experiments.

Title: Adiabatic quantum state preparation in integrable models
Authors: Maximilian Lutz, Lorenzo Piroli, Georgios Styliaris, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: We propose applying the adiabatic algorithm to prepare high-energy eigenstates of integrable models on a quantum computer. We first review the standard adiabatic algorithm to prepare ground states in each magnetization sector of the prototypical XXZ Heisenberg chain. Based on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we show that the algorithm circuit depth is polynomial in the number of qubits $N$, outperforming previous methods explicitly relying on integrability. Next, we propose a protocol to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of integrable models that satisfy certain conditions. For a given target eigenstate, we construct a suitable parent Hamiltonian written in terms of a complete set of local conserved quantities. We propose using such Hamiltonian as an input for an adiabatic algorithm. After benchmarking this construction in the case of the non-interacting XY spin chain, where we can rigorously prove its efficiency, we apply it to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of the Richardson-Gaudin models. In this case, we provide numerical evidence that the circuit depth of our algorithm is polynomial in $N$ for all eigenstates, despite the models being interacting.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents as a revolutionary approach to weather forecasting by using quantum computing to improve predictive modeling capabilities. In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.

Title: Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers
Authors: Erin Sheridan, Michael Senatore, Samuel Schwab, Eric Aspling, Taylor Wagner, James Schneeloch, Stephen McCoy, Daniel Campbell, David Hucul, Zachary Smith, Matthew LaHaye
Abstract: Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.

Title: Quantum Circuit Design for Decoded Quantum Interferometry
Authors: Natchapol Patamawisut, Naphan Benchasattabuse, Michal Hajdušek, Rodney Van Meter
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum algorithm for approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization problems by reducing instances of linear satisfiability to bounded-distance decoding over superpositions of quantum states. A central challenge in realizing DQI is the design of a decoder that operates coherently on quantum superpositions. In this work, we present a concrete quantum circuit implementation of DQI, with a focus on the decoding subroutine. Our design leverages a reversible Gauss-Jordan elimination circuit for the decoding stage. We analyze the circuit's depth and gate complexity and validate its performance through simulations on systems with up to 30 qubits. These results establish a concrete foundation for scalable implementations of DQI and open the door to future algorithmic refinements and hardware-level realizations.

Title: Quantum Gate Decomposition: A Study of Compilation Time vs. Execution Time Trade-offs
Authors: Evandro C. R. Rosa, Jerusa Marchi, Eduardo I. Duzzioni, Rafael de Santiago
Abstract: Similar to classical programming, high-level quantum programming languages generate code that cannot be executed directly by quantum hardware and must be compiled. However, unlike classical code, quantum programs must be compiled before each execution, making the trade-off between compilation time and execution time particularly significant. In this paper, we address the first step of quantum compilation: multi-qubit gate decomposition. We analyze the trade-offs of state-of-the-art decomposition algorithms by implementing them in the Ket quantum programming platform and collecting numerical performance data. This is the first study to both implement and analyze the current state-of-the-art decomposition methods within a single platform. Based on our findings, we propose two compilation profiles: one optimized for minimizing compilation time and another for minimizing quantum execution time. Our results provide valuable insights for both quantum compiler developers and quantum programmers, helping them make informed decisions about gate decomposition strategies and their impact on overall performance.

Title: High-performance local decoders for defect matching in 1D
Authors: Louis Paletta, Anthony Leverrier, Mazyar Mirrahimi, Christophe Vuillot
Abstract: Local decoders, also known as cellular-automaton decoders, offer a promising path toward real-time quantum error correction by replacing centralized classical decoding, with inherent hardware constraints, by a natively parallel and streamlined architecture from a simple local transition rule. We propose two new types of local decoders for the quantum repetition code in one dimension. The signal-rule decoders interpret odd parities between neighboring qubits as defects, attracted to each other via the exchange of classical point-like excitations, represented by a few bits of local memory. We prove the existence of a threshold in the code-capacity model and present numerical evidence of exponential logical error suppression under a phenomenological noise model, with data and measurement errors at each error correction cycle. Compared to previously known local decoders that suffer from sub-optimal threshold and scaling, our construction significantly narrows the gap with global decoders for practical system sizes and error rates. Implementation requirements can be further reduced by eliminating the need for local classical memories, with a new rule defined on two rows of qubits. This shearing-rule works well at relevant system sizes making it an appealing short-term solution. When combined with biased-noise qubits, such as cat qubits, these decoders enable a fully local quantum memory in one dimension.

Title: Quantum Parameter Estimation Uncertainty Relation
Authors: Bing-Shu Hu, Xiao-Ming Lu
Abstract: Quantum multiparameter estimation focuses on the simultaneous inference of multiple parameters in quantum systems through measurement and data processing. Its complexity stems from two key factors: measurement incompatibility and parameter correlation. By strategically manipulating the multidimensional parameter space, we derive an estimation uncertainty relation that quantifies how these factors jointly limit estimation precision in the two-parameter case. This uncertainty relation is tight for pure states and thus completely describes the quantum limit of two-parameter estimation precision in a simple inequality. To intuitively illustrate the impact of the uncertainty relation, we develop an error-ellipse method and demonstrate its utility in phase-space displacement estimation. Our results reveal that a geometric perspective of the parameter space offers a powerful approach for addressing multiparameter estimation challenges.

Title: Optimal quantum simulation of linear non-unitary dynamics
Authors: Guang Hao Low, Rolando D. Somma
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution generated by any bounded, time-dependent operator $-A$ with non-positive logarithmic norm, thereby serving as a natural generalization of the Hamiltonian simulation problem. Our method generalizes the recent Linear-Combination-of-Hamiltonian-Simulation (LCHS) framework. In instances where $A$ is time-independent, we provide a block-encoding of the evolution operator $e^{-At}$ with $\mathcal{O}\big(t\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ queries to the block-encoding oracle for $A$. We also show how the normalized evolved state can be prepared with $\mathcal{O}(1/\|e^{-At}|{\vec{u}_0}\rangle\|)$ queries to the oracle that prepares the normalized initial state $|{\vec{u}_0}\rangle$. These complexities are optimal in all parameters and improve the error scaling over prior results. Furthermore, we show that any improvement of our approach exceeding a constant factor of approximately 3 is infeasible. For general time-dependent operators $A$, we also prove that a uniform trapezoidal rule on our LCHS construction yields exponential convergence, leading to simplified quantum circuits with improved gate complexity compared to prior nonuniform-quadrature methods.

Title: Embezzlement as a "Self-Test" for Infinite Copies of Entangled States
Authors: Li Liu
Abstract: We investigate the operator-algebraic structure underlying entanglement embezzlement, a phenomenon where a fixed entangled state (the catalyst) can be used to generate arbitrary target entangled states without being consumed. We show that the ability to embezzle a target state $g$ imposes strong internal constraints on the catalyst state $f$: specifically, $f$ must contain infinitely many mutually commuting, locally structured copies of $g$. This property is formalized using C*-algebraic tools and is analogous to a form of self-testing, certifying the presence of infinite copies of $g$ within $f$. Using this infinite-copy certification. Our results clarify the structural requirements for embezzlement and provide new conceptual tools for analyzing state certification in infinite-dimensional quantum systems.

Title: Bayesian Greedy Receiver for Pulse Position Modulation without an Error Floor under Thermal Noise
Authors: Leo Bia, Christos N. Gagatsos, Saikat Guha
Abstract: We investigate quantum receiver architectures for demodulation $M$-ary Pulse Position Modulation under thermal noise and photon-starved conditions. Building on the greed receiver framework, we analyze it using jointly optimized displacement-squeezing and the Dolinar receiver. We further introduce a novel slicing Bayesian greedy receiver, which partitions each PPM time slot into multiple optical slices and update the full posterior distribution over codeword hypothesis at each slice using Bayes' rule. Under the presence of noise, our slicing greedy receiver outperforms the standard greedy receiver and appears to avoid a noise floor given sufficient slicing resolution.

Title: Discrete-Time Quantum Random Walk for Epidemiological Modeling
Authors: Sayan Manna, Nikhil Kowshik, Sudebkumar Prasant Pal
Abstract: We introduce a discrete-time quantum random walk (QRW) framework for spatial epidemic modelling on a two-dimensional square lattice and compare its dynamics to classical random-walk SIR models. In our model, each infected site spawns a quantum walker whose coherent evolution (controlled by an amplitude-splitting coin and conditional shifts) can infect visited susceptible sites with probability $p$ and persists for a lifetime of $\tau$ steps. We perform extensive quantum simulations on finite lattices and compute the basic reproduction number $R_0$ across a broad grid of $(p,\tau)$ values. Results show that QRW dynamics interpolate between diffusive and super-diffusive regimes: at low $p$ the QRW reproduces classical-like $R_0$, while at higher $p$ and $\tau$ ballistic propagation and interference produce markedly larger $R_0$ and non-Gaussian spatial profiles. We compare the QRW $R_0$ range to empirical estimates from historical outbreaks and discuss parameter regimes where QRW offers a closer qualitative match than classical diffusion. We conclude that QRWs provide a flexible, conceptually novel toy model for exploring rapid or heavy-tailed epidemic spread.

Title: Measuring the non-Abelian Quantum Phase with the Algorithm of Quantum Phase Estimation
Authors: Seng Ghee Tan, Son-Hsien Chen, Ying-Cheng Yang, Yen-Fu Chen, Yen-Lin Chen, Chia-Hsiu Hsieh
Abstract: We propose an approach to measure the quantum phase of an electron in a non-Abelian system using the algorithm of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The discrete-path systems were previously studied in the context of square or rectangular rings. Present focus is on measuring the quantum phases. The merit of the algorithm approach is two-fold. First off, it eliminates the need for an interferometric set up. Quantum phase is measured by reading off of measurable qubit states of the QPE modules. Secondly, the QPE works by subjecting the quantum state to a sequence of quantum computing operations that eventually map the phase information into measurable qubit states. All the operations are realizable by standard quantum computer gates and algorithms, placing the new effort within the reach of standard quantum computational framework.

Title: Enhancing Optical Imaging via Quantum Computation
Authors: Aleksandr Mokeev, Babak Saif, Mikhail D. Lukin, Johannes Borregaard
Abstract: Extracting information from weak optical signals is a critical challenge across a broad range of technologies. Conventional imaging techniques, constrained to integrating over detected signals and classical post-processing, are limited in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from shot noise accumulation in the post-processing algorithms. We show that these limitations can be circumvented by coherently encoding photonic amplitude information into qubit registers and applying quantum algorithms to process the stored information from asynchronously arriving optical signals. As a specific example, we develop a quantum algorithm for imaging unresolved point sources and apply it to exoplanet detection. We demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance can be achieved under realistic imaging conditions using relatively small scale quantum processors.

Title: Quantum $(r,δ)$-locally recoverable codes
Authors: Carlos Galindo, Fernando Hernando, Helena Martín-Cruz, Ryutaroh Matsumoto
Abstract: Classical $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes are designed for avoiding loss of information in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems. We introduce the quantum counterpart of those codes by defining quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes which are quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting $\delta -1$ qudit erasures from sets of at most $r+ \delta -1$ qudits. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$. When $Q(C)$ comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples attaining the bound are given.

Title: Quantum Circuits for SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Praveen Balaji, Cianán Conefrey-Shinozaki, Patrick Draper, Jason K. Elhaderi, Drishti Gupta, Luis Hidalgo, Andrew Lytle, Enrico Rinaldi
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories in varying dimensions, lattice volumes, and truncations offer a rich family of targets for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum devices. In return, formulating quantum simulations can provide new ways of thinking about the quantum structure of gauge theories. In this work, we consider pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory in two and three spatial dimensions in a streamlined version of the electric basis. We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for NISQ era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multi-controlled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.

Title: Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes
Authors: Hamid Arian Zad, Michal Jaščur, Azam Zoshki, Ralph Kenna, Nerses Ananikian
Abstract: We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.

Title: Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves
Authors: Ning Liu, Guodong Cheng
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram that maps the competitive interplay between the unstable tongues of parametric resonance and the intrinsic Jeans instability. The diagram reveals that increasing the driving frequency compresses the Jeans-unstable region and allows well-separated parametric resonance tongues to dominate, thereby creating a clear regime for observing Faraday waves. Conversely, lowering the driving frequency expands the domain of Jeans instability, which fragments and overwhelms the parametric resonance structures. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal a characteristic transition from parametric-resonance-driven Faraday waves to gravity-dominated Jeans collapse as the Jeans frequency increases.

Title: Spectral distribution of sparse Gaussian Ensembles of Real Asymmetric Matrices
Authors: Ratul Dutta, Pragya Shukla
Abstract: Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g. modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues. Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble. Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.

Title: Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices
Authors: Zhenze Fan, Juan Wang, Yan Li
Abstract: We investigate the formation of novel moiré quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer-atomic interactions. By introducing the density wave amplitude, we divide the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes at each stage. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is closely linked to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moiré quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. The patterns exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting potential applications of this strongly frequency-dependent pattern formation in quantum precision measurement. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.

Title: Positivity bounds from thermal field theory entropy
Authors: Xin-Yi Liu, Yongjun Xu
Abstract: We present an approach to deriving positivity bounds on effective field theories by analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of thermal quantum field systems. Focusing on scalar theories with higher-dimensional operators, we compute the finite-temperature entropy using thermal field theory techniques. We argue that consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles--specifically, the expectation that entropy increases with the introduction of new degrees of freedom--imposes nontrivial constraints on Wilson coefficients. In particular, we show that the coefficient of the leading dimension-8 operator must be strictly positive. This thermodynamic perspective offers an alternative to traditional S-matrix-based derivations of positivity bounds and provides a complementary perspective into the interplay between entropy, unitarity, and causality in quantum field theory.
