Title: Large-Range Tuning and Stabilization of the Optical Transition of Diamond Tin-Vacancy Centers by In-Situ Strain Control
Authors: Julia M. Brevoord, Leonardo G. C. Wienhoven, Nina Codreanu, Tetsuro Ishiguro, Elvis van Leeuwen, Mariagrazia Iuliano, Lorenzo De Santis, Christopher Waas, Hans K. C. Beukers, Tim Turan, Carlos Errando-Herranz, Kenichi Kawaguchi, Ronald Hanson
Abstract: The negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV-) center in diamond has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing and quantum networks. To connect SnV- qubits in large networks, in-situ tuning and stabilization of their optical transitions are essential to overcome static and dynamic frequency offsets induced by the local environment. Here we report on the large-range optical frequency tuning of diamond SnV- centers using micro-electro-mechanically mediated strain control in photonic integrated waveguide devices. We realize a tuning range of >40 GHz, covering a major part of the inhomogeneous distribution. In addition, we employ real-time feedback on the strain environment to stabilize the resonant frequency and mitigate spectral wandering. These results provide a path for on-chip scaling of diamond SnV-based quantum networks.

Title: Generation of entanglement and non-stationary states via competing coherent and incoherent bosonic hopping
Authors: Parvinder Solanki, Albert Cabot, Matteo Brunelli, Federico Carollo, Christoph Bruder, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: Incoherent stochastic processes added to unitary dynamics are typically deemed detrimental since they are expected to diminish quantum features such as superposition and entanglement. Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent non-stationary behavior.

Title: An Overview of CV-MDI-QKD
Authors: Alasdair I. Fletcher, Cillian Harney, Masoud Ghalaii, Panagiotis Papanastasiou, Alexandros Mountogiannakis, Gaetana Spedalieri, Adnan A. E. Hajomer, Tobias Gehring, Stefano Pirandola
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.

Title: General relativistic particle trajectories via quantum mechanical weak values and the Schwarzschild-Alcubierre spacetime
Authors: Joshua Foo, Cameron Bellamy, Timothy C. Ralph
Abstract: We show that the average trajectories of relativistic quantum particles in Schwarzschild spacetime, obtained via quantum mechanical weak measurements of momentum and energy, are equivalent to the predicted flow lines of probability current in curved spacetime quantum theory. We subsequently demonstrate that these trajectories correspond exactly to classical null geodesics in a hybrid Schwarzschild-Alcubierre spacetime. This threefold equivalence demonstrates how quantum theory in curved spacetime can be formulated via operationally-defined measurements, and that such a theory may be interpreted deterministically, in the spirit of hidden-variable models such as Bohmian mechanics, through the novel connection to an underlying "guiding metric."

Title: Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cage in Bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems
Authors: Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu
Abstract: The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectrum in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various type of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.

Title: Quantifying the Upper Limit of Backflash Attack in Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Jialei Su, Junxuan Liu, Zihao Chen, Mingyang Zhong, Qingquan Peng, Jiangfang Ding, Yijun Wang, Anqi Huang, Ying Guo
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) theoretically provides information-theoretic security based on physical laws. However, imperfections in practice lead to the possibility of quantum hacking on the QKD implementation, especially the passive attacks that are difficult to be detected. In this paper, we study experimentally and theoretically the upper limit of a backflash attack, as one of the vital passive attacks, on a fiber-based QKD system. We experimentally demonstrate the backflash attack on a full equipped fiber-based QKD receiver to show its feasibility and limited distinguish ratio of decoding. More importantly, we have developed a simulation model to analyze the maximum distinguish ratio of decoding can be achieved considering the wide-spectrum feature of backflash photons, which indicates that Eve can extract effective key information from 95.7% of the backflash photons. Consequently, the secure key rate of the decoy-state BB84 QKD system under backflash attack is calculated. This work provides a general methodology to comprehensively evaluate the effect of the backflash attack on a QKD system.

Title: Gaussian basis set approach to one-loop self-energy
Authors: DÃ¡vid Ferenc, Maen Salman, Trond Saue
Abstract: We report a method for the evaluation of the one-loop self-energy, to all orders in the external binding field, using a Gaussian basis set expansion. This choice of basis is motivated by its widespread use in molecular calculations. For a one-electron atom, our results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the exact Dirac--Coulomb wave functions. The developed method can be of interest for high-precision studies of heavy few-electron molecular systems, where the rigorous computation of QED corrections is currently a formidable task.

Title: Double descent in quantum machine learning
Authors: Marie Kempkes, Aroosa Ijaz, Elies Gil-Fuster, Carlos Bravo-Prieto, Jakob Spiegelberg, Evert van Nieuwenburg, Vedran Dunjko
Abstract: The double descent phenomenon challenges traditional statistical learning theory by revealing scenarios where larger models do not necessarily lead to reduced performance on unseen data. While this counterintuitive behavior has been observed in a variety of classical machine learning models, particularly modern neural network architectures, it remains elusive within the context of quantum machine learning. In this work, we analytically demonstrate that quantum learning models can exhibit double descent behavior by drawing on insights from linear regression and random matrix theory. Additionally, our numerical experiments on quantum kernel methods across different real-world datasets and system sizes further confirm the existence of a test error peak, a characteristic feature of double descent. Our findings provide evidence that quantum models can operate in the modern, overparameterized regime without experiencing overfitting, thereby opening pathways to improved learning performance beyond traditional statistical learning theory.

Title: Efficient Simulation of Quantum Secure Multiparty Computation
Authors: Kartick Sutradhar
Abstract: One of the key characteristics of secure quantum communication is quantum secure multiparty computation. In this paper, we propose a quantum secure multiparty summation (QSMS) protocol that can be applied to many complex quantum operations. It is based on the $(t, n)$ threshold approach. We combine the classical and quantum phenomena to make this protocol realistic and secure. Because the current protocols employ the $(n, n)$ threshold approach, which requires all honest players to execute the quantum multiparty summation protocol, they have certain security and efficiency problems. However, we employ a $(t, n)$ threshold approach, which requires the quantum summation protocol to be computed only by $t$ honest players. Our suggested protocol is more economical, practical, and secure than alternative protocols.

Title: Quantum Advantage in Private Multiple Hypothesis Testing
Authors: Seung-Hyun Nam, Hyun-Young Park, Joonwoo Bae, Si-Hyeon Lee
Abstract: For multiple hypothesis testing based on classical data samples, we demonstrate a quantum advantage in the optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT), where the privacy and utility measures are set to (quantum) local differential privacy and the pairwise-minimum Chernoff information, respectively. To show the quantum advantage, we consider some class of hypotheses that we coin smoothed point masses. For such hypotheses, we derive an upper bound of the optimal PUT achieved by classical mechanisms, which is tight for some cases, and propose a certain quantum mechanism which achieves a better PUT than the upper bound. The proposed quantum mechanism consists of a classical-quantum channel whose outputs are pure states corresponding to a symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM), and a depolarizing channel.

Title: Invariant Theory and Magic State Distillation
Authors: Amolak Ratan Kalra, Shiroman Prakash
Abstract: We show that the performance of a linear self-orthogonal $GF(4)$ code for magic state distillation of Bravyi and Kitaev's $|T\rangle$-state is characterized by its simple weight enumerator. We compute weight enumerators of all such codes with less than 20 qubits and find none whose threshold exceeds that of the 5-qubit code. Using constraints on weight enumerators from invariant theory and linear programming, we obtain bounds on the exponent characterizing noise suppression of a $|T\rangle$-state distillation protocol. We also obtain new non-negativity constraints on such weight enumerators by demanding consistency of the associated magic state distillation routine. These ``quantum constraints'' lead to new bounds on the distance of classical self-dual and maximal self-orthogonal linear $GF(4)$ codes, in particular, implying the nonexistence of a self-dual $[12m, 6m, 2m+4]_{GF(4)}$ linear code.

Title: Light-based Chromatic Aberration Correction of Ultrafast Electron Microscopes
Authors: Marius Constantin Chirita Mihaila, Neli LaÅ¡toviÄkovÃ¡ Streshkova, Martin KozÃ¡k
Abstract: We propose and theoretically demonstrate a technique that allows one to compensate for chromatic aberrations of traditional electron lenses in ultrafast electron microscopes. The technique is based on space- and time-dependent phase modulation of a pulsed electron beam using interaction with a shaped pulsed ponderomotive lens. The energy-selective focal distance is reached by combining the electron temporal chirp with the time-dependent size of the effective potential, with which the electrons interact. As a result, chromatic aberration can be reduced by up to a factor of seven. This approach paves the way for advanced transverse and longitudinal wavefront shaping of electrons in free space.

Title: Continuous variable measurement-device-independent quantum certification

Abstract: Secure and reliable certification of quantum resources is a fundamental challenge in the advancement of next-generation quantum technologies, particularly as devices become more complex and integrated into practical applications, where parts of the system may be untrusted or inaccessible by users. Addressing this challenge requires certification methods that rely on minimal assumptions and limited trust while still faithfully and reliably verifying the quantum resources in question. For infinite-dimensional bosonic systems, existing certification methods rely on fully trusted and well calibrated measurement systems, leaving significant security vulnerabilities open. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of measurement-device-independent (MDI) certification schemes for infinite-dimensional bosonic systems, where the certification process is conducted using entirely untrusted measurement devices and assuming only the trusted preparation of coherent states. Specifically, we implement schemes for the MDI certification of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement and the operation of an elementary optical CV quantum memory. We leverage techniques of Bayesian metrology and exploit the practicality and accessibility of Gaussian quantum optics to achieve secure and efficient certification. These results demonstrate the potential of the MDI framework to enhance trust in quantum technologies with applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.

Title: End-to-end compilable implementation of quantum elliptic curve logarithm in Qrisp
Authors: Diego Polimeni, Raphael Seidel
Abstract: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a widely established cryptographic technique, recognized for its effectiveness and reliability across a broad range of applications such as securing telecommunications or safeguarding cryptocurrency wallets. Although being more robust than RSA, ECC is, nevertheless, also threatened by attacks based on Shor's algorithm, which made it a popular field of study in quantum information science. A variety of techniques have been proposed to perform EC arithmetic in quantum devices; however, software support for compiling these algorithms into executables is extremely limited. Within this work, we leverage the Qrisp programming language to realize one of the first fully compilable implementations of EC arithmetic and verify its correctness using Qrisp's built-in sparse matrix simulator.

Title: Resource-Efficient Compilation of Distributed Quantum Circuits for Solving Large-Scale Wireless Communication Network Problems
Authors: Kuan-Cheng Chen, Felix Burt, Shang Yu, Chen-Yu Liu, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Kin K. Leung
Abstract: Optimizing routing in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is pivotal for minimizing energy consumption and extending network lifetime. This paper introduces a resourceefficient compilation method for distributed quantum circuits tailored to address large-scale WSN routing problems. Leveraging a hybrid classical-quantum framework, we employ spectral clustering for network partitioning and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for optimizing routing within manageable subgraphs. We formulate the routing problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, providing comprehensive mathematical formulations and complexity analyses. Comparative evaluations against traditional classical algorithms demonstrate significant energy savings and enhanced scalability. Our approach underscores the potential of integrating quantum computing techniques into wireless communication networks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future network optimization challenges

Title: Optimal multicore quantum computing with few interconnects
Authors: J. Montes, F. Borondo, Gabriel G. Carlo
Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors have produced a quantum computation revolution in recent times. However, to make further advances new strategies to overcome the error rate growth are needed. One possible way out is dividing these devices into many cores. On the other hand, the majorization criterion efficiently classifies quantum circuits in terms of their complexity, which can be directly related to their ability of performing non classically simulatable computations. In this paper, we use this criterion to study the complexity behavior of a paradigmatic universal family of random circuits distributed into several cores with different architectures. We find that the optimal complexity is reached with few interconnects, this giving further hope to actual implementations in nowadays available devices. A universal behavior is found irrespective of the architecture and (approximately) of the core size. We also analyze the complexity properties when scaling processors up by means of adding cores of the same size. We provide a conjecture to explain the results.

Title: Dynamic Routing in Space-Ground Integrated Quantum Networks
Authors: Tianjie Hu, Jindi Wu, Qun Li
Abstract: Quantum networks emerge as fundamental frameworks for addressing various large-scale problems. There are two primary architectures: space-based quantum networks, which deploy satellites with free space channels to interconnect users, and ground-based quantum networks, which utilize optical fibers to interconnect users. In this paper, we explore space-ground integrated quantum networks that incorporate both satellites and optical fibers into the infrastructure. This integrated network features three forms of communication: using only free space links, only ground links, or a hybrid usage of free space and ground links. We formulate the routing problem in space-ground integrated quantum networks as an integer programming and propose two solutions: using a linear relaxation and a greedy algorithm. The linear relaxation algorithm allows timely scheduling of additional entanglement purification, whereas the greedy algorithm enables quick scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate their effective balancing between network throughput and communication fidelity.

Title: Genuine Multipartite Nonlocality sharing under sequential measurement
Authors: Sk Sahadat Hossain, Indrani Chattopadhyay
Abstract: The study of quantum nonlocality sharing has garnered significant attention, particularly for two-qubit and three-qubit entangled systems. In this paper, we extend the investigation to $n$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) systems, analyzing nonlocality sharing under unbiased unsharp measurements. Employing the Seevink and Svetlichny inequalities, we explore both unilateral and multilateral sequential measurement scenarios. In the unilateral scenario, we derive the range for which an observer's multiple copies can share genuine $n$-partite nonlocality with single copies of the remaining parties. In the multilateral scenario, we identify the maximum number of independent observers on $m$ sides who can share genuine $n$-partite nonlocality with other parties. A crucial aspect of our results is that all findings stem from a measurement strategy where each sequential observer utilizes unbiased unsharp measurements. As a specific case, for the four-qubit maximally entangled GHZ state, we demonstrate that at most two copies of an observer (e.g., Alice) can share nonlocality in the unilateral sequential measurement scenario. However, in the multilateral scenario, no additional sharing is possible compared to the unilateral case. This finding highlights the significance of unsharp measurements in optimizing the recycling of qubits for generating quantum nonlocality.

Title: Finite-size security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution with imperfect heterodyne measurement
Authors: Adnan A.E. Hajomer, Akash Nag Oruganti, Ivan Derkach, Ulrik L Andersen, Vladyslav C Usenko, Tobias Gehring
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) using coherent states and heterodyne detection enables secure quantum communication based on technology that has large similarities to coherent optical telecommunication. Yet, practical implementations of coherent receivers used in both technologies encounter device imperfections, which for CVQKD are often not addressed in security proofs. Here, we present a theoretical framework that rigorously accounts for imperfect heterodyne measurements arising from phase imbalances in the coherent (heterodyne) receiver. Focusing on collective attacks, we establish a finite-size security proof that reveals how measurement imperfections limit the distance over which a positive key rate is achievable. To mitigate these effects, we propose a local transformation during classical post-processing. We validate our approach experimentally on a CVQKD system with an imperfect coherent receiver, underscoring its potential for scalable, cost-effective CVQKD with photonic integrated receivers in which phase-imbalances naturally appear through manufacturing tolerances.

Title: Low-overhead Magic State Circuits with Transversal CNOTs
Authors: Nicholas Fazio, Mark Webster, Zhenyu Cai
Abstract: With the successful demonstration of transversal CNOTs in many recent experiments, it is the right moment to examine its implications on one of the most critical parts of fault-tolerant computation -- magic state preparation. Using an algorithm that can recompile and simplify a circuit of consecutive multi-qubit phase rotations, we manage to construct fault-tolerant circuits for CCZ, CS and T states with minimal T-depth and also much lower CNOT depths and qubit counts than before. These circuits can play crucial roles in fault-tolerant computation with transversal CNOTs, and we hope that the algorithms and methods developed in this paper can be used to further simplify other protocols in similar contexts.

Title: Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of generalized Hubbard models
Authors: Andreas Juul Bay-Smidt, Frederik Ravn Klausen, Christoph SÃ¼nderhauf, RÃ³bert IzsÃ¡k, Gemma C. Solomon, Nick S. Blunt
Abstract: Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which allows simulation of Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and provides a framework that enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model and the PPP model. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate Hubbard models on hexagonal lattice fragments and periodic hexagonal lattices, analyze gate costs, and provide commutator bounds for evaluating Trotter errors, including new commutator bounds for the extended Hubbard model. We compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, which we optimize for the hexagonal lattice Hubbard model, and demonstrate that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.

Title: Quantum locally recoverable code with intersecting recovery sets
Authors: Kaifeng Bu, Weichen Gu, Xiang Li
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum locally recoverable codes (qLRCs) with intersecting recovery sets. We derive a singleton-like bound for these codes by leveraging the additional information provided by the intersecting recovery sets. Furthermore, we provide a construction for qLRCs with intersecting recovery sets by introducing a variation of the hypergraph product. Finally, we apply our qLRC methods to obtain improved results for classical LRCs. These results may provide new insights into the locality of quantum error correction code.

Title: A relativistic continuous matrix product state study of field theories with defects
Authors: Karan Tiwana, Edoardo Lauria, Antoine Tilloy
Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.

Title: Observation of single-photon azimuthal backflow with weak measurement
Authors: Zhen-Fei Zhang, Peng-Fei Huang, Shan-Chuan Dong, Yan-Xin Rong, Jin-Shi Xu, Yong-Jian Gu, Ya Xiao
Abstract: Quantum backflow, a counterintuitive interference phenomenon where particles with positive momentum can propagate backward, is important in applications involving light-matter interactions. To date, experimental demonstrations of backflow have been restricted to classical optical systems, where momentum is measured using the slit scanning technique or the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor technique. However, these techniques have low spatial resolution due to limitations in slit width and Fourier transform lenslet array density. Here, by adopting the technique of weak measurement, we report an observation of azimuthal backflow both theoretically and experimentally. Our results show that a heralded single photon, prepared in specific superposition states with solely negative orbital angular momentum (OAM), exhibits positive OAM. The effects of mode ratio, propagation distance and OAM index on the azimuthal backflow are systematically investigated. Our method avoids using slits and lenslet arrays, allowing for the accurate extraction of photon momentum at each pixel. This work provides new insights and techniques for observing and manipulating backflow in quantum systems.

Title: Determination of Land\'{e} $g_J$ factor and Zeeman coefficients in ground-state $^{171}$Yb$^+$ and their applications to quantum frequency standards
Authors: Jize Han, Benquan Lu, Yanmei Yu, Jiguang Li, Zhiguo Huang, Jingwei Wen, Ling Qian, Lijun Wang
Abstract: We report the determination of the LandÃ© $g_J$ factor and Zeeman coefficients for the ground-state of $^{171}$Yb$^+$, relevant to microwave quantum frequency standards (QFSs). The $g_J$ factor is obtained by using two independent methods: multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and multireference configuration interaction, yielding a consistent value of 2.002615(70). The first- and second-order Zeeman coefficients are determined as 14,010.78(49) Hz/$\mu$T and 31.0869(22) mHz/$\mu$T$^2$, respectively, based on the calculated $g_J$ factor. These coefficients enable reduced magnetic-field-induced uncertainties, improving the accuracy of the $^{171}$Yb$^+$ microwave QFSs. The results reported in this work also offer potential for improved constraints on variations in fundamental constants through frequency comparisons, and advancing trapped-ion quantum computers based on the ground-state hyperfine splitting of $^{171}$Yb$^+$.

Title: Quantum tomography from the evolution of a single expectation
Authors: Hjalmar Rall, Michael M. Wolf
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of performing full quantum tomography based on the homogeneous time evolution of a single expectation value. For example, we find that every non-trivial binary measurement evolved by any quantum channel, except for a null set, in principle enables full quantum state tomography. While this remains true when restricted to Lindblad semigroups, we show that beyond the qubit case unitary evolution is never sufficient - so the presence of noise is essential. We prove an analog of Takens' embedding theorem for quantum channels, which extends our findings to cases where prior information is available, and we provide estimation bounds for finite statistics.

Authors: Giselle A. Elbaz, Pierre-Louis Julliard, MikaÃ«l CassÃ©, Heimanu Niebojewski, Benoit Bertrand, GrÃ©goire Roussely, Valentin Labracherie, Maud Vinet, Tristan Meunier, Bruna Cardoso Paz
Abstract: Different groups worldwide have been working with the GlobalFoundries 22nm platform (22FDX) with the hopes of industrializing the fabrication of Si spin qubits. To guide this effort, we have performed a systematic study of six of the foundry's processes of reference (POR). Using effective mobility as a figure of merit, we study the impact of gate stack, channel type and back bias as a function of temperature. This screening process selected qubit devices that allowed us to couple quantum dots along both the length and width of the Si channel. We present stability diagrams with clear and regular honeycomb patterns, where spurious elements such as dopants are not observed. By combining these results with room and low temperature simulations, we provide insights into potential technology optimizations and show both the utility of qubit pre-screening protocols as well as the advantages of leveraging forward body bias within an FDSOI (Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator) qubit platform.

Title: Implementing Finite Impulse Response Filters on Quantum Computers
Authors: Aishwarya Majumdar, Bojko N. Bakalov, Dror Baron, Yuan Liu
Abstract: While signal processing is a mature area, its connections with quantum computing have received less attention. In this work, we propose approaches that perform classical discrete-time signal processing using quantum systems. Our approaches encode the classical discrete-time input signal into quantum states, and design unitaries to realize classical concepts of finite impulse response (FIR) filters. We also develop strategies to cascade lower-order filters to realize higher-order filters through designing appropriate unitary operators. Finally, a few directions for processing quantum states on classical systems after converting them to classical signals are suggested for future work.

Title: Exploring Unique Characteristics in Stark Many-Body Localization
Authors: Chung Po Ching, Xiao Li
Abstract: Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.

Title: Intense Laser-Driven Phenomena In Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Amar Bharti
Abstract: Condensed-matter provides attractive platforms to realize exotic particles, originally proposed in high-energy physics. Weyl semimetal (WSM) is a material in which low-energy collective excitations are governed by massless Weyl fermions, which appear in pairs of opposite chirality and are topologically protected. Thus, the discovery of topological materials such as WSM has heralded a new era in contemporary physics. Moreover, these materials offer exciting opportunities in next-generation signal processing and optoelectronics. This thesis explores different facets of the intense laser-driven phenomena in WSM for applications in emerging lightwave-driven Petahertz electronics and quantum technologies.

Title: Photonic chiral state transfer near the Liouvillian exceptional point
Authors: Huixia Gao, Konghao Sun, Dengke Qu, Kunkun Wang, Lei Xiao, Wei Yi, Peng Xue
Abstract: As branch-point singularities of non-Hermitian matrices, the exceptional points (EPs) exhibit unique spectral topology and criticality, with intriguing dynamic consequences in non-Hermitian settings. In open quantum systems, EPs also emerge in the Liouvillian spectrum, but their dynamic impact often pertains to the transient dynamics and is challenging to demonstrate. Here, using the flexible control afforded by single-photon interferometry, we study the chiral state transfer when the Liouvillian EP is parametrically encircled. Reconstructing the density-matrix evolution by experimentally simulating the quantum Langevin equation, we show that the chirality of the dynamics is only present within an intermediate encircling timescale and dictated by the landscape of the Liouvillian spectrum near the EP. However, the chirality disappears at long times as the system always relaxes to the steady state. We then demonstrate the universal scaling of the chirality with respect to the encircling time. Our experiment confirms the transient nature of chiral state transfer near a Liouvillian EP in open quantum systems, while our scheme paves the way for simulating general open-system dynamics using single photons.

Title: Purcell-Enhanced, Directional Light-Matter Interaction in a Waveguide-Coupled Nanocavity
Authors: Nicholas J. Martin, Dominic Hallett, Mateusz Duda, Luke Hallacy, Elena Callus, Luke Brunswick, RenÃ© Dost, Edmund Clarke, Pallavi K. Patil, Pieter Kok, Maurice S. Skolnick, Luke R. Wilson
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically tunable, spin-dependent, directional coupling of single photons by embedding quantum dots (QDs) in a waveguide-coupled nanocavity. The directional behavior arises from direction-dependent interference between two cavity modes when coupled to the device waveguides. The small mode volume cavity enables simultaneous Purcell enhancement (${10.8\pm0.7}$) and peak directional contrast (${88\pm1\%}$), exceeding current state-of-the-art waveguide-only systems. We also present a scattering matrix model for the transmission through this structure, alongside a quantum trajectory-based model for predicting the system's directionality, which we use to explain the observed asymmetry in directional contrast seen in QD devices. Furthermore, the nanocavity enables wide-range electrical tuning of the emitter's directional contrast. We present results showing precise tuning of a QD emission line from a directional contrast of ${2\%}$ to ${96\%}$. In combination, these characteristics make this cavity-waveguide approach promising for use as a building block in directional nanophotonic circuits.

Title: Matrix Product Density Operators: Renormalization Fixed Points and Boundary Theories
Authors: J.I. Cirac, D. Perez-Garcia, N. Schuch, F. Verstraete
Abstract: We consider the tensors generating matrix product states and density operators in a spin chain. For pure states, we revise the renormalization procedure introduced by F. Verstraete et al. in 2005 and characterize the tensors corresponding to the fixed points. We relate them to the states possessing zero correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate ground states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. For mixed states, we introduce the concept of renormalization fixed points and characterize the corresponding tensors. We also relate them to concepts like finite correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate Gibbs states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. One of the main result of this work is that the resulting fixed points can be associated to the boundary theories of two-dimensional topological states, through the bulk-boundary correspondence introduced by Cirac et al. in 2011.

Title: A Benchmarking Study of Quantum Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization
Authors: Krishanu Sankar, Artur Scherer, Satoshi Kako, Sam Reifenstein, Navid Ghadermarzy, Willem B. Krayenhoff, Yoshitaka Inui, Edwin Ng, Tatsuhiro Onodera, Pooya Ronagh, Yoshihisa Yamamoto
Abstract: We study the performance scaling of three quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization: measurement-feedback coherent Ising machines (MFB-CIM), discrete adiabatic quantum computation (DAQC), and the DÃ¼rr-Hoyer algorithm for quantum minimum finding (DH-QMF) that is based on Grover's search. We use MaxCut problems as a reference for comparison, and time-to-solution (TTS) as a practical measure of performance for these optimization algorithms. For each algorithm, we analyze its performance in solving two types of MaxCut problems: weighted graph instances with randomly generated edge weights attaining 21 equidistant values from $-1$ to $1$; and randomly generated Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass instances. We empirically find a significant performance advantage for the studied MFB-CIM in comparison to the other two algorithms. We empirically observe a sub-exponential scaling for the median TTS for the MFB-CIM, in comparison to the almost exponential scaling for DAQC and the proven $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{2^n}\right)$ scaling for DH-QMF. We conclude that the MFB-CIM outperforms DAQC and DH-QMF in solving MaxCut problems.

Title: Entanglement transitions induced by quantum-data collection
Authors: Shane P. Kelly, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We present an entanglement transition in an array of qubits, induced by the transfer of quantum information from a system to a quantum computer. This quantum-data collection is an essential protocol in quantum machine learning algorithms that promise exponential advantage over their classical counterparts. In this and an accompanying work [Phys. Rev. A 111, 012425 (2025)], we identify sufficient conditions for an entanglement transition to occur in the late time state of the system and quantum computer. In this letter, we present an example entanglement transition occurring in a system comprised of a 1D chain of qubits evolving under a random brickwork circuit. After each layer, a fraction $p$ of sites undergo noisy quantum transduction in which quantum information is transferred to a quantum computer but at the cost of introducing noise from an environment. For an entanglement transition to occur, we argue that the environment must obtain the same amount of information as gained by the computer. Under this condition, the circuit shows a transition from volume law to area law entanglement as the rate $p$ is increased above a critical threshold. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-data collection to induce entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework for emergent entanglement phenomena in protocols relevant to quantum machine learning.

Title: Quantum and classical query complexities of functions of matrices
Authors: Ashley Montanaro, Changpeng Shao
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $s$-sparse Hermitian matrix, $f(x)$ be a univariate function, and $i, j$ be two indices. In this work, we investigate the query complexity of approximating $\bra{i} f(A) \ket{j}$. We show that for any continuous function $f(x):[-1,1]\rightarrow [-1,1]$, the quantum query complexity of computing $\bra{i} f(A) \ket{j}\pm \varepsilon/4$ is lower bounded by $\Omega(\widetildeÂ°_\varepsilon(f))$. The upper bound is at most quadratic in $\widetildeÂ°_\varepsilon(f)$ and is linear in $\widetildeÂ°_\varepsilon(f)$ under certain mild assumptions on $A$. Here the approximate degree $\widetildeÂ°_\varepsilon(f)$ is the minimum degree such that there is a polynomial of that degree approximating $f$ up to additive error $\varepsilon$ in the interval $[-1,1]$. We also show that the classical query complexity is lower bounded by $\widetilde{\Omega}((s/2)^{(\widetildeÂ°_{2\varepsilon}(f)-1)/6})$ for any $s\geq 4$. Our results show that the quantum and classical separation is exponential for any continuous function of sparse Hermitian matrices, and also imply the optimality of implementing smooth functions of sparse Hermitian matrices by quantum singular value transformation. As another hardness result, we show that entry estimation problem (i.e., deciding $\bra{i} f(A) \ket{j}\geq \varepsilon$ or $\bra{i} f(A) \ket{j}\leq -\varepsilon$) is BQP-complete for any continuous function $f(x)$ as long as its approximate degree is large enough. The main techniques we used are the dual polynomial method for functions over the reals, linear semi-infinite programming, and tridiagonal matrices.

Title: Principles for Optimizing Quantum Transduction in Piezo-Optomechanical Systems
Authors: James Schneeloch, Erin Sheridan, A. Matthew Smith, Christopher C. Tison, Daniel L. Campbell, Matthew D. LaHaye, Michael L. Fanto, Paul M. Alsing
Abstract: Two-way microwave-optical quantum transduction is essential to connecting distant superconducting qubits via optical fiber, and to enable quantum networking at a large scale. In BlÃ©sin, Tian, Bhave, and Kippenberg's article, ``Quantum coherent microwave-optical transduction using high overtone bulk acoustic resonances" (Phys. Rev. A, 104, 052601 (2021)), they lay out a two-way quantum transducer converting between microwave photons and telecom-band photons by way of an intermediary GHz-band phonon mode utilizing piezoelectric and optomechanical interactions respectively (and are the first to work out the quantum piezoelectric coupling). In this work, we examine both the piezoelectric, and optomechanical interactions from first principles, and together with the evanescent coupling between optical modes, discuss what parameters matter most in optimizing this kind of quantum transducer. For its additional utility, we have also compiled a table of relevant properties of optical materials that may be used as elements in transducers.

Title: Engineering One Axis Twisting via a Dissipative Berry Phase Using Strong Symmetries
Authors: Jeremy T. Young, Edwin Chaparro, Asier PiÃ±eiro Orioli, James K. Thompson, Ana Maria Rey
Abstract: We show how a driven-dissipative cavity coupled to a collective ensemble of atoms can dynamically generate metrologically useful spin-squeezed states. In contrast to other dissipative approaches, we do not rely on complex engineered dissipation or input states, nor do we require tuning the system to a critical point. Instead, we utilize a strong symmetry, a special type of symmetry that can occur in open quantum systems and emerges naturally in systems with collective dissipation, such as superradiance. This symmetry preserves coherence and allows for the accumulation of an atom number-dependent Berry phase which in turn creates spin-squeezed states via emergent one-axis twisting dynamics. This work shows that it is possible to generate entanglement in an atom-cavity resonant regime with macroscopic optical excitations of the system, going beyond the typical dispersive regime with negligible optical excitations often utilized in current cavity QED experiments.

Title: Quantum optics with giant atoms in a structured photonic bath
Authors: L. Leonforte, X. Sun, D. Valenti, B. Spagnolo, F. Illuminati, A. Carollo, F. Ciccarello
Abstract: We present a general framework to tackle quantum optics problems with giant atoms, i.e. quantum emitters each coupled {\it non-locally} to a structured photonic bath (typically a lattice) of any dimension. The theory encompasses the calculation and general properties of Green's functions, atom-photon bound states (BSs), collective master equations and decoherence-free Hamiltonians (DFHs), and is underpinned by a formalism where a giant atom is formally viewed as a normal atom lying at a fictitious location. As a major application, we provide for the first time a general criterion to predict/engineer DFHs of giant atoms, which can be applied both in and out of the photonic continuum and regardless of the structure or dimensionality of the photonic bath. This is used to show novel DFHs in 2D baths such as a square lattice and photonic graphene.

Title: Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking
Authors: Shane P. Kelly, Jamir Marino
Abstract: In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the RÃ©nyi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010402 (2025) ] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.

Title: Engineering Hierarchical Symmetries
Authors: Zhanpeng Fu, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao, Marin Bukov
Abstract: The capacity to custom tailor the properties of quantum matter and materials is a central requirement for enlarging their range of possible functionalities. A particularly promising route is the use of driving protocols to engineer specific desired properties with a high degree of control and flexibility. Here, we present such a program for the tunable generation of sequences of symmetries on controllable timescales. Concretely, our general driving protocol for many-body systems generates a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries, which imprints emergent quasiconservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$. Our results have direct applications in experiments with quantum simulators.

Title: Linear gate bounds against natural functions for position-verification
Authors: Vahid Asadi, Richard Cleve, Eric Culf, Alex May
Abstract: A quantum position-verification scheme attempts to verify the spatial location of a prover. The prover is issued a challenge with quantum and classical inputs and must respond with appropriate timings. We consider two well-studied position-verification schemes known as $f$-routing and $f$-BB84. Both schemes require an honest prover to locally compute a classical function $f$ of inputs of length $n$, and manipulate $O(1)$ size quantum systems. We prove the number of quantum gates plus single qubit measurements needed to implement a function $f$ is lower bounded linearly by the communication complexity of $f$ in the simultaneous message passing model with shared entanglement. Taking $f(x,y)=\sum_i x_i y_i$ to be the inner product function, we obtain a $\Omega(n)$ lower bound on quantum gates plus single qubit measurements. The scheme is feasible for a prover with linear classical resources and $O(1)$ quantum resources, and secure against sub-linear quantum resources.

Title: Unifying Collisional Models and the Monte Carlo Metropolis Method: Algorithms for Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Nathan M. Myers, Hrushikesh Sable, Vito W. Scarola
Abstract: Classical systems placed in contact with a thermal bath will inevitably equilibrate to a thermal state at the bath temperature. The same is not generally true for open quantum systems, which place additional conditions on the structure of the bath and system-bath interaction if thermalization is to occur. Collisional models, or repeated interaction schemes, are a category of microscopic open quantum system models that have seen growing use in studying quantum thermalization, in which the bath is modeled as a large ensemble of identical ancilla systems that sequentially interact with the system. We demonstrate that, when each bath ancilla is prepared in a thermal state with a discrete spectrum that matches the energy eigenstate transitions of the system, the system dynamics generated by the collisional model framework are identical to those generated under the Metropolis algorithm. This equivalence holds not just in the steady state regime, but also in the transient regime. As the Metropolis scheme does not require explicitly modeling the system-bath interaction, this allows it to be used as a computationally efficient alternative for simulating collisional model dynamics.

Title: Low-Rank Variational Quantum Algorithm for the Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Sara Santos, Xinyu Song, Vincenzo Savona
Abstract: The simulation of many-body open quantum systems is key to solving numerous outstanding problems in physics, chemistry, material science, and in the development of quantum technologies. Near-term quantum computers may bring considerable advantage for the efficient simulation of their static and dynamical properties, thanks to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms to approximate the dynamics of the density matrix describing the quantum state in terms of an ensemble average. Here, a variational quantum algorithm is developed to simulate the real-time evolution of the density matrix governed by the Lindblad master equation, under the assumption that the quantum state has a bounded entropy along the dynamics, entailing a low-rank representation of its density matrix. The algorithm encodes each pure state of the statistical mixture as a parametrized quantum circuit, and the associated probabilities as additional variational parameters stored classically, thereby requiring a significantly lower number of qubits than algorithms where the full density matrix is encoded in the quantum memory. Two variational AnsÃ¤tze are proposed, and their effectiveness is assessed in the simulation of the dynamics of a 2D dissipative transverse field Ising model. The results underscore the algorithm's efficiency in simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems in the low-rank regime with limited quantum resources on a near-term quantum device.

Title: Correlations enable lossless ergotropy transport
Authors: Rick P. A. Simon, Janet Anders, Karen V. Hovhannisyan
Abstract: "A battery powers a device" can be read as "work stored in the battery is being transported to the device." In quantum batteries, the total amount of stored work can be measured by ergotropy, which is the maximal work extractable by unitary operations. Transporting ergotropy is fundamentally different from transporting energy, and here we find that ergotropy can be gained even when the transmission channel is strictly energy conserving. We show that, generically, ergotropy transport is lossy whenever the two systems start uncorrelated. In contrast, for a large class of correlated initial states, transport can be gainful. Furthermore, a single correlated state can be used multiple times, allowing to transport without losses an order of magnitude more work than the battery capacity. Correlations are thus a useful resource for ergotropy transport, and we quantify how this resource is consumed during gainful transport.

Title: Accelerating quantum imaginary-time evolution with random measurements
Authors: Ioannis Kolotouros, David Joseph, Anand Kumar Narayanan
Abstract: Quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) is a promising tool to prepare thermal or ground states of Hamiltonians, as convergence is guaranteed when the evolved state overlaps with the ground state. However, its implementation using a a hybrid quantum/classical approach, where the dynamics of the parameters of the quantum circuit are derived by McLachlan's variational principle is impractical as the number of parameters $m$ increases, since each step in the evolution takes $\Theta(m^2)$ state preparations to calculate the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM). In this work, we accelerate QITE by rapid estimation of the QFIM, while conserving the convergence guarantees to the extent possible. To this end, we prove that if a parameterized state is rotated by a 2-design and measured in the computational basis, then the QFIM can be inferred from partial derivative cross correlations of the probability outcomes. One sample estimate costs only $\Theta(m)$ state preparations, leading to rapid QFIM estimation when a few samples suffice. The second family of estimators take greater liberties and replace QFIMs with averaged classical Fisher information matrices (CFIMs). In an extreme special case optimized for rapid (over accurate) descent, just one CFIM sample is drawn. We justify the second estimator family by proving rapid descent. Guided by these results, we propose the random-measurement imaginary-time evolution (RMITE) algorithm, which we showcase and test in several molecular systems, with the goal of preparing ground states.

Title: Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations
Authors: Xiao Wang, Fabio Pablo Miguel MÃ©ndez-CÃ³rdoba, Dieter Jaksch, Frank Schlawin
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations with systematic approximations. It goes beyond various high-frequency expansion methods commonly used in Floquet theory, as we demonstrate with the example of the driven Fermi-Hubbard model. In the limit of high driving frequencies, the FSWT Hamiltonian reduces to the widely used Floquet-Magnus result. We anticipate this method will be useful for designing Rydberg multi-qubit gates, controlling correlated hopping in quantum simulations in optical lattices, and describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.

Title: Benchmarking the readout of a superconducting qubit for repeated measurements
Authors: S. Hazra, W. Dai, T. Connolly, P. D. Kurilovich, Z. Wang, L. Frunzio, M. H. Devoret
Abstract: Readout of superconducting qubits faces a trade-off between measurement speed and unwanted back-action on the qubit caused by the readout drive, such as $T_1$ degradation and leakage out of the computational subspace. The readout is typically benchmarked by integrating the readout signal and choosing a binary threshold to extract the "readout fidelity". We show that readout fidelity may significantly overlook readout-induced leakage errors. Such errors are detrimental for applications that rely on continuously repeated measurements, e.g., quantum error correction. We introduce a method to measure the readout-induced leakage rate by repeatedly executing a composite operation - a readout preceded by a randomized qubit-flip. We apply this technique to characterize the readout of a superconducting qubit, optimized for fidelity across four different readout durations. Our technique highlights the importance of an independent leakage characterization by showing that the leakage rates vary from $0.12\%$ to $7.76\%$ across these readouts even though the fidelity exceeds $99.5\%$ in all four cases.

Title: Analytical Performance Estimations for Quantum Repeater Network Scenarios
Authors: Allen Zang, Joaquin Chung, Rajkumar Kettimuthu, Martin Suchara, Tian Zhong
Abstract: Quantum repeater chains will form the backbone of future quantum networks that distribute entanglement between network nodes. Therefore, it is important to understand the entanglement distribution performance of quantum repeater chains, especially their throughput and latency. By using Markov chains to model the stochastic dynamics in quantum repeater chains, we offer analytical estimations for long-run throughput and on-demand latency of continuous entanglement distribution. We first study single-link entanglement generation using general multiheralded protocols. We then model entanglement distribution with entanglement swapping over two links, using either a single- or a double-heralded entanglement generation protocol. We also demonstrate how the two-link results offer insights into the performance of general $2^k$-link nested repeater chains. Our results enrich the quantitative understanding of quantum repeater network performance, especially the dependence on system parameters. The analytical formulae themselves are valuable reference resources for the quantum networking community. They can serve as benchmarks for quantum network simulation validation or as examples of quantum network dynamics modeling using the Markov chain formalism.

Title: Multi-controlled single-qubit unitary gates based on the quantum Fourier transform
Authors: Vladimir V. Arsoski
Abstract: Multi-controlled (MC) unitary (U) gates are widely employed in quantum algorithms and circuits. Few state-of-the-art decompositions of MCU gates use non-elementary $C-R_x$ and $C-U^{1/2^{m-1}}$ gates resulting in a linear function for the depths of an implemented circuit on the number of these gates. Our approach is based on two generalizations of the multi-controlled X (MCX) gate that uses the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) comprised of Hadamard and controlled-phase gates. For the native gate set used in a genuine quantum computer, the decomposition of the controlled-phase gate is twice as less complex as $C-R_x$, which can result in an approximately double advantage of circuits derived from the QFT. The first generalization of QFT-MCX is based on altering the controlled gates acting on the target qubit. These gates are the most complex and are also used in the state-of-the-art circuits. We used an alternative single-qubit gate notation, based on a general rotation about an arbitrary axis, to efficiently minimize the complexities of gates acting on the target qubit. Furthermore, we optimize the QFT-MCX circuit and show that it is equivalent to a stair MCX gate array. Using this stair-wise structure, we devise a method for adding an arbitrary phase factor to each qubit and show how to expand the circuit straightforwardly to the multi-controlled multi-target (MCMT) gate. The second generalization relies on the ZYZ-like decomposition that uses two MCX circuits in the standard approach to implement single-qubit multi-controlled special unitary gates. We will show that by extending one QFT-MCX circuit we implement the two multi-controlled X gates needed for the decomposition. Since the complexities of our circuits are minimized to approximately equal those of the QFT-based MCX, our MCUs are more advanced than any known circuit...

Title: Pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators
Authors: Aritra Ghosh, Akash Sinha
Abstract: In this work, we describe certain pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators, both of which are exactly-solvable models in quantum mechanics. By coupling the dynamics of a particle moving in a one-dimensional potential to an imaginary-valued gauge field, it is possible to obtain certain pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the original (Hermitian) problem. In particular, it is pointed out that the Swanson oscillator arises as such an extension of the quantum harmonic oscillator. For the pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators, we explicitly solve for the wavefunctions in the position representation and also explore their intertwining relations.

Title: Simulation of satellite and optical link dynamics in a quantum repeater constellation
Authors: Jaspar Meister, Philipp KleinpaÃ, Davide Orsucci
Abstract: Quantum repeaters and satellite-based optical links are complementary technological approaches to overcome the exponential photon loss in optical fibers and thus allow quantum communication on a global scale. We analyze architectures which combine these approaches and use satellites as quantum repeater nodes to distribute entanglement to distant optical ground stations. Here we simulate dynamic, three-dimensional ground station passes, going beyond previous studies that typically consider static satellite links. For this, we numerically solve the equations of motion of the dynamic system consisting of three satellites in low Earth orbit. The model of the optical link takes into account atmospheric attenuation, single-mode fiber coupling, beam wandering and broadening, as well as adaptive optics effects. We derive analytical expressions for the Bell state measurement and associated error rates for quantum memory assisted communications, including retrieval efficiency and state coherence. We consider downlink and uplink architectures for continental and intercontinental connections and evaluate the impact of satellite altitude and inter-satellite distance on the expected entanglement swapping rate. Our simulation model enables us to design different orbital configurations for the satellite constellation and analyze the annual performance of the quantum repeater under realistic conditions.

Title: Holographic deep thermalization: theory and experimentation
Authors: Bingzhi Zhang, Peng Xu, Xiaohui Chen, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.

Title: Measurement incompatibility under loss
Authors: Mohammad Mehboudi, Fatemeh Rezaeinia, Saleh Rahimi-Keshari
Abstract: We investigate the measurement incompatibility of continuous-variable systems with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces under the influence of pure losses, a fundamental noise source in quantum optics, and a significant challenge for long-distance quantum communication. We show that loss channels with transmissivities less than $1/n$ make any set of $n$ measurements compatible. Additionally, we design a set of measurements that remains incompatible even under extreme losses, where the number of measurements in the set increases with the amount of loss. These measurements rely on on-off photodetectors and linear optics, making them feasible for implementation under realistic laboratory conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that no loss channel can break the incompatibility of all measurements. As a result, quantum steering remains achievable in the presence of pure loss.

Title: Entanglement growth in the dark intervals of a locally monitored free-fermion chain
Authors: Giovanni Di Fresco, Youenn Le Gal, Davide Valenti, Marco SchirÃ², Angelo Carollo
Abstract: We consider a free fermionic chain with monitoring of the particle density on a single site of the chain and study the entanglement dynamics of quantum jump trajectories. We show that the entanglement entropy grows in time towards a stationary state which display volume law scaling of the entropy, in stark contrast with both the unitary dynamics after a local quench and the no-click limit corresponding to full post-selection. We explain the extensive entanglement growth as a consequence of the peculiar distribution of quantum jumps in time, which display superpoissonian waiting time distribution characterised by a bunching of quantum jumps followed by long dark intervals where no-clicks are detected, akin to the distribution of fluorescence light in a driven atom. We show that the presence of dark intervals is the key feature to explain the effect and that by increasing the number of sites which are monitored the volume law scaling gives away to the Zeno effect and its associated area law.

Title: Correlations, Spectra and Entanglement Transitions in Ensembles of Matrix Product States
Authors: Hugo LÃ³io, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we analyze the spectra of the MPS transfer matrices and relate them to the spreading of mutual information in the MPS state. We demonstrate how different features of the spectral density correspond to distinct types of circuits, revealing that these MPS ensembles retain crucial physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. Notably, in the presence of quantum monitoring, we show the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.

Title: An alternative explicit circuit diagram for the quantum search algorithm by implementing a non-unitary gate
Authors: Ammar Daskin
Abstract: Since the final quantum state in the Grover search algorithm is the normalized marked quantum state in the Gram-Schmidt process, Abrams and Lloyd[1] has showed that we can generate this vector by using a non-unitary gate. Following their ideas, in this paper, we present multiple explicit unitary implementations by using the square root of the non-unitary matrix and by a unitary matrix that mimics the Gram-Schmidt process. We also discuss the implementation through a linear combination of unitary matrices or similar methods and how these approximations may change the complexity. The reading of the marked element from the given circuits with high probability still requires repetitions similar to the original algorithm. However, it gives an alternative implementations which may be useful in certain platforms

Title: From Quantum Cognition to Conceptuality Interpretation II: Unraveling the Quantum Mysteries
Authors: Diederik Aerts, Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi, Sandro Sozzo
Abstract: An overview of the conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics is presented, along with an explanation of how it sheds light on key quantum and relativistic phenomena. In particular, we show how the interpretation clarifies Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, wave function-based and entanglement-based nonlocality, interference effects resulting from the superposition principle, delayed choice experiments, quantum measurements, the mechanism of quantization, the reason why entities can establish entanglement bonds, and the statistical behavior of indistinguishable entities. We further argue that the interpretation can also elucidate relativistic effects, focusing on time dilation. Finally, we suggest that it can provide a novel and challenging perspective on evolution. This article is the second in a two-part series devoted to exploring this promising approach to reality. The first part, which serves as a companion to this discussion, outlines the intellectual trajectory leading from the first applications of quantum notions to human cognition to the bold rethinking suggested by the conceptuality interpretation.

Title: Performance Analysis for Crosstalk Errors between Parallel Entangling Gates in Trapped Ion Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Fangxuan Liu, Gaoxiang Tang, Luming Duan, Yukai Wu
Abstract: The ability to execute a large number of quantum gates in parallel is a fundamental requirement for quantum error correction, allowing an error threshold to exist under the finite coherence time of physical qubits. Recently, two-dimensional ion crystals have been demonstrated as a plausible approach to scale up the qubit number in a trapped ion quantum computer. However, although the long-range Coulomb interaction between the ions enables their strong connectivity, it also complicates the design of parallel gates and leads to intrinsic crosstalk errors. Here we examine the effects of crosstalk errors on a rotated surface code. We show that, instead of the distance-3 code considered in previous works, a distance-5 code is necessary to correct the two-qubit crosstalk error. We numerically calculate the logical error rates and coherence times under various crosstalk errors, gate infidelities and coherence times of the physical qubits, and we optimize the parallelism level according to the competition between different error sources. We show that a break-even point can be reached under realistic parameters. We further analyze the spatial dependence of the crosstalk, and discuss the scaling of the logical error rate versus the code distance for the long-term goal of a logical error rate below $10^{-10}$.

Title: Optimizing hypergraph product codes with random walks, simulated annealing and reinforcement learning
Authors: Bruno C. A. Freire, Nicolas Delfosse, Anthony Leverrier
Abstract: Hypergraph products are quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed from two classical LDPC codes. Although their dimension and distance depend only on the parameters of the underlying classical codes, optimizing their performance against various noise channels remains challenging. This difficulty partly stems from the complexity of decoding in the quantum setting. The standard, ad hoc approach typically involves selecting classical LDPC codes with large girth. In this work, we focus on optimizing performance against the quantum erasure channel. A key advantage of this channel is the existence of an efficient maximum-likelihood decoder, which enables us to employ optimization techniques based on sampling random codes, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Our results indicate that these techniques improve performance relative to the state-of-the-art.

Title: Phenomenology of Holography via Quantum Coherence on Causal Horizons
Authors: Ohkyung Kwon
Abstract: There is much recent development towards interferometric measurements of holographic quantum uncertainties in an emergent background space-time. Despite increasing promise for the target detection regime of Planckian strain power spectral density, the foundational insights of the motivating theories have not been connected to a phenomenological model of observables measured in a realistic experiment. This work proposes a candidate model, based on the central hypothesis that all horizons are universal boundaries of coherent quantum information -- where the decoherence of space-time happens for the observer. The prediction is inspired by 't Hooft's algebra for black hole information that gives coherent states on horizons, whose spatial correlations were shown by Verlinde and Zurek to also appear on holographic fluctuations of causal boundaries in flat space-time (conformal Killing horizons). Time-domain correlations are projected from Planckian jitters whose coherence scales match causal diamonds, motivated by Banks' framework for the emergence of space-time and locality. The universality of this coherence on causal horizons compels a multimodal research program probing concordant signatures: An analysis of cosmological data to probe primordial correlations, motivated by Hogan's interpretation of well-known CMB anomalies as coherent fluctuations on the inflationary horizon, and upcoming 3D interferometers to probe causal diamonds in flat space-time. Candidate interferometer geometries are presented, with a modeled frequency spectrum for each design.

Abstract: It is univocally anticipated that in a theory of quantum gravity, there exist quantum superpositions of semiclassical states of spacetime geometry. Such states could arise for example, from a source mass in a superposition of spatial configurations. In this paper we introduce a framework for describing such "quantum superpositions of spacetime states." We introduce the notion of the relativity of spacetime superpositions, demonstrating that for states in which the superposed amplitudes differ by a coordinate transformation, it is always possible to re-express the scenario in terms of dynamics on a single, fixed background. Our result unveils an inherent ambiguity in labelling such superpositions as genuinely quantum-gravitational, which has been done extensively in the literature, most notably with reference to recent proposals to test gravitationally-induced entanglement. We apply our framework to the above mentioned scenarios looking at gravitationally-induced entanglement, the problem of decoherence of gravitational sources, and clarify commonly overlooked assumptions. In the context of decoherence of gravitational sources, our result implies that the resulting decoherence is not fundamental, but depends on the existence of external systems that define a relative set of coordinates through which the notion of spatial superposition obtains physical meaning.

Title: Floquet SYK wormholes
Authors: MartÃ­ Berenguer, Anshuman Dey, Javier Mas, Juan Santos-SuÃ¡rez, Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.

Title: Path-Integral Formulation of Truncated Wigner Approximation for Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Toma Yoneya, Kazuya Fujimoto, Yuki Kawaguchi
Abstract: The truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) enables us to investigate bosonic quantum many-body dynamics, including open quantum systems described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In the TWA, the Weyl-Wigner transformation, a way of mapping from quantum-mechanical operators to $c$-numbers, of the GKSL equation leads to the Fokker-Planck equation, which we calculate by reducing it to the corresponding stochastic differential equations. However, the Fokker-Planck equation is not always reduced to the stochastic differential equations depending on details of jump operators. In this work, we clarify the condition for obtaining the stochastic differential equations from the Fokker-Planck equation and derive analytical expressions of these equations for a system with an arbitrary Hamiltonian with jump operators that do not couple different states. This result enables us to shortcut the conventional complicated calculations in applying the TWA. In the course of the derivation, we formulate the GKSL equation by using the path-integral representation based on the Weyl-Wigner transformation, which gives us a clear interpretation of the relation between the TWA and quantum fluctuations and allows us to calculate the non-equal time correlation functions in the TWA. In the benchmark calculations, we numerically confirm that the relaxation dynamics of physical quantities including the non-equal time correlation functions obtained in our formulation agrees well with the exact ones in the numerically solvable models.

Title: Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Guilherme Delfino, Ho Tat Lam, Ãmer M. Aksoy
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.

Title: Semiclassical Limit of Resonance States in Chaotic Scattering
Authors: Roland Ketzmerick, Florian Lorenz, Jan Robert Schmidt
Abstract: Resonance states in quantum chaotic scattering systems have a multifractal structure that depends on their decay rate. We show how classical dynamics describes this structure for all decay rates in the semiclassical limit. This result for chaotic scattering systems corresponds to the well-established quantum ergodicity for closed chaotic systems. Specifically, we generalize Ulam's matrix approximation of the Perron-Frobenius operator, giving rise to conditionally invariant measures of various decay rates. There are many matrix approximations leading to the same decay rate and we conjecture a criterion for selecting the one relevant for resonance states. Numerically, we demonstrate that resonance states in the semiclassical limit converge to the selected measure. Example systems are a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and open quantum maps.

Title: Non-linear regime of atomic arrays at low drive intensity: controlled generation of multiple subradiant excitations via a multi-photon resonance
Authors: Orazio Scarlatella, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: Atomic arrays have emerged as an interesting light-matter platform displaying strong and controllable collective effects. In subwavelength regimes, they are characterized by a manifold of subradiant eigenstates, which can host rich quantum many-body physics and might be useful for applications. Nevertheless, their controlled excitation by a weak coherent drive is prevented by their subradiant nature. While this is true at a linear level, and although the weak-drive regime has been often described using linear theories, we point out that this regime is instead strongly non-linear for regular arrays. Using a dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach, we show that by driving weakly a non-linear two-particle resonance, a steady-state with a controlled population of subradiant modes can be obtained. This features a non-zero density of interacting subradiant excitations, displaying multi-mode squeezing correlations and long-range correlations that survive many-body heating effects, even at non-zero drive intensities.

Title: Pauli spin blockade at room temperature in double-quantum-dot tunneling transport through individual deep dopants in silicon
Authors: Yoshisuke Ban, Kimihiko Kato, Shota Iizuka, Hiroshi Oka, Shigenori Murakami, Koji Ishibashi, Satoshi Moriyama, Takahiro Mori, Keiji Ono
Abstract: Pauli spin blockade (PSB) is a spin-dependent charge transport process that typically appears in double quantum dot (QD) devices and is employed in fundamental research on single spins in nanostructures to read out semiconductor qubits. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of the QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a silicon field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity below geomagnetic field. Lifting in PSB caused by magnetic resonance (50 K) and Rabi oscillations (10 K) are also observed. Further development of this unique system may lead to room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.

Title: Approaching the quantum limit of energy resolution in animal magnetoreception
Authors: I. K. Kominis, E. Gkoudinakis
Abstract: A large number of magnetic sensors, like superconducting quantum interference devices, optical pumping and nitrogen vacancy magnetometers, were shown to satisfy the energy resolution limit. This limit states that the magnetic sensitivity of the sensor, when translated into a product of energy with time, is bounded below by Planck's constant, hbar. This bound implies a fundamental limitation as to what can be achieved in magnetic sensing. Here we explore biological magnetometers, in particular three magnetoreception mechanisms thought to underly animals' geomagnetic field sensing: the radical-pair, the magnetite and the MagR mechanism. We address the question of how close these mechanisms approach the energy resolution limit. At the quantitative level, the utility of the energy resolution limit is that it informs the workings of magnetic sensing in model-independent ways, and thus can provide subtle consistency checks for theoretical models and estimated or measured parameter values, particularly needed in complex biological systems. At the qualitative level, the closer the energy resolution is to hbar, the more "quantum" is the sensor. This offers an alternative route towards understanding the quantum biology of magnetoreception. It also quantifies the room for improvement, illuminating what Nature has achieved, and stimulating the engineering of biomimetic sensors exceeding Nature's magnetic sensing performance.

Title: Stochastic resonance in vibrational polariton chemistry
Authors: Yaling Ke
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach--the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.

Title: High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces
Authors: Shihao Shao, Yikang Li, Zhouchen Lin, Qinghua Cui
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at this https URL, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.

Title: Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model
Authors: MartÃ­ Berenguer, Javier Mas, Juan Santos-SuÃ¡rez, Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.

Title: Measurement and Teleportation in the cSYK/JT Correspondence
Authors: Raphael Brinster, Stefan Forste, Yannic Kruse, Saurabh Natu
Abstract: We consider two complex SYK models entangled in a thermofield double (TFD) state and investigate the effect of one-sided projective measurements. As measurement operator we choose single site charge operators. Performing a measurement results in a non-zero $U(1)$ charge. The entropy curve differs from the previously studied SYK model due to a thermodynamic phase transition that takes place after a certain charge is reached. We also match our results to a dual bulk description. Finally, a teleportation protocol is provided to support the notion of a traversable wormhole being formed.

Title: A Simplification Method for Inequality Constraints in Integer Binary Encoding HOBO Formulations
Authors: Yuichiro Minato
Abstract: This study proposes a novel method for simplifying inequality constraints in Higher-Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulations. The proposed method addresses challenges associated with Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, specifically the increased computational complexity and reduced solution accuracy caused by the introduction of slack variables and the resulting growth in auxiliary qubits. By efficiently integrating constraints, the method enhances the computational efficiency and accuracy of both quantum and classical solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments applied to combinatorial optimization problems. The results indicate that this method expands the applicability of quantum algorithms to high-dimensional problems and improves the practicality of classical optimization solvers for optimization problems involving inequality constraints.
