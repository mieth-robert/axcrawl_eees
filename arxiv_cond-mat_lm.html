            <h2>Majorana edge reconstruction and the $ν=5/2$ non-Abelian thermal Hall puzzle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tevž Lotrič, Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel, Steven H. Simon, S. A. Parameswaran</p>
            <p>Pioneering thermal transport measurements on two-dimensional electron gases in high magnetic fields have demonstrated that the quantized Hall state at filling factor $\nu=5/2$ has a thermal Hall conductance $\kappa$ quantized in half-integer multiples of $\kappa_0 = {\pi^2 k_B^2 T}/{3h}$. Half-integer $\kappa/\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the experimentally observed value of $\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian' state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an 'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can "screen'' a Pfaffian or AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is consistent with experiment.</p>

            <h2>Finite-temperature criticality through quantum annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Teza, Francesco Campaioli, Marco Avesani, Oren Raz</p>
            <p>Critical phenomena at finite temperature underpin a broad range of physical systems, yet their study remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks near phase transitions. Quantum annealers have attracted significant interest as a potential tool for accessing finite temperature criticality beyond classical reach, but their utility in precisely resolving criticality has remained limited by noise, hardware constraints, and thermal fluctuations. Here we overcome these challenges, showing that careful calibration and embedding allow quantum annealers to capture the full finite-temperature critical behavior of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. By tuning the energy scale of the system and mitigating device asymmetries, we sample effective Boltzmann distributions and extract both the critical temperature and the associated critical exponents. Our approach opens the study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium critical phenomena in a broad class of systems at finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Triplet Exciton-driven Topological Mott insulator at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peizhi Mai</p>
            <p>Motivated by experiments in which the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) charge gap greatly exceeds the Curie temperature, we apply determinantal quantum Monte Carlo to two complementary lattice models with different geometries: the checkerboard quantum-spin-Hall-Hubbard model and the generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.</p>

            <h2>Correlated quantum shift vector of particle-hole excitations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu Yang, Ajit Srivastava, Justin C. W. Song</p>
            <p>Excitons are a prime example of how electron interactions affect optical response and excitation. We demonstrate that, beyond its spectra, the bound nature of an exciton's electron-hole pair produces a correlated quantum geometry: excitonic excitations possess a quantum shift vector that is independent of light polarization. We find this counterintuitive behavior has dramatic consequences for geometric response: e.g., in noncentrosymmetric but non-polar materials, vertical excitonic transitions possess vanishing shift vector zeroing their shift photocurrent; this contrasts with finite and strongly light polarization dependent shift vectors for non-interacting delocalized particle-hole excitations. This dichotomy makes shift vector a sharp diagnostic of the pair localization properties of particle-hole excitations and demonstrates the non-perturbative effects of electron interactions in excited state quantum geometric response.</p>

            <p>Multi-exciton correlations shape the photo-induced response of nanostructured materials, particularly when interactions are enhanced by light confinement. Here multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is used to quantify biexciton and exciton-polariton dynamics in a semiconductor microcavity. One- and two-quantum spectra, which are dominated by polariton-related contributions, also include a polarization-dependent biexciton feature whose magnitude and spectral coordinates depend on the detuning between the cavity mode and the exciton resonance. Comparison of spectra acquired using collinear and noncollinear experimental geometries indicates that excitation wavevector plays no significant role in this behavior. The measured energy dispersion and cavity enhancement are not compatible with uncoupled biexcitons or bipolaritons. To explain the measurements, an indirect biexciton-photon coupling model is introduced whereby biexcitons are formed from dark excitons that Coulomb couple to the bright-exciton fraction of the polaritons. The model addresses inconsistent observations of biexcitons previously reported in semiconductor microcavities and is generalizable to any material where optically dark excitons contribute to light-matter interaction. Our results suggest a mechanism to access long-lived dark excitons through multi-exciton correlations in strongly coupled systems.</p>

            <h2>Advancing Quantum Transport Calculations: An Effective Medium Theory with Plane-Wave Basis and PAW Potentials in Eigenstates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cheng Lin, Ken-Ming Lin, Yu-Chang Chen</p>
            <p>We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.</p>

            <h2>Promising ferroelectric metal EuAuBi with switchable giant shift current</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangrong Tan, Jinyu Zou, Gang Xu</p>
            <p>The coexistence of metallicity and ferroelectricity in ferroelectric (FE) metals defies conventional wisdom and enables novel functionalities in electronic and optoelectronic systems. However, intrinsic FE metals remain extremely rare and challenging. Here, using first-principles calculations, we identify that a huge spontaneous polarization of 16.6-20.2 $\mu\text{C}/\text{cm}^2$, a moderate switching barrier of 68.5 meV/f.u., and a low carrier concentration of $ \sim 2.5 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ coexist in topological semimetal EuAuBi. Further electron-phonon coupling calculations reveal that the metallic carriers interact weakly with the FE phonon mode, consistent with the decoupled electron mechanism. Moreover, EuAuBi exhibits a pronounced bulk photovoltaic effect characterized by a giant polarization-dependent shift current with the magnitude of conductivity up to 370 $\mu\text{A}/\text{V}^2$. Thus, a feasible FE metal verification setup is proposed based on the shift current measurement. These results not only demonstrate that EuAuBi is a promising FE metal, but also propose a practical route for FE metals identification, which could promote the FE metals study greatly.</p>

            <h2>Observation of superconductivity-induced leading-edge gap in Sr-doped $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjie Sun, Zhicheng Jiang, Bo Hao, Shengjun Yan, Hongyi Zhang, Maosen Wang, Yang Yang, Haoying Sun, Zhengtai Liu, Dianxiang Ji, Zhengbin Gu, Jian Zhou, Dawei Shen, Donglai Feng, Yuefeng Nie</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bulk $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ has ignited significant interest in nickelate superconductors. Unlike cuprates, where superconductivity predominantly originates from the $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, nickelates exhibit additional complexities involving contributions from the $\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$ orbital, prompting fundamental questions about their pairing mechanisms. Despite recent progress in stabilizing superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films at ambient pressure, direct spectroscopic evidence of the superconducting gap opening remains elusive. Here, we present an in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of Sr-doped superconducting $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films. Fermi surface mapping reveals Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-derived $\alpha$ and $\beta$ pockets, with orbital fillings of 0.11$\pm$0.02 electrons and 0.66$\pm$0.03 holes per Ni, respectively, resulting in a total of 0.45$\pm$0.04 electrons for each Ni. These bands exhibit moderate electron correlations, characterized by a band renormalization factor of 3-4. Notably, both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands exhibit leading-edge shifts across the superconducting transition, with gap magnitude of ~1-2 meV at Fermi momenta along the Brillouin zone diagonal and slightly away from the zone diagonal, deviating from the conventional $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap structure. Additionally, the Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$-derived $\gamma$ band lies ~75 meV below the Fermi level, indicating a $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-dominated fermiology in this compound.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Quantum behavior on frustrated Ising model: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seunghan Lee, Hunpyo Lee</p>
            <p>We investigated the quantum effects of a frustrated Ising model on a two-dimensional square lattice using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). While strong spin frustration is known to induce quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, previous classical approaches restricted to binary (up or down) spin configurations have been insufficient to fully capture the quantum contributions of frustration. In this study, we introduced a quantitative metric to evaluate the quantum effects arising from frustration and employed QAOA to differentiate between classical and quantum regimes. Notably, we found that in the weakly frustrated region, QAOA measurements rarely capture first excited states, as they are energetically well separated from the ground state. In contrast, near the quantum phase transition point, excited states appear more frequently in QAOA measurements, highlighting the increased role of quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <p>In this work, we reveal the coexistence and correlation of a topological cusp anomaly in the planar Hall signal and a spin-flip scattering dominated positive longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) across the entire temperature range below the Curie point in Fe3GeTe2. This correlation dies out exponentially as the magnetic field is directed away from the ab-plane, resulting in unusually sharp polar angle dependence of longitudinal MR and the Hall response.</p>

            <h2>Crossing over from flat band superconductivity to conventional superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Thumin, G. Bouzerar</p>
            <p>Over the past ten years, flat band (FB) or geometric superconductivity has become a major issue in condensed matter physics due to the significant technological benefits it could offer. Observations of this unconventional form of superconductivity are unfortunately still very limited, and significant efforts are being made to search for candidate materials. Most existing theoretical studies focus on systems with strictly non-dispersive bands, which, from an experimental point of view, represents an extremely difficult technological constraint to achieve. It is therefore crucial to understand to what extent this constraint can be relaxed. In other words, to what extent can superconductivity in flat bands survive weak perturbations? The main objective of the present study is precisely to answer this essential question in detail.</p>

            <h2>Superlubricity of Borophene: Tribological Properties in Comparison to hBN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Hinaut, B. Sena Tömekçe, Shuyu Huang, Yiming Song, Ernst Meyer, Antonio Cammarata, Willi Auwärter, Thilo Glatzel</p>
            <p>The tribological performance of 2D materials makes them good candidates toward a reduction of friction at the macroscale. Superlubricity has been observed for graphene, MoS\textsubscript{2} and MXenes and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is used to reduce or tune friction, but other materials are investigated as potential candidates for low-lubricity applications. Specifically, borophene is predicted to have ultra-low friction. Here, we experimentally investigate frictional properties of borophene and use a borophene-hBN lateral heterostructure to directly compare the tribological properties of the two complementary 2D materials. In particular, we investigate the friction between a sliding tip and (i) the weakly corrugated $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene layer on Ir(111) or (ii) the hBN/Ir(111) superlattice structures with a strongly corrugated moiré reconstruction. Our experimental study performed in ultra-high vacuum at room temperature combined with a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model calculation confirms the superlubricity predicted for borophene, while hBN, which exhibits a higher friction, is nevertheless confirmed as a low friction material. Ab initio calculations show that the lower friction of $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene with respect to hBN can be rationalized by weaker tip/surface interactions. In addition, we assess structural and electrical properties of borophene and hBN by using scanning probe techniques and compare their dissipation under the oscillating tip to investigate the possible path of energy dissipation occurring during friction. Our study demonstrates the low frictional properties of borophene and the potential of lateral heterostructure investigations to directly compare the properties of these 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Muonium as a probe of point defects in type-Ib diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. Yokoyama, J.S. Lord, H. Abe, T. Ohshima</p>
            <p>Muonium (Mu), a bound state of a positively charged muon and an electron, can diffuse through crystal lattices and interact with defect centers in insulators and semiconductors. We demonstrate that this Mu's diffusive property can be used to probe defects in a diamond crystal lattice; specifically, substitutional nitrogen atoms (N$_\text{s}^0$) and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in type-Ib diamond. Upon interaction with these defects, Mu can exchange its electron's spin or change its charge state, which result in muon spin relaxation. However, muons in diamond (and semiconductors in general) can be in a few distinctive muonium states, with each state contributing to the muon signal. In addition, these states can undergo site and charge exchange interaction, forming a dynamic network. Hence, to study the Mu interaction with point defects, the muon data have to be deconvoluted to isolate signals from the diffusing species. To achieve this goal, we have modeled the Mu state exchange dynamics and numerically simulated the time evolution of muon spin polarization by the density matrix method. With a global curve fit to a set of longitudinal field scan data, one can extract the Mu transition rates that involve interaction with the defect centers. The diffusing tetrahedral interstitial Mu was found to interact with the paramagnetic N$_\text{s}^0$ center via electron spin exchange. In contrast, they are converted to form a diamagnetic center upon interaction with the negatively charged NV center.</p>

            <h2>Reversible local strain engineering of $\mathrm{WS}_2$ using a micro-mechanical spring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Herrmann, Zhixiang Huang, Sai Rahul Sitaram, Ke Ma, S M Jahadun Nobi, Xi Wang</p>
            <p>Local strain engineering is a promising technique to tune the properties of two-dimensional materials at the nanoscale. However, many existing methods are static and limit the systematic exploration of strain-dependent material behavior. Here, we demonstrate dynamic and reversible control of local strain distributions in suspended trilayer tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS}_2$) via nanoindentation using a micro-mechanical spring patterned with nanoscale probes. Micro-photoluminescence measurements reveal that indentation using a ring-shaped probe induces a nearly uniform biaxial strain distribution accompanied by a reversible redshift of the neutral exciton peak, consistent with simulated strain magnitudes. We further show that the in-plane strain distribution is spatially programmable by engineering the probe geometry and present designs for inducing point-like, uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial strain distributions. The presented platform enables substrate-free, repeatable local strain engineering in suspended 2D materials and provides a versatile tool for streamlining the investigation of strain-dependent phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Hyperuniformity at the Absorbing State Transition: Perturbative RG for Random Organization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Ma, Johannes Pausch, Gunnar Pruessner, Michael E. Cates</p>
            <p>Hyperuniformity, where the static structure factor obeys $S(q)\sim q^{\varsigma}$ with $\varsigma> 0$, emerges at criticality in systems having multiple, symmetry-unrelated, absorbing states. Important examples arise in periodically sheared suspensions and amorphous solids; these lie in the random organisation (RO) universality class, for which analytic results for $\varsigma$ are lacking. Here, using Doi-Peliti field theory and perturbative RG about a Gaussian model, we find $\varsigma = 0^+$ and $\varsigma= 2\epsilon/9 + O(\epsilon^2)$ in dimension $d>d_c=4$ and $d=4-\epsilon$ respectively. Our calculations assume that renormalizability is sustained via a certain pattern of cancellation of strongly divergent terms. These cancellations allow the upper critical dimension to remain $d_c = 4$, as is known for RO, while generic perturbations (e.g., those violating particle conservation) would typically flow to a fixed point with $d_c=6$. The assumed cancellation pattern is closely reminiscent of a long-established one near the tricritical Ising fixed point. (This has $d_c=3$, although generic perturbations flow towards the Wilson-Fisher fixed point with $d_c = 4$.) We show how hyperuniformity in RO emerges from anticorrelation of strongly fluctuating active and passive densities. Our calculations also yield the remaining exponents to order $\epsilon$, surprisingly without recourse to functional RG. These exponents coincide as expected with the Conserved Directed Percolation (C-DP) class which also contains the Manna Model and the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (q-EW) model. Importantly however, our $\varsigma$ differs from one found via a mapping to q-EW. That mapping neglects a conserved noise in the RO action, which we argue to be dangerously irrelevant. Thus, although other exponents are common to both, the RO and C-DP universality classes have different exponents for hyperuniformity.</p>

            <h2>The effect of fiber plasticity on domain formation in soft biological composites -- Part I: a bifurcation analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michalis Agoras, Fernanda F. Fontenele, Nikolaos Bouklas</p>
            <p>The main objective of this work is to shed light on the effect of fiber plasticity on the macroscopic response and domain formation in soft biological composites. This goal is pursued by analyzing the plane-strain response of two-phase laminates. In the context of this problem, the effect of fiber plasticity is accounted for by allowing the elastically stiffer layers (``fiber'' phase) to also yield plastically and by taking the soft layers (``matrix'' phase) to be purely elastic solids. The analysis is carried out at finite elastic and plastic strains, but it is restricted to unidirectional, non-monotonic loading paths, applied by initially increasing the macroscopic stretch along the direction of the layers up to a prescribed maximum value and then decreasing the same stretch down to a minimum value. A simple expression is derived for the critical conditions at which the homogenized behavior of the laminate loses strong ellipticity for the first time along the loading path. The relevance of this result stems from the fact that the loss of macroscopic ellipticity of these composites is known to coincide with the onset of bifurcations of the long-wavelength type. It follows from this result that, just like hyperelastic laminates, elastoplastic laminates may lose macroscopic ellipticity whenever their incremental strength in shear perpendicular to the layers vanishes for the first time. For situations in which loss of macroscopic ellipticity does take place, a corresponding post-bifurcation solution for the homogenized behavior of the laminate is computed. The deformed state of the material described by this solution is characterized by twin lamellar domains that are formed at a length scale much larger than the width of the original, microscopic layers, but still much smaller than the overall dimensions of the macroscopic specimen under consideration.</p>

            <p>We report on the temperature-dependent optical response of thin films of YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} (YBCO) in the visible spectral range under cryogenic conditions. Specifically, we observe an increase in transmittance near the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), which saturates within a few kelvins below Tc. The increase in transmittance is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in reflectance as the temperature drops below Tc, and both quantities track the superconducting phase transition. Changes in transmittance are found to be wavelength dependent, with the maximum variation occurring at 633 nm and minimal at 450 nm. These observations establish a correlation between the variation in optical response and the superconducting phase transition, even in the visible regime. The results of our experiment highlight the potential for using non-contact optical measurements to determine Tc. The effect can be explained using the two-fluid model, which can account for the observed temperature and wavelength dependence of the transmittance of the superconducting thin films.</p>

            <h2>Chiral superconductivity near a fractional Chern insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel</p>
            <p>Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable moire potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before a metallic state forms. A chiral $f+if$ superconductor and a commensurate $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) differ in energy by less than $1\%$, reproducing the distinct superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases experimentally observed near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome remains robust against realistic Coulomb screening, light doping, and variations in lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.</p>

            <h2>Phase Stability and Transformations in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites from Machine Learning Force Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xia Liang, Johan Klarbring, Aron Walsh</p>
            <p>Lead halide perovskites (APbX$_3$) offer tunable optoelectronic properties but feature an intricate phase-stability landscape. Here we employ on-the-fly data collection and an equivariant message-passing neural-network potential to perform large-scale molecular dynamics of three prototypical perovskite systems: CsPbX$_3$, MAPbX$_3$, and FAPbX$_3$. Integrating these simulations with the PDynA analysis toolkit, we resolve both equilibrium phase diagrams and dynamic structural evolution under varying temperature and halide-mixing conditions. Our findings reveal that the A-site cation strongly modulates octahedral tilt modes and phase pathways: MA$^+$ effectively "forbids" the beta-to-gamma transition in MAPbX$_3$ by requiring extensive molecular rearrangements and crystal rotation, whereas the debated low-temperature phase in FAPbX$_3$ is best represented as an Im$\bar{3}$ cubic phase with $a^+a^+a^+$ tilts. Additionally, small changes in halide composition and arrangement $\unicode{x2013}$ from uniform mixing to partial segregation $\unicode{x2013}$ alter tilt correlations. Segregated domains can even foster anomalous tilting modes that impede uniform phase transformations. These results highlight the multi-scale interplay between cation environment and halide distribution, offering a rational basis for tuning perovskite architectures toward improved phase stability.</p>

            <p>Cavities provide a means to manipulate the optical and electronic responses of quantum materials by selectively enhancing light-matter interaction at specific frequencies and momenta. While cavities typically involve external structures, exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials can form intrinsic self-cavities due to their small finite dimensions, confining electromagnetic fields into plasmonic cavity modes, characterized by standing-wave current distributions. While cavity-enhanced phenomena are well-studied at optical frequencies, the impact of self-cavities on nonlinear electronic responses--such as photogalvanic currents--remains largely unexplored, particularly in the terahertz regime, critical for emerging ultrafast optoelectronic technologies. Here, we report a self-cavity-induced Purcell enhancement of photogalvanic currents in the vdW semimetal WTe$_2$. Using ultrafast optoelectronic circuitry, we measured coherent near-field THz emission resulting from nonlinear photocurrents excited at the sample edges. We observed enhanced emission at finite frequencies, tunable via excitation fluence and sample geometry, which we attribute to plasmonic interference effects controlled by the cavity boundaries. We developed an analytical theory that captures the cavity resonance conditions and spectral response across multiple devices. Our findings establish WTe$_2$ as a bias-free, geometry-tunable THz emitter and demonstrate the potential of self-cavity engineering for controlling nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Materials for Light Dark Matter Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonit Hochberg, Dino Novko, Rotem Ovadia, Antonio Politano</p>
            <p>We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.</p>

            <h2>Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre Chaduteau, Derek K. K. Lee, Frank Schindler</p>
            <p>The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Introduction to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model: A Strongly Correlated System Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Jha</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model delivers an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit -- all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Designed as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity -- woven throughout this work -- underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</p>

            <h2>A Study of Non-linear Flows and Shear Banding in Wormlike Micelles Under Varying Elasticity, Flow Curvature, and Surfactant Chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alfredo Scigliani, Hadi Mohammadigoushki</p>
            <p>We report the flow dynamics of two shear-banding wormlike micellar solutions with distinct surfactant chemistries in a Taylor-Couette (TC) setup following a startup shear. The solutions, formulated with CTAB/NaSal and CPyCl/NaSal, exhibit comparable bulk rheology and equilibrium microstructural properties. By varying the TC gap size, we systematically examine elasticity number over a range of 128000-4470000, while flow curvature spans from 0.022 to 0.171. Under a step shear into the stress plateau, both solutions exhibit a pronounced stress overshoot that intensifies with increasing elasticity number and flow curvature, followed by the development of growing flow heterogeneities. Beyond a critical threshold of elasticity number and curvature, the CTAB/NaSal solution exhibits transient flow reversal, whereas the CPyCl/NaSal solution, despite developing similar heterogeneities, does not undergo flow reversal under any tested conditions. We hypothesize that this difference arises from the stronger electrostatic repulsions between CPyCl head groups due to their larger size, coupled with the higher dissociation rate of Cl counterions. Additionally, the quasi-steady velocity profiles are significantly influenced by elasticity number and flow curvature. Wall slip at the outer cylinder exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on these parameters: it is negligible at low values of elasticity number and flow curvature, peaks at intermediate values, and diminishes at high values. Our findings highlight how surfactant chemistry, elasticity number, and flow curvature control shear-banding flows in wormlike micelles.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic simplicial complexes</h2>

            <p>We investigate simplicial complexes deterministically growing from a single vertex. In the first step, a vertex and an edge connecting it to the primordial vertex are added. The resulting simplicial complex has a 1-dimensional simplex and two 0-dimensional faces (the vertices). The process continues recursively: On the $n$-th step, every existing $d-$dimensional simplex ($d\leq n-1$) joins a new vertex forming a $(d+1)-$dimensional simplex; all $2^{d+1}-2$ new faces are also added so that the resulting object remains a simplicial complex. The emerging simplicial complex has intriguing local and global characteristics. The number of simplices grows faster than $n!$, and the upper-degree distributions follow a power law. Here, the upper degree (or $d$-degree) of a $d$-simplex refers to the number of $(d{+}1)$-simplices that share it as a face. Interestingly, the $d$-degree distributions evolve quite differently for different values of $d$. We compute the Hodge Laplacian spectra of simplicial complexes and show that the spectral and Hausdorff dimensions are infinite. We also explore a constrained version where the dimension of the added simplices is fixed to a finite value $m$. In the constrained model, the number of simplices grows exponentially. In particular, for $m=1$, the spectral dimension is $2$. For $m=2$, the spectral dimension is finite, and the degree distribution follows a power law, while the $1$-degree distribution decays exponentially.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Yu Xiao, Bowen Kan, Huan Ma, Bowen Zhao, Honghui Shang</p>
            <p>We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ansätze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recent progress has shown that a broad class of highly correlated wavefunctions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.</p>

            <h2>Astrocyte-Mediated Higher-Order Control of Synaptic Plasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo Menesse, Ana P. Millán, Joaquín J. Torres</p>
            <p>The dynamics of higher-order topological signals are increasingly recognized as a key aspect of the activity of complex systems. A paradigmatic example are synaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different mechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms, the role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the so-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the competition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have yet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the tripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in short-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and pre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability of neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term plasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a minimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation that propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit is highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to external input. By introducing higher-order interactions among different synapses through astrocyte modulation, we show that higher-order modulation robustly stabilizes circuit dynamics and expands the parameter space that supports stimulus-driven activity. Our findings highlight a plausible mechanism by which astrocytes can reshape effective connectivity and enhance information processing through higher-order structural interactions -- even in the simplest recurrent circuits.</p>

            <p>Advances in machine learning have led to the development of foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across chemically diverse compounds at reduced computational cost. Hitherto, the accuracy and utility of these models have been assessed relying on descriptors based on formation energies or idealized harmonic atomic vibrations. Yet, the rigorous and physically interpretable quantification of their capability to describe both realistic anharmonic atomic dynamics and technologically relevant observables remains a pressing problem. Here, we address this problem, leveraging the Wigner formulation of heat transport and the Grüneisen approach to thermal expansion to connect the atomic-physics awareness of foundation models to their utility in predicting experimentally observable thermomechanical properties, presenting standards and fine-tuning protocols needed to achieve first-principles accuracy. We apply our framework to a database of 103 solids with diverse compositions and structures, demonstrating that it overcomes the major bottlenecks of current methods for designing heat-management materials -- high cost, limited transferability, or lack of physics awareness -- and its potential to discover materials for next-gen technologies ranging from thermal insulation to neuromorphic computing.</p>

            <p>We consider matter-wave bright solitons in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with a view to study Josephson-type oscillation and self-trapping of population imbalance between two pseudo-spin states. For fixed values of nonlinear interaction and lattice parameters, the population imbalance executes Josephson-type oscillation and the frequency of oscillation decreases with the increase of helicoidal gauge potential. The frequency of oscillation, however, increases in presence of nonlinear optical lattices. We find that the population imbalance can oscillate about a non-zero value and result self-trapping for proper choices of parameters of the system. The self-trapping can be enhanced by the increase of helicoidal gauge potential and by properly tuning the lattice parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Skarmoutsos, Stefano Mossa</p>
            <p>The elusive presence of an anomalously increasing screening length at high ionic concentrations hampers a complete picture of interactions in electrolytes. Theories which extend the diluted Debye-Huckel framework to higher concentrations predict, in addition to the expected decreasing Debye length, an increasing significant scale of the order of at most a few ionic diameters. More recent surface force balance experiments with different materials succeeded in measuring increasing length scales which, however, turn out to extend over tenths or even hundreds of ionic diameters. While simulation work has managed to characterize the former, the latter still avoid detection, generating doubts about its true origin. Here we provide a step forward in the clarification of such a conundrum. We have studied by extensive Molecular Dynamics simulation the properties of a generic model of electrolyte, lithium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in ethylene-carbonate, in a vast range of salt concentrations continuously joining the Debye non-interacting limit to the opposite over-charged solvent-in-salt states. On one side, we have accurately determined the macroscopic concentration-induced structural, dielectric and transport modifications, on the other we have quantified the resulting nano-scale ions organization. Based only on the simulation data, without resorting to any uncontrolled hypothesis or phenomenological parameter, we identify a convincing candidate for the measured anomalously increasing length, whose origin has been possibly misinterpreted.</p>

            <p>Lifshitz invariant is a symmetry invariant composed of multiple order parameters that contain a single spatial derivative in a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy, which may induce a nonuniform configuration of the order parameters. In multiband superconductors, we find phase transitions from a uniform superconducting state to qualitatively distinct two pair-density-wave (PDW) states with small and large momenta $\boldsymbol{q}$ based on the GL theory. The former is induced by the Lifshitz invariant, while the latter originates from the drag effect. In the PDW states, the Higgs and Leggett modes (i.e., collective amplitude and relative phase oscillations of the order parameters) are shown to couple to electromagnetic fields linearly. We construct microscopic models of multiband superconductors with Lifshitz invariant that exhibit PDW states, and calculate the linear optical conductivity using the diagrammatic approach. We find optically active Higgs and Leggett modes in the small $\boldsymbol{q}$ PDW state, indicating that the PDW state is a suitable platform to explore collective modes of multiband superconductors in the linear response regime.</p>

            <p>We develop the theory of the non-adiabatic phonon self-energy arising from coupling to electrons with finite linewidths using the spectral representation of Green's functions. Our formalism naturally includes the contribution from the intra-band electronic transitions (as well as the inter-band ones) at all electron wavevectors to the phonon linewidths, which is forbidden for zone-center optical phonons if infinitesimal electron linewidths are used. As a proof of principle, we use the theory to calculate the linewidth of the double-degenerate, zone-center optical $E_{\rm 2g}$ phonons of graphene as a function of the chemical potential. The calculated phonon linewidths obtained with finite electron linewidths differ significantly from those obtained with infinitesimal electron linewidths even at low temperatures. Intra-band electronic transitions play an important role in making this difference. Moreover, only the results accounting for the finite electron linewidths are in quantitative agreement with the available experimental data. The presented formalism is suitable for first-principles calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. E. Cates, C. Nardini</p>
            <p>In active systems, whose constituents have non-equilibrium dynamics at local level, fluid-fluid phase separation is widely observed. Examples include the formation of membraneless organelles within cells; the clustering of self-propelled colloidal particles in the absence of attractive forces, and some types of ecological segregation. A schematic understanding of such active phase separation was initially borrowed from what is known for the equilibrium case, in which detailed balance holds at microscopic level. However it has recently become clear that in active systems the absence of detailed balance, although it leave phase separation qualitatively unchanged in some regimes (for example domain growth driven by interfacial tension via Ostwald ripening), can in other regimes radically alter its phenomenology at mechanistic level. For example, microphase separation can be caused by reverse Ostwald ripening, a process that is hard to imagine from an equilibrium perspective. This and other new phenomena arise because, instead of having a single, positive interfacial tension like their equilibrium counterparts, the fluid-fluid interfaces created by active phase separation can have several distinct interfacial tensions governing different properties, some of which can be negative. These phenomena can be broadly understood by studying continuum field theories for a single conserved scalar order parameter (the fluid density), supplemented with a velocity field in cases where momentum conservation is also present. More complex regimes arise in systems described by multiple scalar order parameters (especially with nonreciprocal interactions between these); or when an order parameter undergoes both conserved and non-conserved dynamics; or in systems that support orientational long-range order in one or more of the coexisting phases.

We also theoretically studied this phenomenon by generalizing the granular rheology $\mu(I)$ to the case of elongated grains and computing the linear response to such a perturbation. Even if the agreement between theory and simulations remains qualitative only, we can reproduce and understand the inversion of the vortex pattern when the cell aspect ratio is increased from a vertically to a horizontally elongated cell shape, emphasizing the key role of the second normal stress difference as well as the cell geometry.</p>

The increase in the coupling strength or the density of polar particles results in the: Sharper strings with larger probability of connecting the topological defects of same charge and the enhanced dynamics of topological defects. However, the ordering kinetics of the system shows the delayed coarsening for larger coupling or polar density.

            <p>Cosmic rays are deemed to be generated by a process known as ``Fermi acceleration", in which charged particles scatter against magnetic fluctuations in astrophysical plasmas. The process itself is however universal, has both classical and quantum formulations, and is at the basis of dynamical systems with interesting mathematical properties, such as the celebrated Fermi-Ulam model. Despite its effectiveness in accelerating particles, Fermi acceleration has so far eluded unambiguous verifications in laboratory settings. Here, we realize the first fully controllable Fermi accelerator by colliding ultracold atoms against engineered movable potential barriers. We demonstrate that our Fermi accelerator, which is only 100 um in size, can produce ultracold atomic jets with velocities above half a meter per second. Adding dissipation, we also experimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra, which is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand, our work effectively opens the window to the study of high energy astrophysics with cold atoms, offering new capabilities for the understanding of phenomena such as diffusive acceleration at collisionless shocks. On the other, the performance of our Fermi accelerator is competitive with those of best-in-class accelerating methods used in quantum technology and quantum colliders, but with substantially simpler implementation and virtually no upper limit.</p>

In particular, we identify a crossover in the anisotropic pressure components: at high densities, the transverse pressure overtakes the longitudinal one when the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold.

The bio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured MoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication. Structural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of 2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90% degradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger tests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive species.

A tight binding model is employed, allowing for hopping between up to fourth nearest neighbors and anisotropic hopping parameters. In addition, we introduce short range electron-electron interactions which are necessary to stabilize the quartic semi-Dirac phase. Without interactions, or in the presence of long range correlations, the lattice is unstable towards formation of either anisotropic Dirac cones, or simple (quadratic) semi-Dirac phase.</p>

            <h2>Anomaly, Class Division, and Decoupling in Wealth Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaeseok Hur, Meesoon Ha, Hawoong Jeong</p>
            <p>Economic inequality is driven by the structure of agent networks, interactions among agents, and the abilities of individual agents. We provide a comprehensive picture of anomalous diffusion, economic class division, and bimodal wealth distribution in an agent-based model, where heterogeneous agent abilities and growth rates are tuned on sparse regular networks. In particular, we focus on the statistical characteristics of logarithmic scaled normalized wealth distributions with two ability parameters, assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and concentration $\mathcal{R}$. For the set of $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{R})$, temporal behaviors of log-wealth distributions reveal that the decoupling between different ability groups depends primarily on $\mathcal{R}$ and long-term inequality depends mainly on $\mathcal{A}$. In other words, class division and decoupling are driven by $\mathcal{R}$, while the super-diffusive nature in the leading class is driven by $\mathcal{A}$. Our findings highlight that hierarchical segregation of abilities, rather than ability differences alone, is a key driver of economic class stratification. Finally, our model provides a minimal, yet powerful framework for understanding the bimodal global income distribution observed over the past half century and highlights the critical role of network-level segregation in shaping economic inequality.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity via paramagnon and magnon exchange in a 2D near-ferromagnetic full metal and ferromagnetic half-metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary M Raines, Andrey V Chubukov</p>
            <p>We study superconductivity in paramagnetic and ferromagnetically-ordered phases in a two-dimensional electron system with parabolic fermionic dispersion and short-range repulsive interaction. In the paramagnetic phase, we find that a weak momentum dependence of a paramagnon propagator parametrically reduces the onset temperature for the pairing compared to that in phenomenological theories which assume a strong dispersion of a paramagnon and also changes the topology of the gap function. In the ferromagnetic phase, we show that the order instantly polarizes low-energy fermionic excitations. We derive the fully renormalized pairing interaction between low-energy fermions, mediated by two transverse Goldstone modes and show that it is attractive in a spatially-odd channel. The pairing temperature in the ferromagnetic phase is found to be a fraction of the Fermi energy, significantly larger than in the paramagnetic phase near the transition. Our results are relevant for understanding superconductivity in proximity to itinerant ferromagnetism in multi-valley graphene systems, particularly the ones with full valley and spin polarization.</p>

            <h2>Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Seung-Cheol Lee</p>
            <p>The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p>A new class of optical quasiparticles called magnetic excitons recently emerged in magnetic van der Waals materials. Akin to the highly effective strategies developed for electrons, the strong interactions of these excitons with the spin degree of freedom may provide innovative solutions for long-standing challenges in optics, such as steering the flow of energy and information. Here, we demonstrate transport of excitons by spin excitations in the van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Key results of our study are the observations of ultrafast, nearly isotropic exciton propagation substantially enhanced at the Neel temperature, transient contraction and expansion of the exciton clouds at low temperatures, as well as superdiffusive behavior in bilayer samples. These signatures largely defy description by commonly known exciton transport mechanisms and are related to the currents of incoherent magnons induced by laser excitation instead. We propose that the drag forces exerted by these currents can effectively imprint characteristic properties of spin excitations onto the motion of excitons. The universal nature of the underlying exciton-magnon scattering promises driving of excitons by magnons in other magnetic semiconductors and even in non-magnetic materials by proximity in heterostructures, merging the rich physics of magneto-transport with optics and photonics.</p>

            <h2>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avishek Das, Pieter Rein ten Wolde</p>
            <p>The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials are being widely researched for their interesting electronic properties. Their optoelectronic, mechanical and thermal properties can be finely modulated using a variety of methods, including strain, passivation, doping, and tuning of defect density. However, measuring defect densities, such as those associated with vacancy-type point defects, is inherently very difficult in atomically thin materials. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction can be used to measure defect density in ~15x20$\mu$m monolayer MoS$_2$, a prototypical 2D semiconductor, quickly and easily compared to standard methods. We present a simple analytic model, the lattice gas equation, that fully captures the relationship between atomic Bragg diffraction intensity and defect density. The model, combined with ab initio scattering calculations, shows that our technique can immediately be applied to a wide range of 2D materials, independent of sample chemistry or structure. Additionally, favourable signal scaling with lateral resolution makes wafer-scale characterisation immediately possible.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. We study both numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subjected to stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates that conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamic field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to the corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially and which decay with a hydrodynamic long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators that can be defined on four neighboring sites. All operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially, while the others show a slow hydrodynamic decay. While most hydrodynamic power laws seem to follow the analytical predictions, we also discuss cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between analytics and the finite-size numerical data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Pezzutto, Gabriele De Chiara, Stefano Gherardini</p>
            <p>We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Gamba, Bingyu Cui, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</p>

            <p>Noncentrosymmetric superconductors are expected to exhibit DC photocurrents even for irradiation frequencies below the superconducting gap. Such superconducting photocurrent are non-dissipative and track the quantum geometry of the superconducting state. Here we argue that superconducting photocurrent drives changes to the constitutive superconducting current phase relation (CPR) manifesting in a light controlled inductive response as well as altering the critical current. For chiral incident light, we find that superconducting photocurrent can transform reciprocal CPR into a non-reciprocal CPR producing a non-reciprocal inductance and light-controlled superconducting diode effect. These provide a protocol for measuring superconducting photocurrent and new tools for mapping the quantum geometry and order parameter of superconductors.</p>

            <p>We propose quasiperiodic chains with tunable mobility edge physics, as a promising platform for engineering long-range quantum entanglement. Using the generalized Aubry-André model, we show that the mobility edges play a key role in manipulating long-range indirect interactions in these systems. Near the mobility edge, critical states exhibit unexpectedly strong correlations between sites that share similar local structures, regardless of their spatial separation. Remarkably, by tuning the mobility edge across the Fermi level, one can induce both adiabatic transport and abrupt switching of entanglement between distant sites. These results highlight the potential of aperiodic structures for controlling nonlocal quantum correlations, opening new avenues for entanglement-based applications in quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <p>Controlling spin currents in topological insulators (TIs) is crucial for spintronics but challenged by the robustness of their chiral edge states, which impedes the spin manipulation required for devices like spin-field effect transistors (SFETs). We theoretically demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by synergistically applying circularly polarized light and gate-tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling (rSOC) to a 2D TI. Laser irradiation provides access to Floquet sidebands where rSOC induces controllable spin precession, leading to the generation of one-way, switchable spin-polarized photocurrents, an effect forbidden in equilibrium TIs. This mechanism effectively realizes SFET functionality within a driven TI, specifically operating within a distinct Floquet replica, offering a new paradigm for light-based control in topological spintronics.</p>

            <p>Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity, ferroelectricity, magnetism and charge density waves. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the Néel temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states.</p>

If Majorana zero modes indeed exist in this kind of trijunctions, coupling between them in multiple trijunction devices would be further expected. In this study, we fabricated Josephson devices containing two adjacent Josephson trijunctions on the surface of Sn-(Bi,Sb)2(Te,S)3, and observed that the minigap reopens for both trijunctions in their phase spaces where a closure would otherwise be expected if the trijunctions existed independently.

            <p>Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with higher hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL is beneficial to the global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the picture that the IL itself can drive the $d$-wave superconductivity while the OLs only serve as the charge reservoir. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</p>

            <p>One of the manifestations of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is that a tilted ferromagnet exhibits faster restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry after a quantum quench when starting from a larger tilt angle. This phenomenon has recently been observed experimentally in an ion trap that simulates a long-range spin chain. However, the underlying mechanism of the QME in the presence of long-range interactions remains unclear. Using the time-dependent spin-wave theory, we investigate the dynamical restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry and the QME in generic long-range spin systems. We show that quantum fluctuations of the magnetization drive the restoration of symmetry by melting the initial ferromagnetic order and are responsible for the QME. We find that this effect occurs across a wide parameter range in long-range systems, in contrast to its absence in some short-range counterparts.</p>

It can alternatively be described in terms of non-interacting Majorana fermions, can be solved exactly, and has a quantum spin-liquid ground state. Open boundaries then host Majorana zero modes (MZMs) that are robust against some types of disorder. We analyze the fate of the MZMs when they couple to an environment via a Lindblad master equation. By computing the time evolution of the density matrix, we find that when decoherence occurs, the steady state is mostly the maximally mixed state. Among the few exceptions is a parameter regime that realizes the superconducting Kitaev chain model with periodic boundary conditions. We consistently observe a quantum Zeno effect in the density matrix as well as in the entropy and fidelity, while it is not found in the energy gap of some gapped spin liquids. We thus present a comprehensive overview over MZMs coupled to a spin bath that is relevant to proposals to detect MZMs of Kitaev layers on surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>

            <p>The identification of high-temperature unconventional charge order and superconductivity in kagome quantum materials is pivotal for deepening our understanding of geometrically frustrated and correlated electron systems, and for harnessing their exotic properties in future quantum technologies. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkably rich phase diagram in the kagome superconductor YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, uncovered through a unique combination of muon spin rotation (${\mu}$SR), magnetotransport, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study reveals the emergence of a charge-ordered state with a propagation vector of (1/2, 0, 0), setting a record onset temperature of 800 K for such an order in a kagome system and for quantum materials more broadly. In addition, we observe time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking below $T_{2}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 25 K and field-induced magnetism below $T_{1}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 90 K, indicating the presence of a hidden magnetic state. These transitions are mirrored in the magnetoresistance data, which show a clear onset at ${\sim}$ $T_{1}^{*}$ and a pronounced increase below ${\sim}$ $T_{2}^{*}$, ultimately reaching a maximum magnetoresistance of 45${\%}$. Band structure calculations identify two van Hove singularities (VHSs) near the Fermi level, one of which resides within a flat band, suggesting a strong interplay between electronic correlations and emergent orders. At low temperatures, we find bulk superconductivity below $T_{\rm c}$ = 3.4 K, characterized by a pairing symmetry with either two isotropic full gaps or an anisotropic nodeless gap. Together, our findings point to a coexistence of high-temperature charge order, tunable magnetism, and multigap superconductivity in YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, positioning it as a compelling platform for exploring correlated kagome physics.</p>

            <p>Quantum materials with novel spin textures from strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are essential components for a wide array of proposed spintronic devices. Topological insulators have necessary strong SOC that imposes a unique spin texture on topological states and Rashba states that arise on the boundary, but there is no established methodology to control the spin texture reversibly. Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing Bi2Se3 films by altering the step-edge termination directly changes the strength of SOC and thereby modifies the Rashba strength of 1D edge states. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy shows that these Rashba edge states arise and subsequently vanish through the Se functionalization and reduction process of the step edges. The observations are corroborated by density functional theory calculations, which show that a subtle chemical change of edge termination fundamentally alters the underlying electronic structure. Importantly, we experimentally demonstrated fully reversible and repeatable switching of Rashba edge states across multiple cycles at room temperature. The results imply Se functionalization as a practical method to control SOC and spin texture of quantum states in topological insulators.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</p>

Recent studies have revealed the nonequilibrium characters of the plasmonic hot carriers and their nonadiabatic coupling to molecular vibrations. Yet, the precise mechanism of plasmonic photocatalysis remains elusive and controversial. Here, we present a unified description of thermal and nonthermal hot carriers in the dynamics of vibrational excitation and photodissocation, where a quantitative comparison between the two mechanisms can be made. We revisit a well-studied system, O$_2$ dissociation on silver nanoparticles. The nonthermal hot carriers are found to promote molecular dissociation in the low-temperature or high-intensity regime. With increasing laser intensity, the dissociation rate exhibits a transition from a linear to nonlinear dependence due to the onset of vibrational heating as observed in experiment.

            <h2>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Yves Desaules, Thomas Iadecola, Jad C. Halimeh</p>
            <p>Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be locally avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Emergent magnetism and spin liquids in an extended Hubbard description of moiré bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenhao Song, Urban F. P. Seifert, Leon Balents, Hong-Chen Jiang</p>
            <p>Motivated by twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study an extended Hubbard model with both on-site and off-site repulsive interactions, in which Mott insulating states with concomitant charge order occur at fractional fillings. To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagomé geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moiré TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenyuan Qiu, Zhihui Luo, Xunwu Hu, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ over 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks an important step in the field of nickelate superconductors. Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally observed nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. In addition, by analysing the orbital-resolved pairing configurations and their projections onto Fermi surface, we find that the nodeless feature of $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Moreover, we identify a formation of the inplane inter-orbital $d$-wave pairing between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which can even enhance the dominated interlayer $s_\pm$-wave.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Veloza-Diaz, Friederike Schmid, Robinson Cortes-Huerto, Pietro Ballone, Nancy C. Forero-Martinez</p>
            <p>A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.</p>

            <h2>The Symmetry Taco: Equivalences between Gapped, Gapless, and Mixed-State SPTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Qi, Ramanjit Sohal, Xie Chen, David T. Stephen, Abhinav Prem</p>
            <p>Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences, including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in $1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state ``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory for the pseudogap and the transition to $d$-wave superconductivity in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshit Pandey, Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Ravi Shanker, Sayantan Sharma, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits "Fermi arcs", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).</p>

While the flat bands near zero energy are central to many correlated phenomena, their interaction with higher-energy remote bands remains less understood. Here, we investigate these hybridization processes as a function of the twist angle and analyze their impact on the charge distribution, topological properties such as Chern number, quantum metric, and orbital magnetic energy. We identify multiple topological phase transitions between magic angles, driven by band inversions at high-symmetry points in momentum space. Notably, the central bands can exhibit phases with Chern numbers C = 2, revealing previously unreported topological states in TBG.</p>

            <p>It is known that in contrast to homogeneous ferromagnetism helical magnetism is compatible with superconductivity and causes only weak suppressive effect on superconducting critical temperature. Despite this fact it induces p-wave triplet superconducting correlations in homogeneous superconducting systems with intrinsic helical magnetism. The combination of these two facts indicates a high potential for the application of such systems in disspationless spintronics. For this reason here we investigate the proximity effect in atomically thin superconductor/helical (conical) magnet heterostructures (SC/HM). It is shown that in SC/HM heterostructures the strength of the proximity effect and, in particular, amplitude of p-wave triplet superconductivity and the degree of superconductivity suppression are complex functions of the magnet exchange field and filling factors of the magnet and the superconductor. Further we demonstrate that $p$-wave correlations ensure transport spin supercurrent flow in the SC/HM heterostructure with conical magnets and unveil the physical relationship between the transport spin supercurrent, degree of the magnet conicity and internal structure of p-wave correlations in the momentum space.</p>

            <h2>MBFormer: A General Transformer-based Learning Paradigm for Many-body Interactions in Real Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Hou, Xian Xu, Jinyuan Wu, Diana Y. Qiu</p>
            <p>Recently, radical progress in machine learning (ML) has revolutionized computational materials science, enabling unprecedentedly rapid materials discovery and property prediction, but the quantum many-body problem -- which is the key to understanding excited-state properties, ranging from transport to optics -- remains challenging due to the complexity of the nonlocal and energy-dependent interactions. Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free, transformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire many-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention mechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field states. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in predicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton oscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is trained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute error (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and exciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body correlations. Our framework provides an end-to-end platform from ground states to general many-body prediction in real materials, which could serve as a foundation model for computational materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Johns, Nitin Yadav, Anand Vinod, Kuljeet Kaur, Jino George</p>
            <p>Strong coupling in the conventional sense requires that the Rabi cycling process between two interacting states is faster than other dissipation rates. Some recent experimental findings show intriguing properties that were attributed to polaritonic states (e.g., plexcitons) even though the above criterion is not satisfied. Here, we theoretically predict and provide experimental evidence of polariton-like behavior in a system that does not show Rabi splitting. The photoluminescence of an exciton-cavity system consisting of a two-dimensional exciton monolayer (tungsten disulfide, WS2) coupled to a planar, open, one-mirror optical cavity configuration is studied. We experimentally observed a transition from the weak coupling regime crossing an exceptional point to form polariton-like states by varying the coupling strength and the cavity loss. Our observations are fully in agreement with a theoretical quasi-normal mode analysis, which predicts this transition and confirms the presence of exceptional points in the system. These results provide evidence that polaritonic effects can be experimentally observed even when the conventional strong coupling condition is not satisfied.</p>

            <h2>Revealing THz optical signatures of Shiba-state-induced gapped and gapless superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, R. Y. Fang, S. L. Zhang, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Understanding the interplay of superconductivity and magnetic disorder has been a long-standing challenge. Here we report a fully self-consistent calculation of the complex renormalization by exchange interactions and hence the complete phase diagram of conventional $s$-wave superconductors with magnetic impurities as well as the related physical properties including the optical response. We show that a small amount of magnetic disorder can drive the system into a gapless superconducting state, where the single-particle excitation gap vanishes whereas the superconducting order parameter $\Delta_0$ remains finite. In this phase, the linear optical conductivity exhibits a finite absorption over the low-frequency regime, particularly for photon energies below the conventional threshold $2|\Delta_0|$, even at low temperatures, in sharp contrast to the gapped state. The nonlinear response, however, remains coherent and is dominated by the Higgs-mode dynamics rather than gapless quasiparticle background. These findings reveal a fundamental distinction between dissipative single-particle excitations and coherent collective dynamics of the condensate, a feature likely general to other gapless superconductors, and introduces a fundamentally different detection scheme, using THz spectroscopy to probe the signatures of Shiba states.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism-induced non-collinear superconducting diode effect and unidirectional superconducting transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Current studies of non-reciprocal superconducting (SC) transport have centered on the forward-backward asymmetry of the critical current measured along a single axis. In most realizations, this diode effect is achieved via introducing ferromagnetism or applying an external magnetic field, which drives system into an effective Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state but often at the cost of severely suppressing the SC gap and thus compromising device robustness. Here we propose and theoretically demonstrate that coupling a conventional $s$-wave SC thin film to a $d$-wave altermagnet offers a more resilient alternative. The momentum-dependent spin splitting inherent to altermagnets induces a non-collinear SC-diode effect in the BCS state, with the critical-current anisotropy exhibiting a fourfold ($C_4$) symmetry. Upon entering the FF state at large splitting, this anisotropy gradually evolves into a unidirectional ($C_1$) pattern. Crucially, the FF pairing momentum locks to the discrete crystal axes, eliminating the rotational Goldstone mode and preserving a sizable SC gap without any abrupt or significant suppression. These combined features make the altermagnetic proximity an appealing platform to engineer symmetry-protected, energy-efficient and programmable SC diodes for next-generation electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Bilayer graphene, forming moiré superlattices, possesses distinct electronic and optical properties derived from the hybridization of energy band and the emergence of van Hove singularities depending on its twist angle. Extensive research has been conducted on the global characteristics of moiré superlattice induced by long-range periodicity. However, limited attention has been given to the local properties within a moiré unit cell, which undoubtedly differ due to the variations in three-dimensional atomic arrangement. Here we demonstrate the highly localized excitations of carbon 1s electrons to unoccupied van Hove singularities in a twisted bilayer graphene using an electron energy loss spectroscopy based on a monochromated transmission electron microscope. The core-level excitations associated with the van Hove singularities show a systematic twist angle dependence which is analogous to the optical excitations. Furthermore, local variations in those core-level van Hove singularity peaks within a moiré unit cell have been corroborated for the first time, which can originate from core-exciton lifetimes and band modifications influenced by the local stacking geometry.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of quantum vortex dipoles in a strongly interacting, spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid at zero temperature. Using fully microscopic time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that the dipole trajectory is strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of spin polarization. The resulting forces on the vortices include both longitudinal (dissipative) and transverse components, leading to deflection and shrinking of the dipole during propagation. For moderate polarization, vortex dipoles are deflected and lose energy, while for larger imbalances, they are rapidly annihilated. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spin-imbalanced Fermi gases contain a spatially nonuniform normal component even at zero temperature. We show that vortex dipoles serve as sensitive probes of this component, offering a route to indirectly detect exotic superfluid phases such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and related inhomogeneous condensates.</p>

            <p>Non-equilibrium control of electronic properties in condensed matter systems can result in novel phenomena. In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We study the local relaxation of closed quantum systems through the relative entropy between the reduced density matrix and its long time limit. We show, using analytic arguments combined with numerical checks, that this relative entropy can be very well approximated by an entropy difference, affording a significant computational advantage. We go on to relate this to the entanglement asymmetry of the subsystem with respect to time translation invariance. In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect, wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium. We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial states.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of charge fluctuations after homogeneous quantum quenches in one-dimensional systems with ballistic transport. For short but macroscopic times where the non-trivial dynamics is largely dominated by long-range correlations, a simple expression for the associated full counting statistics can be obtained by hydrodynamic arguments. This formula links the non-equilibrium charge fluctuation after the quench to the fluctuations of the associated current after a charge-biased inhomogeneous modification of the original quench which corresponds to the paradigmatic partitioning protocol. Under certain assumptions, the fluctuations in the latter case can be expressed by explicit closed form formulas in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities via the Ballistic Fluctuations Theory. In this work, we identify precise physical conditions for the applicability of a fully hydrodynamic theory, and provide a detailed analysis explicitly demonstrating how such conditions are met and how this leads to such hydrodynamic treatment. We discuss these conditions at length in non-relativistic free fermions, where calculations become feasible and allow for cross-checks against exact results. In physically relevant cases, strong long-range correlations can complicate the hydrodynamic picture, but our formula still correctly reproduces the first cumulants.</p>

We analyze the long-time behavior and obtain the temporal scaling of the first two moments of any stochastic functional of the random walk when the resetting time distribution exhibits a power-law tail. When the resetting times PDF has finite moments, the probability density of any functional converges to a delta function centered at its mean, indicating an ergodic phase. We explicitly examine the case of the half-occupation time and derive the ergodicity breaking parameter, the first two moments, and the limiting distribution when the resetting time distribution follows a power-law tail, for both Brownian and subdiffusive random walks. We characterize the three different shapes of the limiting distribution as a function of the exponent of the resetting distribution. Our theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo simulations, which show excellent agreement with the analytical results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baruch Meerson, Pavel V. Sasorov</p>
            <p>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $-1/2<H<0$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly anti-persistent regime $-1/2<H<0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The extended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation function. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2<H<0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2<H<0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.</p>

            <h2>Cluster-diagrammatic D-TRILEX approach to non-local electronic correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Félix Fossati, Evgeny A. Stepanov</p>
            <p>In this work, we extend the theoretical approach known as "D-TRILEX", developed for solving correlated electronic systems, to a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</p>

            <h2>New universality classes govern the critical and multicritical behavior of an active Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Wong, Chiu Fan Lee</p>
            <p>The Ising model is one of the most well known models in statistical physics, with its critical behavior governed by the Wilson-Fisher universality class (UC). When active motility is incorporated into the Ising model by, e.g., dictating that the spins' directional movements follow their orientations, the spin number density necessarily constitutes a soft mode in the hydrodynamic description, and can therefore modify the scaling behavior of the system. Here, we show that this is indeed the case in a critical active Ising model in which density can impede the system's collective motion. Specifically, we use a perturbative dynamic renormalization group method to the one-loop level to uncover three new UCs, one of which supersedes the Wilson-Fisher UC to become the generic UC that governs the critical behavior of the active Ising model.</p>

            <h2>Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byjesh N. Radhakrishnan, Francesco Serafin, Thomas L. Schmidt, Etienne Fodor</p>
            <p>In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Maire, Andrea Plati, Frank Smallenburg, Giuseppe Foffi</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which transition from a state of pure vertical motion to a horizontal diffusive state upon increased density. Depending on the details of the system, we observe both continuous and discontinuous transitions in numerical simulations. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to a coarse-grained model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankit Patidar, Gaurav Goel</p>
            <p>Phyllosilicate clays have diverse applications in packaging industries and are found highly suitable for formulation, including thermoplastic starch (TPS), polyethylene (PE), or their combination. We developed CG MARTINI-3 parameters of the pyrophyllite using Lifshitz theory and experimental surface tension data. These initial bead assignments of pyrophyllite and periodic tetramethylammonium-montmorillonite (TMA-MMT) sheet were fine-tuned using optimal reproduction of structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties obtained via all-atom (AA) simulation of TPS with a periodic pyrophyllite sheet. These developed models predicted the correct AA radial distribution function and two-body excess entropy for polymer-sorbitol pairs, showcasing the robustness of the developed CG model in predicting the properties not used in parameterization. These composite simulations revealed acceleration (for pyrophyllite) or retardation (for TMA-MMT) of khun segment dynamics (compared to melt) with the depletion of polymer near the surface. The developed CG parameters were used to investigate the long-time behavior of TPS-polyethylene (PE) melt and their Cloisite-15A-based composite systems. The coordination number indicated compatibilization of the TPS-PE phase, achieved by binding TPS through its bare polar surface and PE via alkyl-mediated interactions, which consequently reduced the TPS-PE interfacial surface tension from 45 mN/m to 13.06 mN/m. Additionally, high TPS-clay coordination, sustained localization of clay at the TPS-PE interface, and clay aggregation observed in CG simulation closely agree with experimental observations. Further, the CG model effectively captured the clay-mediated variation in the overall morphology of the TPS-PE system and their direct impact on chain conformational properties, making this CG model highly suitable for a material design perspective.</p>

            <p>Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.</p>

By analyzing the band population, we confirm the quasiparticle nature of the system both in the presence and absence of an external laser field.

These transitions exhibit Rabi-like oscillations, attributed to the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS), further reinforcing the quasiparticle character of the model.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Ricardo Guevara Garban, Yves Chemisky, Étienne Prulière, Michaël Clément</p>
            <p>We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean, macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.</p>

            <p>We develop a general framework for studying phases of mixed states with strong and weak symmetries, including non-invertible or categorical symmetries. The central idea is to consider a purification of the mixed state density matrix, which lives in a doubled Hilbert space. We propose a systematic classification of phases in this doubled Hilbert space, relying crucially on the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach. This framework applies not only to group symmetries but also, importantly, to non-invertible symmetries. We illustrate the approach in 1+1d to classify phases with strong (non-)invertible symmetries, which include strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) phases and mixed strong/weak symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs). We also develop an approach for studying symmetries that involve a combination of strong and weak symmetries. A noteworthy example of this has weak non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry and strong $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The continuum description is complemented by a lattice model analysis informed by the SymTFT framework.</p>

            <p>Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.</p>

            <p>With a growing interest in securing user data within the internet-of-things (IoT), embedded encryption has become of paramount importance, requiring light-weight high-quality Random Number Generators (RNGs). Emerging stochastic device technologies produce random numbers from stochastic physical processes at high quality, however, their generated random number streams are adversely affected by process and supply voltage variations, which can lead to bias in the generated streams. In this work, we present an adaptive variation-resilient RNG capable of extracting unbiased encryption-grade random number streams from physically driven entropy sources, for embedded cryptography applications. As a proof of concept, we employ a stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (sMTJ) device as an entropy source. The impact of variations in the sMTJ is mitigated by employing an adaptive digitizer with an adaptive voltage reference that dynamically tracks any stochastic signal drift or deviation, leading to unbiased random bit stream generation. The generated unbiased bit streams, due to their higher entropy, then only need to undergo simplified post-processing. Statistical randomness tests based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite are conducted on bit streams obtained using simulations and FPGA entropy source emulation experiments, validating encryption-grade randomness at a significantly reduced hardware cost, and across a wide range of process-induced device variations and supply voltage fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Metasurface with bound states in the continuum (BICs) offer exceptional potential for optical sensing due to their inherently high quality (Q) factors. However, the detection of symmetry-protected BICs remains experimentally challenging due to their non-radiative nature. Introducing slight asymmetry makes these resonances observable, though it reduces the Q-factor. In real devices, intrinsic material losses further affect the resonance behavior and sensing performance. While it is often assumed that sensing is optimized at the critical coupling when radiative and non-radiative losses are balanced, the precise conditions for achieving the best limit of detection (LOD) and figure-of-merit (FOM) remain under active discussion. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate BIC-based sensing in the terahertz (THz) range. We demonstrate that the LOD exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on asymmetry, reaching an unexpected optimum where radiative and non-radiative losses are not equal. Moreover, we show that this optimum differs between reflection and transmission sensing schemes. Our results provide practical guidelines for optimizing Q-factor, sensitivity, and signal amplitude together, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental limits of BIC-based sensing.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems possess exotic localization phenomena beyond their Hermitian counterparts, exhibiting massive accumulation of eigenstates at the system boundaries with different scaling behaviors. In this study, we investigate two weakly coupled non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson chains under Möbius boundary conditions (MBCs), and reveal the coexistence of two distinct localization behaviors for eigenstates. Namely, eigenstates exhibit non-Hermitian skin effect in one chain and scale-free localization in the other. Notably, the localization characteristics of eigenstates can exchange between the two chains depending on their eigenenergies. This phenomenon is found to emerge from the critical behaviors induced by the weak interchain coupling, which can even be enhanced by MBCs in comparison \red{to} the system under other boundary conditions. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian localization and criticality, and offer new insights into engineering tunable edge-localized states in synthetic quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as this http URL we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror and time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Hence they do not lead to a field-driven photocurrent individually, but when superposed can break individual symmetries and generate photocurrents. For unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase the tailored light exhibits TRS while breaking all other crystal symmetries, which imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems as we show both theoretically and experimentally. We employ state-of-the-art \textit{ab-initio} simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.</p>

We characterise the crossover in the dynamical scaling from $\tau\sim 1/(\nu k^2)$ at finite viscosity to $\tau\sim 1/(u_{\rm rms}k)$ in the inviscid limit, where $\tau$ is the decorrelation time. We show that, although the static properties of spectrally truncated Euler flows radically differ from their hydrodynamical limit, they share a similar emergent $k^{-1}$ dynamical scaling.</p>

            <p>We report the first synthesis of halogenated organic molecules via pulsed laser ablation in liquid, specifically halopolyynes, i.e., carbon atomic wires terminated by halogen atoms, and the first Raman characterization of long halogenated wires. Using dichloromethane and a dibromomethane-containing solution, we produced a polydisperse mixtures of monohalogeanted (HC$_n$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_n$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=6-20). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled us to separate and analyze these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectroscopy confirmed their molecular structures. Their formation mechanism involves carbon chain polymerization and termination by halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed that halogen terminations act as weak electron donors, slightly affecting conjugation, bond length alternation, and moderately redshifting vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement, an emerging signature behavior of carbyne-like systems. Vibrational anharmonicity measurements confirm that halopolyynes follow the universal anharmonicity law previously proposed for carbyne-like materials, solidifying their classification within this family. These findings not only expand the synthetic toolbox for carbon atomic wires but also establish halopolyynes as a versatile platform for tailoring wire terminations and developing novel materials with tunable electronic and optical properties.</p>

We introduce an in situ UV resonance Raman approach for real-time monitoring of the growth of carbon atomic wires during pulsed laser ablation in liquid without perturbing the synthesis environment. We track single-chain species' growth dynamics, achieving size selectivity by exploiting the peculiar optoelectronic properties of carbon wires and the tunability of synchrotron radiation. We systematically explore diverse solvents, finding size- and solvent-dependent production rates linked to the solvent's C/H ratio and carbonization tendency. Carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics reveal a complex interplay between formation and degradation, leading to an equilibrium. Water, lacking in carbon atoms and reduced polyynes' solubility, yields fewer wires with rapid saturation. Organic solvents exhibit enhanced productivity and near-linear growth, attributed to additional carbon from solvent dissociation and low relative polarity. Exploring the dynamics of the saturation regime provides new insights into advancing carbon atomic wires' synthesis via PLAL. Understanding carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics can contribute to optimizing PLAL processes for nanomaterial synthesis.</p>

            <p>We operationally uncover aspects of wave/particle duality for the open driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model in its strong-coupling limit. We lay special emphasis on the vacuum Rabi resonance, and determine the corresponding normalized intensity-field correlation function via mapping to ordinary resonance fluorescence. We demonstrate that temporal wave-particle fluctuations of light emanating from an established vacuum Rabi resonance are explicitly non-classical, while the limit of vanishing spontaneous emission restores detailed balance. When photon blockade sets in, individual realizations show a rapidly increasing frequency of fluctuations towards the two-photon resonance, arising as a direct consequence of a resolved JC spectrum. About the two-photon resonance peak, spontaneous emissions are more likely to revive a high-frequency quantum beat in the conditioned electromagnetic field amplitude than photons escaping out of the cavity mode. The beat originates from a coherent superposition of the first excited JC couplet states, and sets the background against which nonclassical phase shifts are observed in the conditioned quadrature amplitudes. We also find that the onset of steady-state bimodality reduces the variation of the normalized intensity-field correlation, at the expense of its temporal symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Schorlepp, Katharina Kormann, Jeremiah Lübke, Tobias Schäfer, Rainer Grauer</p>
            <p>Sampling synthetic turbulent fields as a computationally tractable surrogate for direct numerical simulations (DNS) is an important practical problem in various applications, and allows to test our physical understanding of the main features of real turbulent flows. Reproducing higher-order Eulerian correlation functions, as well as Lagrangian particle statistics, requires an accurate representation of coherent structures of the flow in the synthetic turbulent fields. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic coherent-structure based method for sampling synthetic random fields, based on a superposition of instanton configurations - an instanton gas - from the field-theoretic formulation of turbulence. We discuss sampling strategies for ensembles of instantons, both with and without interactions and including Gaussian fluctuations around them. The resulting Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics are evaluated numerically and compared against DNS results, as well as Gaussian and log-normal cascade models that lack coherent structures. The instanton gas approach is illustrated via the example of one-dimensional Burgers turbulence throughout this paper, and we show that already a canonical ensemble of non-interacting instantons without fluctuations reproduces DNS statistics very well. Finally, we outline extensions of the method to higher dimensions, in particular to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence for future applications to cosmic ray propagation.</p>

            <h2>Sliding of a liquid spherical drop in an external fluid: a generalization of the Hadamard-Rybczynski equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Lebedev-Stepanov</p>
            <p>An analytical solution is obtained for the problem of the slow movement of a small drop of liquid in another immiscible liquid in an infinitely large reservoir with the boundary condition of partial slip at the liquid-liquid interface. That generalizes the conventional Navier condition of partial slip that given at the liquid-solid interface, since the solid (rigid) state can be considered as a liquid with infinite viscosity. A generalized Hadamard-Rybczynski equation (HRE) is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the conventional HRE. For infinite viscosity of the droplet, generalized HRE becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the all components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids, including diagonal tensor components. Generalized HRE is applied to the interpretation of the experiment in which the velocity of falling of a spherical droplet of silicate oil in the castor oil is investigated. Streamlines have been built corresponding to both the Hadamard-Rybczynski model and the partial slip approach. Presumably, the best applicability of the generalized HRE should be expected for the interface of hydrophobic liquid and hydrophilic one (water - hydrocarbons, water - higher alcohols, in general: aqueous emulsions, water - lipophilic organic liquids and oils, etc.). These are quite important emulsions in practical terms, for example, for the oil industry and medicine. Experimental methods for determining the slip length are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Based Modeling of Perception as Emergent from contextualized Internal Evaluation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Fanfarillo, Gustavo Diez, Victor Gómez Mayordomo, Miguel Bosch, J. Ricardo Arias-Gonzalez, Belén Valenzuela</p>
            <p>We develop a microscopic model of perception of an interoceptive sensation in which spin-like variables encode an organism's internal evaluation of embodied vital norms associated with the sensation. Spins can take positive, negative, or neutral values. These local valorizations interact on a lattice embedded in the environmental context, and their collective configuration gives rise to a macroscopic perceptual state. By applying a coarse-graining procedure to a family of symmetric spin models, we derive a macroscopic Landau-type functional that makes explicit the mechanism by which key phenomenological features of perception, emerge from microscopic evaluative interactions. A central result is that the inclusion of a neutral evaluative state fundamentally alters the structure of the perceptual landscape, enhancing entropy, lowering the critical threshold, and increasing sensitivity to contextual input. These results establish a principled link between microscopic evaluative processes and large-scale perceptual organization, offering a flexible framework for integrating perceptual regulation and neurobiological modeling. The model integrates notions of neuroscience and cognitive science using the formalism of condensed matter field theory and providing novel theoretical insights and experimental predictions for conditions such as mental disorders and chronic pain.</p>

            <h2>On-chip magnon polaritons in the ultrastrong coupling regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shugo Yoshii, Manuel Müller, Ryo Ohshima, Matthias Althammer, Yuichiro Ando, Hans Huebl, Masashi Shiraishi</p>
            <p>Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase this http URL, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</p>

            <p>A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuexin Xu, Kuljeet Kaur, Chloé Vignes, Mohammad H. Ansari, John M. Martinis</p>
            <p>We present a scalable framework for accurately modeling many-body interactions in surface-code quantum processor units (QPUs). Combining a concise diagrammatic formalism with high-precision numerical methods, our approach efficiently evaluates high-order, long-range Pauli string couplings and maps complete chip layouts onto exact effective Hamiltonians. Applying this method to surface-code architectures, such as Google's Sycamore lattice, we identify three distinct operational regimes: computationally stable, error-dominated, and hierarchy-inverted. Our analysis reveals that even modest increases in residual qubit-qubit crosstalk can invert the interaction hierarchy, driving the system from a computationally favorable phase into a topologically ordered regime. This framework thus serves as a powerful guide for optimizing next-generation high-fidelity surface-code hardware and provides a pathway to investigate emergent quantum many-body phenomena.</p>

            <p>Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) behavior in one-dimensional systems has been predicted and shown to occur at semiconductor-to-metal transitions within two-dimensional materials. Reports of one-dimensional defects hosting a Fermi liquid or a TLL have suggested a dependence on the underlying substrate, however, unveiling the physical details of electronic contributions from the substrate require cross-correlative investigation. Here, we study TLL formation within defectively engineered WS$_2$ atop graphene, where band structure and the atomic environment is visualized with nano angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, and non-contact atomic force microscopy. Correlations between the local density of states and electronic band dispersion elucidated the electron transfer from graphene into a TLL hosted by one-dimensional metal (1DM) defects. It appears that the vertical heterostructure with graphene and the induced charge transfer from graphene into the 1DM is critical for the formation of a TLL.</p>

            <p>Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors represent a natural source of optical non-linearity, thanks to their intrinsically anharmonic nature. Here we derive the selection rules behind non-linear plasmonics showing its dependence on plasmonic branches hidden to other spectroscopies, like RIXS. We benchmark our results for the case of layered cuprates, showing how in a layered system the combined effect of plasmon dispersion and light polarization can move the resonance of the bilayer system away from the plasma edge measured in linear spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate the dependence of the non-linear THz response on the convoluted plasmon dispersion in a momentum region complementary to RIXS, and offer a possible perspective for the generation of THz pulses by artificially designed Josephson heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anirudha Menon, Anwesha Chattopadhyay, K. Sengupta, Arnab Sen</p>
            <p>We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify. This emergence leads to a critical theory which seems to be different from those in the Ising universality class. Instead, within the data obtained from finite-size scaling analysis, we find the critical theory to be not inconsistent with Ashkin-Teller universality in the sense that the transitions of the model reproduces a critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$ close to unity. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>Materials with high thermal conductivity are needed to conduct heat away from hot spots in high power electronics and optoelectronic devices. Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has a high thermal conductivity due to its special phonon dispersion relation. Previous experimental studies of c-BAs report a room-temperature thermal conductivity between 1000 and 1300 W m-1 K-1. We synthesized high purity isotopically enriched c-BAs single crystals with room-temperature thermal conductivity of around 1500 W m-1 K-1. Using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), we measured thermal conductivity and found a 1/T2 temperature dependence between 300 K and 600 K - slightly stronger than predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models. Brillouin and Raman scattering revealed minimal changes in phonon frequencies over the same temperature range, suggesting that the observed 1/T2 dependence is not caused by temperature dependent changes in phonon dispersion. To probe defect densities in the BAs crystals we studied, we conducted transient reflectivity microscopy (TRM) measurements of absorption at sub-bandgap photon energies. We observe a correlation between TRM signal intensity and thermal conductivity. Notably, samples with thermal conductivity near 1500 W m-1 K-1 still exhibited nonzero TRM signals, suggesting the presence of defects despite the high thermal conductivity.</p>

            <p>Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated nanoparticles derived from natural cellulose, with potential applications ranging from rheological modifiers and emulsion stabilizers to photonic pigments and sensors. For most applications, precise control over CNC morphology and surface chemistry is essential, but the relationship between process parameters, CNC characteristics, and their resulting behavior is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of centrifugation and ionic strength on CNC morphology after dialysis using transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron diffraction. We find that the centrifugation step commonly applied during CNC purification promotes the formation of compact composite nanoparticles made of aligned crystallites, referred to as 'bundles', that are associated preferentially along their hydrophobic faces. In stark contrast, transient exposure to high ionic strength leads to fractal-like, irregular composite nanoparticles. We then examine the consequence of these morphological differences on the cholesteric self-organization of the CNCs: aligned bundles reduce the cholesteric pitch in suspension, causing a blue-shift in the color of dish-cast photonic films, while misaligned particles promote gelation, producing colorless films. This study reveals the importance of sample history, in particular, the often-disregarded purification steps, on CNC characteristics and their ensemble behavior, thereby unlocking new routes for tailoring this promising nanomaterial.</p>

            <p>The interplay between strong electronic correlations and the inherent frustration of certain lattice geometries is a common mechanism for the formation of nontrivial states of matter. In this work, we theoretically explore the collective electronic effects in the monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a recently discovered triangular lattice Mott insulator. Our advanced many-body numerical simulations predict the emergence of a phase separation region upon doping this material. Notably, in close proximity to the phase separation, the static charge susceptibility undergoes a drastic change and reveals a distinctive bow-tie structure in momentum space. The appearance of such a fingerprint in the context of spin degrees of freedom would indicate the formation of a spin ice state. This finding allows us to associate the observed phase separation to a charge ice state, a state with a remarkable power law dependence of both the effective exchange interaction and correlations between electronic densities in real space.</p>

Our wave function is constructed based on the occupation numbers and natural orbitals of the one-body density matrix. We demonstrate that the newly found wave function describes the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas under any external potential. By expressing the proposed wave function in the framework of second quantization, we show that the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas is a number-conserving Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state. We provide explicit expressions for the corresponding coefficients that describe the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas as a number-conserving BCS state. Additionally, the suitable form of the proposed wave function in second quantization allows us to derive the necessary expectation values to experimentally detect pairing in the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. With this, we prove and show how to detect that the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas not only exhibits non-trivial quantum correlations but is also a paired state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Tanogami</p>
            <p>Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for shell models. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, by assuming the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the Kolmogorov multiplier, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.</p>

            <p>We present a bosonized effective field theory for a 2d Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field using the coadjoint orbit approach, which was recently developed as a nonlinear bosonization method in phase space for Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the guiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in noncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level degeneracy ($N_{\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the resulting theory describes $N_{\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating in \emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the bosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\theta$-term. By properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and magnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat, Landau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de Haas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological $\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated gapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of bosonization.</p>

By precisely varying the electron density, we demonstrate tunability of plasmon mode frequencies over several GHz. Additionally, we find that the power dependence of these modes can be used to investigate both homogeneous and inhomogeneous sources of spectral broadening. These results demonstrate the versatility of electrons on helium for probing collective excitations in low-dimensional Coulomb liquids and solids, and demonstrate a path for integrating engineered plasmons in electrons on helium with hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic systems.</p>

Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</p>

We find that the Hund coupling plays a crucial role in rearranging the orbital populations and in generating the heavy mass and low coherence scale. The latter is found to be approximately 1-2 Kelvin, even though the most correlated orbital is found to be significantly doped ~10% away from half-filling. A flat quasiparticle band appears near the Fermi level as a result of the strong electronic correlations. Finally, we discuss our results in comparison to experiments.</p>

            <p>The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.</p>

            <p>What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.</p>

It has also been desired to explore quantum-mechanical SUSY in microscopic lattice models.

Moreover, we utilize the supercharge dynamics to demonstrate the SUSY property of the model under investigation: the expectation value of supercharge freezes under time evolution for supersymmetric lattice models in contrast to the trivial oscillation for generic nonsupersymmetric lattice models. The proposal is validated on direct simulation of Rydberg atom arrays' dynamics and ready for experiments.

            <p>Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase. Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.</p>

            <p>The physics of glass has been a significant topic of interest for decades. Dynamical facilitation is widely believed to be an important characteristic of glassy dynamics, but the precise mechanism is still under debate. We propose a lattice model of glass called the facilitated random walk (FRW). Each particle performs continuous time random walk in the presence of its own random local kinetic constraints. The particles do not interact energetically. Instead, they interact kinetically with a hopping rate resampling rule under which motions of a particle can randomly perturb the local kinetic constraints of other particles. This dynamic interaction is reversible, following a rate restoration rule. A step-by-step reversal of the particle motions exactly restore the previous constraints, modeling randomness quenched in the configuration space of glass. The model exhibits stretched exponential relaxation and dynamical heterogeneity typical of glasses. Despite the lack of explicit facilitation rule, the FRW shows facilitation behaviors closely analogous to those of the kinetically constrained models (KCM). The FRW is a coarse-grained version of the distinguishable particle lattice model (DPLM) and this exemplifies that compatible defect and atomistic models can complement each other on the study of glass.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Competing phases of HfO$_2$ from unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubo Qi, Karin M. Rabe</p>
            <p>We carry out first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the complex energy landscape and competing phases of HfO$_2$ can be understood from the four unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure of HfO$_2$ with the space group $Cmma$. We consider structures generated from the $Cmma$ reference structure by all possible combinations of the zone center and zone boundary modes belonging to the unstable flat phonon branches. We find 12 distinct locally-stable structures, of which 5 correspond to well-known phases. We also show that 8 of these 12 structures can be described as period-2 superlattices of the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ (oIII), ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ (oIV), monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (m) and distorted monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (dm) structures. We demonstrate how the unstable flat phonon bands can explain the atomically thin grain boundaries in the various types of superlattices. Finally, we point out that arbitrary-period HfO$_2$ superlattices derived from the 6 different types of period-2 superlattices are expected to form based on the flatness of the unstable phonon branches. The organizing principle provided by this work deepens our understanding of the underlying physics in the phase stability of HfO$_2$ and provides guidance for functional phase stabilization.</p>

            <p>We combine ultra-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering and quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study thermodynamics and spin excitations in the spin-supersolid phase of the triangular lattice XXZ antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ under zero and non-zero magnetic field. BKT transitions signaling the onset of Ising and supersolid order are clearly identified, and the Wannier entropy is experimentally recovered just above the supersolid phase. At low temperatures, with an experimental resolution of about 23 $\mu$eV, no discrete coherent magnon modes are resolved within a broad scattering continuum. Alongside gapless excitations, a pseudo-Goldstone mode with a 0.06 meV gap is observed. A second, higher-energy continuum replaces single-spin-flip excitations of the Ising model. Under applied fields, the continuum evolves into coherent spin waves, with Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone sectors responding differently. The experiments and simulations show excellent quantitative agreement.</p>

            <h2>Subnanometric control of coupling between WS$_2$ monolayers with a molecular spacer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sara A. Elrafei, Tom T. C. Sistermans, Alberto G. Curto</p>
            <p>Stacking monolayer semiconductors into heterostructures allows for control of their optical and electronic properties, offering advantages for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. Specifically, adding a thin spacer between monolayers can yield bulk materials that retain interesting monolayer properties, such as a direct bandgap and a high emission quantum efficiency. The interaction mechanisms between monolayers, including interlayer coupling, charge transfer, and energy transfer, might be tuned through subnanometric control over the spacer thickness. Traditional spacer materials like bulk oxides or other layered materials can suffer from poor material interfaces or inhomogeneous thickness over large areas. Here, we use a spin-cast organic molecular spacer to adjust interlayer coupling in WS$_2$ monolayer stacks. We vary the molecular spacer thickness to tune the interlayer distance, significantly altering the optical properties of the resulting organic-inorganic heterostructures. Additionally, we demonstrate a dependence of the valence-band splitting on molecular spacer thickness manifested as a change in the energy difference between A and B excitons resulting from spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions. Our results illustrate the potential of molecular spacers to tailor the properties of monolayer heterostructures. This accessible approach opens new routes to advance atomically thin devices and could enable sensing technologies at the subnanometer scale.</p>

            <h2>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-Bing Zhang, Xin-Chi Zhou, Bao-Zong Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu</p>
            <p>The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model for broad range of strongly correlated phases, particularly the high-Tc superconductor. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p>

            <h2>Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurélien Decelle, Alfonso de Jesús Navas Gómez, Beatriz Seoane</p>
            <p>Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</p>

            <h2>The origin of anomalous non-linear microwave absorption in Josephson junction qubits: mysterious nature of two level systems or their dynamic interaction?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander L. Burin</p>
            <p>Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) commonly found at low temperature in amorphous and disordered materials are responsible for decoherence in superconducting Josephson junction qubits particularly because they absorb energy of coherent qubit oscillations in the microwave frequency range. In planar Josephson resonators with oxide interfaces this absorption is characterized by an anomalously weak loss tangent dependence on the field in the non-linear regime that conflicts with the theoretical expectations and the observations in amorphous dielectrics. It was recently suggested that this anomalous absorption is due to TLS dynamic interactions. Here we show that such interactions cannot lead to the observed loss-tangent field dependence and suggest the alternative explanation assuming that TLS dipole moments $p$ are distributed according to the specific power law $P(p) \propto 1/p^{3-\eta}$ ($0\leq \eta <1$). This assumption, indeed, results in the observed loss tangent behavior. The hypothesis of a power law distribution is supported both by the recent measurements of individual TLS dipole moments and the theoretical model of TLS formation due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction, thus connecting the anomalous absorption with the possible solution of the long-standing problem of the nature of TLSs.</p>

            <h2>Classical representation of the dynamics of quantum spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tony Jin</p>
            <p>Since the advent of quantum mechanics, classical probability interpretations have faced significant challenges. A notable issue arises with the emergence of negative probabilities when attempting to define the joint probability of non-commutative observables. In this work, we propose a resolution to this dilemma for quantum spin chains, by introducing an exact representation of their dynamics in terms of classical continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). These CTMCs effectively model the creation, annihilation, and propagation of pairs of classical particles and antiparticles. The quantum dynamics then emerges by averaging over various realizations of this classical process.</p>

            <h2>Interplay of superconducting, metallic, and crystalline states of composite fermions at $ν{=}1/6$ in wide quantum wells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ajit C. Balram, Anirban Sharma, J. K. Jain</p>
            <p>Evidence for developing fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling fraction $\nu{=}1/6$ and $1/8$ has recently been reported in wide GaAs quantum wells [Wang \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 134}, 046502 (2025)]. In this article, we theoretically investigate the nature of the state at $\nu{=}1/6$ as a function of the quantum well width and the density by considering composite-fermion (CF) crystals, CF Fermi sea, and various kinds of paired CF states. The $f$-wave paired state has the lowest energy among the paired CF states. However, for parameters of interest, the energies of the CF crystal, the CF Fermi liquid, and the $f$-wave paired CF state are too close to call. We, therefore, predict that {\it if} the FQHE at $\nu{=}1/6$ is experimentally confirmed, this state would be an $f$-wave paired state of CFs, which can be verified by measurement of its thermal Hall conductance. Exact diagonalization studies for systems with up to 8 electrons show that the ground states at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ are incompressible for all widths and densities we have considered and well described by the corresponding Laughlin and Jain states. We propose a phase diagram for large quantum well widths and densities in which at zero disorder, incompressible FQHE states are stabilized at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ and $\nu{=}1/6$, but in between these fillings the CF crystal is stabilized. With disorder, which creates a spatial variation in the filling factor, two regimes are identified: (i) for small disorder, when the incompressible states percolate at the special fillings, FQHE with quantized Hall plateaus and vanishing longitudinal resistance should occur; and (ii) for larger disorder, when the CF crystal percolates, the longitudinal resistance rises with decreasing temperature but the domains of FQHE liquid produce minima at the special filling factors. The experiments are consistent with the latter scenario.</p>

            <h2>Stochastically bistable growth and decay in the Togashi-Kaneko model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeremy R. Worsfold, Richard G. Morris</p>
            <p>The two-state Togashi-Kaneko model demonstrates how, at finite system sizes, autocatalysis can lead to noise-induced bistability between the cellular concentrations of different molecular species. Here, we show that, in the biologically relevant scenario of species-dependent export rates, the nascent stochastic switching between molecular species also drives a concomitant switching between periods of growth or decay in the total population size. We demonstrate this behavior using stochastic simulations as well as the numerical integration of a Fokker-Planck equation that approximates the finite system-size limit. By combining piecewise-deterministic-Markov and linear-noise approximations, we further find analytic expressions for the stationary distributions of the different molecular species when stochastic switching is faster than the dynamics in the total population size. We envisage that other models in the voter class -- including spin systems, flocking and opinion dynamics -- may also exhibit aperiodic growth and decay in population size, as well as be amenable to similar techniques.</p>

            <p>We design an enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to study 1D quantum dissipative systems, using their bosonized representation. Expressing the bosonized Hamiltonian as a path integral over a scalar field enables the application of Monte Carlo algorithms developed for classical systems. Specifically, we focus on a dissipative XXZ spin chain, exhibiting critical slowing down, minima degeneracy and long-range interactions. Addressing all three bottlenecks, we design an algorithm that combines local persistent Event-Chain Monte Carlo moves with global cluster moves, in a O(1)-complexity implementation. Through systematic performance analysis, we show that such an algorithm outperforms traditional Metropolis algorithms by more than a magnitude factor and is competitive with current state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. We then use this approach to determine the dissipative spin chain's phase diagram, thereby reinforcing prior analytical predictions.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence and transformation of pinch-point singularities in the excitation spectrum of electronic flat band systems on kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb interactions. While pinch points are widely recognized as signatures of classical spin liquids, they also appear in electronic flat-band systems when there exists a singular band-touching point to dispersive bands. We explore how SOC modifies the pinch-point structure in the chiral spin flat-band metallic state, which we term spinor-ice. The pinch point profile can rotate or redistribute its spectral weight, governed by a prefactor in the spectral function that primarily depends on the direction of the ground-state spin polarization, where we show that SOC flat bands could be experimentally probed by rotating the spin polarization of the injected electron to infer internal magnetic structures. These observations are discussed in conjunction with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and the application to the potential SOC flat-band material $\rm CsW_2O_6$. We also demonstrate the persistent residual pinch-point features under Coulomb interactions and deviations from the ideal flat-band limit.</p>

We obtain a specific condition that $\mu$ and $\sigma$ must fulfil in order to be able to solve the SDE via mapping the generic process, using a suitable space-time transformation, onto the simpler Wiener process. By taking advantage of this transformation, we obtain the propagator in the case of open, reflecting, and absorbing \emph{time-dependent\/} boundary conditions for a large class of diffusion processes. In particular, this allows us to derive the first-passage time statistics of such a large class of models, some of which were so far unknown. While our results are valid for a wide range of non-autonomous, non-linear and non-homogeneous processes, we illustrate applications in stochastic thermodynamics by focusing on the propagator and first-passage-time statistics of isoentropic processes that were previously realized in the laboratory with Brownian particles trapped with optical tweezers.</p>

            <p>We study the full distribution $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ of sums $A = \sum_{i=1}^N$ where $x_1, \dots, x_N$ are $N \gg 1$ independent and identically distributed random variables each sampled from a given distribution $p(x)$ with a subexponential $x \to \infty$ tail. We consider two particular cases: (I) the one-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-x^\alpha}$ where $0 < x < \infty$, (II) the two-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-|x|^\alpha}$ where $-\infty < x < \infty$. We assume $0 < \alpha < 1$ (in both cases). As follows immediately from known theorems, for both cases (i) typical fluctuations of $\Delta A = A - \left\langle A\right\rangle $ are described by the central-limit theorem, (ii) the tail $A \to \infty$ is described by the big-jump principle $P_{N}\left(A\right) \simeq N p\left(A\right)$, and (iii) in between these two regimes there is a nontrivial intermediate regime which displays anomalous scaling $P_{N}\left(A\right) \sim e^{-N^\beta f(\Delta A/N^\gamma)}$ with anomalous exponents $\beta,\gamma \in (0,1)$ and large-deviation function $f(y)$ that are all exactly known. In practice, although these theoretical predictions of $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ work very well in regimes (i) and (ii), they often perform quite poorly in the intermediate regime (ii), with errors of several orders of magnitude for $N$ as large as $10^4$. We calculate subleading order corrections to the theoretical predictions in the intermediate regime. We find that for $0 < \alpha < \alpha_c$, these corrections scale as power laws in $N$, while for $\alpha_c < \alpha < 1$ they scale as stretched exponentials, where the threshold value is $\alpha_c = 1/2$ in case (I) and $\alpha_c = 2/3$ in case (II). This difference between the two cases is a result of the mirror symmetry $p(x) = p(-x)$ which holds only in the latter case.</p>

The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies and complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. We present a universal scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we discover that Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankan Biswas, Avraham Klein</p>
            <p>It is well known that the time-dependent response of a correlated system can be inferred from its spectral correlation functions. As a textbook example, the zero sound collective modes of a Fermi liquid appear as poles of its particle-hole susceptibilities. However, the Fermi liquid's interactions endow these response functions with a complex analytic structure, so that this time/frequency relationship is no longer straightforward. We study how the geometry of this structure is modified by a nontrivial band geometry, via a calculation of the zero sound spectrum of a Dirac cone in two dimensions. We find that the chiral wavefunctions, that encode the band geometry, fundamentally change the analytic structure of the response functions, which encode its Riemannian geometry. As a result, isotropic interactions can give rise to a variety of unconventional zero sound modes, that, due to the geometry of the functions in frequency space, can only be identified via time-resolved probes. These modes are absent in a conventional Fermi liquid with similar interactions, so that these modes can be used as a sensitive probe for the existence of Dirac points in a band-structure.</p>

            <p>Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Finding possible mechanisms of attaining a global polar order via dynamical mechanisms - without any explicit alignment interaction - is an area of active current research. We report a novel flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the polar liquid flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques. The mechanism we report requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. This can be equivalently interpreted as pair colloids sliding a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating due to chemical interactions. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. We complement these results with an analysis of a continuum hydrodynamic model, with the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state. Finally, we present simulations for flocking in an agent-based model consisting of local update rules of colloidal pairs that slide and rotate upon collision.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism has been detected in several materials using spin-sensitive probes. These measurements require rather complex setups that make it challenging to track variations in altermagnetic order, e.g., to identify a temperature-tuned altermagnetic phase transition. We propose a simple transport measurement that can probe the order parameter for $d$-wave altermagnetism. We suggest magnetoconductivity anisotropy -- the difference between the two principal values of the magnetoconductivity tensor. This quantity can be easily measured as a function of temperature, without any spin-selective apparatus. It acquires a nonzero value in a $C_4K$ phase, where $C_4$ rotations and time reversal $K$ are not symmetries but their combination is. This effect can be traced to the modification of phase space density due to Berry curvature, which we demonstrate using semiclassical equations of motion for band electrons. As an illustration, we build a minimal tight-binding model with altermagnetic order that breaks $C_4$ and $K$ symmetries while preserving $C_4K$.</p>

            <p>The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</p>

Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1=19 meV, Delta2=6-8 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, this allows us to put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Furthermore, a clear bosonic mode with energy Omega=30+-2 meV is observed, which further supports a sign reversal gap. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leiming Chen, Chiu Fan Lee, John Toner</p>
            <p>We study two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. In the absence of fluctuations, these form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity rotates uniformly in time at a fixed frequency. Fluctuations are described by the (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order. For weak chirality, the system is in the linear regime of the KPZ equation for a wide range of length scales, over which it exhibits quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for velocity and density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen embrittlement (HE), in which the hydrogen infiltrates metal lattices to form hydrides, typically causes catastrophic failure. Inspired by HE effects, we synthesized 18 high-purity metal hydrides (MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, {\delta}-ZrH1.6, {\epsilon}-ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH) , using bulk metal foils as precursors and sulfuric/oleic acid as hydrogen donors. Through high-pressure experiments and theoretical calculations, the physical critical pressure ({\Delta}Pph) and equivalent pressure ({\Delta}Peq) concept were introduced to elucidate the mechanisms of the synthesizing and stabilizing metal hydrides. Quantitative analysis of 18 metal hydrides establishes that the criterion |{\Delta}Peq| > {\Delta}Pph governs HE-driven hydride synthesis. Conversely, when |{\Delta}Peq| < {\Delta}Pph , hydrogen-induced brittle fracture initiates. This mechanism enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides (LiH) while concurrently explaining failure modes in metals such as Fe. Our approach successfully converts HE from a primary culprit of material failure to an effective contributor in hydride synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Beyond one-loop: higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SangEun Han, Igor F. Herbut</p>
            <p>We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f < N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} < N_f < N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f > N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</p>

            <p>We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. this http URL. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Zhongbo Yan</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</p>

            <p>We present a phase-resolved investigation of Ni-based oxides and hydroxides relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), combining ground-state DFT+U calculations with operando and in situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by high-resolution TEM. Five crystalline phases-cubic and hexagonal NiO, monoclinic and trigonal Ni(OH)2, and NiOOH-are systematically characterized in terms of their vibrational and electronic structure. Although the DFT models are idealized (0 K, defect-free, no solvation), they serve as clean, phase-specific references for interpreting complex experimental spectra. Cubic NiO is confirmed to be dynamically and electronically stable, consistent with dominant Raman modes observed experimentally. Despite dynamic instabilities in phonon dispersions, hexagonal NiO is structurally verified via TEM, suggesting substrate- or defect-stabilized metastability. Ni(OH)2 polymorphs are both vibrationally stable semiconductors, with the trigonal phase exhibiting stronger spin polarization. NiOOH exhibits spin-polarized electronic states across the Brillouin zone, consistent with its asymmetric band structure under ferromagnetic ordering. Independently, phonon calculations reveal soft modes near the Gamma-point, indicating dynamic instability under idealized conditions, yet operando Raman spectra align closely with calculated zone-center modes. However, introducing 0.03 Angstrom symmetry-breaking displacements relaxes the NiOOH lattice off its saddle point, removing imaginary phonon modes and stabilizing the phase. This integrated framework demonstrates how idealized DFT can reveal intrinsic fingerprints that anchor the interpretation of vibrational and electronic responses in catalytically active, dynamically evolving Ni-based materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Payal Wadhwa, Michael Schmid, Georg Kresse</p>
            <p>The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30° and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.</p>

            <p>In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-breaking considerations play an important role in allowing reliable and accurate predictions of complex systems in quantum many-body simulations. The general theory of perturbations in symmetry-breaking phases is nonetheless intrinsically more involved than in the unbroken phase due to non-vanishing anomalous Green's functions or anomalous quasiparticle interactions. In the present paper, we develop a formulation of many-body theory at non-zero temperature which is explicitly covariant with respect to a group containing Bogoliubov transformations. Based on the concept of Nambu tensors, we derive a factorisation of standard Feynman diagrams that is valid for a general Hamiltonian. The resulting factorised amplitudes are indexed over the set of un-oriented Feynman diagrams with fully antisymmetric vertices. We argue that, within this framework, the design of symmetry-breaking many-body approximations is simplified.</p>

            <p>The theory of Self-Consistent Green's Function (SCGF) is reformulated in an explicit Nambu-covariant fashion for applications to many-body systems at non-zero temperature in symmetry-broken phases. This is achieved by extending the Nambu-covariant formulation of perturbation theory, presented in the first part of this work, to non-perturbative schemes based on self-consistently dressed propagators and vertices. We work out in detail the self-consistent ladder approximation, motivated by a trade-off between numerical complexity and many-body phenomenology. Taking a complex general Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) propagator as a starting point, we also formulate and prove a sufficient condition on the stability of the HFB self-energy to ensure the convergence of the initial series of ladders at any energy. The self-consistent ladder approximation is written purely in terms of spectral functions and the resulting set of equations, when expressed in terms of Nambu tensors, are remarkably similar to those in the symmetry-conserving case. This puts the application of the self-consistent ladder approximation to symmetry-broken phases of infinite nuclear matter within reach.</p>

The upper bound involves a Guerra-style interpolation and requires a convexity assumption on the model's covariance function. Meanwhile, the lower bound adapts the cavity method of Chen so that it can be combined with the synchronization technique of Panchenko; this part requires no convexity assumption. In order to guarantee that the resulting Parisi formula has a minimizer, we formalize the pairing of synchronization maps with overlap measures so that the constraint set is a compact metric space. This space is not related to the model's spherical structure and can be carried over to other multi-species settings.</p>

            <h2>Crisanti-Sommers formula and simultaneous symmetry breaking in multi-species spherical spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Bates, Youngtak Sohn</p>
            <p>There is a rich history of expressing the limiting free energy of mean-field spin glasses as a variational formula over probability measures on $[0,1]$, where the measure represents the similarity (or "overlap") of two independently sampled spin configurations. At high temperatures, the formula's minimum is achieved at a measure which is a point mass, meaning sample configurations are asymptotically orthogonal up to a magnetic field correction. At low temperatures, though, a very different behavior emerges known as replica symmetry breaking (RSB). The deep wells in the energy landscape create more rigid structure, and the optimal overlap measure is no longer a point mass. The exact size of its support remains in many cases an open problem. Here we consider these themes for multi-species spherical spin glasses. Following a companion work in which we establish the Parisi variational formula, here we present this formula's Crisanti-Sommers representation. In the process, we gain new access to a problem unique to the multi-species setting. Namely, if RSB occurs for one species, does it necessarily occur for other species as well? We provide sufficient conditions for the answer to be yes. For instance, we show that if two species share any quadratic interaction, then RSB for one implies RSB for the other. Moreover, the level of symmetry breaking must be identical, even in cases of full RSB. In the presence of an external field, any type of interaction suffices.</p>

            <h2>Large Deviations Theory of Increasing Returns</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Franchini, Riccardo Balzan</p>
            <p>An influential theory of increasing returns has been proposed by the economist W. B. Arthur in the '80s to explain the lock-in phenomenon between two competing commercial products. In the most simplified situation there are two competing products that gain customers according to a majority mechanism: each new customer arrives and asks which product they bought to a certain odd number of previous customers, and then buy the most shared product within this sample. It is known that one of these two companies reaches monopoly almost surely in the limit of infinite customers. Here we consider a generalization [G. Dosi, Y. Ermoliev, Y. Kaniovsky, J. Math. Econom. 23, 1-19 (1994)] where the new customer follows the indication of the sample with some probability, and buy the other product otherwise. Other than economy, this model can be reduced to the urn of Hill, Lane and Sudderth, and includes several models of physical interest as special cases, like the Elephant Random Walk, the Friedman's urn and other generalized urn models. We provide a large deviation analysis of this model at the sample-path level, and give a formula that allows to find the most likely trajectories followed by the market share variable. Interestingly, in the parameter range where the lock-in phase is expected, we observe a whole region of convergence where the entropy cost is sub-linear. We also find a non-linear differential equation for the cumulant generating function of the market share variable, that can be studied with a suitable perturbations theory.</p>

We provide a rigorous derivation of this Physics law for two effective models of Mott v.r.h.: the random resistor network for v.r.h. of \cite[Section~IV]{AHL} and Mott's random walk.

            <p>Integrating magnetic skyrmions into neuromorphic computing could help improve hardware efficiency and computational power. However, developing a scalable implementation of the weighted sum of neuron signals - a core operation in neural networks - has remained a challenge. Here, we show that weighted sum operations can be performed in a compact, biologically-inspired manner by using the non-volatile and particle-like characteristics of magnetic skyrmions that make them easily countable and summable. The skyrmions are electrically generated in numbers proportional to an input with an efficiency given by a non-volatile weight. The chiral particles are then directed using localized current injections to a location where their presence is quantified through non-perturbative electrical measurements. Our experimental demonstration, which currently has two inputs, can be scaled to accommodate multiple inputs and outputs using a crossbar array design, potentially nearing the energy efficiency observed in biological systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.</p>

We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving Majorana Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\F$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group when acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on the same sector.</p>

Viewing these theories as CFTs perturbed by relevant or irrelevant deformations, we show that conformal perturbation theory in the thermal state breaks down at late times allowing for the emergence of hydrodynamics. This breakdown occurs universally due to the unsuppressed exchange of stress tensors near the lightcone. Furthermore, for theories with central charge $c\rightarrow\infty$ we solve for the emergent hydrodynamic theory to all orders in the gradient expansion by arguing that all transport parameters appearing in two-point functions have universal expressions in terms of the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the perturbation. The radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic dispersion relations provides an early time cutoff for hydrodynamics, which agrees with the time scale at which conformal perturbation theory breaks down.</p>

            <p>We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</p>

            <p>Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis. Determining adsorption energy requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations, making it computationally intensive. Current methods rely on exhaustive sampling, which does not guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. To address this, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and reasoning to strategically explore configurations, significantly reducing the number of initial setups required while improving energy prediction accuracy. In this study, we also evaluated the performance of different LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-Chat, as the reasoning engine for Adsorb-Agent, with GPT-4o showing the strongest overall performance. Tested on twenty diverse systems, Adsorb-Agent identifies comparable adsorption energies for 84% of cases and achieves lower energies for 35%, particularly excelling in complex systems. It identifies lower energies in 47% of intermetallic systems and 67% of systems with large adsorbates. These findings demonstrate Adsorb-Agent's potential to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and enhancing prediction reliability compared to exhaustive search methods.</p>

Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is resilient to measurement errors. We quantify confidence intervals and sensitivity measures to identify experiments that improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that previous measurements had overestimated the strength of low-frequency noise by an order of magnitude.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tista Banerjee, Suchetan Das, K. Sengupta</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenpu Zhang, Ting-Wei Hsu, Ting You Tan, Daniel H. Slichter, Adam M. Kaufman, Matteo Marinelli, Cindy A. Regal</p>
            <p>We present an optical tweezer array of $^{87}$Rb atoms housed in an cryogenic environment that successfully combines a 4 K cryopumping surface, a <50 K cold box surrounding the atoms, and a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens. We demonstrate a 3000 s atom trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the $10^{-4}$ level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly-interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles Paul Moore, Hiba Belkadi, Brouna Safi, Gabriel Amselem, Charles N. Baroud</p>
            <p>Cells and other soft particles are often forced to flow in confined geometries in both laboratory and natural environments, where the elastic deformation induces an additional drag and pressure drop across the particle. In contrast with other multiphase flows, the physical parameters that determine this additional pressure are still not known. Here we start by measuring the pressure drop across a single spherical hydrogel particle as it flows in a microfluidic comparator. This pressure is found to depend on the amount of confinement, elastic modulus, fluid viscosity and velocity. A model for the force balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above ingredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow considerations. The final model collapses the force measurements forces onto a single scaling law spanning several decades, while providing physical insights by recalling elements from classic multiphase flows and contact mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence of Schrödinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schrödinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Sanokowski, Wilhelm Berghammer, Martin Ennemoser, Haoyu Peter Wang, Sepp Hochreiter, Sebastian Lehner</p>
            <p>Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Balasubramanian, Charlie Cummings</p>
            <p>We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact simple gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on ``link complements'', i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger state (GHZ)-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state. These results generalize to any three dimensional topological field theory with a dual chiral rational conformal field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale</p>
            <p>We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</p>

            <h2>Probing the Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Sinha, Trideb Shit, Avinash Tetarwal, Diptiman Sen, Sebabrata Mukherjee</p>
            <p>The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic modulation of the stronger intra-cell couplings in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</p>

            <h2>Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline states in open systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roy D. Jara Jr., Phatthamon Kongkhambut, Hans Keßler, Andreas Hemmerich, Jayson G. Cosme</p>
            <p>In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against thermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of the period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and discrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity system, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency.</p>

Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various transformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable precision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies coincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein dynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edwina F. Yeo, Benjamin J. Walker, Philip Pearce, Mohit P. Dalwadi</p>
            <p>Controlling bacterial surface adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation in fluid systems is crucial for the safety and efficacy of medical and industrial processes. Here, we theoretically examine the transport of bacteria close to surfaces, isolating how the key processes of bacterial motility and fluid flow interact and alter surface adhesion. We exploit the disparity between the fluid velocity and the swimming velocity of common motile bacteria and, using a hybrid asymptotic-computational approach, we systematically derive the coarse-grained bacterial diffusivity close to surfaces as a function of swimming speed, rotational diffusivity, and shape. We calculate an analytical upper bound for the bacterial adhesion rate by considering the scenario in which bacteria adhere irreversibly to the surface on first contact. Our theory predicts that maximal adhesion occurs at intermediate flow rates: at low flow rates, increasing flow increases surface adhesion, while at higher flow rates, adhesion is decreased by shear-induced cell reorientation.</p>

            <h2>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessica Kaijia Jiang, Federica Maria Surace, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-André models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-André models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</p>

The correlation functions are finite above the single-particle gap with a square-root onset, as is also found from field theory close to the Mott transition. The correlation functions display a featureless superposition of the primary and tertiary Hubbard bands.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Lacerda-Santos, Xavier Waintal</p>
            <p>The convergence of iterative schemes to achieve self-consistency in mean field problems such as the Schrödinger-Poisson equation is notoriously capricious. It is particularly difficult in regimes where the non-linearities are strong such as when an electron gas in partially depleted or in presence of a large magnetic field. Here, we address this problem by mapping the self-consistent quantum-electrostatic problem onto a Non-Linear Helmoltz (NLH) equation at the cost of a small error. The NLH equation is a generalization of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that one can build iterative schemes that are provably convergent by constructing a convex functional whose minimum is the seeked solution of the NLH problem. In a second step, the approximation is lifted and the exact solution of the initial problem found by iteratively updating the NLH problem until convergence. We show empirically that convergence is achieved in a handfull, typically one or two, iterations. Our set of algorithms provide a robust, precise and fast scheme for studying the effect of electrostatics in quantum nanoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>We present a quantum-inspired solver for the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the Quantics Tensor-Train (QTT) representation. By evolving the system entirely within a low-rank tensor manifold, the method sidesteps the memory and runtime barriers that limit conventional finite-difference and spectral schemes. Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware. These results position tensor networks as a practical bridge between high-performance classical computing and prospective quantum hardware for the numerical treatment of nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations.</p>

            <p>Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of operator monomials for different model parameters, we identify all first- and second-order transitions based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying and understanding quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <p>{\alpha}-phase Ruthenium (III) chloride ({\alpha}-RuCl3) has attracted significant attention because of its potential for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid. In this work, we employ first-principles many-body perturbation theory to study its many-electron interactions and excited-state properties. We find enhanced many-electron interactions that dominate quasiparticle energies and optical responses in {\alpha}-RuCl3. Our calculated quasiparticle band gap of bulk structure is about 1.75 eV that agrees well with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, our calculated first and second primary bright excitons are located at 1.23 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively. These excitons show good consistency with the main features observed in the optical absorption spectrum. We extend our investigation to monolayer {\alpha}-RuCl3, examining the zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases. In addition to significant excitonic effects, the optical spectrum of the zigzag AFM phase exhibits anisotropic behavior, while the FM phase demonstrates isotropic characteristics. The different optical response behaviors provide an efficient approach to identify the energy nearly degenerate magnetic states, which can both potentially exist in fabricated samples.</p>

Current experiments shield the molecules from destructive collisions by engineering long-range repulsive interactions using microwave or static electric fields. These shielding methods produce interaction potentials with large repulsive cores that are not well described with contact potentials. In this paper we explore the anisotropic interaction potentials that arise for pairs of polar molecules shielded with static electric fields. We derive computationally inexpensive approximations for the potentials that are suitable for use in calculations of many-body properties. The interaction potentials for molecules shielded with static fields are qualitatively different from those that arise from single-field microwave shielding and will produce quite different many-body physics.</p>

The heterodyne scheme enabled us to distinguish the relative orientation of the crystal domains, and further, it allowed us to characterize the complex phases of the susceptibility relative to a reference quartz sample. By comparing the results from the monolayer regions and the heterobilayer region over several hundred microns of the sample area, we determined that the contribution of interlayer effects to second-harmonic generation is within the experimental uncertainty arising from the sample inhomogeneity.

            <p>Topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) are topologically protected insulating states induced not by single-particle band inversions, but by the Kondo interaction between itinerant electrons and a lattice of local magnetic moments. Although experiments have suggested the emergence of three-dimensional (3D) TKIs in the rare earth compound SmB6, its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart has not been demonstrated to date. Here we report experimental evidence of a TKI in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which support a Kondo lattice with topologically nontrivial Kondo interactions. We prepare in a dual-gated device a triangular lattice Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer Kondo-coupled to a half-filled itinerant band in the WSe2 layer. Combined transport and compressibility measurements show that the prepared state supports metallic transport at high temperatures and, at low temperatures, an insulating bulk with conducting helical edge states protected by spin-Sz conservation. The presence of Kondo singlets is further evidenced by their breakdown at high magnetic fields. Such behaviors are in stark contrast to the simple metallic state when the Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer is depleted by gating. Our results open the door for exploring tunable topological Kondo physics in moiré materials.</p>

We show that the nontrivial topology of 5-SL MnBi2Te4, in the presence of Landau quantization, is governed by a generalized topological index rooted in the parity anomaly of Dirac fermions in (2+1) dimensions. The anomaly manifests as an anomalous Landau level, giving rise to gate-tunable helical edge transport.

            <p>Exciton transport in 2D semiconductors holds promise for room-temperature, ultra-compact optoelectronic devices, but it is limited by short propagation distances. Hybridization of excitons with cavity photons to form exciton-polaritons can enhance the propagation by orders of magnitude, enabling a coherent, ballistic transport. However, a microscopic understanding of the role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in \ce{MoSe2} monolayers at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct transport regimes: (i) an initial sub-ps ballistic-like regime characterized by a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-ps superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization. The gained microscopic insights will trigger and guide future experimental studies on the phonon-mediated polariton transport in atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

Here, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure consisting of an antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer and an Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film is able to harbor the half-quantized Hall (HQH) effect with a ferroelectrically switchable Hall conductivity of $e^2/2h$. We first show that, in the energetically stable configuration, the antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer opens a gap in the top surface bands of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ through proximity effect, while its bottom surface bands remain gapless; consequently, HQH conductivity of $e^2/2h$ can be sustained clockwise or counterclockwise depending on antiferromagnetic configuration of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Remarkably, when applying interlayer sliding within the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer, its electric polarization direction associated with parity-time reversal symmetry breaking is reversed, accompanied by a reversal of the HQH conductivity. The proposed approach offers a powerful route to control topological quantum transport in antiferromagnetic materials by ferroelectricity.</p>

            <h2>Polariton transport in 2D semiconductors: Phonon-mediated transitions between ballistic, superdiffusive and exciton-limited regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jamie M. Fitzgerald, Roberto Rosati, Ermin Malic</p>
            <p>Exciton transport in 2D semiconductors holds promise for room-temperature, ultra-compact optoelectronic devices, but it is limited by short propagation distances. Hybridization of excitons with cavity photons to form exciton-polaritons can enhance the propagation by orders of magnitude, enabling a coherent, ballistic transport. However, a microscopic understanding of the role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in \ce{MoSe2} monolayers at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct transport regimes: (i) an initial sub-ps ballistic-like regime characterized by a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-ps superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization. The gained microscopic insights will trigger and guide future experimental studies on the phonon-mediated polariton transport in atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

            <p>Friction causes mechanical energy dissipation and material degradation in machinery and devices. While phononic friction is well understood via anharmonic lattice dynamics, the physics of electronic friction remains unclear due to challenges in separating electronic degrees of freedom from phononic ones in experiments and analyzing the non-equilibrium interactions between ionic movement and electronic dynamics in theory. To tackle this problem, we construct a sliding device featuring 2D crystalline interfaces that possess ultra-smooth and minimally interacting surfaces, achieving the state of structural superlubricity with no wear and minimal friction. Using electrical and mechanical controls, we tuned the nature of interfacial electronic coupling and charge densities in materials in an on-device setting, which allows us to disentangle the electron and phonon contributions to friction. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis supported by first-principles calculations demonstrate that electronic friction can well surpass phononic contributions and dominate energy dissipation at structural superlubricity contacts. These findings offer fresh insights into the mechanism of electronic friction and promising opportunities for friction control in device applications.</p>

            <h2>Prediction of High-Temperature Half Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semi-magnetic Topological Insulator of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. U. Muzaffar, Kai-Zhi Bai, Wei Qin, Guohua Cao, Yutong Yang, Shunhong Zhang, Ping Cui, Shun-Qing Shen, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
            <p>The classic Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs theorem dictates that a single electron band of a lattice can only harbor an integer quantum Hall conductance as a multiple of e^2/2h, while recent studies have pointed to the emergence of half quantum anomalous Hall (HQAH) effect, though the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain controversial. Here we propose an ideal platform of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$ that allows not only to realize the HQAH effect at much higher temperatures, but also to critically assess the different contributions of the gapped and gapless Dirac bands. We first show that the top surface bands of the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film become gapped, while the bottom surface bands remain gapless due to proximity coupling with the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ overlayer. Next we show that such a semi-magnetic topological insulator harbors the HQAH effect at ~20 K, with Cr doping enhancing it to as high as 67 K, driven by large magnetic anisotropy and strong magnetic coupling constants that raise the Curie temperature. Our detailed Berry curvature analysis further helps to reveal that, whereas the gapped surface bands can contribute to the Hall conductance when the chemical potential is tuned to overlap with the bands, these bands have no net contribution when the chemical potential is in the gapped region, leaving the gapless bands to be the sole contributor to the HQAH conductance. Counterintuitively, the part of the gapless bands within the gapped region of the top surface bands have no net contribution, thereby ensuring the plateau nature of the Hall conductance.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocal spin-wave excitations in Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aastha Jain, Dheeraj Kumar Singh</p>
            <p>We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnet within the random-phase approximation. We find that the non-reciprocal behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned in-plane and not out-of-plane. Furthermore, the spin-wave excitations exhibit non-reciprocal behavior in a direction in the momentum space reciprocal to an in-plane direction perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic moments. In that case, the first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear. However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p>Transient size segregation of a bi-disperse granular mixture flowing over a periodic chute is studied using the Discrete Element Method and continuum simulations. A recently developed particle force-based size segregation model is used to predict the time-dependent flow properties of binary mixtures starting from rest. A two-way coupled continuum model that solves the momentum balance and convection-diffusion equations by incorporating the mixture segregation model along with the generalized inertial number-based rheological model is developed for predicting the evolution of segregation. The predicted concentration profiles and other flow properties of the mixture are found to be in good agreement with the DEM data for a variety of compositions. The evolution of the centre of mass of the two species with time is also very well captured for different initial configurations and size ratios using the particle force-based segregation model.</p>

            <p>Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological applications and to discover new phenomena. In particular, advances of experimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Fermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms experiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign. Moreover, our specific heat results demonstrate interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime.</p>

            <p>Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.</p>

            <h2>Characterization of fractional Chern insulator quasiparticles in moiré transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Liu, Bohao Li, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moiré lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moiré lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle. We also discuss the effect of band mixing on FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>Momentum-band topology, which transcends conventional topological band theory, unlocks new topological phases that host fascinating temporal interface states. However, direct bulk experimental evidence of such emerging band topology is still lacking due to the great challenges in resolving eigenstates and topological invariants of time-varying systems. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the momentum-band topology in a PT-symmetric Floquet lattice, where the drive-induced momentum gap can be characterized by a quantized Berry phase in the energy Brillouin zone. Experimentally, we synthesize the Floquet lattice model using an acoustic cavity-tube structure coupled to custom-designed external circuits. By reconstructing the effective Hamiltonian, we extract the system's eigenstates and provide the first bulk evidence of momentum-band topology from the perspectives of band inversion and topological invariants. This is accompanied by an unambiguous observation of time-localized interface states in real physical time, thereby providing the boundary signature of the bulk topology. Our work paves the way for further experimental studies on the burgeoning momentum-gap physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panwad Chavalekvirat, Wisit Hirunpinyopas, Pawin Iamprasertkun</p>
            <p>The selection of an appropriate solvent has long been a critical factor in the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) nanosheets. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) remains one of the most commonly used solvents due to its favourable surface tension compatibility, particularly with tungsten diselenide (WSe2), which facilitates a relatively high yield of exfoliated nanosheets. However, prolonged exposure of the nanosheets to NMP promotes oxidation, consequently diminishing their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, a more environmentally friendly solvent system, consisting of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionised water (DI), induces significantly less oxidation and results in enhanced HER performance. Notably, this green solvent system achieves the lowest overpotential of 0.209 V vs RHE after 24 hours of chronoamperometry.</p>

            <h2>Absence of higher than 6-fold coordination in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João Elias F. S. Rodrigues, Angelika D. Rosa, Emin Mijit, Tetsuo Irifune, Gaston Garbarino, Olivier Mathon, Raffaella Torchio, Max Wilke</p>
            <p>Simple binary oxide glasses can exhibit a compression behavior distinct from that of their crystalline counterparts. In this study, we employed high-pressure X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled to the diamond anvil cell to investigate in detail local structural changes around Ge in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa. We conducted four independent runs, both with and without pressure-transmitting media. Up to 30 GPa, we observed no significant influence of the pressure medium on the pressure dependence of the $Ge-O$ bond length ($<R_{Ge-O}>$). Between 10 and 30 GPa, the evolution of $<R_{Ge-O}>$ shows substantial variability across our experiments and previous works. The measured values lie close to those reported for crystalline polymorphs, including the rutile- and $CaCl_{2}$-type phase of $GeO_{2}$. This finding suggests that the amorphous structure possesses considerable flexibility to transition among different atomic configurations. From 30 GPa to 158 GPa, our results for both $<R_{Ge-O}>$ and the non-bonded cation-cation distance $<R_{Ge...Ge}>$ demonstrate that edge-sharing octahedra remain the main structural motives in glassy $GeO_{2}$. Up to 100 GPa, compaction proceeds primarily via distortions of octahedral $O-Ge-O$ bond angles accompanied by octahedral bond shortening. Above 100 GPa, octahedral distortion becomes the prevailing mechanism. Compared to its crystalline analogues ($\alpha-PbO_{2}$ and pyrite-like phase), glassy $GeO_{2}$ exhibits a slightly less efficient compaction mechanism, likely due to kinetic constraints that inhibit reconstructive lattice rearrangements.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Origins of Conformable Dynamics: From Disorder to Deformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Weberszpil</p>
            <p>Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability. However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling complex critical dynamics.</p>

We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</p>

            <h2>Effective behavior of heterogeneous media governed by strain gradient elasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harkirat Singh, Mayank Raj, Kaushik Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>Various mechanical phenomena depend on the length scale, and these have inspired a variety of nonlocal and higher gradient continuum theories. Mechanistically, it is believed that the length scale dependence arises due to an interplay between the length scale of heterogeneities in the material, the length scale of the material being probed and the phenomenon under study. In this paper, we seek to understand this interplay in a simple setting by studying the overall behavior of a one-dimensional periodic medium governed by strain gradient elasticity at the microstructural scale. We find that the overall behavior is not described by a strain gradient elasticity. In other words, strain gradient theories are not invariant under averaging at this scale. We also find that the overall behavior may be described by a kernel-based nonlocal elasticity theory, and approximated locally by a fractional strain gradient elasticity. Consequently, one can obtain various scaling laws with exponent between zero (classical elasticity) and one (strain-gradient elasticity). We also learn the overall behavior using a Fourier neural operator.</p>

            <p>Cold atom experiments show that a mobile impurity particle immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate forms a well-defined quasiparticle (Bose polaron) for weak to moderate impurity-boson interaction strengths, whereas a significant line broadening is consistently observed for strong interactions. Motivated by this, we introduce a phenomenological theory based on the assumption that the most relevant states are characterized by the impurity correlated with at most one boson, since they have the largest overlap with the uncorrelated states to which the most common experimental probes couple. These experimentally relevant states can however decay to lower energy states characterised by correlations involving multiple bosons, and we model this using a minimal variational wave function combined with a complex impurity-boson interaction strength. We first motivate this approach by comparing to a more elaborate theory that includes correlations with up to two bosons. Our phenomenological model is shown to recover the main results of two recent experiments probing both the spectral and the non-equilibrium properties of the Bose polaron. Our work offers an intuitive framework for analyzing experimental data and highlights the importance of understanding the complicated problem of the Bose polaron decay in a many-body setting.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen a vast increase in research onto van der Waals magnetic materials, due to the richness of many-body effects and the versatility for next-generation technologies. In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \textit{d}-wave orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. To solve this issue, here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\textsubscript{3}, via complementary absorption and photoemission spectroscopies, and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and demonstrating that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism in this material is attributable to the orbital mixing between I \textit{p} and Cr \textit{e\textsubscript{g}} states.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gunnar F. Schwertfeger, Po-Hao Chang, Predrag Nikolic, Igor I. Mazin</p>
            <p>The Kagome lattice is a 2D network of corner sharing triangles found in several rare earth materials resulting in a complicated and often frustrated magnetic system. In the last decades, modifications of the motif, such as breathing Kagome, asymmetric Kagome, and twisted Kagome were brought into the limelight. In particular, the latter has lower symmetry than the original Kagome and thus allows implementations of an "Ising-local" Hamiltonian, leading to a 2D spin ice. One such material implementation, HoAgGe, was recently reported to have an exceptionally rich phase diagram and is a strongly frustrated 2D spin-ice material with a twisted-Kagome geometry. In the presence of an external magnetic field the compound exhibits step-like magnetization plateaus at simple fractions of the saturation magnetization. It is believed that this phenomenon results from strong single-site anisotropy, which in HoAgGe was found to be in-plane and along a high-symmetry direction. Previous Monte Carlo simulations with empirical exchange parameters explain some, but not all experimental observations. In this work we present (a) first-principle calculations of the crucial model parameters and (b) direct energy minimization via a Reduced-Configuration-Space search, as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of the field-dependent phase diagram. We find that for HoAgGe the calculated exchange parameters are very different from the earlier suggested empirical ones, and describe the phase diagram much more accurately. This is likely because the first-principles parameters are, in addition to geometrically, also parametrically frustrated.</p>

            <p>Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium -- ripplons -- affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak. This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad range of the coupling strength</p>

We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate $\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into account. Here, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $m$ is the mass of the particles, $c_P$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $T$ is the temperature.</p>

            <h2>Unusual electronic structure in underdoped cuprate superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Li, Minghuan Zeng, Huaiming Guo, Shiping Feng</p>
            <p>The underdoped cuprate superconductors are characterized by the opening of the pseudogap, while such an aspect of the pseudogap effect should be reflected in the low-energy electronic structure (LEES). Here the effect of the pseudogap on LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is investigated within the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. The strong coupling of the electrons with the spin excitation induces the pseudogap-state in the particle-hole channel and superconducting (SC) state in the particle-particle channel, where the pseudogap and SC gap respectively originate from the electron normal and anomalous self-energies, and are evaluated by taking into account the vertex correction. As a natural consequence of the interplay between the pseudogap-state and SC-state, the SC transition temperature Tc exhibits a dome-like shape of the doping dependence, however, in a striking contrast to Tc in the underdoped regime, the pseudogap crossover temperature T* is much higher than Tc in the underdoped regime, and then it decreases with the increase of doping, eventually disappearing together with Tc at the end of the SC dome. Concomitantly, the spectral weight on the electron Fermi surface (EFS) at around the antinodal region is suppressed strongly by this pseudogap, and then EFS is truncated to form four disconnected Fermi arcs centered around the nodal region with the largest spectral weight located at around the tips of the disconnected Fermi arcs. Moreover, the dip in the peak-dip-hump structure observed in the energy distribution curve and checkerboard charge ordering found in the ARPES autocorrelation are intrinsically connected with the emergence of the pseudogap. The theory therefore indicates that the same spin excitation that governs both the pseudogap-state and SC-state naturally leads to the exotic features of LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Metric Enhancement and Hierarchical Scaling in One-Dimensional Quasiperiodic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jundi Wang, Yuxiao Chen, Huaqing Huang</p>
            <p>The quantum metric, a key component of quantum geometry, plays a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena and has been extensively studied in periodic crystals and moiré materials. Here, we systematically investigate quantum geometry in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic systems and uncover novel properties that fundamentally distinguish them from both periodic crystals and disordered media. Our comparative analysis reveals that quasiperiodicity significantly enhances the quantum metric -- despite the absence of translational symmetry -- due to the presence of critical wavefunctions with long-range spatial correlations. In the Aubry-André-Harper model, we show that the quantum metric serves as a sensitive probe of localization transitions, exhibiting sharp changes at the critical point and distinct behaviors near mobility edges. In the Fibonacci chain, characterized by a singular continuous spectrum, we discover an anomalous enhancement of the quantum metric when the Fermi level lies within the minimal gaps of the fractal energy spectrum. Using a perturbative renormalization group framework, we trace this enhancement to the hierarchical structure of the spectrum and the bonding-antibonding nature of critical states across narrow gaps. Our findings establish a fundamental connection between wavefunction criticality, spectral fractality, and quantum geometry, suggesting quasiperiodic systems as promising platforms for engineering enhanced quantum geometric properties beyond conventional crystalline paradigms.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of quantum oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michel Caffarel</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a compact analytical approximation for the quantum partition function of systems composed of quantum oscillators. The proposed formula is general and applicable to an arbitrary number of oscillators described by a rather general class of potential energy functions (not necessarily polynomials). Starting from the exact path integral expression of the partition function, we introduce a time-dependent Gaussian approximation for the potential contribution and, then, invoke a principle of minimal sensitivity to minimize the error. This leads to a system of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution yields the optimal parameters of the gaussian approximation. The resulting approximate partition function accurately reproduces thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy, average energy, and specific heat -- even at zero temperature -- with typical errors of only a few percent. We illustrate the performance of our approximate formula with numerical results for systems of up to ten coupled anharmonic oscillators. These results are compared to "exact" numerical results obtained via Hamiltonian diagonalization for small systems and Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations for larger ones.</p>

            <h2>Growth and prediction of plastic strain in metallic glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tero Mäkinen, Anshul D. S. Parmar, Silvia Bonfanti, Mikko Alava</p>
            <p>Predicting the failure and plasticity of solids remains a longstanding challenge, with broad implications for materials design and functional reliability. Disordered solids like metallic glasses can fail either abruptly or gradually without clear precursors, and the mechanical response depends strongly on composition, thermal history and deformation protocol -- impeding generalizable modeling. While deep learning methods offer predictive power, they often rely on numerous input parameters, hindering interpretability, methodology advancement and practical deployment. Here, we propose a macroscopic, physically grounded approach that uses plastic strain accumulation in the elastic regime to robustly predict deformation and yield. This method reduces complexity and improves interpretability, offering a practical alternative for disordered materials. For the Cu-Zr-(Al) metallic glasses prepared with varied annealing, we identify two limiting regimes of plastic strain growth: power-law in poorly annealed and exponential in well-annealed samples. A physics-informed framework with Bayesian inference extracts growth parameters from stress-strain data within $\sim$5\% strain, enabling early prediction of bulk response and yield point, well before the failure. The predictive performance improves with annealing, and bulk plasticity correlates with the microscopic plastic activity from scattered to growth near yielding. This work presents a physically interpretable and experimentally relevant framework for predicting plasticity and failure in metallic glasses from early mechanical response, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for material characterization and design.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets offer a promising platform for dissipationless spin transport by combining zero net magnetization with spontaneous non-relativistic spin splitting. However, their magnonic transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum-kinetic theory for thermally driven magnon currents that cleanly separates Berry-curvature-driven intrinsic contributions from Drude-like scattering-dependent terms. Applying this framework to a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we reveal spin-split magnon bands that support both intrinsic and extrinsic spin Nernst and Seebeck currents. For realistic parameters, we predict a sizable magnon spin-splitting angle (about 3.3 degrees) and a pure transverse spin current capable of exerting a strong spin-splitter torque suitable for magnetization switching.</p>

Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions.

            <p>Twisted van der Waals materials provide a tunable platform for investigating two-dimensional superconductivity and quantum phases. Using spectra-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we study the superconducting states in twisted bilayer graphene and track their evolution from insulating phases. Gate-dependent spectroscopic measurements reveal two distinct regimes: under-doped ({\nu} = -2.3) and optimally doped ({\nu} = -2.6). In the under-doped regime, partial superconductivity arises, forming a network interspersed with non-gapped regions. At optimal doping, the entire unit cell demonstrates superconductivity, with gap size modulation showing an anti-correlation with the local density of states. This gate-dependent transition from an insulating phase to a modulated superconductor uncovers an unexpected spatial hierarchy in pairing behavior and offers direct microscopic insights to constrain theories of superconductivity in moiré systems.</p>

            <p>We study strongly correlated fractional topological phases on a two-sphere threaded by a magnetic dipole field with globally vanishing flux. Solving the Dirac equation in this background produces spheroidal wavefunctions forming a highly degenerate manifold of normalizable zero modes, with degeneracy proportional to the total absolute flux. We introduce a non-Abelian spin gauge field near the equator to hybridize the north and south domain-confined modes, forming a global flat band. Projecting interactions into this band yields Laughlin-type correlated states. The entanglement spectrum shows a chiral tower consistent with a virtual edge, demonstrating bulk-edge correspondence in a closed geometry. This generalizes the zero-flux flat-band construction of \cite{Parhizkar:2024som} to curved backgrounds, with potential applications to synthetic and astrophysical systems.</p>

            <p>Entanglement underpins quantum information processing and computing, yet its experimental quantification in complex, many-body condensed matter systems remains a considerable challenge. Here, we reveal a highly entangled electronic phase proximate to a quantum metal-insulator transition, identified by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering interferometry. This approach reveals that entanglement across atomic sites generates characteristic interference patterns, which our model accurately reproduces, enabling extraction of a full entanglement spectrum and resolution of the underlying quantum states. Our analysis of the pyrochlore iridate Nd2Ir2O7 demonstrates that the system undergoes pronounced quantum fluctuations in its spin, orbital and charge degrees of freedom, even in the presence of a long-range 'all-in-all-out' antiferromagnetic order. Importantly, the observed entanglement signatures facilitate the coexistence of multiple exotic symmetry-breaking orders. Complementary investigations using Raman spectroscopy corroborate the presence of these hidden orders and their emergent excitations. In particular, we observe a two-magnon-bound state below the lowest single-magnon excitation energy, which, together with split phonon modes, provides strong evidence for cubic symmetry-breaking orders of magnetic origin juxtaposed with the all-in-all-out order. Our work thus establishes a direct link between quantum entanglement and emergent unconventional orders, opening new avenues for investigating quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Despite exhibiting a similar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band character to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates host additional electron pockets that distinguish them from single-band cuprates. The elusive orbital origin of these electron pockets has led to competing theoretical scenarios. Here, using polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we determine the orbital character of the Fermi surfaces in NdNiO$_2$. Our data reveal that the electron-like pocket arises predominantly from interstitial $s$ states, with negligible contributions from rare-earth 5$d$ and 4$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level. The observation of well-defined quantum well states indicates a uniform distribution of these interstitial electrons throughout the film thickness. By comparing with electronic structure of LaNiO$_2$, we find that the rare-earth element modulates the Ni-derived bands and hopping integrals through a chemical pressure effect. These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electride-like interstitial $s$ states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals. The electride-like character offer new insight into the self-doping and superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</p>

            <p>We revisit Landau's theory by renormalizing quadratic coefficients from nonlinear polynomial equations to adapt them to the system's dimensionality. These coefficients are employed to perform detailed specific-heat calculations for several high-temperature superconductors near the superconducting transition. We phenomenologically explain the change in the specific heat jump using Ginzburg-Landau theory, which is applicable to any spatial arrangement and interactions between electrons that influence the system's symmetries. We discuss the effects that may lead to the rapid and non-monotonic variation of the specific heat jump, $\Delta{C_p}/T_{c}$, across the transition over relatively small ranges of fluctuations, focusing particularly on changes attributed to the Sommerfeld coefficient in the normal state. We quantitatively explain the considerable reduction, disappearance, or significant enhancement of the specific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition, considering strong fluctuation corrections to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of low-dimensional systems. Additionally, we study the evolution of specific heat jumps by varying the system's dimensionality and discuss the results in relation to experimental observations of specific-heat jumps in iron-, yttrium-, and bismuth-based superconductors, as well as in $\beta$-pyrochlore oxides superconductors like $KOs_2O_6$.</p>

            <p>We introduce a new class of tunable periodic structures, formed by launching two obliquely propagating surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric substrate that supports a two-dimensional quantum material. The resulting acoustoelectric superlattice exhibits two salient features. First, its periodicity is widely tunable, spanning a length scale intermediate between moiré superlattices and optical lattices, enabling the formation of narrow, topologically nontrivial energy bands. Second, unlike moiré systems, where the superlattice amplitude is set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude of the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic wave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that varying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ control over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and nontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.</p>

            <p>The development of materials science is undergoing a shift from empirical approaches to data-driven and algorithm-oriented research paradigm. The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Bilotto, Martin Trulsson, Jean-François Molinari</p>
            <p>The rheology of dense granular shear flows is influenced by friction and particle shape. We investigate numerically the impact of non-spherical particle geometries under shear on packing fraction, stress ratios, velocity fluctuations, force distribution, and dissipation mechanisms, for a wide range of inertial numbers, friction coefficients and aspect ratios. We obtain a regime diagram for the dissipation which shows that lentil-like (oblate) particles exhibit an extended sliding regime compared to rice-like (prolate) particles with the same degree of eccentricity. Additionally, we identify non-monotonic behaviour of slightly aspherical particles at low friction, linking it to their higher fluctuating rotational kinetic energy. We find that angular velocity fluctuations are generally reduced when particles align with the flow, except in highly frictional rolling regimes, where fluctuations collapse onto a power-law distribution and motion becomes less correlated. Moreover, for realistic friction coefficients power dissipation tends to concentrate along the major axis aligned with the flow, where slip events are more frequent. We also show that flat particles develop stronger fabric anisotropy than elongated ones, influencing macroscopic stress transmission. These findings provide new insights into the role of particle shape in granular mechanics, with implications for both industrial and geophysical applications.</p>

            <p>Low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) topological materials such as MoTe$_2$ host efficient charge-to-spin conversion (CSC) mechanisms that can be harnessed for novel electronic and spintronic devices. However, the nature of the various CSC mechanisms and their correlation with underlying crystal symmetries remain unsettled. In this work, we use local spin-sensitive electrochemical potential measurements to directly probe the spatially dependent nonequilibrium spin accumulation in MoTe$_2$ flakes down to four atomic layers. We are able to clearly disentangle contributions originating from the spin Hall and Rashba-Edelstein effects and uncover an abundance of unconventional spin polarizations that develop uniquely in the sample bulk and edges with decreasing thickness. Using ab-initio calculations, we construct a unified understanding of all the observed CSC components in relation to the material dimensionality and stacking arrangement. Our findings not only illuminate previous CSC results on MoTe$_2$ but also have important ramifications for future devices that can exploit the local and layer-dependent spin properties of this 2D topological material.</p>

            <p>We show that the integer quantum Hall transition in a disordered nanowire with orbital momentum-space texture connected to four terminals is accompanied by an orbital Hall transition. We applied a multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and found that both conductance fluctuations in the integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) and orbital-conductance fluctuations in the orbital Hall transition (OHT) display multifractal behavior. We argue that this multifractality is primarily related to disorder, which gives rise to the strong fluctuations that are fingerprints of IQHT and OHT, but is also a consequence of the fact that the nanowire has finite size, which causes a weakening of the multifractality in a certain range of values of disorder strength followed by a new regime of increasing multifractality with increasing disorder strength. Furthermore, our findings indicate that OHT can bring novel insights to future IQHT analysis.</p>

Semi-quantitative EDS analysis revealed a Ce:In ratio of 1:3.1(1), and the SAED results confirmed that the nanowires are polycrystalline with a cubic unit cell. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and NMR data indicated a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition to $T_N$ $\approx$ 2.4 K compared to the bulk value ($\approx$ 10 K). Furthermore, NMR analysis at temperatures below 2.8 K showed a reduced quadrupole frequency, $\nu_Q$ $\approx$ 1.77(2) MHz, and provided evidence of polycrystalline nanowires formed within the nanoporous alumina template, in agreement with SAED results.

            <p>Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</p>

In this work, we measured IX transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure by time-resolved photoluminescence imaging. These measurements probe the kinetics of IX cloud expansion and reveal the transport characteristics. We found IX transport with anomalously high diffusivity, orders of magnitude higher than for regular diffusive exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures. This efficient IX transport agrees with long-range ballistic transport and is consistent with the Bose-Hubbard theory prediction of superfluid in moire superlattices.</p>

            <p>Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Crack growth in lithium-ion battery electrodes is typically detrimental and undesirable. However, recent experiments suggest that stabilized fracture of cathode active materials in liquid electrolytes can increase electrochemically active surfaces, shorten diffusion pathway, enhance (de)lithiation and improve overall capacity. To decipher the fundamental couplings between electrolyte wetting and fracture evolution and evaluate their influences on macroscopic battery performance, we conducted an integrated experiment-simulation study on $\alpha$-V2O5 single crystals and polycrystalline NCM as model cathode materials. Despite synthesis challenges, single-crystal $\alpha$-V2O5 offers clearer fundamental insights than polycrystalline counterparts with grain-boundary complexities. Fracture patterns and lithiation heterogeneities on the samples were mapped using advanced scanning techniques after chemical (de)lithiation cycles, exhibiting excellent agreements with simulations by the developed multiphysics model. Results reveal a mutually reinforcing interplay between wetting and fracture: (i) electrolyte infiltration at fracture surfaces enhances (de)lithiation and compositional heterogeneity; (ii) wetting influences fracture dynamics, including fracture modes, propagation distance and directionality. The validated modelling framework is further applied to simulations on polycrystalline NCM particles under constant-current (dis)charging, highlighting the critical role of wetting in promoting fracture and improving overall capacity. This work bridges fundamental understanding of wetting-fracture coupling with practical implications for battery performance optimization via controlled fracture engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Su, Brian J. Blankenau, Namhoon Kim, Jessica A. Krogstad, Elif Ertekin</p>
            <p>Nitrogen (N) is a key alloying element that enhances the performance of Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels, improving austenite stability, corrosion resistance, and yield strength. However, the role of N in modifying chemical ordering, particularly short-range order (SRO) and long-range order (LRO), is complex due to the multi-sublattice nature and magnetic interactions in these alloys. In this work, we combine first-principles calculations with the spin cluster expansion (spin CE) method to systematically investigate the effects of N on chemical ordering in Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Our atomistic models confirm a strong affinity between N and Cr, which drives the formation of N-Cr SRO and, at higher N concentrations, stabilizes M4N-type ordered phases (M = metal). Monte Carlo simulations reveal that low N concentrations promote local N-Cr or N-N SRO, while increasing N content leads to the emergence of Cr-and N-rich LRO structures. We also show that the presence of N suppresses intrinsic Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr SRO by competing with these interactions, particularly at high concentrations. The impact of Cr content on ordering diminishes as N approaches its solubility limit. These findings are consistent with experimental observations in high-N austenitic steels. Finally, we discuss the influence of kinetic and magnetic effects on SRO evolution in high-N alloys. This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding N-driven chemical ordering and offers insights into microstructural changes during nitriding processes.</p>

            <h2>Scaling laws for doublet craters formed by low-velocity impacts of unequal-mass spheres into a granular bed</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruto Kitagawa, Ririha Obara, Yu Matsuda</p>
            <p>Understanding the formation mechanism of doublet craters is an important challenge for advancing knowledge in astronomy and granular physics. In this study, we investigated craters formed by low-velocity impacts of two steel spheres with different masses into a granular bed. Even when the masses were different, a figure-eight-shaped doublet crater and a central ridge were observed, similar to the case with equal masses. However, the resulting shape became asymmetric even without a time delay between impacts. The total length of the doublet crater increased depending on the spacing between the two spheres and the ratio of their impact energies. These results followed a theoretical model based on a scaling law, where the crater diameter is proportional to the one-fourth power of the impact energy. A model was also developed to describe the crater overlap, which increases as the spheres become closer. It was also shown that the crater diameters vary with the time difference, and that the second impact tends to form a larger crater due to fluidization induced by the first.</p>

            <h2>Optimized Bistable Vortex Memory Arrays for Superconducting In-Memory Matrix-Vector Multiplication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Altay Karamuftuoglu, Changxu Song, Beyza Zeynep Ucpinar, Sasan Razmkhah, Massoud Pedram</p>
            <p>Building upon previously introduced Bistable Vortex Memory (BVM) as a novel, nonvolatile, high-density, and scalable superconductor memory technology, this work presents a methodology that uses BVM arrays to address challenges in data-driven algorithms and neural networks, specifically focusing on matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). The BVM approach introduces a novel superconductor-based methodology for in-memory arithmetic, achieving ultra-high-speed and energy-efficient computation by utilizing BVM arrays for in-memory computation. The design employs a tiled multiplier structure where BVM's inherent current summation capability is combined with Quantizer Buffer (QB) cells to convert the analog accumulated current into a variable number of digital Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) pulses. These pulses are then processed by T1 adder cells, which handle binary addition and carry propagation, thereby forming a complete functional multiplier unit. This paper thus presents an efficient MVM architecture that uses these BVM-based multipliers in a systolic array configuration to enable parallel computation. A key innovation is an optimized BVM array structure specifically tailored for multiplication applications, involving a restructuring of Sense Lines (SLs) with diagonal connections to reduce area and an adjusted input scheme to enhance computational efficiency compared to the general-purpose BVM array design. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a 4-bit multiplier operating at 20 GHz with 50 ps latency and an MVM structure demonstrating operation at 20 GHz. Furthermore, we showcase how this multiplier design can be extended to support Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. This work paves the way for power-efficient neural networks by enabling high-speed in-memory computation.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Ionic Conductivity along the Coherent $Σ$3 Grain Boundary in ThO2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miaomiao Jin, Jilang Miao, Marat Khafizov, Beihan Chen, Yongfeng Zhang, David H. Hurley</p>
            <p>Understanding oxygen diffusion along grain boundaries (GBs) is critical for controlling ionic conductivity in oxide ceramics. GBs are typically thought to enhance ionic transport due to structural disorder and increased free volume. In this study, we report an unexpected anomaly: the $\Sigma 3(111)$ GB in thorium dioxide (ThO$_2$), despite its compact and coherent structure, exhibits significantly higher oxygen ionic conductivity compared to the more open GB ($\Sigma 19$ as an example). Using atomistic simulations based on a machine learning interatomic potential, we revealed that the high conductivity in the $\Sigma 3$ GB arises from a collective diffusion mechanism involving highly correlated atomic motion reminiscent of a superionic state. In contrast, the $\Sigma 19$ GB follows conventional pipe diffusion, consistent with its more open structure. This comparison highlights that enhanced GB conductivity is not simply correlated with free volume, but can occur from specific structural motifs that enable collective transport. These findings provide new guidance for designing GB-engineered oxides with targeted ionic transport properties for energy applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koudai Sugimoto, Tomotaka Kuwahara, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>The inverse Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system, initially in thermal equilibrium and prepared at different temperatures below that of the final equilibrium state, relaxes to the final state more rapidly when starting from a lower initial temperature. We extend this concept to the relaxation toward a prethermal state in isolated quantum systems. By examining a simple model that exhibits prethermalization, we demonstrate that this effect indeed manifests under periodic driving. We further discuss the realization of this phenomenon in a variety of systems within a unified theoretical framework.</p>

            <p>The $RT_3$B$_2$ ($R=$Y, Lu, $T=$ Co, Os) family hosts a perfect kagome lattice of $T$ atoms, offering an interesting platform to investigate the interplay of electronic structure, superconductivity, and lattice dynamics. Here, we compare two members of this family, LuOs$_3$B$_2$ and YCo$_3$B$_2$, with similar crystallography but differing chemical composition, leading to distinct electronic correlation strengths and spin-orbit coupling effects. We confirm superconductivity in LuOs$_3$B$_2$ with $T_c = 4.75$K, while YCo$_3$B$_2$ remains non-superconducting above 1.8K. First-principles estimates of the electron-phonon coupling for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ are consistent with its observed $T_c$ and suggest a moderate coupling strength. Both materials exhibit kagome-derived electronic features, including quasi-flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities. Fermi surface calculations reveal quasi-one-dimensional behavior along the $c$-axis in YCo$_3$B$_2$, in contrast to the more three-dimensional Fermiology of LuOs$_3$B$_2$. Phonon calculations for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ show imaginary modes, indicating potential lattice instabilities. Experimental estimates of the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios point to non-negligible electronic correlations in both compounds.</p>

            <h2>Quantized conductance in a CVD-grown nanoribbon with hidden Rashba effect</h2>

            <p>Quantized conductance in quasi-one-dimensional systems not only provides a hallmark of ballistic transport, but also serves as a gateway for exploring quantum phenomena. Recently, a unique hidden Rashba effect attracts tremendous attention, which arises from the compensation of opposite spin polarizations of a Rashba bilayer in inversion symmetric crystals with dipole fields, such as bismuth oxyselenide ($\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$). However, investigating this effect utilizing conductance quantization is still challenging. Here we report the conductance quantization observed in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown high-mobility $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$ nanoribbon, where quantized conductance plateaus up to $44\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$ ($e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is the Planck constant, and the factor $2$ results from spin degeneracy) are achieved at zero magnetic field. Due to the hidden Rashba effect, the quantized conductance remains in multiples of $2e^{2}/{h}$ without Zeeman splitting even under magnetic field up to $12$ T. Moreover, within a specific range of magnetic field, the plateau sequence exhibits the Pascal triangle series, namely $(1,3,6,10,15\dots )\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$, reflecting the interplay of size quantization in two transverse directions. These observations are well captured by an effective hidden Rashba bilayer model. Our results demonstrate $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$ as a compelling platform for spintronics and the investigation of emergent phenomena.</p>

Investigations were conducted on both thin flat and bulk samples prepared of low-temperature Wood's metal alloy and transparent organic media (camphene and diphenylamine).

            <p>We present a phase-resolved investigation of Ni-based oxides and hydroxides relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), combining ground-state DFT+U calculations with operando and in situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by high-resolution TEM. Five crystalline phases-cubic and hexagonal NiO, monoclinic and trigonal Ni(OH)2, and NiOOH-are systematically characterized in terms of their vibrational and electronic structure. Although the DFT models are idealized (0 K, defect-free, no solvation), they serve as clean, phase-specific references for interpreting complex experimental spectra. Cubic NiO is confirmed to be dynamically and electronically stable, consistent with dominant Raman modes observed experimentally. Despite dynamic instabilities in phonon dispersions, hexagonal NiO is structurally verified via TEM, suggesting substrate- or defect-stabilized metastability. Ni(OH)2 polymorphs are both vibrationally stable semiconductors, with the trigonal phase exhibiting stronger spin polarization. NiOOH exhibits spin-polarized electronic states across the Brillouin zone, consistent with its asymmetric band structure under ferromagnetic ordering. Independently, phonon calculations reveal soft modes near the Gamma-point, indicating dynamic instability under idealized conditions, yet operando Raman spectra align closely with calculated zone-center modes. However, introducing 0.03 Angstrom symmetry-breaking displacements relaxes the NiOOH lattice off its saddle point, removing imaginary phonon modes and stabilizing the phase. This integrated framework demonstrates how idealized DFT can reveal intrinsic fingerprints that anchor the interpretation of vibrational and electronic responses in catalytically active, dynamically evolving Ni-based materials.</p>

            <h2>The Ferroelectric Superconducting Field Effect Transistor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Paghi, Laura Borgongino, Elia Strambini, Giorgio De Simoni, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto</p>
            <p>The ferroelectric field-effect transistor (Fe-FET) is a three-terminal semiconducting device first introduced in the 1950s. Despite its potential, a significant boost in Fe-FET research occurred about ten years ago with the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. This material has been incorporated into electronic processes since the mid-2000s. Here, we observed ferroelectricity in a superconducting Josephson FET (Fe-JoFET) operating at cryogenic temperatures below 1 Kelvin. The Fe-JoFET was fabricated on the InAsOI platform, which features an InAs epilayer hosted by an electrical insulating substrate, using HfO2 as the gate insulator, making it a promising candidate due to its ferroelectric properties. The Fe-JoFET exhibits significant hysteresis in the switching current and normal-state resistance transfer characteristics, which depend on the range of gate voltages. This phenomenon opens a new research area exploring the interaction between ferroelectricity and superconductivity in hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems, with potential applications in cryogenic data storage and computation. Supporting this, the Fe-JoFET was operated as a cryogenic superconducting single memory cell, exhibiting both dissipative and non-dissipative states. Its non-volatility was tested over a 24-hour measurement period. We also demonstrated that the Fe-JoFET can retain information at temperatures above the superconductor critical temperature, resulting in a temperature-fault-tolerant memory cell resistant to temperature oscillations or, in the worst case, cryostat faults.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengxin Yang, Jiangzhen Shi, Kan-Hao Xue, Jun-Hui Yuan, Xiangshui Miao</p>
            <p>There has been a high demand in rectifying the band gap under-estimation problem in density functional theory (DFT), while keeping the computational load at the same level as local density approximation. DFT-1/2 and shell DFT-1/2 are useful attempts, as they correct the spurious electron self-interaction through the application of self-energy potentials, which pull down the valence band. Nevertheless, the self-energy potential inevitably disturbs the conduction band, and these two methods fail for semiconductors whose hole and electron are entangled in the same shell-like regions. In this work, we introduce the occupation-dependent DFT-1/2 method, where conduction band states are not subject to the additional self-energy potential disturbance. This methodology works for difficult cases such as $\text{Li}_2\text{O}_2$, $\text{Cu}_2\text{O}$ and two-dimensional semiconductors. Using a shell-like region for the self-energy potential, and allowing for downscaling of the atomic self-energy potential (with an $A$ < 1 factor), the occupation-dependent shell DFT+$A$-1/2 method yields more accurate conduction band and valence band edge levels for monolayer $\text{MoS}_2$, compared with the computationally demanding hybrid functional approach.</p>

These phases feature non-trivial order with zero magnetization. The multipole models have dimer local conserved quantities that are Ising terms of spin. The Hilbert spaces are locally fragmented into independent sectors described effectively by {\it higher-order spin}. For dipole models, we consider two ladder geometries and work out the phase diagrams. Different phases of the model can be distinguished experimentally with the dynamical structure factor. Higher-order multipole models are obtained by introducing more dimer conserved quantities. The phases are characterized by the values of the local conserved quantities and the transverse-Ising phases of the higher-order spin.</p>

            <p>Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface phonon arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</p>

            <p>Ceramics are typically brittle at ambient conditions due to their covalent or ionic bonding and limited dislocation activities. While plasticity, and occasionally superplasticity, can be achieved in ceramics at high temperatures through thermally activated phenomena, creep, and grain boundary sliding, their deformation at ambient temperature and pressure remains challenging. Processing under high pressure via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method offers new pathways for severe plastic deformation (SPD) of ceramics. This article reviews recent advances in HPT processing of ceramics, focusing primarily on traditional ceramics (e.g., oxides, carbides, nitrides, oxynitrides) and to a lesser extent advanced ceramics (e.g., silicon, carbon, perovskites, clathrates). Key structural and microstructural features of SPD-processed ceramics are discussed, including phase transformations and the generation of nanograins and defects such as vacancies and dislocations. The properties and applications of these deformed ceramics are summarized, including powder consolidation, photoluminescence, bandgap narrowing, photovoltaics, photocatalysis (dye degradation, plastic waste degradation, antibiotic degradation, hydrogen production, CO2 conversion), electrocatalysis, thermoelectric performance, dielectric performance, and ion conductivity for Li-ion batteries. Additionally, the article highlights the role of HPT in synthesizing novel materials, such as high-entropy ceramics (particularly high-entropy oxides), black oxides, and high-pressure polymorphs, which hold promise for energy and environmental applications.</p>

            <p>The intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) is distinguished from the Josephson diode effect (JDE) by its manifestation of nonreciprocal critical current phenomena within a monolithic superconductor, typically linked to finite-momentum Cooper pairing. The long-standing assumption that SDE requires co-breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries proves to be necessary but not sufficient. In this work, we propose a universal diagnostic criterion. Embodied in two concise inequalities, this criterion enables convenient and intuitive assessment of whether an intrinsic SDE can emerge in a given system without requiring extensive numerical calculations. Furthermore, our universal criterion provides explicit design guidelines for material systems exhibiting intrinsic SDE.</p>

            <p>Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the torsional mechanical properties of pristine iron (Fe) and carbon-doped iron (FeC) nanowires with [001] orientation through molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. for accurately modeling Fe-C interactions in body-centered cubic structures. Systematic analysis across carbon concentrations (0 - 10%), temperatures (1 - 900 K), and cross-sectional dimensions 10a, 13a, 15a, ( where a = 2.81 Angstrom represents the lattice constant ) within the LAMMPS environment reveals that increasing carbon content weakens grain boundaries, reducing the maximum shear stress required to reach the critical torsional angle, while higher temperatures promote phase transitions from elastic to plastic deformation due to enhanced atomic vibrations, and larger cross-sections exhibit higher shear stress resistance attributed to strengthening effects from the outer atomic layers. By elucidating these interrelationships between carbon content, temperature, and dimensional factors, this work provides fundamental insights into the mechanical behavior of FeC nanowires under torsional loading conditions, offering valuable guidance for their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems, nanorobotic actuators, and advanced structural materials where precise control of mechanical properties is essential.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials showing room-temperature magnetism and high coercivity are desired for combining magnetism with semiconducting properties useful for spintronics. In this work, the magnetic properties of the 1T phase of MoS$_2$ have been studied at room temperature. We observe ferromagnetism with a coercivity of ~0.3 T and a maximum saturation magnetization of 0.26 emu/g at room temperature. This is the highest among coercivities reported so far in 2D magnets at room temperature. MoS$_2$ nanosheets are prepared using a single-step hydrothermal synthesis with a relative 1T-phase reaching up to 77%. We report a correlation between the structural and magnetic characteristics via interplanar distance and coercivity. The increase in interplanar distance is also accompanied by an increase in the 1T phase. Our results pave a useful way of controlling the coercivity and saturation magnetization in a 2D magnet with applications in spintronics and low-power quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The optical and magneto-optical properties of thin epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films, with thicknesses ranging from 8 to 160 nm, were investigated across the spectral range of 0.7-6.4 eV. The films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering on MgO substrate with stress-mediating Cr buffer layer. Structural and magnetic characterization revealed an stress-induced martensitic transformation for the films thicker than 80 nm, while thinner films remained in austenite structure deformed by substrate constraint. Both X-type and Y-type twin domains were observed in martensitic samples. Magneto-optical polar Kerr effect spectra showed notable evolution with film thicknesses, demonstrating changes in electronic structure of Ni-Mn-Ga. A combination of spectroscopic ellipsometry and magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy allowed for the deduction of the spectral dependence of full permittivity tensor of investigated samples. Three magneto-optical transitions were fitted to the spectra of non-diagonal permittivity using semiclassical theory, showing strong correlations with in-plane coercivity. Observed correlations highlight the impact of substrate-induced strain on Ni-Mn-Ga films and provide insights into the electronic structure changes associated with the martensitic transformation.</p>

            <h2>Computing dielectric spectra in molecular dynamics simulations: using a cavity to disentangle self and cross correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marceau Hénot</p>
            <p>Dielectric spectra are typically obtained in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by analyzing the fluctuations, in the absence of an applied electric field, of the total dipole moment of the simulation box. We compare this standard method with a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross-correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods. We propose that, for a liquid with a sufficiently high dielectric permittivity, the cavity protocol yields a self-spectrum consistent with the electrostatic boundary conditions applicable to the experimental situation.</p>

            <h2>Variational Approach to the Snake Instability of a Bose-Einstein Condensate Soliton</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Umut Tanyeri, Mehmet Atakan Gürkan, Ahmet Keleş, Mehmet Özgur Oktel</p>
            <p>Solitons are striking manifestations of nonlinearity, encountered in diverse physical systems such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In BECs, dark solitons emerge as exact stationary solutions of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. While they can be long-lived in elongated traps, their stability is compromised in higher dimensions due to the snake instability, which leads to the decay of the soliton into vortex structures among other excitations. We investigate the dynamics of a dark soliton in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an anisotropic harmonic trap. Using a variational ansatz that incorporates both the transverse bending of the soliton plane and the emergence of vortices along the nodal line, we derive equations of motion governing the soliton's evolution. This approach allows us to identify stable oscillation modes as well as the growth rates of the unstable perturbations. In particular, we determine the critical trap anisotropy required to suppress the snake instability. Our analytical predictions are in good agreement with full numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.</p>

            <h2>Supersymmetric properties of one-dimensional Markov generators with the links to Markov-dualities and to shape-invariance-exact-solvability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cecile Monthus</p>
            <p>For diffusion process involving the force $F(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$, the continuity equation $\partial_t P_t(x)=- \partial_xJ_t(x)$ gives the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ in terms of the current $J_t( x)=F(x)P_t(x)-D(x)\partial_x P_t(x)={\cal J}P_t( x)$ obtained from $P_t( x) $ via the application of the first-order differential current-operator ${\cal J}$. So the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ is governed by the factorized Fokker-Planck generator ${\cal F}=-\partial_x{\cal J}$, while the dynamics of the current $J_t( x)$ is governed by its supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} }= - {\cal J}\partial_x$, so that their right and left eigenvectors are directly related using the two intertwining relations ${\cal J}{\cal F}=-{\cal J}\partial_x{\cal J}={\hat {\cal F}}{\cal J}$ and ${\cal F}\partial_x=-\partial_x{\cal J}\partial_x=\partial_x{\hat {\cal F} }$. We also describe the link with the factorization of the adjoint $ {\cal F}^{\dagger}=\frac{d}{dm(x)}\frac{d}{ds(x)} $ in terms of the scale function $s(x)$ and speed measure $m(x)$. We then analyze how the supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} } = - {\cal J} \partial_x$ can be re-interpreted in two ways: (1) as the adjoint ${\mathring {\cal F}}^{\dagger} ={\mathring {\cal J} }^{\dagger} \partial_x$ of the Fokker-Planck generator ${\mathring {\cal F}}=- \partial_x{\mathring {\cal J} }$ associated to the dual force ${\mathring F}(x)=-F(x)-D'(x)$, that unifies various known Markov dualities; (2) as the non-conserved Fokker-Planck generator ${\tilde {\cal F}}_{nc} = -\partial_x{\tilde {\cal J}}-{\tilde K }(x)$ involving the force ${\tilde F}(x)=F(x) +D'(x)$ and the killing rate ${\tilde K }(x)=-F'(x)-D''(x)$, with application to shape-invariance-solvability. Finally, we describe how all these ideas can be also applied to Markov jump processes with nearest-neighbors transition rates $w(x \pm 1,x)$.</p>

            <p>Over the preceding years, nickel (Ni) and its compounds have been increasingly employed in various aspects of human social life, metallurgical/industrial manufactures, healthcare, and chemical processes. Although Ni is considered an essential trace element in biological systems, excessive intake or metabolic deficiency of \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) ions may cause detrimental health effects to living organisms. Therefore, a facile and accurate detection of \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\), especially in environmental and biological settings, is of huge significance. As an efficient detection method, assaying \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) using optical (colorimetric and/or fluorogenic) sensors has experienced quite a vigorous growth period, with a large number of excellent research contributions. Nanomaterial-based optical sensors, including metal nanoparticles (MNPs), quantum dots (QDs), and carbon dots (CDs), offer distinct advantages over conventional small-molecule organic and inorganic sensors. This study mainly provides an overview of the recent advancements and challenges related to the design strategies of various optical nanosensors to selectively detect the \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) ion. Emphasis has also been placed on comparing the sensing performance of various nanosensors, along with exploring future perspectives.</p>

            <p>Increasing the spin-orbit coupling in InGaAs quantum wells is desirable for applications involving spintronics and topological quantum computing. Digital alloying is an approach towards growing ternary quantum wells that enables asymmetric interfaces and compositional grading in the quantum well, which can potentially modify the spin-orbit coupling in the quantum well. The spin-orbit coupling of the quantum wells is extracted from beating patterns in the low magnetic field magnetoresistance. Digital alloying is found to modify the spin-orbit coupling by up to 138 meV\textnormalÅ. The changes induced in the spin-orbit coupling can be qualitatively understood as being due to modifications in the interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biel Martinez, Yann-Michel Niquet</p>
            <p>Hole spin qubits in Ge/GeSi heterostructures benefit from the clean environment of epitaxial interfaces and from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient electrical control, which makes them promising candidates for quantum computation. However, spin-orbit coupling also enhances the sensitivity to electrical disorder, potentially increasing variability. In this work, we perform numerical simulations in a realistic device geometry to quantify the variability of the charge and spin properties of Ge qubits induced by charge traps at the SiGe/oxide interfaces. We show that while the variability of charge properties remains moderate, spin properties (g-factors and Rabi frequencies) show significant dispersion. We explore the implications of this variability for large-scale architectures, and provide guidelines to minimize variability both in terms of interface quality requirements and optimal operation strategies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinwei Zheng, Martin Weinelt, Christian Strüber</p>
            <p>We observe momentum transfer in the ponderomotive potential of near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) experiments with ultrashort extreme ultraviolet probe pulses. Acceleration of photoelectrons in the transient grating provided by an intense laser pulse reflected at a surface leads to delay-dependent oscillations of electric kinetic energies. Photon and electron momenta determine the oscillation frequency. We experimentally observe and theoretically simulate electron yield modulations driven by a novel electron-energy bunching effect. Measurement results are simulated and fitted with high accuracy. Complete reversion of the ponderomotive momentum transfer allows for retrieval of the undisturbed initial state and the transient band structure for overlapping pump and probe pulses.</p>

            <p>The extreme toxicity of cyanide (\ce{CN^-}) ions in diverse environmental media has garnered significant attention toward the design of well-organized molecular probes for their selective and sensitive detection. In this context, we present a monometallic Ru(II) complex (Ru-1), based on the 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole moiety, acting as a highly selective luminescent probe for \ce{CN^-} recognition in pure water. Additionally, Ru-1 also functions as an efficient sensor for \ce{F^-}, \ce{AcO^-}, and \ce{H2PO4^-} ions, along with \ce{CN^-}, when acetonitrile is used as the solvent system. The binding constant ($K_b$) and detection limit (LoD) for \ce{CN^-} were determined to be $3.05 \times 10^6$~M$^{-1}$ and 12.8~nM, respectively, in water. The close proximity of the N--H site to the Ru(II) center, along with its notable acidity, were identified as the primary factors responsible for the high selectivity of Ru-1 toward \ce{CN^-} in aqueous media. Job's plots and density functional theory (DFT) analyses were conducted to support the anion binding mechanism. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the \ce{CN^-}-induced emission lifetime change of Ru-1 in water. To explore practical applicability, the Ru-1 probe was developed into paper-based strips capable of detecting \ce{CN^-} ions in the millimolar range via the naked eye under 365~nm UV illumination. It was also effectively applied for the detection of \ce{CN^-} in human breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines and natural food sources, such as apple seeds and sprouting potatoes.</p>

            <p>Diffusion over networks has recently been used to define spatiotemporal scales and extend Kadanoff block spins of Euclidean space to supernodes of networks in the Laplacian renormalization group (LRG). Yet, its ad hoc coarse-graining procedure remains underdeveloped and unvalidated, limiting its broader applicability. Here we rigorously formulate an LRG preserving the equilibrium state, offering a principled coarse-graining procedure. We construct the renormalized Laplacian matrix preserving dominant spectral properties using a proper, quasi-complete basis transformation and the renormalized adjacency matrix preserving mean connectivity from equilibrium-state flows among supernodes. Applying recursively this equilibrium-preserving LRG to various hypergraphs, we find that in hypertrees with low spectral dimensions vertex degree and hyperedge cardinality distributions flow toward Poissonian forms, while in hypergraphs lacking a finite spectral dimension they broaden toward power-law forms when starting from Poissonian ones, revealing how informational, structural, and dynamical scale-invariances are interrelated.</p>

            <p>Controlling the size and shape of assembled structures is a fundamental challenge in self-assembly, and is highly relevant in material design and biology. Here, we show that specific, but promiscuous, short-range binding interactions make it possible to economically assemble linear filaments of user-defined length. Our approach leads to independent control over the mean and width of the filament size distribution and allows us to smoothly explore design trade-offs between assembly quality (spread in size) and cost (number of particle species). We employ a simple hierarchical assembly protocol to minimize assembly times, and show that multiple stages of hierarchy make it possible to extend our approach to the assembly of higher-dimensional structures. Our work provides a simple and experimentally straightforward solution to size control that is immediately applicable to a broad range of systems, from DNA origami assemblies to supramolecular polymers and beyond.</p>

            <p>A comprehensive Hartree-Fock analysis of the ground-state electronic structure of spherical gold nanoparticles modeled within the jellium approximation is carried out for all systems containing up to 132 delocalized electrons. Emphasis is placed on resolving the energy-level ordering, properly describing the electron density tail and associated charge spill-out, and assessing the accuracy of local exchange and kinetic energy potentials. The calculations are performed on a high-resolution real-space grid to ensure numerical precision. Significant discrepancies are observed between the exchange energy given by the Hartree-Fock approximation and the local spin density approximation (LSDA) in both the inner and outer regions of the nanoparticle. To address these differences, a refined expression of the one-electron exchange energy density as an explicit function of the charge density is proposed. Similarly, the failure of the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy model near the surface of the nanoparticle is resolved by introducing an improved expression for the one-electron kinetic energy density.</p>

            <p>The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</p>

            <p>We report a novel localization phenomenon that emerges in non-Hermitian and quasiperiodic coupled systems, which we dub ``Anderson-Skin (AS) dualism". The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Induced Chiral Currents in a Mesoscopic Helicoidal Quantum Well</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>We introduce a mesoscopic quantum well whose confinement and chirality emerge solely from the intrinsic torsion of a finite helicoidal metric. This purely geometric construction requires no external gates or fields: the metric itself induces both a harmonic radial potential and a torsion-driven Zeeman term that breaks the $m \leftrightarrow -m$ degeneracy. By imposing hard-wall boundary conditions at $z = \pm L/2$, we quantize the axial motion and obtain a genuinely zero-dimensional helicoidal quantum dot. An exact analytic solution reveals an energy spectrum with chiral splitting linear in both the torsion parameter $\Omega$ and the axial quantum number $n_z$. For realistic InAs nanoroll parameters ($L = 100$ nm, $\Omega = 5\times10^{6} \mathrm{m^{-1}}$), this geometric effect results in a measurable splitting of $\sim 0.5$ meV. We propose three viable experimental platforms, ultracold atoms in optical traps, femtosecond-written photonic waveguides, and strain-engineered semiconductor nanorolls, where this torsion-induced phenomenon should be accessible with current technology.</p>

            <p>Generative models show great promise for the inverse design of molecules and inorganic crystals, but remain largely ineffective within more complex structures such as amorphous materials. Here, we present a diffusion model that reliably generates amorphous structures up to 1000 times faster than conventional simulations across processing conditions, compositions, and data sources. Generated structures recovered the short- and medium-range order, sampling diversity, and macroscopic properties of silica glass, as validated by simulations and an information-theoretical strategy. Conditional generation allowed sampling large structures at low cooling rates of 10$^{-2}$ K/ps to uncover a ductile-to-brittle transition and mesoporous silica structures. Extension to metallic glassy systems accurately reproduced local structures and properties from both computational and experimental datasets, demonstrating how synthetic data can be generated from characterization results. Our methods provide a roadmap for the design and simulation of amorphous materials previously inaccessible to computational methods.</p>

            <p>The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30° and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.</p>

While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.</p>

            <p>Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been in the focus of contemporary condensed matter research as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism. In the face of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical predictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb interactions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly correlated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic order, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is driven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and stabilized by the incommensurate moiré stacking with the substrate. We further identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\times$ 2 surface reconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly toggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no sign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our findings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we establish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring Moiré-assisted electronic surface order.</p>

            <p>Metal-support interfaces fundamentally govern the catalytic performance of heterogeneous systems through complex interactions. Here, utilizing operando transmission electron microscopy, we uncovered a type of looping metal-support interaction in NiFe-Fe3O4 catalysts during hydrogen oxidation reaction. At the NiFe-Fe3O4 interfaces, lattice oxygens react with NiFe-activated H atoms, gradually sacrificing themselves and resulting in dynamically migrating interfaces. Meanwhile, reduced iron atoms migrate to the {111} surface of Fe3O4 support and react with oxygen molecules. Consequently, the hydrogen oxidation reaction separates spatially on a single nanoparticle and is intrinsically coupled with the redox reaction of the Fe3O4 support through the dynamic migration of metal-support interfaces. Our work provides previously unidentified mechanistic insight into metal-support interactions and underscores the transformative potential of operando methodologies for studying atomic-scale dynamics.</p>

            <p>Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems.

With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</p>

            <p>The three-dimensional frustrated spin lattice in MgCrGaO4, where Cr3+ ions occupy a pyrochlore-like network, exemplifies a quantum magnet with competing interactions, macroscopic degeneracy, and exotic low-energy excitations. Using thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), muon spin relaxation (muSR), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) techniques, we observe no magnetic order or spin freezing down to 57 mK, despite a sizable exchange interaction (J= 58 K) between Cr3+ (S=3/2) moments and inherent site disorder. Below the characteristic exchange energy scale, all experimental probes detect the emergence of antiferromagnetic short-range spin correlations, corroborated by magnetic diffuse scattering in the wave vector dependence of low-energy magnetic excitations centered on Q = 1.5 A^-1 in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. The low-temperature specific heat follows a near-quadratic dependence without a gap, consistent with algebraic spin correlations. These results establish MgCrGaO4 as a rare three-dimensional classical spin liquid featuring a highly degenerate ground-state manifold and gapless excitations, offering a strong impetus for the experimental realization of spin liquids in higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets.</p>

            <p>We performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate, from an atomistic point of view, the formation of dislocations during the epitaxial growth of Ge on Si. We show that simulations at 900 and 1000 K with deposition rates of 10$^8$ monolayers per second provide a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy. In these conditions, the ratio between the Ge deposition rate and the ad-atom jump rate is analogous to that of out-of-equilibrium experiments. In addition, the main features of the grown film (intermixing, critical film thickness, dislocation typology, and surface morphology) are well described. Our simulations reveal that dislocations originate in low-density amorphous regions that form under valleys of the rough Ge film surface. Atoms are squeezed out of these regions to the surface, releasing the stress accumulated in the film and smoothing its surface. Amorphous regions grow until atoms begin to rearrange in dislocation half-loops that propagate throughout the Ge film. The threading arm ends of the dislocation half-loops move along the surface following valleys and avoiding islands. The film surface morphology affects the propagation path of the dislocation half-loops and the resulting dislocation network.</p>

            <h2>Instability of the Haldane Phase: Roles of Charge Fluctuations and Hund's Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoshi Nishimoto</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate the stability of the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase in spin-1/2 Heisenberg and half-filled Hubbard ladders coupled by ferromagnetic Hund's interactions. Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.</p>

            <h2>Topological defect modes in bilayer acoustic networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renaud Cote, Marc Pachebat, Antonin Coutant</p>
            <p>The bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates topological properties of a material in the bulk to the presence of robust modes localized on the edge, is at the core of the now mature field of topological wave physics. More recently, it was realized that in crystalline structures, certain types of defects can host localized modes, in which case the bulk-boundary correspondence has to be replaced by a bulk-defect correspondence. These defect-localized modes are expected to have robust properties owing to their topological origin. In this work, we show how to obtain topological defect modes in a lattice possessing both mirror and chiral symmetry. The defect is obtained by endowing a plaquette with a non-trivial gauge flux. We show that the bulk-defect correspondence is satisfied by introducing appropriate topological invariants. Moreover, the topological defect modes are shown to be highly robust to the introduction of symmetry-preserving disorder. The model is then realized in an acoustic system made of a network of tubes, and the presence of topological defect mode is experimentally clearly demonstrated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasilii Vasilchenko, Matteo Giantomassi, Samuel Poncé, Xavier Gonze</p>
            <p>The behavior of charge carriers in polar materials is governed by electron-phonon interactions, which affect their mobilities via phonon scattering and may localize carriers into self-induced deformation fields, forming self-trapped polarons. We present a first-principles study of self-trapped polaron formation in paradigmatic polar semiconductors and insulators using the variational polaron equations framework and self-consistent gradient optimization. Our method incorporates long-range corrections to the electron-phonon interaction, essential for finite-size systems. We demonstrate how the variational approach enables the identification of multiple polaronic states and supports the analysis of polarons with arbitrarily large spatial extent via energy filtering. The potential energy surfaces of the resulting polarons exhibit multiple local minima, reflecting distinct, symmetry-broken polaronic configurations in systems with degenerate band edges. Our findings align with previous theoretical studies and establish a robust foundation for future ab initio studies of polarons, especially those employing variational methods.</p>

            <h2>Self-consistent moment dynamics for networks of spiking neurons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianni Valerio Vinci, Roberto Benzi, Maurizio Mattia</p>
            <p>A novel approach to moment closure problem is used to derive low dimensional laws for the dynamics of the moments of the membrane potential distribution in a population of spiking neurons. Using spectral expansion of the density equation we derive the recursive and nonlinear relation between the moments, such as the mean potential, and the population firing rates. The self-consistent dynamics found relies on the dominant eigenvalues of the evolution operator, tightly related to the moments of the single-neuron inter-spike interval distribution. Contrary to previous attempts our system can be applied both in noise- and drift-dominated regime, and both for weakly and strongly coupled population. We demonstrate the applicability of the theory for the case of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons deriving closed analytical expressions. Truncating the mode decomposition to the first few more relevant moments, results to effectively describe the population dynamics both out-of-equilibrium and in response to strongly-varying inputs.</p>

            <h2>Pseudo-likelihood produces associative memories able to generalize, even for asymmetric couplings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco D'Amico, Dario Bocchi, Luca Maria Del Bono, Saverio Rossi, Matteo Negri</p>
            <p>Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small, patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics (spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory and generalization.</p>

            <h2>Statistical characterization of valley coupling in Si/SiGe quantum dots via $g$-factor measurements near a valley vortex</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin D. Woods, Merritt P. Losert, Nasir R. Elston, M. A. Eriksson, S. N. Coppersmith, Robert Joynt, Mark Friesen</p>
            <p>The presence of low-energy valley excitations in Si/SiGe heterostructures often causes spin qubits to fail. It is therefore important to develop robust protocols for characterizing the valley coupling. Here, we show that realistically sized samplings of valley energy distributions tend to dramatically overestimate the average valley coupling. But we find that knowledge of the valley phase, in addition to the valley splitting, can significantly improve our estimates. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel method to probe the valley phase landscape across the quantum well using simple $g$-factor measurements. An important calibration step in this procedure is to measure $g$ in a loop enclosing a valley vortex, where the valley phase winds by $\pm 2\pi$ around a zero of the valley splitting. This proposal establishes an important new tool for probing spin qubits, and it can be implemented in current experiments.</p>

            <p>The topological magnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT), with gapped topological surface state, is an attractive platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall and Axion insulator states. However, the experimentally observed surface state gaps fail to meet theoretical predictions, although the exact mechanism behind the gap suppression has been debated. Recent theoretical studies suggest that intrinsic antisite defects push the topological surface state away from the MBT surface, closing its gap and making it less accessible to scanning probe experiments. Here, we report on the local effect of defects on the MBT surface states and demonstrate that high defect concentrations lead to a displacement of the surface states well into the MBT crystal, validating the theorized mechanism. The local and global influence of antisite defects on the topological surface states are studied with samples of varying defect densities by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT). Our findings identify a combination of increased defect density and reduced defect spacing as the primary factors underlying the displacement of the surface states and suppression of surface gap, shedding light to further development of topological quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Frustrated random interactions are a key ingredient of spin glasses. From this perspective, we study the dynamics of the Kuramoto model with quenched random couplings: the simplest oscillator ensemble with fully disordered interactions. We answer some open questions by means of extensive numerical simulations and a perturbative calculation (the cavity method). We show frequency entrainment is not realized in the thermodynamic limit and that chaotic dynamics are pervasive in parameter space. In the weak coupling regime, we find closed formulas for the frequency shift and the dissipativeness of the model. Interestingly, the largest Lyapunov exponent is found to exhibit the same asymptotic dependence on the coupling constant irrespective of the coupling asymmetry, within the numerical accuracy.</p>

            <p>We provide an overview of the methodology and fundamental principles associated with newly developed experimental technique -- scanning quantum-vortex microscopy [Hovhannisyan et al., Commun. Mater., vol. 6, 42 (2025)]. This approach appears promising for experimental studies of vortex pinning phenomena in superconducting films and nanodevices. In particular, we studied the magnetic properties of magnetron-sputtered niobium (Nb) films by low-temperature magnetic force microscopy. As the temperature approaches the superconducting critical temperature, the pinning potential caused by structural defects weakens; consequently, the attractive interaction between the magnetic tip of the cantilever and a single-quantum vortex begins to dominate. In this scenario the magnetic probe is capable of trapping a vortex during the scanning process. Because the dragged vortex continues interacting with structural defects, it serves as an efficient nano-probe to explore pinning potentials and visualize grain boundaries in granular Nb films, achieving resolutions (30 nm) comparable to the superconducting coherence length.</p>

            <p>Hafnia-based ferroelectrics are revolutionizing the data storage industry and the field of ferroelectrics, with improved materials and devices being reported monthly. However, full understanding and control has not been reached yet and the ideal material still needs to be found. Here we report ferroelectric hafnia-zirconia superlattices made out of zirconium-substituted hafnia (Hf$_{1-x}$Zr$_x$O$_2$) sublayers of varying stoichiometries alternating with pure ZrO$_2$ sublayers. It is observed that the ZrO$_2$ layers in these superlattices act as a booster for the total remnant polarization (P$_r$). By combining the benefits of the ZrO$_2$ layers and the added interfaces, which help prevent breakdown, we fabricate superlattices with a total 87.5% ZrO$_2$ content, exhibiting record polarizations with a 2P$_r$ value of 84 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ that can be cycled 10$^9$ times, while maintaining a 2P$_r$ > 20 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Next to these attractive properties, substitution of HfO$_2$ by the much more abundant ZrO$_2$ offers a significant step towards the sustainable application of these devices.</p>

            <p>Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moiré excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moiré excitons hybridize with photons to form moiré exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features. In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moiré excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moiré patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moiré polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moiré excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujoy Datta, Prashant Singh</p>
            <p>The future of spintronic and semiconductor applications demands materials with tailored electronic and magnetic properties. This study uses density functional theory to investigate the electronic structure of the half-metallic compound Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ under uniaxial strain and in its Ge-substituted derivatives. Strain analysis shows that although the half-metallic band-gap collapses under strain beyond $-2\%$, the ferrimagnetic character remains stable. Ge substitution at six inequivalent Al-sites in Mn$_{4}$Al$_{11}$ results in varying degrees of metallicity and magnetic properties. Substitution at Al$=(000)$ induces a metal-to-insulator transition with an indirect semiconducting gap of $0.14~ eV$. Bonding and hybridization analysis reveals that local Mn-Al interactions due to Ge substitution significantly modify the local electronic structure, causing both electronic and magnetic phase transitions. This work highlights the effectiveness of substitutional doping in tuning half-metallicity and magnetic properties in inorganic solids, enabling the design of materials for future technological applications.</p>

            <p>Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing the key phenomena, such as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions present in the system. In this study, we investigate the intraband and interband polarizability within the random phase approximation for the three-dimensional nodal line semimetals, specifically for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and ZrSiS. We find both intraband and interband contributions show tunable behavior with the chemical potential, which adds a resonance signature in the behavior of the polarizability. Further, in the long wavelength limit, the results reveal the quadratic dependence on the wave vector by the non-resonant intraband and interband parts of the polarizability. On the other hand, the resonant interband part gives a cubic dependence on the wave vector. In addition, the total polarizability is dominated by the intraband part in the low frequency regime, while in the mid and high frequency regimes, the interband part takes the lead. This study opens avenues for further theoretical and experimental exploration of frequency dependent dielectric properties, paving the way for potential applications in tunable plasmonic devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate the fluctuating Stokes equation in the presence of spatially correlated noise -- characterized by a single length scale -- while preserving thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends nonmonotonically on the ratio $\ell/r$ between the correlation length $\ell$ and the particle radius $r$: the MSD decreases as $\ell$ approaches $r$, reaches a minimum near $\ell\simeq r$, and rises again for $\ell > r$. The initial suppression stems from transient trapping, where sluggish momentum diffusion at short wavelengths confines the particle. When $\ell>r$, the particle hops between traps and eventually recovers normal diffusion ($\text{MSD}\propto t$) consistent with the fact that momentum diffusion crosses over to the standard Laplacian at long wavelengths. We further illustrate that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equations, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</p>

            <p>Recently, "photovoltaic photographs" were proposed as a creative application of photovoltaic technologies, relevant in fields such as architecture or the automotive industry. In this application an image is created by light-induced patterning of the photoactive layer, causing a local change in the appearance of the solar cell. In order to further develop this concept, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanism underlying these local changes. Here, UV-VIS and infrared spectroscopic techniques, as well as Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, have been used to investigate the physico-chemical changes induced by this process in the photoactive layer of proof-of-concept photo-patterned dye-sensitized solar cells. We show that, for N719 photovoltaic photographs, TiO2 plays a crucial role and that the dye undergoes a multi-step chemical degradation, related to its isothiocyanate ligand. These insights are of importance for a better understanding of the photo-induced degradation of N719, a more substantiated control of the light-induced patterning process, and to design appropriate light-induced patterning techniques for other classes of solar cells.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Bursik, F. Bender, R. Stierle, G. Bauer, J. Gross</p>
            <p>We assess the capabilities of hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) to predict mass transfer across vapor-liquid interfaces by studying the response of an initially equilibrated pure component vapor-liquid system to the localized insertion of a second component. Hydrodynamic DFT captures the effect of interfaces on the dynamics by modeling the chemical potential gradients of an inhomogeneous system based on classical DFT. Hydrodynamic DFT effectively connects molecular models with continuum fluid dynamics. Away from interfaces the framework simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations. We employ Maxwell-Stefan diffusion with a generalized driving force to model diffusive molecular transport in inhomogeneous systems. For the considered Lennard--Jones truncated and shifted (LJTS) fluid, we utilize a non-local Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed truncated and shifted (PeTS) equation of state. The model provides noise-free partial densities and fluxes for the mass transfer near the interface, as well as profiles of these quantities across the interface. A comparison with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations shows that hydrodynamic DFT accurately predicts mass transfer across the interface, including microscopic phenomena such as the temporary enrichment and repulsion of the light boiling component at the interface. Combining generalized entropy scaling with generalized Maxwell-Stefan diffusion allows for an accurate description of diffusive molecular transport in the system. This approach can accurately predict phase behavior, equilibrium interfaces, and mass transfer across interfaces based on molecular interactions for mixtures of strongly dissimilar components. Our results suggest that hydrodynamic DFT can accurately predict the dynamics of mixtures at vapor-liquid interfaces.</p>

            <p>In soft matter science, it is often the goal to design new materials with targeted properties. These materials can be used in many applications, each requiring specific features to be optimized for maximum fitness. The use of self-assembly processes, where a target structure is attained from suitably designed building blocks, is a powerful tool for this optimization. However, it is still an open question how to generally design realizable building blocks that lead to the desired phases. In this work, the double gyroid is chosen as target structure and DNA functionalized nanoparticles are used as our building blocks. Using existing pair potentials as inspiration, a large design space is defined for exploration of the target structure. An effective search strategy is implemented, where free energy calculations are first used to coarse grain our originally fine-grained model of the building blocks and then quickly evaluate the fitness of each design. These data are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that allows obtaining predictions for all candidates in our design space through an active learning loop. Successful coarse-grained designs are identified and evaluated again through interfacial pinning calculations with the fine-grained model. This work leads to the development of specific, experimentally relevant designs of DNA functionalized nanoparticles that self-assembly into the target phase. The methodology used can be extended to other types of building blocks and target structures.</p>

            <p>Wet-chemistry synthesized Gold nanourchins (Au NUs), characterized by spiky morphologies with spherical cores, exhibit complex and geometry-dependent plasmonic properties distinct from those of symmetrical nanostructures. While plasmon hybridization and mode coupling in branched nanostructures have been broadly studied, the specific optical behavior of Au NUs-particularly regarding spike length distribution and ultrafast dynamics-remains underexplored. This study investigates the steady-state and transient absorption spectra of Au NUs with 50-80 nm cores and 5-20 nm spikes, revealing multiple resonance bands. Transient absorption spectroscopy at various excitation wavelengths confirmed the presence of distinct resonances. Electromagnetic simulations based on TEM tomography-inspired models identified two key extinction bands: a green-wavelength dark mode resonance and a red-nIR spike-induced resonance attributed to the lightning rod effect. Simulations further showed that short, uniformly distributed spikes (aspect ratio <= 1) weakly excite dark resonances, while longer spikes (aspect ratio > 1) induce hybridized longitudinal resonances and significant redshifts. Broad spike length distributions result in multiple coexisting resonances, aligning with experimental extinction spectra. A preliminary surface-enhanced Raman scattering study using 2-naphthalene thiol confirmed stronger enhancement for long-spiked Au NUs under 785 nm excitation, validating the field enhancement potential of the identified resonances.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunrui Qiu, Richard John, Lukas Herron, Pratyush Tiwary</p>
            <p>Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work, we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow, important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive computational results.</p>

            <h2>Tunable and low-noise WSe$_2$ quantum emitters for quantum photonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Athanasios Paralikis, Pawel Wyborski, Pietro Metuh, Niels Gregersen, Battulga Munkhbat</p>
            <p>Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\sim$170 $\mu$eV to $\sim$40 $\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\sim$500 $\mu$eV to $\sim$150 $\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\sim$100 $\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit: the linewidth ratio $R = W_{\text{exp}} / W_{\text{rad}}$ and total broadening $\Delta W = W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{rad}}$, with both being reduced more than five-fold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single-photons for future photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling temperature and Reynolds number effects in quantum turbulence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Ignacio Polanco, Philippe-E. Roche, Luminita Danaila, Emmanuel Lévêque</p>
            <p>The interplay between viscous and frictional dissipation is key to understanding quantum turbulence dynamics in superfluid $^4$He. Based on a coarse-grained two-fluid description, an original scale-by-scale energy budget that identifies each scale's contribution to energy dissipation is derived. Using the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) model to further characterize mutual friction, direct numerical simulations at temperatures $1.44 \, \mathrm{K} \lesssim T \lesssim 2.16 \, \mathrm{K}$ indicate that mutual friction promotes intense momentum exchanges between the two fluids to maintain a joint energy cascade despite their viscosity mismatch. However, the resulting overall frictional dissipation remains small (compared to the viscous dissipation) and confined to far-dissipative scales. This remarkable feature allows us to define an effective Reynolds number for the turbulence intensity in a two-fluid system, helping to disentangle the effects of Reynolds number and temperature in quantum turbulence. Thereby, simple physical arguments predict that the distance $\ell$ between quantized vortices (normalized by the turbulence integral scale $L_0$) should behave as $\ell/L_0 \approx 0.5 \, \mathrm{Re}_\kappa^{-3/4}$ with the Reynolds number based on the quantum of circulation $\kappa$. This law is well supported by a large set of experimental and numerical data within the temperature range of the HVBK model. Finally, this new approach offers the possibility of revisiting the ongoing controversy on intermittency in quantum turbulence. It is shown that observed changes in intermittency arise from Reynolds number effects rather than from temperature variations, as proposed in recent studies.</p>

            <p>Germanium spin qubits exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction, which allow for high-fidelity qubit control, but also provide a strong dependence on the magnetic field. Superconducting vector magnets are often used to minimize dephasing due to hyperfine interactions and to maximize spin control, but these compromise the sample space and thus challenge scalability. Here, we explore whether a permanent magnet outside the cryostat can be used as an alternative. Operating in a hybrid mode with an internal and external magnet, we find that we can fine-tune the magnetic field to an in-plane orientation. We obtain a qubit dephasing time T2*=13 microseconds, Hahn-echo times T2H=88 microseconds, and an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity above 99.9%, from which we conclude that room temperature magnets allow for high qubit performance. Furthermore, we probe the qubit resonance frequency using only the external magnet, with the internal superconducting magnet switched off. Our approach may be used to scale semiconductor qubits and use the increased sample space for the integration of cryogenic control circuitry and wiring to advance to large-scale quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We formulate a spatial extension of the Leggett-Garg inequality by considering three distant observers locally measuring a many-body system at three subsequent times. The spatial form, in particular, is specially suited to analyze propagation of quantum perturbations through spin chains, by capturing how a measurement at one site can later affect distant sites due to the interactions. We illustrate our proposal for a Heisenberg chain in a magnetic field, showing indeed that the first inequality-violation time scales proportionally to the distance between measuring parties. We attribute this phenomenon to Lieb-Robinson physics and, confirming this connection, we find that violations are anticipated when increasing the interaction range. The inequality violation, readily observable in current experiments, demonstrates the incompatibility between two-point correlation functions and the macrorealistic hypothesis. In outlook, spatial Leggett-Garg inequalities constitute a new tool for analyzing the non-relativistic dynamics of many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The complex absorbing potential (CAP) formalism has been successfully employed in various wavefunction-based methods to study electronic resonance states. In contrast, Green's function-based methods are widely used to compute ionization potentials and electron affinities but have seen limited application to resonances. We integrate the CAP formalism within the $GW$ approximation, enabling the description of electronic resonances in a Green's function framework. This approach entails a fully complex treatment of orbitals and quasiparticle energies in a non-Hermitian setting. We validate our CAP-$GW$ implementation by applying it to the prototypical shape resonances of \ce{N2^-}, \ce{CO^-}, \ce{CO_2^-}, \ce{C2H2-}, \ce{C2H4-}, and \ce{CH2O-}. It offers a fast and practical route to approximate both the lifetimes and positions of resonance states, achieving an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art wavefunction-based methods.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks To Inverse Design Metasurfaces For Incident Angle-Independent Unidirectional Transmission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreeraj Rajan Warrier, Jayasri Dontabhaktuni</p>
            <p>Optimization of metasurface designs for specific functionality is a challenging problem due to the intricate relation between structural features and electromagnetic responses. Recently, many researchers resolved to inverse design of metasurfaces for efficient design parameters based on methods such as parameter optimization, evolutionary optimization and machine learning. In this paper a hybrid quantum machine learning method which uses quantum encoders to enhance the performance of a classical GAN is applied to implement inverse design of a metasurface. Aiming towards angle-independent unidirectional transmission, this approach combines a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to optimize metasurface designs. Incident-angle independent uni-directional transmission has potential applications in efficient solar cells, thermal cooling, non-reciprocal devices, etc. However, it is very challenging to achieve such a metasurface design via forward methods and hence very few studies exist till now in this direction. The methodology employed in this work reduces the data requirement for inverse design by 30% compared to conventional GAN-based methods. More importantly, the developed metasurface designs show high fidelity of 95% with regard to the targeted far-field radiation patterns. We also provide a material look-up table for feasible substitutes of the obtained material design with real materials and yet maintaining performance accuracy. Further, we embed the inverse-designed metasurfaces into Perovskite solar cell layers to demonstrate the improvement in its performance. We observe that the conversion efficiency of the example perovskite solar cell improves by 95% and remains independent of incident angle in the range -60$^\circ$ to 60$^\circ$ within the desired frequency range.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew D Butler, Benjamin J Walker, Thomas Montenegro-Johnson, Panayiota Katsamba</p>
            <p>Active deformable filaments exhibit a large range of qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics, depending on their flexibility, the strength of the active forcing, and the surrounding environment. For a sufficiently strong activity, the resulting forces buckle the filament into different shapes, altering its dynamic behaviour. We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with an efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics, including motions that may be described as planar swimming, circling, pinwheeling, flapping and diffusive.</p>

            <p>The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045 (2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a critical number of photons associated to the nonlinear coupling, yielding a theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon molecule in the high-power regime for high-fidelity qubit readout.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum melting of quasiperiodic attractors in driven-dissipative cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline Nowoczyn, Ludwig Mathey, Kilian Seibold</p>
            <p>Nonlinear classical mechanics has established countless intriguing and profound phenomena. These include limit tori defined by toroidal attractors that support quasiperiodic motion of at least two incommensurate frequencies. Here we address the question, whether and how such phenomena persist in open quantum systems. We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the Lindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled driven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian and the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the quantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs of purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent quasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small negative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of these modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the classical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase transition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry. Analysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced dephasing as the primary mechanism behind this "quantum melting" of the torus. We quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter, revealing universal scaling with both system size and time. These scaling laws are robust and independent of microscopic parameters. Our results establish the quantum melting of limit tori as a distinct non-equilibrium critical phenomenon and provide concrete signatures for experimental observation in trapped ions and superconducting circuits.</p>

For a periodic (Floquet) non-unitary evolution, such circuits are exactly tractable and admit volume-to-area law transitions. We show that breaking time-translation symmetry down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin. Furthermore, for some classes of random non-unitary circuits, we demonstrate the robustness of the volume-to-area law phase transition for arbitrary random realizations, thanks to the emergent compactness of the classical map encoding the circuit's dynamics.</p>

            <p>We develop a conformal geometric model for grain boundaries in graphene based on a periodic line of alternating disclinations. Within the framework of (2+1)-dimensional gravity, we solve a reduced form of the Einstein equations to determine the conformal factor, from which the induced metric, scalar curvature, and holonomy are obtained analytically. Each pentagon-heptagon pair is modeled as a disclination dipole, forming a continuous distribution that captures the geometric signature of experimentally observed 5-7 grain boundaries. We show that the curvature is localized near the defect line and that the geometry becomes asymptotically flat, with trivial holonomy at large distances. This construction provides a tractable and physically consistent realization of the Katanaev-Volovich framework, connecting topological defect theory with atomistic features of graphene.</p>

            <p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.

Here we present a distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to 128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.</p>

            <p>Understanding mechanisms of rare but important events in complex molecular systems, such as protein folding or ligand (un)binding, requires accurately mapping transition paths from an initial to a final state. The committor is the ideal reaction coordinate for this purpose, but calculating it for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems has long been considered intractable. Here, we introduce an iterative path sampling strategy for computing the committor function for systems with high free energy barriers. We start with an initial guess to define isocommittor interfaces for transition interface sampling. The resulting path ensemble is then reweighted and used to train a neural network, yielding a more accurate committor model. This process is repeated until convergence, effectively solving the long-standing circular problem in enhanced sampling where a good reaction coordinate is needed to generate efficient sampling, and vice-versa. The final, converged committor model can be interrogated to extract mechanistic insights. We demonstrate the power of our method on a benchmark 2D potential and a more complex host-guest (un)binding process in explicit solvent.</p>

            <p>We theoretically analyze the Photosystem II reaction center using a quantum master equation approach, where excitonic and charge-transfer rates are computed at the Redfield and Förster levels with realistic spectral densities. The focus is on ergotropy, the maximum work extractable from a quantum state without energy loss. We compute the ergotropy by constructing passive states in the thermodynamic sense. Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes. Our findings highlight how biological systems may exploit non-equilibrium population structures to optimize energy conversion, connecting quantum thermodynamic principles to biological energy harvesting.</p>

            <p>The enhancement of power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of single-junction solar cells is a key objective in the advancement of hot carrier solar cells. Recent findings indicate that quantum wells (QWs) can effectively generate hot carriers by confining charged carriers within their potential wells and by optimizing material properties. Here, we investigate the impact of quantum confinement on the thermodynamic properties of photogenerated hot carriers in p-i-n InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructure diodes, utilizing QW thicknesses of 4 nm, 5.5 nm, and 7.5 nm. The optical properties of these nanostructures reveal significant hot carrier effects at various lattice temperatures, with a pronounced effect noted at lower temperatures. The experimental results indicate that the widest QW exhibits stronger hot carrier effects than the thinner QWs. Additionally, the open-circuit voltage of the samples demonstrates a correlation with the degree of quantum confinement, mirroring trends observed in the quasi-Fermi level splitting of hot carriers. However, the magnitudes recorded exceed the bandgap of the quantum structures, suggesting that this behavior may be influenced by the barrier layer. Furthermore, the short-circuit current of the samples reveals a strong dependence on excitation power, but not on the degree of quantum confinement. This indicates that the majority of the photocurrent is generated in the barrier, with negligible contributions from photogenerated carriers within the QWs. This study provides insights into the role of quantum confinement on the opto-electrical properties of non-equilibrium hot carrier populations in QW structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andonis Gerardos</p>
            <p>This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited. We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B} \ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model ($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more parameters than necessary when comparing many models. Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC, cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model identification and predictive capability. Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals ($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data. PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with stochastic dynamics.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling, feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment on the utility of transfer learning.</p>

            <p>The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct $\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of 4.</p>

To verify this conjecture, a numerical search for states with constant enstrophy flux in wavenumber space over finite time intervals in two-dimension turbulence is conducted using a Monte Carlo method. Properties of the obtained states, such as energy spectrum and spectra related to fourth-order moments, are examined and compared with those of turbulence states obtained from direct numerical simulations. The dependence of the obtained states on the time interval and the initial conditions used in the numerical search is also discussed.</p>

            <p>We theoretically discuss a new kind of photonic spin-Hall effect (PSHE) for optical beams propagating inside an inhomogeneously twisted anisotropic material. The rotation angle plays the role of an effective gauge field. When the twisting distribution is odd symmetric, the optical beams move along mirror-symmetric trajectories according to their helicity. Connection of this volumetric PSHE with the geometric phase and the Kapitza effect is elucidated.</p>

            <h2>What is emergence, after all?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abbas K. Rizi</p>
            <p>The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</p>

            <h2>Universal Bound States in Long-range Spin Chains with an Impurity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Sun, Lei Feng, Pengfei Zhang</p>
            <p>Understanding how quasi-particles interact with impurities is crucial for unveiling novel properties of quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the enhanced scattering between electrons and magnetic impurities in the low-energy limit, which gives rise to the Kondo effect. In this letter, motivated by recent developments in quantum simulation platforms, we investigate the universal behavior of long-range quantum spin chains with a single local impurity, focusing on systems that conserve the magnon number. Using effective field theory, we show that distinct classes of universal three-magnon states can emerge when the impurity-mediated two-magnon interaction is on resonance. When the long-range coupling decays as $1/r^\alpha$, we find that (i) for $\alpha\in (2,2.89)$, the system exhibits Efimov effects, with the three-body binding energy forming a geometric series $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-n (\alpha-1) \pi/s_0(\alpha)$, (ii) for $\alpha=2$, the system shows semi-super Efimov effects with $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-(n\pi-\theta)^2/8$. Our theoretical prediction is validated by the numerical solution of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. Our results could be tested experimentally in the future on quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <h2>Structure and dynamics jointly stabilize the international trade hypergraph</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jung-Ho Kim, Sudo Yi, Sang-Hwan Gwak, K.-I. Goh, D.-S. Lee</p>
            <p>Understanding how fluctuations arise and spread in the international trade system can help assess the current state and guide future developments. We analyze the world trade data to investigate strong adverse fluctuations, characterized here as `collapsed trades' -- individual trades that experience significant declines in annual trade volume compared to the previous year. Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades are clustered similar to infectious disease outbreaks in societies. Moreover, the portion of collapsed trades is found to be negatively correlated with trade volume. We develop a collapse propagation model, an epidemic-like model with a weight-dependent infection rate, that reproduces all the essential empirical features. Through both analytical and numerical analysis, we identify two key factors that synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse and serve as a joint stabilizing mechanism for the international economy: i) a positive correlation between a trade's degree (the number of adjacent trades) and its volume and ii) an algebraically decaying infection rate with trade volume. In particular, the second factor weakened during the 2008--2009 global economic recession, possibly explaining the broader spread of collapse.</p>

            <h2>Work and entropy of mixing in isolated quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Budhaditya Bhattacharjee, Rohit Kishan Ray, Dominik Šafránek</p>
            <p>The mixing of two different gases is one of the most common natural phenomena, with applications ranging from CO$_2$ capture to water purification. Traditionally, mixing is analyzed in the context of local thermal equilibrium, where systems exchange energy with a heat bath. Here, we study mixing in an isolated system with potentially non-equilibrium initial states, characterized solely by macroscopic observables. We identify the entropy of mixing as a special case of observational entropy within an observer-dependent framework, where both entropy and extractable work depend on the resolution of measurement. This approach naturally resolves the Gibbs mixing paradox in quantum systems: while an observer experiences a discontinuous increase in entropy upon learning of the existence of two particle types, this knowledge does not provide an advantage in work extraction if the types of particles remain operationally indistinguishable in their measurements. Finally, we derive a Landauer-like bound on the difference in energy extracted by two observers, where an "observational temperature" emerges, determined by the accessible information. These results provide a foundation for rigorously determining the energy required to unmix in non-equilibrium settings and extend beyond quantum systems, offering insights into the thermodynamics of isolated classical gases.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling strategies and entanglement transitions in unitary circuit games with matchgates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raúl Morral-Yepes, Marc Langer, Adam Gammon-Smith, Barbara Kraus, Frank Pollmann</p>
            <p>In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a "disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.</p>

Due to doping-induced symmetry breaking within the host crystal, electronic defect states emerge around the thorium nucleus and can facilitate nuclear (de)excitation via laser-assisted electronic bridge mechanisms. We investigate spontaneous and laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for different charge compensation mechanisms. While the calculated spontaneous electronic bridge rates are very small, laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for nuclear (de)excitation turn out to be significantly more efficient than both spontaneous nuclear decay and direct laser excitation, offering promising prospects for the future clock operation.</p>

            <p>We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g., mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional (2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500 devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently, fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models, including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination ($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets online.</p>

            <h2>Intuitive dissection of the Gaussian information bottleneck method with an application to optimal prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vahe Galstyan, Age Tjalma, Pieter Rein ten Wolde</p>
            <p>Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader, non-Gaussian contexts.</p>

            <h2>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David E. Evans, Corey Jones</p>
            <p>We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.</p>

            <p>Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this, we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.</p>

            <p>Hyperuniform structures are spatial patterns whose fluctuations disappear on long length scales, making them effectively homogeneous when observed from afar. Mathematically, this means that their spectral density, $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, approaches zero for low wavenumber, $|\textbf{k}|$. Crystalline lattices are hyperuniform, as are certain quasicrystals, maximally random jammed packing of spheres, and electrons in the fractional quantum Hall state. Stealthy-hyperuniformity is an even stronger constraint on the spectral density: it requires that $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$ is strictly zero in a finite range of wavevectors around $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, called the stealthy regime, or exclusion region. Since the degree of scattering by disorder is, to leading order, proportional to $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, waves propagating through such structures may do so without scattering for sufficiently long wavelengths and short distances. Here, we measure scattering by disorder in photonic crystal slabs with stealthy-hyperuniform disorder by measuring the linewidths of the photonic bands. We observe the transition between the stealthy and non-stealthy regimes, marked by a sharp increase in linewidth. We also observe the effects of multiple scattering in the stealthy regime, which implies diminishing transparency. Moreover, we show that residual single scattering in the stealthy regime arises from an intrinsically non-Hermitian effect: propagating light has a complex effective mass due to radiative loss out of the slab.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Chamon, Andrei E. Ruckenstein, Eduardo R. Mucciolo, Ran Canetti</p>
            <p>Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem [1,2,3]. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (``wormhole'') connecting the two sides of an AdS ``eternal'' black hole [4]. Here we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally-equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides a new perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide.</p>

            <p>Acoustic metamaterials have gained popularity as promising materials for enhancing noise reduction. Here, we explore the use of metamaterials, based on Helmholtz resonators (HRs), to enhance the performance of standard clay hollow brick. By incorporating HRs in the upper and lower hollows, we transform the standard brick into metaBrick, which is essentially designed based on metamaterial principles. We evaluate the acoustic and thermal performance of walls constructed with clay metaBricks, focusing on sound transmission loss and heat resistance. Both the finite element method and experimental analysis were employed to highlight the performance of metaBricks compared to standard clay bricks. Results show that metaBricks significantly enhance acoustic and thermal insulation, achieving an attenuation of $20$ \si{dB} across a broad frequency range from $500$ to $2500$ \si{Hz} and an $8$\% increase in thermal resistance. However, compressive strength is reduced by $33$\%, though it remains above the standard requirements for building materials. These findings indicate that metaBrick is a promising building material, offering improved sound and thermal insulation.</p>

Since stable topological bands are also present in these systems, the interplay of both phases is discussed, showing that corner charges appear in over 80% of the materials and are linked to fragile topology. Using first-principles calculations, we predict fractionally-charged corner charges protected by $C_3$ symmetry.

            <p>Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated nanoparticles derived from natural cellulose, with potential applications ranging from rheological modifiers and emulsion stabilizers to photonic pigments and sensors. For most applications, precise control over CNC morphology and surface chemistry is essential, but the relationship between process parameters, CNC characteristics, and their resulting behavior is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of centrifugation and ionic strength on CNC morphology after dialysis using transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron diffraction. We find that the centrifugation step commonly applied during CNC purification promotes the formation of compact composite nanoparticles made of aligned crystallites, referred to as 'bundles', that are associated preferentially along their hydrophobic faces. In stark contrast, transient exposure to high ionic strength leads to fractal-like, irregular composite nanoparticles. We then examine the consequence of these morphological differences on the cholesteric self-organization of the CNCs: aligned bundles reduce the cholesteric pitch in suspension, causing a blue-shift in the color of dish-cast photonic films, while misaligned particles promote gelation, producing colorless films. This study reveals the importance of sample history, in particular, the often-disregarded purification steps, on CNC characteristics and their ensemble behavior, thereby unlocking new routes for tailoring this promising nanomaterial.</p>

            <p>Feynman diagrams are an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, stochastic quantum Monte Carlo sampling suffers from the sign problem, particularly when solving a multiorbital quantum impurity model. Recently, two approaches have been proposed for efficient numerical treatment of Feynman diagrams: Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) to replace stochastic sampling and the Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) representation for compressing space-time dependence. One of the remaining challenges is the nontrivial task of identifying low-rank structures in weak-coupling Feynman diagrams for multiorbital electron-phonon systems. In particular, the traditional TCI algorithm faces an ergodicity problem, which prevents it from fully exploring the multiorbital space. To address this, we incorporate a new algorithm called global search, which resolves this issue. By combining this approach with QTT, we uncover low-rank structures and achieve efficient numerical integration with exponential resolution in time and faster-than-power-law convergence of error relative to computational cost. Additionally, our approach does not require the division of discontinuous regions necessary in non-quantics TCI.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry Lane, Martin Mourigal</p>
            <p>In two dimensional magnets, the interplay of thermal fluctuations and spin anisotropy control the existence of long-range magnetic order. In the van der Waals antiferromagnets FePX$_3$, orbital degeneracy in the $t2g$ levels of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions in octahedral coordination yields strong uniaxial anisotropy, which stabilizes magnetic order up to T$\approx$100 K. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements around the magnetic ordering transition have shown the existence of a broad spectrum of magnetic fluctuations with nontrivial momentum dependence, which has been interpreted as evidence for localized entangled cluster excitations. In this paper, we offer an alternative interpretation using classical nonlinear spin dynamics simulations. We present stochastic Landau Lifshitz dynamics simulations that reproduce the neutron scattering measurements of Chen et al. [npj Quantum Mater. 9, 40 (2024)] on FePSe$_3$. These calculations faithfully explain the dynamical structure factor's momentum and energy dependence and point to a classical origin for the excitations observed in neutron spectroscopy and that the order-disorder transition can be understood in terms of thermal fluctuations overcoming the anisotropy energy.</p>

            <p>Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports soft magnon modes. In particular, we show that these soft modes can mediate pairing through inter-band scattering events that are symmetry-forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, thus providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</p>

            <p>As a fundamental thermodynamic principle, speed limits reveal the lower bound of entropy production (EP) required for a system to transition from a given initial state to a final state. While various speed limits have been developed for continuous-time Markov processes, their application to discrete-time Markov chains remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the speed limits in discrete-time Markov chains, focusing on two types of EP commonly used to measure the irreversibility of a discrete-time process: time-reversed EP and time-backward EP. We find that time-reversed EP satisfies the speed limit for the continuous-time Markov processes, whereas time-backward EP does not. Additionally, for time-reversed EP, we derive practical speed limits applicable to systems driven by cyclic protocols or with unidirectional transitions, where conventional speed limits become meaningless or invalid. We show that these relations also hold for continuous-time Markov processes by taking the time-continuum limit of our results. Finally, we validate our findings through several examples.</p>

We investigate the supercurrent properties and discover non-reciprocal supercurrents for both the Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states with distinct spatial dependencies.

Apart from the antiferromagnetic phase, we find a magnetically ordered phase with left-left-right-right order and a gapless phase with central charge value $c=1$, resolving the existing contradictory results in literature regarding this parameter region. In particular, the origin of the left-left-right-right order is clarified based on a perturbative Luttinger liquid analysis. The left-left-right-right phase is further shown to persist in the Kitaev-Heisenberg-Gamma model when a small nonzero Gamma interaction is introduced. Using a coupled-chain method, we also demonstrate that the one-dimensional (1D) left-left-right-right order gives a quasi-1D explanation for the 2D stripy order of the same model on the honeycomb lattice.</p>

            <h2>Large-$N$ SU(4) Schwinger boson theory for coupled-dimer antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shang-Shun Zhang, Yasuyuki Kato, E. A. Ghioldi, L. O. Manuel, A. E. Trumper, Cristian D. Batista</p>
            <p>We develop a systematic large-$N$ expansion based on the Schwinger boson representation of SU(4) coherent states of dimers for the paradigmatic spin-$1/2$ bilayer square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. This system exhibits a quantum phase transition between a quantum paramagnetic state and a Néel order state, driven by the coupling constant $g = J'/J$, which is defined as the ratio between the inter-dimer $J'$ and intra-dimer $J$ exchange interactions. We demonstrate that this approach accurately describes static and dynamic properties on both sides of the quantum phase transition. The critical coupling constant $g_c \approx 0.42$ and the dynamic spin structure factor reproduce quantum Monte Carlo results with high precision. Notably, the $1/N$ corrections reveal the longitudinal mode of the magnetically ordered phase along with the overdamping caused by its decay into the two-magnon continuum. The present large-$N$ $SU(N)$ Schwinger boson theory can be extended to more general cases of quantum paramagnets that undergo a quantum phase transition into magnetically ordered states.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of boundary criticality and exotic topological semimetals in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Wu, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>It was recently found that, going beyond the tendfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and violating the bulk-boundary correspondence of the usual topological phases, PT-invariant systems support a real Chern insulator with the so-called boundary criticality, which forbids the transition between different orders of topological phases accompanied by the closing and reopening of the bulk-band gap. Here, we fnd that the periodic driving can break the boundary criticality of a PT-invariant system. Setting free from the the boundary criticality, diverse first- and second-order topological phases absent in the static case are found in both the zero and Pi/T modes. The application of our result in the three-dimensional PT-invariant system permits us to discover exotic second-order Dirac and nodal-line semimetals with coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. Enriching the family of the topological phases in PT-invariant systems, our result provides us a useful way to explore novel topological phases.</p>

            <h2>The Basins of Attraction of Soft Sphere Packings Are Not Fractal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Praharsh Suryadevara, Mathias Casiulis, Stefano Martiniani</p>
            <p>The energy landscape plays a central role in understanding the dynamics of low-temperature and athermal systems, which are characterized by a plethora of minima and the intricate geometry of their basins of attraction. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must instead be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies of soft sphere packings destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales.</p>

            <p>The ability to control the morphology of the nanotube deposit formed during the evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate is of theoretical and practical interest. Such deposits are required for various applications including nanotechnology, medicine, biotechnology, and optronics. In the experiment of Zhao et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 440, 68 (2015)], an annular deposit was formed near the contact line. The deposition geometry is caused by the coffee ring effect. This deposit is unusual in its morphology. It changes gradually in space from a disordered structure in the inner part of the ring to an aligned structure of nanotubes close to the periphery. To understand the mechanisms that lead to this, we have developed a mathematical model that takes into account the effects of advection, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions on particle transport. Results of numerical calculations have confirmed that all these factors together have an influence on the formation of such a variable morphology. Qualitative agreement with the experiment is shown for some values of the model parameters.</p>

            <p>Interactions between active individuals in animal collectives lead to emergent responses that remain elusive in synthetic soft matter. Here, shape-morphing polymers are used to create bio-inspired transient solids that self-assemble with controlled mechanical properties and disassemble on demand. Dilute-suspensions of magnetic, heat-responsive liquid crystal elastomer ribbons mechanically interlock, inducing reversible aggregation. A mathematical model is developed that sheds light on the role of topological mechanisms in aggregation. Aggregation was favored for ribbons with moderate curvature at 25C above crosslinking temperature as compared to flat ribbons or higher curvature ribbons at higher temperatures. The ribbon suspensions reversibly transition between fluid- and solid-like states, exhibiting up to 6 orders-of-magnitude increase in the storage moduli of the entangled aggregates compared with the liquid dispersions. Controlled dissociation is induced by imparting kinetic energy to the individual ribbons at high magnetic field rotation speeds (> 200 RPM). Ribbon shape and the medium in which dissociation occurs were shown to govern disassembly. Imparting dynamic collective behaviors into synthetic systems may enable a range of potential applications from bio-inspired soft robotics to injectable biomaterials.</p>

            <p>Recent reports on the signatures of high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc close to 80 K have triggered great research interest and extensive follow-up studies. Although the zero resistance has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions, the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ under high pressure remains controversial. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in-situ quantum sensors, we observe compelling evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline bilayer nickelate samples: the magnetic field expulsion during both field cooling and field warming processes. In particular, we explore the multiparameter measurement capacity of the diamond quantum sensors to extract the weak demagnetization signal of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and contributes to the development of quantum sensing of weak signals under high-pressure conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vanja Marić, Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti</p>
            <p>We consider translationally invariant quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains with local interactions and a discrete symmetry that is spontaneously broken at zero temperature. We envision experimenters switching off the couplings between two parts of the system and preparing them in independent equilibrium states. One side of the chain is prepared in a disordered phase, and the other in a symmetry-breaking ground state. When the couplings are switched back on, time evolution ensues. We argue that in integrable systems the front separating the ordered region recedes at the maximal velocity of quasiparticle excitations over the ground state. We infer that, generically, the order parameters should vary on a subdiffusive scale of order $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is time, and their fluctuations should exhibit the same scaling. This interfacial region exhibits full range correlations, indicating that it cannot be decomposed into nearly uncorrelated subsystems. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a case study, we demonstrate that all order parameters follow the same universal scaling functions. Through an analysis of the skew information, we uncover that the breakdown of cluster decomposition has a quantum contribution: each subsystem within the interfacial region, with extent comparable to the region, exists in a macroscopic quantum state.</p>

            <p>What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.</p>

            <h2>Crystal Structure and Collective Oxygen Transport in the High-Temperature Phase of Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sung-Hoon Lee, Ki-Ha Hong</p>
            <p>In crystalline materials, atomic motion is typically confined to vibrations within a fixed lattice, with substantial movement generally associated with defect migration. Here, we report an extraordinary collective ionic transport pathway in the high-temperature tetragonal phase of tantalum pentoxide (H-Ta$_2$O$_5$), whose crystal structure has remained unresolved until now. Our density functional theory calculations unequivocally determine the tetragonal structure to possess a four-fold screw-symmetric configuration derived from the known orthorhombic phase. The proposed structure aligns excellently with experimental lattice constants and transmission electron microscopy observations, resolving longstanding ambiguities regarding the atomic arrangement of H-Ta$_2$O$_5$. Remarkably, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal an unexpected ionic transport mechanism: coordinated, floating-like motion of specific oxygen atoms occurring at temperatures as low as 500 K. This collective oxygen motion beyond simple vibrations occurs within the stoichiometric lattice. The calculated energy barrier is exceptionally low (~0.2 eV), an order of magnitude below typical crystalline diffusion barriers. This drastic barrier reduction arises from flexible lattice coordination around screw-rotation planes, providing extensive positional flexibility and effectively dissipating local charge imbalances near oxygen pathways. Our findings elucidate the intriguing phenomena of intrinsic and anisotropic oxygen conductivity in H-Ta$_2$O$_5$ and offer valuable insights for designing novel crystalline materials with enhanced ionic mobility.</p>

Conventionally described by a single-component wavefunction, the Laughlin state features fractionally charged quasiparticles arising from correlations within one electron species. Here, we explore a novel physical situation by introducing inter-species Coulomb coupling between two intra-species Laughlin states in a quantum Hall graphene bilayer structure. Although quasiparticle excitations typically exhibit charge gaps of tens of Kelvin, we observe that this energy scale is significantly lowered through interlayer excitonic pairing between quasiparticles and quasiholes. Identified via transport measurements, these excitons belong to an unprecedented category of charge-neutral anyons, opening a new avenue for investigating exotic quantum statistics and phases of matter.</p>

            <p>Understanding and computing the entropic forces exerted by polymer chains under confinement is important for many reasons, from research to applications. However, extracting properties related to the free energy, such as the force (or pressure) on confining walls, does not readily emerge from conventional polymer dynamics simulations due to the entropic contributions inherent in these free energies. Here we propose an alternative method to compute such forces, and the associated free energies, based on empirically measuring the average force required to confine a polymer chain between parallel walls connected by an artificial elastic spring. This measurement enables us to interpolate the expression for the free energy of a confined self-avoiding chain and offer an analytical expression to complement the classical theory of ideal chains in confined spaces. Therefore, the significance of our method extends beyond the findings of this paper: it can be effectively employed to investigate the confinement free energy across diverse scenarios where all kinds of polymer chains are confined in a gap between parallel walls.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors CrSBr offer an ideal platform to achieve exciton-polaritons correlated with magnetic orders for developing solid-state quantum, spintronic, and photonic devices. However, for the exciton-polaritons formed by lower-energy excitons (XL = 1.37 eV), the coupling strength and nonlinear optical response are almost inert to the external magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate robust strong coupling between higher-energy excitons (XH = 1.8 eV) and photons that persists up to room temperature, along with giant magnetic-field tunability. The Rabi splitting energy is tuned up to 100 meV within a moderate 0.45 T in-plane magnetic field due to changes in excitonic states during the spin transitions. Besides, we observe significantly enhanced polariton nonlinearity in the intermediate magnetic phase, which exhibits a distinct mode-number dependence and originates from magnon-assisted long-range attractive interactions and coupling strength reduction. These results advance the development of on-demand polariton platforms for spin-correlated quantum optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>Titanium (Ti) is an adhesion and contact metal commonly used in nanoelectronics and two-dimensional (2D) materials research. However, when Ti is deposited on graphene (Gr), we obtain dramatically different film morphology depending on the experimental conditions. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio density functional theory calculations, we show that the most critical parameters are the number of Gr layers, the nature of the Gr support, and the deposition temperature. Particularly distinctive is the island morphology and large defect density of Ti on monolayer Gr, compared to bilayer or thicker Gr. We propose that this results from structural and mechanical differences between monolayer and thicker Gr flakes, where monolayer Gr is more flexible, exhibits larger surface roughness and therefore lower Ti diffusivity, and is more easily damaged. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of Ti morphology on Gr to processing and substrate conditions, allowing us to propose design rules for controlling Ti-Gr interface properties and morphology and to discuss the implications for other technologically relevant metal deposition processes.</p>

            <p>While there are many different mechanisms which have been proposed to understand the physics behind light induced ``superconductivity", what seems to be common to the class of materials in which this is observed are strong pairing correlations, which are present in the normal state. Here we argue, that the original ideas of Eliashberg are applicable to such a pseudogap phase and that with exposure to radiation the fermions are redistributed to higher energies where they are less deleterious to pairing. What results then is a photo-induced state with dramatically enhanced number of nearly condensed fermion pairs. In this phase, because the a.c. conductivity, $\sigma(\omega) = \sigma_1(\omega) + i \sigma_2(\omega)$, is dominated by the bosonic contribution, it can be computed using conventional (Aslamazov Larkin) fluctuation theory. We, thereby, observe the expected fingerprint of this photoinduced ``superconducting" state which is a $1/\omega$ dependence in $\sigma_2$ with fits to the data of the same quality as found for the so-called photo-enhanced (Drude) conductivity scenario. Here, however, we have a microscopic understanding of the characteristic low energy scale which appears in transport and which is necessarily temperature dependent. This approach also provides insight into recent observations of concomitant diamagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations suggest that the observed light-induced phase in these strongly paired superconductors has only short range phase coherence without long range superconducting order.</p>

We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.</p>

We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced ``shadows'' of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a roton-like excitation.

Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</p>

We apply the theory to two different microscopic models where policies correspond either to fixed parameters similar to evolutionary dynamics, or to state-dependent controllers known from the field of robotics. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and agent-based simulations.

            <h2>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier--phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier--phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring appropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</p>

            <h2>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</p>

            <h2>Classical Fractons: Local chaos, global broken ergodicity and an arrow of time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aryaman Babbar, Ylias Sadki, Abhishodh Prakash, S. L. Sondhi</p>
            <p>We report new results on classical nonrelativistic dipole conserving particles - fractons. These have been previously shown to exhibit "Machian" dynamics where the motion of one particle requires the presence of others in its proximity, such that dynamics produces ergodicity breaking steady states characterized by clusters. In this work, we show that although the global state breaks ergodicity, a limited version of ergodic behavior is retained within the clusters which may or may not be chaotic, depending on the nature of the microscopic Hamiltonian. In certain cases, we show that the dynamics can be mapped to that of a billiards particle in various stadiums. We also show that the many-fracton trajectories characteristically exhibit a central time or "Janus point" and thus a generic nonequilibrium bidirectional arrow of time.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-aperiodic grain boundary phases of Σ5 tilt grain boundaries in refractory metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enze Chen, Timofey Frolov</p>
            <p>We report new ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma$5[001] tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma$5 tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon, as validated through density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the atoms in the split kite phase demonstrate distinct collective diffusion dynamics. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</p>

            <h2>A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julio Cesar Siqueira Rocha, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Bismarck Vaz da Costa</p>
            <p>In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher's zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions using a parametrization of the entropy function in the microcanonical ensemble. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the latent heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features-such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves-which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. This approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Unified description of viscous, viscoelastic, or elastic thin active films on substrates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henning Reinken, Andreas M. Menzel</p>
            <p>It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xixi Feng, Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Gao Xianlong, Shujie Cheng</p>
            <p>We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of bond dissipation and disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial system is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial system strengthens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huandong Chen, Jayakanth Ravichandran</p>
            <p>Volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal oscillations in phase-change materials, specifically those undergoing metal-to-insulator transitions, offer unique attributes such as fast and low-field volatile switching, tunability, and stochastic dynamics. These characteristics are particularly promising for emulating neuronal behaviors and solving complex computational problems. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of volatile resistive switching devices and neuronal oscillators based on three representative materials with coincident electronic and structural phase transitions, at different levels of technological readiness: the well-studied correlated oxide VO2, the charge-density-wave transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, and the emerging phase-change chalcogenide perovskite BaTiS3. We discuss progresses from the perspective of materials development and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariia Radova, Wojciech G. Stark, Connor S. Allen, Reinhard J. Maurer, Albert P. Bartók</p>
            <p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials are revolutionising atomistic materials simulations by providing accurate and scalable predictions within the scope covered by the training data. However, generation of an accurate and robust training data set remains a challenge, often requiring thousands of first-principles calculations to achieve high accuracy. Foundation models have started to emerge with the ambition to create universally applicable potentials across a wide range of materials. While foundation models can be robust and transferable, they do not yet achieve the accuracy required to predict reaction barriers, phase transitions, and material stability. This work demonstrates that foundation model potentials can reach chemical accuracy when fine-tuned using transfer learning with partially frozen weights and biases. For two challenging datasets on reactive chemistry at surfaces and stability and elastic properties of tertiary alloys, we show that frozen transfer learning with 10-20% of the data (hundreds of datapoints) achieves similar accuracies to models trained from scratch (on thousands of datapoints). Moreover, we show that an equally accurate, but significantly more efficient surrogate model can be built using the transfer learned potential as the ground truth. In combination, we present a simulation workflow for machine learning potentials that improves data efficiency and computational efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jannik Gondolf, Andreas Kreisel, Mercè Roig, Yue Yu, Daniel F. Agterberg, Brian M. Andersen</p>
            <p>Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear compensated Néel ordered magnets that break time-reversal symmetry and feature spin-split band structures. Based on versatile microscopic models able to capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom, we study characteristic local signatures of altermagnetism near disorder sites. We give a complete list of two-dimensional models that exhibit altermagnetism classified by their corresponding layer groups. Specifically, we calculate the local density of states in the vicinity of pointlike nonmagnetic impurities and expose its spatial dependence for two minimal models showcasing $d$-wave and $g$-wave altermagnetism. The momentum structure of the nodes ($d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc.) is directly imprinted on the total local density of states, thus measurable by scanning tunneling conductance experiments. This signature is present both in the spin-resolved as well as the spin-summed local density of states. We find a weaker response in the nonmagnetic state from the anisotropic crystal environment and uncover the importance of the sublattice degree of freedom to model altermagnets. We also study coexistence phases of altermagnetism and superconductivity and provide predictions for the local impurity response of in-gap bound states. The response of impurity bound states strongly enhances the distinct altermagnetic signature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew P. C. Underwood, P. B. Blakie</p>
            <p>This paper develops and implements the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for spin-1 Bose gases, addressing key considerations for numerical simulations. As an application of the theory we explore equilibrium phases in a two-dimensional spin-1 gas, where quasi-long-range order emerges via a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our analysis includes definition of superfluid densities for both mass and spin degrees of freedom, in a manner suitable for implementation within a stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We present a finite-temperature phase diagram for the ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas and identify three distinct superfluid phases: two exhibiting conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like behavior and a novel phase that simultaneously supports independent mass and spin superflows. As temperature increases, the stability region of this novel phase shrinks. We provide characterization of the phase transitions through consideration of the spin-component densities and the unbinding of multiple types of vortices. This work provides a foundation for further studies of nonequilibrium and finite-temperature phenomena in spinor Bose gases.</p>

            <p>Understanding the atomic structure of magnetite-carboxylic acid interfaces is crucial for tailoring nanocomposites involving this interface. We present a Monte Carlo (MC)-based method utilizing iron oxidation state exchange to model magnetite interfaces with tens of thousands of atoms, scales typically inaccessible by electronic structure calculations. Charge neutrality is ensured by the oxidation of Fe ions. The MC approach allows magnetite to adapt to its environment at interfaces without requiring interface-specific rescaling of force-field parameters. This enables a simple, versatile method. By comparing adsorption sites, layer distances, and bond lengths with results from electronic structure calculations and experiments, we validated the accuracy of our method. We found that the oxidation state distribution and, consequently, binding site preference depend on coverage and surface thickness, with a critical thickness signaling the transition from layered to bulk-like oxidation states. The method ensures seamless compatibility with popular biomolecular force fields providing transferability and simplifying the study of magnetite interfaces in general.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niels Henrik Aase, Erik Wegner Hodt, Karl Bergson Hallberg, Asle Sudbø, Jacob Linder</p>
            <p>The emergence of an orbital angular momentum (OAM) response to a charge current holds promise for technological applications, allowing electrical control of magnetization dynamics. Often, the OAM current is invoked in explaining experimental results for very large orbital transport effects, but this is conceptually challenging as the OAM current is not a conserved quantity. Instead of utilizing the orbital conductivity associated with the non-conserved OAM current, we here use non-equilibrium Green's functions to directly image the OAM density in real space under an applied electric current bias. We find strong spatial variations in OAM density, with the lattice acting as a source and sink of OAM. Moreover, we show that the OAM response depends sensitively on the angle between the charge current and the crystal axis. This enables the generation of a transverse OAM response in one current direction and solely a longitudinal response in another. We refer to this as an orbital splitter effect, analogous to the spin splitter effect in altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Correlations between dislocations in crystals reduce the elastic energy via screening of the strain by the surrounding dislocations. We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of $5\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.8\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and HR-EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is modeled by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The HR-EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. The kink in the plot of the autocorrelation function allows a robust and accurate determination of the screening distance without making any simulation or fit. Screening distances of 2 $\mu$m and 0.3 $\mu$m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the HR-EBSD measurements is observed and quantified.</p>

            <p>We have performed a comprehensive computational study of the vibrational properties and electron-phonon couplings in the three known polymorphs of pentacene. Vibrational patterns and electron-phonon interactions were calculated at several q-points of the Brillouin zone, allowing for a detailed mapping of the phonon landscape and the associated coupling mechanisms relevant to charge transport. Using a pool of post-processing tools, we analyze the different phonon dispersions. Thus, we shed light on how low-frequency phonons modulate the transport differently in the polymorphs via their distinct electron-phonon coupling (EPC) signatures in reciprocal space. In fact, we show that distinct phonons dominate in high-temperature and thin-film polymorphs with respect to the high mobility low-temperature polymorph, and that these lead to different decoherence/localization trends. We describe the microscopic origin of the mobility in bulk polymorph, demonstrating that polymorphism not only modulates the transfer integral but also the phonon pattern. For the first time we show that different EPC patterns lead to very different mobility values even in similar structures. Also, we explain how phonon confinement is responsible for the increased mobility observed in 2D phase. Finally, we address the problem of possible coexistence of multiple polymorphs within a single specimen, frequently encountered in organic crystals due to their subtle energy landscape and processing conditions. In this context, we consider the implications of polymorph intergrowth, structural defects and disorder.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p>

            <p>We investigate the wetting transitions displayed by the collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) confined within rigid, impenetrable, flat walls. In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall-particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. An enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for wetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes complete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW), partial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we compute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.</p>

            <p>Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals, with a PL quantum yield of $\sim$0.005\%. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. To understand the origin of the strong PL and short carrier lifetime, we perform multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, supported by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. We identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Our results indicate that phonon-assisted carrier decay and nontrivial electron-phonon interactions contribute to the short carrier lifetimes, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further studies on compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes. By establishing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose an electronic refrigerator based on a ballistic Andreev interferometer that allows to reach a maximum cooling power per channel up to five orders of magnitude larger than that of the conventional normal metal-insulator-superconductor cooler. This effect is achieved by exploiting the destructive interference that occurs when the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$. This results in a strongly suppressed charge current below the superconducting gap, while still allowing the extraction of excitations above the gap, leading to a cooler with enhanced performance. Interestingly, we find that such a large cooling power per channel enables the achievement of an electronic temperature close to the theoretical lower bound. Additionally, we derive an approximate expression for this bound in the regime of low bath temperatures. Finally, we propose potential implementations of the ballistic Andreev interferometer cooler using semiconductors, graphene, and topological insulators.</p>

            <p>This paper presents progress towards the large-scale manufacturability of piezo- and ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films with very high Sc content. Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N layers were deposited by reactive sputtering from a 300 mm diameter Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N target on standard 200 mm Si wafers with Pt bottom- and Mo top-electrodes. The deposited films were analyzed in depth with X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Reciprocal Space Mapping (RSM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) showing well oriented c-axis growth over the full wafer with slight variation in the film thickness and Sc content over the wafer radius. An overall low density of abnormally oriented grains (AOG) was found. Further wafer mapping for piezoelectric and dielectric properties showed a piezoelectric performance increase by 40 % in comparison to Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N while only moderately increasing the permittivity and loss factor. Switching measurements revealed ferroelectric behavior of the film on all measured positions with an average remanent polarization of 88.36 uC/cm$^2$ and an average coercive field of 244 V/um. This successful demonstration opens new opportunities for MEMS applications with demands for high forces like microspeakers or quasi static micromirrors.</p>

            <p>CeO$_x$-based nanoforms are widely used in catalysis, or biomedical applications due to their redox activity and oxygen storage capacity. The key parameters determining their surface chemistry are the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio and the ability to transition between Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states. We synthesized Au@CeO$_x$ core@shell nanoparticles with different thicknesses of CeO$_x$ shells and different Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratios through a photothermal reaction driven by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) at the Au nanoparticle surface induced by visible light. We introduce a way to further enhance the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio in the shell by exposing the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles to visible light using a green laser (532 nm, 50 mW). Our findings based on photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the Ce$^{4+}$-to-Ce$^{3+}$ transition results from LSPR-induced superheating of the Au@CeO$_x$ interface, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and reduction of Ce$^{4+}$ ions. This process is reversible upon air exposure suggesting that the ability to transition between the Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states is retained in the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles. Our study presents the CeO$_x$-based nanoforms with a tunable cerium valence state ratio, highlighting the potential of plasmonic control in optimizing their photocatalytic and enzyme-mimetic properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Yadav, Mahran Yousef, David Wolpert</p>
            <p>All digital devices have components that implement Boolean functions, mapping that component's input to its output. However, any fixed Boolean function can be implemented by an infinite number of circuits, all of which vary in their resource costs. This has given rise to the field of circuit complexity theory, which studies the minimal resource cost to implement a given Boolean function with any circuit. Traditionally, circuit complexity theory has focused on the resource costs of a circuit's size (its number of gates) and depth (the longest path length from the circuit's input to its output). In this paper, we extend circuit complexity theory by investigating the minimal thermodynamic cost of a circuit's operation. We do this by using the mismatch cost (MMC) of a given circuit that is run multiple times in a row to calculate a lower bound on the entropy production (EP) incurred in each such run. Specifically, we discuss conditions under which MMC of a circuit is proportional to the size of a circuit, and conditions for them to diverge. We also use our results to compare the thermodynamic costs of different circuit families implementing the same family of Boolean functions. In addition we analyze how heterogeneity in the underlying physical processes implementing the gates in a circuit influences the minimal thermodynamic cost of the overall circuit. These and other results of ours lay the foundation for extending circuit complexity theory to include mismatch cost as a resource cost.</p>

            <h2>Understanding and Design of Interstitial Oxygen Conductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Meng</p>
            <p>Highly efficient oxygen active materials that react with, absorb, and transport oxygen is essential for fuel cells, electrolyzers and related applications. While vacancy mediated oxygen ion conductors have long been the focus of research, they are limited by high migration barriers at intermediate temperatures, which hinder their practical applications. In contrast, interstitial oxygen conductors exhibit significantly lower migration barriers enabling faster ionic conductivity at lower temperatures. This review systematically examines both well established and recently identified families of interstitial oxygen ion conductors, focusing on how their unique structural motifs such as corner sharing polyhedral frameworks, isolated polyhedral, and cage like architectures, facilitate low migration barriers through interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion mechanisms. A central discussion of this review focuses on the evolution of design strategies, from targeted donor doping, element screening, and physical intuition descriptor material discovery, which leverage computational tools to explore vast chemical spaces in search of new interstitial conductors. The success of these strategies demonstrates that a significant, largely unexplored space remains for discovering high performing interstitial oxygen conductors. Crucial features enabling high performance interstitial oxygen diffusion include the availability of electrons for oxygen reduction and sufficient structural flexibility with accessible volume for interstitial accommodation. This review concludes with a forward looking perspective, proposing a knowledge driven methodology that integrates current understanding with data centric approaches to identify promising interstitial oxygen conductors outside traditional search paradigms.</p>

            <h2>Inertia-induced power-law scaling in martensites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oğuz Umut Salman, Alphonse Finel, Lev Truskinovsky</p>
            <p>Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales, however, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self-organization towards apparent criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of intermittent fluctuations can be at least partially interpreted as an effect of inertia. We build on the insight that inertial dynamics, evidenced by acoustic emission, can become an important factor if the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced \textit{heavy-tailed} avalanche size distributions using a prototypical example of a discrete chain with bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in fully realistic two- and three-dimensional continuum models of elastic phase transitions. In particular, we demonstrate that a three-dimensional model can produce not only qualitative but also quantitative agreement with experiment.</p>

            <h2>Lift force in chiral, compressible granular matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jarosław Pawłowski, Marcin Dudziak, Matteo Baggioli, Jie Zhang, Piotr Surówka</p>
            <p>Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. We propose a macroscopic model of granular matter based on active micropolar fluid dynamics, which incorporates internal rotations, couple stresses, and broken parity through odd viscosity. Our framework extends traditional micropolar theory to describe chiral granular flows driven far from equilibrium, where energy is continuously injected and dissipated. In particular, we focus on steady states and explicitly neglect energy conservation, reflecting the dissipative nature of granular systems maintained in non-equilibrium by external forcing. Within this setup, we study the lift force experienced by a test bead embedded in a compressible, parity-breaking granular flow. We analyze how odd viscosity and microrotation modify the transverse forces, using both analytical results in the linearized Stokes regime and nonlinear finite element simulations. Our results demonstrate that active micropolar fluids provide a physically consistent and symmetry-informed continuum description of chiral granular matter, capable of capturing lift forces that emerge uniquely from odd transport effects.</p>

            <h2>Spin and energy diffusion vs. subdiffusion in disordered spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Herbrych, P. Prelovšek</p>
            <p>While the high-temperature spin diffusion in spin chains with random local fields has been the subject of numerous studies concerning the phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the energy diffusion in the same models has been much less explored. We demonstrate that energy diffusion is faster at weak random fields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both diffusions determine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the system. Numerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large distribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field configurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field strength, the results for sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are incompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumed transition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we find indications of the scenario of subdiffusive transport, particularly in the dynamical diffusivity response.</p>

            <p>Transformations in bcc-$\beta$, hcp-$\alpha$, and the $\omega$ phases of Ti alloys are studied using Density Functional Theory for pure Ti and Ti alloyed with Al, Si, V, Cr, Fe, Cu, Nb, Mo, and Sn. The $\beta$-stabilization caused by alloying Si, Fe, Cr, and Mo was observed, but the most stable phase appears between the $\beta$ and the $\alpha$ phases, corresponding to the martensitic $\alpha''$ phase. Next, the $\{112\}\langle11\bar1\rangle$ bcc twins are separated by a positive barrier, which further increases by alloying w.r.t. pure Ti. The $\{332\}\langle11\bar3\rangle$ twinning yields negative barriers for all species but Mo and Fe. This is because the transition state is structurally similar to the $\alpha$ phase, which is preferred over the $\beta$ phase for the majority of alloying elements. Lastly, the impact of alloying on twin boundary energies is discussed. These results may serve as design guidelines for novel Ti-based alloys with specific application areas.</p>

            <p>The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature $T_C$, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to interband scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multiband superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by interband scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying crystallographic defects in the form of stacking fault tetrahedra with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune interband coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters from two well separated gaps to one merged gap around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multiband superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</p>

            <p>The growth of viscous two-dimensional lipid domains in contact with a viscoelastic actin network was recently shown to exhibit unusual lipid domain ripening due to the geometry and anisotropy of the actin network [Arnold & Takatori. Langmuir. 40, 26570-26578 (2024)]. In this work, we interpret previous experimental results on lipid membrane-actin composites with a theoretical model that combines the Cahn-Hilliard and Landau-de Gennes liquid crystal theory. In our model, we incorporate fiber-like characteristics of actin filaments and bundles through a nematic order parameter, and elastic anisotropy through cubic nematic gradients. Numerical simulations qualitatively agree with experimental observations, by reproducing the competition between the thermodynamic forces that coarsen lipid domains versus the elastic forces generated by the surrounding actin network that resist domain coarsening. We observe a decrease in the growth of domain sizes, finding $R(t) \sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha < 1/4$ for different actin network stiffnesses, in sharp contrast to the $\sim t^{1/3}$ scaling for diffusive growth of domains in the absence of the actin network. Our findings may serve as a foundation for future developments in modeling elastic ripening in complex systems.</p>

            <p>The spontaneous Hall effect (SHE), a finite voltage occurring transversal to the electrical current in zero-magnetic field, has been observed in both conventional and unconventional superconductors, appearing as a peak near the superconducting transition temperature. The origin of SHE is strongly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms such as spontaneous symmetry breaking and time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS), Abrikosov vortex motion, or extrinsic factors like material inhomogeneities, such as non-uniform critical temperature (Tc) distributions or structural asymmetries. This work is an experimental study of the SHE in various superconducting materials. We focused on conventional, low-Tc, sharp transition Nb and unconventional, intermediate-Tc, smeared transition Fe(Se,Te). Our findings show distinct SHE peaks around the superconducting transition, with variations in height, sign and shape, indicating a possible common mechanism independent of the specific material. We propose that spatial inhomogeneities in the critical temperature, caused by local chemical composition variations, disorder, or other forms of electronic spatial inhomogeneities could explain the appearing of the SHE. This hypothesis is supported by comprehensive finite elements simulations of randomly distributed Tc by varying Tc-distribution, spatial scale of disorder and amplitude of the superconducting transition. The comparison between experimental results and simulations suggest a unified origin for the SHE in different superconductors, whereas different phenomenology can be explained in terms of amplitude of the transition temperature in respect to Tc-distribution.</p>

            <p>High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.</p>

            <p>We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.</p>

            <p>With the development of fast neutron reactors and nuclear fusion reactors, it is necessary to find new radiation-hardened high-flux core neutron detectors. The use of perovskite Caesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) for neutron radiation detection is a new research direction. However, at high temperatures, the effects of neutron radiation, especially the Primary Knock-out Atom (PKA) and Displacement Per Atom (DPA), and the defect distribution at the molecular level have not been reported. This study investigated the effect on CsPbBr$_3$ produced by 14 MeV neutron irradiation under 100 K to 400 K. Molecular dynamics methods are used to model the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms at the molecular level of materials. This study obtained the displacement threshold energies of three atoms in CsPbBr$_3$ and obtained the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms within the material over time. Monte Carlo simulations were used to obtain PKA and DPA information in CsPbBr$_3$ under neutron irradiation. This research will help to further study the performance changes of halide perovskites under neutron irradiation to verify the possibility of using them as radiation-hardened neutron detectors.</p>

            <p>We discuss a class of lattice $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum Hamiltonians with bond-dependent Ising couplings and a mutually «anticommuting» algebra of extensively many local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ conserved charges that was explicated in [arXiv:2407.06236]. This mutual algebra is reminiscent of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Pauli matrix algebra but encoded in the structure of \emph{local conserved charges}. These models have finite residual entropy density in the ground state with a simple but non-trivial degeneracy counting and concomitant quantum spin liquidity as proved in [arXiv:2407.06236]. The spin liquidity relies on a geometrically site-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that is rather natural in presence of an «anticommuting» structure, as opposed to for example the bond-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ hexagonal plaquette charges of the Kitaev honeycomb spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model which leads to a mutually commuting local algebra. In this work, we make several exact statements on the many-body order that can be present within the class of «anticommuting» quantum spin liquids. We elucidate the differences between the many-body order in these models and that found in some gapped quantum spin liquids with mutually commuting local algebras, e.g. the Kitaev toric code or Levin-Wen models. We also point out a mutually commuting algebra with local support that are naturally expressed as multi-linear Majorana forms in the Kitaev representation of these quantum spin liquids. They capture non-trivial quantum resonances throughout the lattice in these «anticommuting» $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pankaj Sharma, Narayan Mohanta</p>
            <p>Demonstration of non-Abelian statistics of Majorana bound states (MBS) is crucial for the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Two-dimensional platforms such as planar Josephson junctions require an in-plane magnetic field to generate a pair of MBS at its non-superconducting channel ends; however, the fixed direction of the in-plane magnetic field puts a constraint on the realization of a multi-terminal topological planar junction, and hence its ability to physically move multiple MBS -- which is necessary for performing the fusion and braiding operations. Here we show that in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which can generate multiple pairs of MBS in the absence of any external magnetic field, the non-trivial fusion and braiding operations can be performed. Our numerical calculations, designed for realistic two-dimensional quantum systems, certify the feasibility of experimental realization of the proposed device schemes. We find that both $s$-wave and $d$-wave superconducting leads can generate the MBS; indicating that the MBS movement operations can be performed at higher temperatures using $d$-wave superconducting leads. Our results establish that the skyrmion crystal-coupled planar Josephson junction is a viable platform for the generation and controlled movement of the MBS.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have shown that the nonlinear optical response of crystalline systems is fundamentally a quantum geometric property. In this work, we propose two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which measures the nonlinear conductivity as a function of two independent frequencies using two time-delayed light pulses, as a probe of quantum geometry. We show how the two-frequency second-order nonlinear conductivity, which is naturally measured by 2DCS, decomposes into distinct quantum geometric contributions. We identify a term arising from the multi-band quantum connection that does not appear in linear response, and show that it can be measured in isolation by considering specific polarizations and enforcing time-reversal symmetry. We explore this finding via model calculations for transition metal dichalcogenides and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Through these examples, we demonstrate how 2DCS enables study of the quantum connection, providing a way to compare the quantum geometry of different materials. We also show that one can gain rough momentum-resolved knowledge of the quantum geometry by varying the chemical potential.</p>

            <p>We investigate the ground-state properties of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, based on the off-diagonal wave function variational Monte Carlo method. We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.</p>

We perform our calculations for self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs QD systems as representative case studies. While both methods yield qualitatively consistent trends, quantitative discrepancies arise due to different treatment of atomistic details, strain effects, and confinement. We introduce targeted corrections to the eight-band $k \cdot p$ framework, including a modified deformation potential scheme and adjusted remote-band contributions, to improve agreement with atomistic results, especially for electron g-factors and single-particle energies. Furthermore, we validate the eight-band implementation of hyperfine interactions by benchmarking it against the tight-binding model, showing reasonable convergence for both electrons and holes.

            <p>Using the developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. Using the 1D Heisenberg chain as a benchmark system, we observe a negative spinon spin current exhibiting algebraic scaling $T^{\alpha}$, with exponent $\alpha$, in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence - distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase. It saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit, and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive probes for spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.</p>

The areal N atom density is one third of the areal C atom density in practical devices. It is found that the nitrided layer screens the unfavorable Coulomb interaction of O atoms in the SiO$_2$. However, the electrons flowing under the nitrided layer are significantly scattered by the fluctuation of potential due to the low areal N atom density.

            <p>The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable, physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter physics and AI.</p>

            <h2>Magnetocrystalline anisotropy of FeNi and FeCo along the Bain path</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nica Jane B. Ferrer, Gregory A. Fiete</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate magnetic anisotropy in materials with non-critical elements to determine which symmetry conditions and atomic shell filling favor enhanced magnetic anisotropy. We study the magnetocrystalline anisotropies (MCA) of the equiatomic ferrous compounds FeCo and FeNi using ab initio calculations and analytical approaches via the diatomic pair model. We find that when these materials undergo a Bain transformation, that is, the variation of the a and c lattice parameters adjust to interpolate between the B2 and L10 structural phases while keeping the unit cell volume constant, the MCA versus r = c/a ratio varies differently for FeCo and FeNi despite Co and Ni differing only by one valence electron. To uncover the physics governing these trends, we use a diatomic pair model to perform a theoretical analysis of the ab initio results. We find that the MCA variation along the Bain path is correlated with the structural phase of the material as well as the occupation of (l, m)-resolved states for each equiatomic ferrous compound. Accordingly, the MCA was found to differ depending on the element paired with Fe to form the Fe-X compound (X = Co, Ni). Our work could help guide the scientific community in solving the supply crisis of hard/strong permanent magnets that are crucial for various technological applications such as those depending on motors and generators for energy conversion and clean energy applications.</p>

            <h2>About the Strain-Coupled Molecular Dynamics in the Ferroelastic Phase Transition of TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Nonato, R. X. Silva, C.C. Santos, A. P. Ayala, C.W.A. Paschoal</p>
            <p>Tetramethylammonium (TMA) cadmium azide, is a new perovskite-like compound which undergoes a series of first-order phase transitions, including a ferroelastic transition above room temperature. Understanding the order-disorder structural phase transition (SPT) mechanism in hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) is crucial for designing new compounds with enhanced barocaloric efficiency, as well as unlocking other multifunctional properties. In this paper, we employed the energy fluctuation (EF) model to investigate the experimental linewidth of Raman modes in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ near the critical phase transition temperature ($T_C = {322}{K}$), aiming to gain insights into the molecular dynamics around the SPT. The temperature dependence of the strain, used as an order parameter, was obtained using the appropriate thermodynamic potential for the first-order phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, expressed through a Landau expansion, which can be successfully employed to model first-order ferroelastic phase transitions. We show that the EF model suitably captures the behavior of the Raman linewidths in the vicinity of the structural phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The activation energies obtained for TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ are comparable to those of DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, as well as to $k_B T_C$. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the relaxation reveals that the torsional and librational modes require longer to renormalize after the phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ when compared with DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The discussion based on these new parameters provides a new perspective for understanding molecular dynamics in systems undergoing order-disorder phase transitions, particularly in ferroelastic transitions, where order-disorder mechanisms are coupled to symmetry-breaking lattice distortions.</p>

            <h2>Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Liang</p>
            <p>Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Insu Baek, Seungyun Han, Hyun-Woo Lee</p>
            <p>d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce Néel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank Barrows, Guanming Zhang, Satyam Anand, Zizi Chen, Jonathan Lin, Amman Desai, Stefano Martiniani, Francesco Caravelli</p>
            <p>We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Yafei Ren, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by fsLP are coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. This theory explains how fsLP, of central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a {\em nonequilibrium spintronic mechanism}. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by {\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG equation due to, explicitly included via TDNEGF, electronic bath. The TDNEGF part of the loop is also used to include excitons via mean-field treatment, utilizing off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, of Coulomb interaction binding conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes. Finally, our theory predicts how excited magnons will {\em pump} time-dependent charge currents into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor that will then emit electromagnetic radiation. The windowed FFT of these signals contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</p>

            <p>Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce the hyperfine structure of entanglement, which decomposes entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.</p>

            <p>Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECC). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Boris V. Fine</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</p>

            <p>Disorder-induced phenomena in quantum many-body systems pose significant challenges for analytical methods and numerical simulations at relevant time and system scales. To reduce the cost of disorder-sampling, we investigate quantum circuits initialized in states tunable to superpositions over all disorder configurations. In a translationally-invariant lattice gauge theory (LGT), these states can be interpreted as a superposition over gauge sectors. We observe localization in this LGT in the absence of disorder in one and two dimensions: perturbations fail to diffuse despite fully disorder-free evolution and initial states. However, Rényi entropy measurements reveal that superposition-prepared states fundamentally differ from those obtained by direct disorder sampling. Leveraging superposition, we propose an algorithm with a polynomial speedup in sampling disorder configurations, a longstanding challenge in many-body localization studies.</p>

            <p>Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.</p>

            <p>One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</p>

We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</p>

Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erica Bertolini, Giandomenico Palumbo</p>
            <p>Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.</p>

            <h2>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Medina-Guerra, I. V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Jun He, Jue Hou, Yi-Chao Liu, Zi-Xi Tan</p>
            <p>In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale</p>
            <p>We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</p>

            <p>$\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Liang, Jens Niklas Eberhardt, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $k=6\sim13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.</p>

            <p>Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</p>

            <p>Many quantum technologies require a precise electrical current standard that can only be achieved with expensive cryogenics, or through the secondary standards, such as resistance or voltage. Silicon-based charge pumps could provide such a standard in an inherently scalable way, through their compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication methods. However, coherent quantized charge transfer has so far been demonstrated only in nanoscale devices that are custom-fabricated in academic cleanrooms or research technology foundries. Here, we show that a CMOS device manufactured with commercial 22-nm process node can be used to define a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure an accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A at 50 MHz with reference to SI voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. We then propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This chip could be operated as a table-top primary standard that can be easily integrated with CMOS electronics, generating quantum currents of up to microampere levels.</p>

            <h2>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez, Jiuci Xu</p>
            <p>We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca</p>
            <p>This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</p>

            <p>High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</p>

            <p>Thermal and photothermal effects play an increasing role at the nanoscale due to the general decrease of thermal conductances and to the increasing role of interfaces. Here we present a non-contact optomechanical analysis of the thermal and photothermal properties of suspended nanowires based on pump-probe response measurements: a probe laser measures the nanowire deformations and property changes caused by an intensity-modulated pump laser launching thermal waves propagating along the 1D conductor. The analysis of the dominant photothermal contributions to the nanowires response in the spectral and spatial domains allows in particular to quantify the interfacial contact resistance, to detect its internal optical resonances and to image absorption inhomogeneities. Additionally, by exploiting the temperature-induced optical reflectivity changes of the nanowire, we directly image the spatial structure of the thermal waves propagating within the nanowire. Finally we investigate how those thermal waves are responsible for a dynamical modulation of the nanowire vibration frequency, in the resolved sideband regime, providing novel analytical tools to further inspect the structural properties of nano-optomechanical systems with a large signal to noise ratio. Those methods are generic and critical to correctly understand the photothermal dynamical back action processes and improve the intrinsic sensitivity of those ultrasensitive force probes.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code -- the quintessential model of topological order -- hosts additional, emergent topological phases when perturbed: descendant fractional quantum Hall-like states, which we term \textit{Hall-on-Toric}.

The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions between deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to a much deeper level.</p>

We construct a 6-band, a 3-band, and - simplest of all - a single-band model for this material family, by directly Wannierizing the ab initio bands. All host obstructed atomic isolated bands away from the atomic positions near the Fermi energy. We find that in the 3-band model, the obstructed atomic Wannier function can be well approximated by an optimally compact Wannier function with more than 90% accuracy for all the compounds, rising to a remarkable 94% accuracy in NbSe$_2$. Interestingly, the simplest single-band model has next nearest-neighboring hopping larger than the nearest-neighboring hopping (by nearly an order of magnitude for MoS$_2$, NbSe$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), which comes from the cancellation between the atomic onsite terms and the atomic nearest-neighboring hopping after projecting to the obstructed atomic Wannier functions. Furthermore for NbSe$_2$, we employ a novel approximation scheme to obtain an effective Hamiltonian that captures the 3 bands originating mainly from the Nb atom. We also use conventional perturbation theory to derive the ab initio obstructed Wannier function with 95% accuracy.

            <p>We study Andreev conversion in clean nanostructures containing an interface between graphene in the quantum Hall (QH) state and a superconductor, focusing on the lowest Landau level. First, several graphene nanostructures formed from zigzag edges with sharp corners are considered using a tight-binding model. We find the scattering state for an electron impinging on the interface from the upstream QH edge state, together with the probability of it exiting as a hole in the downstream QH edge state (Andreev conversion). From these results, we deduce the behavior for edges at an arbitrary angle and for rounded corners. A key issue is whether the graphene-superconductor interface is fully transparent or only partially transparent. For full transparency, we recover previous results. In contrast, interfaces with partial but substantial transparency (well away from the tunneling limit) behave very differently: (i) the hybrid electron-hole interfacial modes are not valley degenerate and (ii) intervalley scattering can occur at the corners, even when rounded. As a result, interference between the two hybrid modes can occur, even in the absence of disorder. Finally, we compare the sensitivity of Andreev conversion to interface transparency in the QH regime to that in the absence of a magnetic field. While the zero-field result closely follows the classic Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk relation, Andreev conversion in the QH regime is considerably more robust.</p>

            <p>Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz-2DCS) is transforming our ability to probe, visualize, and control quantum materials far from equilibrium. This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.</p>

            <h2>Ginzburg-Landau theory for unconventional surface superconductivity in PtBi$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harald Waje, Fabian Jakubczyk, Jeroen van den Brink, Carsten Timm</p>
            <p>Recent experimental evidence suggests the presence of an unconventional, nodal surface-superconducting state in trigonal PtBi\textsubscript{2}. We construct a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the three superconducting order parameters, which correspond to the three irreducible representations of the point group $C_{3v}$. The irreducible representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the most likely. We develop a systematic method to determine the symmetry-allowed terms and apply it to derive all terms up to fourth order in the three order parameters. The Ginzburg--Landau functional also includes coupling to the magnetic field. The functional is employed to determine the effect of an applied uniform magnetic field on the nodal structure for $A_1$ and $A_2$ pairing. The results facilitate clear-cut experimental differentiation between these symmetries. We also predict field-induced pair-density waves.</p>

            <p>We report on the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in prototypical bilayers of ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and platinum in the frequency range from 0 THz to as high as 1.5 THz. The spectral composition of the effect exhibits a strong low-pass behavior, decreasing by approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2 THz and vanishing entirely at 1.5 THz. Using a dynamic magnetoresistive model, we can fully explain the spectral dependence by competition of transverse spin-torque (coherent) and longitudinal (incoherent) contributions to the spin current and their characteristic response times. Our analysis suggests that the slow dissipation of incoherent magnons from the interface is the limiting process responsible for the dramatic spectral decay of the SMR. These results establish THz SMR as a powerful probe of ultrafast interfacial spin-magnon coupling.</p>

            <h2>Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens H. Nyhegn, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Leon Balents, Georg M. Bruun</p>
            <p>The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.</p>

            <p>d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce Néel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</p>

            <h2>Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological insulator nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel F. Martínez, Adolfo G. Grushin, Jens H. Bardarson</p>
            <p>Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.</p>

            <p>Motivated by theoretical and experimental studies reported by Yamaguchi et al. (Phys. Rev. B 98, 094402 (2018)), we performed a cluster mean-field analysis of an anisotropic Heisenberg model with six competing exchange interactions. We study the ground and thermal states by tuning the spin anisotropy, magnetic field, and temperature. Our results show that an external magnetic field induces quantum fluctuations, suppressing local moments and leading to the occurrence of a magnetization plateaulike state. When weak spin anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc-Antoine Fardin, Mathieu Hautefeuille, Vivek Sharma</p>
            <p>Scaling laws arise and are eulogized across disciplines from natural to social sciences for providing pithy, quantitative, `scale-free', and `universal' power law relationships between two variables. On a log-log plot, the power laws display as straight lines, with a slope set by the exponent of the scaling law. In practice, a scaling relationship works only for a limited range, bookended by crossovers to other scaling laws. Leading with Taylor's oft-cited scaling law for the blast radius of an explosion against time, and by collating an unprecedented amount of datasets for laser-induced, chemical and nuclear explosions, we show distinct kinematics arise at the early and late stages. We illustrate that picking objective scales for the two axes using the transitions between regimes leads to the collapse of the data for the two regimes and their crossover, but the third regime is typically not mapped to the master curve. The objective scales permit us to abandon the arbitrarily chosen anthropocentric units of measurement, like feet for length and heart-beat for time, but the decimal system with ten digits (fingers) is still part of the picture. We show a remarkable collapse of all three regimes onto a common master curve occurs if we replace the base 10 by a dimensionless radix that combines the scales from the two crossovers. We also illustrate this approach of radical scaling for capillarity-driven pinching, coalescence and spreading of drops and bubbles, expecting such generalizations will be made for datasets across many disciplines.</p>

            <h2>Optimal boron-doped graphene substrate for glucose Raman signal enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Komeda, Antonio Cammarata, Tomas Polcar</p>
            <p>Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive and selective technique that greatly enhances the signal of an analyte, compared with its signal from classical Raman Spectroscopy, due to its interaction with a substrates surface. It has been shown that low concentration boron-doped graphene (B-graphene) enhances the Raman signal of simple organic molecules like pyridine. Recent studies also suggest that B-graphene can remain thermodynamically stable when doped with significantly higher concentrations of boron than previously observed. In this framework, we use quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the influence of dopant concentration and geometric distribution on the effectiveness of B-doped graphene as a SERS substrate, with glucose as analyte. By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of phonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations provide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule orientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman response. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a potential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used phonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising candidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.</p>

Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.

            <h2>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Yafei Ren, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons within two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by classical vector potential of fsLP are coupled to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory explains how fsLP, with central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuine nonequilibrium spintronic effect. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) reveals frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by nonlocal damping due to the bath of electrons. In addition, the TDNEGF part of our TDNEGF+LLG self-consistent loop computes a time-dependent density matrix whose off-diagonal elements are utilized to describe, at the mean-field level, inter-orbital Coulomb interaction binding electrons and holes into excitons. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory predicts how excited magnons {\em pump} charge current into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor responsible for microwave emission. The windowed FFT of the former signal contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</p>

            <p>We investigate the energy bands, magnetism, and superconductivity of bilayer octagraphene with A-A stacking under a perpendicular electric field. A tight-binding model is used to analyze the band structure of the system. The doubling of the unit cell results in each band of the single layer splitting into two. We find that applying a perpendicular electric field increases the band splitting. As the electric field strength increases, the nesting of the Fermi Surface(FS) weakens, eventually disrupting the antiferromagnetic order and bilayer octagraphene exhibits superconductivity. Spin fluctuations can induce unconventional superconductivity with s+--wave pairing. Applying a perpendicular electric field to bilayer octagraphene parent weakens the nesting of the FS, ultimately killing the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordered state and transitioning it into the superconducting state, whichworks as a doping effect. We use the random-phase approximation approach to obtain the pairing eigenvalues and pairing symmetries of the perpendicular electric field-tuned bilayer octagraphene in the weak coupling limit. By tuning the strength of the perpendicular electric field, the critical interaction strength for SDW order can be modified, which in turn may promote the emergence of unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henning Schlömer, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and orthogonal metal (OM) phases. The topological nature of FL* and OM phases has been identified as scenarios compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative scenario: an orthogonal metal with a geometric origin (GOM) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GOM framework establishes a deep connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic ``negative conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.</p>

            <p>Using high-energy-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering, we observe anomalous softening and damping of the transverse acoustic phonon in UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as the system is cooled towards the charge density wave (CDW) transition temperature, T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The phonon exhibits a marked Kohn-type anomaly around the CDW wave vector, Q$_{\rm{CDW}}$, and becomes overdamped within a finite momentum range already well above T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The dispersion anomaly is consistent with potential Fermi surface nesting, which together with the extended phonon collapse indicate strong electron-phonon coupling. The transition temperature estimated from the phonon softening is markedly lower than T$_{\rm{CDW}}$, consistent with a primarily electronic instability rather than a phonon-driven transition. Our results establish UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as a prime example of a strongly correlated electron CDW system with exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling driving phonon softening and collapse.</p>

            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <p>The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.</p>

            <p>The tunable band structure and nontrivial topology of multilayer rhombohedral graphene lead to a variety of correlated electronic states with isospin orders-meaning ordered states in the combined spin and valley degrees of freedom-dictated by the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and Hunds exchange interactions. However, methods for mapping local isospin textures and determining the exchange energies are currently lacking. Here, we image the magnetization textures in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene using a nanoscale superconducting quantum interference device. We observe sharp magnetic phase transitions that indicate spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. In the quarter-metal phase, the spin and orbital moments align closely, providing a bound on the spin-orbit coupling energy. We also show that the half-metal phase has a very small magnetic anisotropy, which provides an experimental lower bound on the intervalley Hunds exchange interaction energy. This is found to be close to its theoretical upper bound. The ability to resolve the local isospin texture and the different interaction energies will allow a better understanding of the phase transition hierarchy and the numerous correlated electronic states arising from spontaneous and induced isospin symmetry breaking in graphene heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Orbital orders under magnetic fields in cubic PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hitoko Okanoya, Kazumasa Hattori</p>
            <p>We study orbital orders in quadrupolar heavy-fermion compound PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$ under magnetic fields on the basis of the Landau theory. Assuming E$_g$ orbital (electric quadrupolar) orders in the cubic symmetry with the ordering wavenumber at the L points in the face-centered cubic lattice Brillouin zone as observed experimentally, we construct the Landau free energy and analyze it. We find that the unidentified high-temperature ordered phase under the magnetic field H ||[001] reported earlier can be interpreted as the consequence of the internal rotation in the orbital moments of f electrons at the Pr site. We discuss the phase diagram for various magnetic-field directions and also possible double-q quadrupolar orders in this system.</p>

            <h2>Are shocks in conserved driven single-file motions with bottlenecks universal?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Pal, Abhik Basu</p>
            <p>Driven single-file motion sets the paradigm for wide variety of one-dimensional directed movements, ranging from intracellular transport and urban traffic to ant trails and controlled robot swarms. Motivated by the phenomenologies of these systems in closed geometries, regulated by number conservation and bottlenecks, we explore the domain walls (DWs) or shocks in a conceptual one-dimensional cellular automaton with a fixed particle number and a bottleneck. For high entry and exit rates of the cellular automaton, and with {sufficiently large} particle numbers, the DWs formed are independent of the associated rate parameters, revealing a {\em hitherto unknown universality} in their {\em shapes}. In contrast, the DWs do depend upon these parameters, if they are small, and hence have nonuniversal shapes. Our predictions on the DWs are testable in experiments.</p>

            <h2>Compressing local vertex functions from the multipoint numerical renormalization group using quantics tensor cross interpolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Frankenbach, Marc Ritter, Mathias Pelz, Nepomuk Ritz, Jan von Delft, Anxiang Ge</p>
            <p>The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic Origin of Friction Between Suspended Rough Particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jake Minten, Bhargav Rallabandi</p>
            <p>Tangential interactions between particles play a central role in suspension rheology. We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.</p>

            <p>We present an analysis of the Korringa ratio in a dirty metal, emphasizing the case where a Stoner enhancement of the uniform susceptibilty is present. We find that the relaxation rates are significantly enhanced by disorder, and that the inverse problem of determining the bare density of states from a study of the change of the Knight shift and relaxation rates with some parameter, such as pressure, has rather constrained solutions, with the disorder playing an important role. Some preliminary applications to the case of chemical substitution in the Rb$_{3-x}$K$_x $C$_{60}$ family of superconductors is presented and some other relevant systems are mentioned.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Doojin Kim, Jong-Chul Park, Gil-Ho Lee, Kin Chung Fong</p>
            <p>We propose a new dark-matter detection strategy that will potentially enable the search for super-light dark matter $m_\chi \simeq 0.1$ keV, improving the minimum detectable mass by more than three orders of magnitude compared to ongoing experiments. This can be achieved by intimately integrating the target material, specifically the $\pi$-bond electrons in graphene, into a Josephson junction to create a highly sensitive detector capable of detecting energy deposits from dark matter as small as $\sim 0.1$ meV. We investigate detection prospects of pg-, ng-, and $\mu$g-scale detectors by calculating the scattering rate between dark matter and free electrons confined in two-dimensional graphene, including Pauli-blocking factors and in-medium screening effects. We find that the proposed detector is expected to not only serve as a complementary probe of super-light dark matter but also achieve higher experimental sensitivities than other proposed experiments, assuming zero readout noise, thanks to the extremely low threshold energy of our graphene Josephson junction sensor.</p>

            <h2>Classification of modular data up to rank 12</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siu-Hung Ng, Eric C. Rowell, Xiao-Gang Wen</p>
            <p>We use the computer algebra system GAP to classify modular data up to rank 12. This extends the previously obtained classification of modular data up to rank 6. Our classification includes all the modular data from modular tensor categories up to rank 12, with a few possible exceptions at rank 12 and levels $5,7$ and $14$. Those exceptions are eliminated up to a certain bound by an extensive finite search in place of required infinite search. Our list contains a few potential unitary modular data which are not known to correspond to any unitary modular tensor categories (such as those from Kac-Moody algebra, twisted quantum doubles of finite group, as well as their Abelian anyon condensations). It remains to be shown if those potential modular data can be realized by modular tensor categories or not. We provide some evidence that all may be constructed from centers of near-group categories or gauging group symmetries of known modular tensor categories, with the exception of a total of five cases at rank 11 (with $D^2 =1964.590$) and 12 (with $D^2 =3926.660$). The classification of modular data corresponds to a classification of modular tensor categories (up to modular isotopes which are not expected to be present at low ranks). The classification of modular tensor categories leads to a classification of gapped quantum phases of matter in 2-dimensional space for bosonic lattice systems with no symmetry, as well as a classification of generalized symmetries in 1-dimensional space.</p>

            <p>Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Delocalization Induced by Residue Imaginary Velocity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Xin Hu, Yong-Xu Fu, Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>The dichotomy of localization versus delocalization is a historic topic central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. In sharp contrast to conventional formalisms through extended wavefunctions, these target systems exhibit delocalization in collective physical properties such as correlation and entanglement (of the Fermi Seas) despite sometimes localized left and right single-particle eigenstates, as we demonstrate numerically and generalize to scenarios with finite temperatures and interaction. Interestingly, disorder contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may also allow strong-disorder delocalization. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and harbors interesting experiments and practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Optical effects in unmagnetized cold plasmas by a chiral axion factor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filipe S. Ribeiro, Pedro D. S. Silva, Manoel M. Ferreira Jr</p>
            <p>Unmagnetized cold plasma modes are investigated in the context of the chiral Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCJF) electrodynamics, where the axion chiral factor acts retrieving some typical properties of magnetized plasmas. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive indices, and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices modified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic conductivity chiral parameter role associated with right-circularly polarized (RCP) and left-circularly polarized (LCP) waves. For each refractive index, the propagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some specific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the low-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the chiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power (RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The negative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP sign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas. Charge density oscillations and Langmuir waves are also discussed, revealing no modified dispersion relation due to the chiral axion factor.</p>

            <h2>Generalization vs. Specialization under Concept Shift</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Nguyen, David J. Schwab, Vudtiwat Ngampruetikorn</p>
            <p>Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e., when data distributions at test time differ from those during training. Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction risk in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of concept shift on generalization performance, including a phase transition between weak and strong concept shift regimes and nonmonotonic data dependence of test performance even when double descent is absent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with experiments based on transformers pretrained to solve linear regression; under concept shift, too long context length can be detrimental to generalization performance of next token prediction. Finally, our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior is present also in classification problems.</p>
